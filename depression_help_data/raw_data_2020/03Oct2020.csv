Ok so this is a vent post and I’m just at the end of it. I can’t handle this shit anymore. Everything is building on top of each other. I seem to have a bad depressive episode every 4 years or so. I have been in a depression for about a month or so I guess. Been really bad since my dog died. Part of it is my dog and part of it is the fact that I feel like my autism has gotten worse since my dog died. Like I feel like I have regressed in habits. I have started having panic attacks again(had one at work yesturday which was embarrassing as hell! If was my first one in a while and it made me angry)I get upset with myself for having them, even though this one was ptsd related. I often wonder if ptsd can have flare ups if I’m being honest. I get upset because my coworkers who I am friends with are so willing to help me. I know it doesn’t make since but I feel so guilty when I get help. I broke down crying after work the other day and told one of my coworkers what I have been dealing with. He said he would be there for me. Had a few other friends tell me the same. I struggle to believe that it’s true. I struggle to trust him and that makes me feel EVEN WORSE! I felt like such a useless piece of shit when he took over when I had a panic attack so I could calm down. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die when I told him that, he was even understanding then. He said that since I had been through a lot that week with what had happened earlier on in the week the panic attack was understandable. I don’t understand why I can’t process how understanding and helpful he is being. Like the fact that I’m not getting any shit for what I’m going through. The fact that he is willing to listen to me when I feel suicidal or feel like self-harming. I just don’t get it. Why is he being so kind? I just end up feeling so fucking guilty for thinking this way. I have been having issues with self harm too. I was clean for about 4 years, but then when my dog died it went downhill. People say it gets better but I feel like that’s such a lie. It always seems to be so temporary. I have wanted to die almost everyday for like a month. I’m so fucking tired of it. I can’t deal with this anymore. I want to reach out when I’m upset, but I’m so fucking scared that the people that are there for me will turn away and say they hate me and that I am an annoying burden like I already think I am myself. I am most likely to be suicidal and want to self harm late at night and I don’t think my friends would want to deal with that. Does anyone else struggle with this? I am just so scared they will just be done with me after dealing with it for so long because of how my my depressive episodes have lasted in the past. They say they love being around me and that I make the workplace fun when I’m there and that I am really funny, and all these other nice things but like I just don’t see it. I don’t know know what to do since part of my depression is my dog passing and the fact that I am having issues socially like always. I normally try to hide it and be happy when I am around my friends but they found out anyway I guess.",03Oct2020,1
1,"I’ll do my best to explain what I mean but it needs some context. I’ve been depressed most my life (currently 23) and every antidepressant I’ve ever tried will work for a short time and then it won’t again. As in I get a bit better or even fully better for a few months at most and then I get super depressed again. So how do I know if the antidepressant is working or if those good patches are just coincidence or my actual life improving? But I also feel like I’m running out of antidepressants to try (and that I’d be willing to try)

I would love advice, opinions etc etc",03Oct2020,1
2,"I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder for a decade now.

Like I say in the title, I feel I have virtually no personality. My life has revolved around my sickness for so long that only conversation I can have with anyone is about my depression. 

While others discover and explore who they are, I feel empty and hopeless.

On top of this, I’m 30 and work a full time job. I have chores to take care of on the weekends. There’s no leisure time to spend with myself. I feel trapped.

Your 20s is when you have the freedom and youth to explore and develop yourself. That freedom is gone from me. I’m tied to a job and adult responsibilities that keep my bills paid but also keep me stagnant. 

I feel like it’s too late to become anyone different. 

Please help me think differently. I don’t have anyone else to talk to. To those of you who were in my place and have fuller lives now, how did you manage it with a full time job?",03Oct2020,1
3,"**Hey guys! I'm 27 years old from Louisiana. I have 4 beautiful children. (2 month old baby boy, twin boys that are 2 years old, &amp; a 4 year old boy) YES I have all boys lol! I am seeing a oncologist because of a mass in my left breast the size of a apple. I was breastfeeding my twins when I suddenly stopped producing milk completely. The mass started out small about 3 years ago and grew dramatically. I'm hoping for positive results but I also have a horrible cancer family history. In the midst of all that going on after my twins were born I got pregnant with my baby boy after doctor saying I couldn't conceive anymore after a horrible miscarriage and surgery damage. Meanwhile as I am going through these health issues (miscarriage then surgery then mass and giving birth) my husband and children's father was out having a good time cheating on me with a 14 year old. Seriously not even joking. I caught them in MY bed and just started puking. And I guess somehow it was my fault and when I caught him he became angry and pushed me to the ground and kicked me numerous times breaking my rib and collar bone and then he LEAVES WITH HIS 14 YEAR OLD leaving me in the floor passed out bleeding and his children unattended to get hurt or whatever.That's how my last two months since I had my youngest has been and I was a sahm during our marriage and obviously I JUST gave birth so I couldn't work. He left exactly 6 weeks ago because our baby was 2 weeks old.**

 I got through the first month alone with using all my savings account, pawning literally everything of worth, and and yard sale. Now two weeks into second month I'm struggling to even buy chef boyardee for the kids. My husband stole my ebt card which is food stamp card and spent every dime on his GF and him or sold them idk. I went to police and filed report and DSS so now its being investigated. I called every day asking are they fine can I get a new card and benefits since he plead guilty to using them but apparently I cant until case COMPLETELY closes. My baby has plenty of formula due to wic but I have NOTHING at all currently to feed my twins and 4 year old. I gave them each a peanut butter half sandwich on one piece of bread for supper and that's last food I had. I haven't ate but that's okay I just want to feed my kids. I dont matter. One of my twins is on pediasure peptide 4 bottles a day in addition to good to gain weight after his heart surgery. I am out of that now and he desperately needs that. Also my twins have maybe one or two diapers each left and newborn has 2 left. No wipes. I asked their father for help and of course he wont answer and finally says ""No I'm done with everything "" I don't have much family here and ones I do have live in Croatia. My mother and father passed away when I was 7 and I was raised by my grandma here in the United states,who passed away last September. 

**Enough rambling I need some kind of hope. What can I do? Besides just go steal food I'm at a loss right now. I feel like I've asked and asked and nothing so far. I am so alone in this world and am sinking further and further under. I'll so anything for my kids to feed them and it hurts me badly to see them asking for food right now. A knife to the chest. I need resources...ideas...organizations...anything? Prayers and positive thoughts would be amazing too. A kind and encouraging word or anything. I'm NOT asking for any money or anyone's hand outs..I needed to vent badly because I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and I'm at a low. Sorry for rambling and the long post but thank you for listening!**",03Oct2020,1

I have so many plans and ideas in my life and I'm in a happy relationship, got good friend but I just feel like I cant get out this funk and I'm worried its gunna effect the people around me. I lost my cat in April (run away) I still cry about it the only thing that keeps coming to mind is coyotes 😓 ik I should be over it by now but I'm not, I cant get a job rn which I understand cause of COVID but the rejection letters dont help, my dad is getting back surgery soon and im so worried for how it will go and its ""the only option"", it's not even the surgery that can hurt him it's the meds they are going to put him under and my mom has been kinda sick too lately with laryngitis (ik not related but still) and im worried about her cause she took back her ex that tested positive and my siblings live with her still I've tried talking to her about it but our relationships already shaky and talking to her I gotta walk on eggshells if I wanna see my siblings without issue, I've been having this idea to start becoming an entrepreneur but it feels unattainable and too ambitious and I feel like if I go for it (not rn but when I start working) I'm gunna put all that time into it to screw us over, I try so hard to stay positive and even try to get productive but after a few hours or days it starts to just feel like I'm faking it, my partner works so I'm a lone at home all day everyday 5 days a week and at his point I just feel like its starting to take a toll. One month, two months fine but even before the pandemic I'd been depressed and even more so now that I'm alone alone and it kinda happened right away cause not too long after I lost my cat my partner had to go back to work (yes ik he has to work but not the part that makes me sad I'm proud of him, just miss him a lot) it's just I kinda went from having some presence in the house to nothing.

I've got a good job, lots of great opportunities, a stable and great income, job security, somewhere nice to live, I'm healthy, I believe that I have friends, and the whole time during this fucking Covid thing, I was at home still paid so much to do fuckall, yet I did nothing because of this depression. Deep down I'm just always so sad, angry and full of hatred, and I feel like if I keep going, it'll become darker and much worst. I use to be so positive, to cheer up everyone, to always find the positive in the worst situations. Now for whatever reason, it is all gone. When I'm at work, I don't think of this pain because I'm working but when I'm at home, that being 2/3 of my day, I'm just bored, sad and depressed. I can't keep on feeling so pathetic.

I was told that those who spend their entire life looking for happiness never find it because they look too far. Honnestly, even if it is right under my nose, I see it but it doesn't make me feel good. Even if I was to stop seeking it, it doesn't help me, I'm still depressed and sad.

13,"
I am looking for some genuine advice here. I’m not one for throwing pity parties, so I will just lay the facts out as plainly as possible 

I am a 25 year old male

I dealt with self loathing, depression and anxiety for the majority of my life.

I have never been the stereotypical “American alpha male”. While I like football, beer, and 90s hip hop......I’ve always enjoyed cooking, 80s techno &amp;amp;amp; design more. My strength has always been my mind, my emotion and my morals.

I have not passed a year of school since I was 10 years old. I was moved on to the next grade each year only because my family was one of the few paying full tuition. My failing was not due to inability, but due to lack of effort and interest.

I have always been a late bloomer and the last to be picked. Didn’t learn to ride a bike until I was 13, didn’t have my first kiss until I was 17, didn’t loose my virginity till 20, didn’t stop watching cartoons until long after everyone else had, and didn’t realize school was important until I was 24. Just a few examples haha

I was kicked out of high school and have been in a very bad mental place for the past 8 years

Since then the majority of my endeavors, whether it be a new job, new hobby, or romantic pursuit....has ended in failure. Most of the time leaving me in worse mental state than I was before

I am balding rapidly, and have lost 1/3 of my hair in the last 18 months

I am overweight (and always have been) at 6’3 and 300lbs. I have narrow shoulders and carry the majority of my weight in my stomach and thighs

It is hard to admit it, but I am not well endowed at all. Well below average. Not a medical condition or anything crazy but very noticeable nonetheless 

I have never been in a relationship. The very few sexual partners I’ve had all have been one night stands. And they are all either older women or girls my age from Tinder. All of these females have declined to hang out again, presumably from my lack of size and sexual experience.

I have no clear career path and am bouncing from minimum wage job to job. I have no savings and no investments.

I am currently in community college, but am only doing it to appease my parents and have no idea what major to choose or what career I would like to or even could succeed in.

I have grown up and live in a very wealthy part of the USA. The vast majority of my peers &amp;amp;amp; friends that I grew up with have now moved on in life. They now have homes, families, good paying jobs and/or large trust funds from their families (must be nice haha). To give an example I spent last weekend working as a valet at a black tie event, and over the course of the evening I parked and retrieved at least a dozen of my ex high school classmates 6 figure vehicles. (Not that there is anything wrong with being a valet)

I am unable to start anything, as I have no confidence in my ability to complete or succeed. My brain kicks in with it’s supposed logic....”you have never succeeded before, what would make you succeed now?”

In my twisted mind I think of it like this....would you place a bet that the sun is going to be purple tomorrow? I wouldn’t, because it’s never happened before

I’m sure I’m missing some facts, but that about sums it up. As you can surmise, the combination of all these things has taken quite a toll on my mental health. 

Although there are always outliers, we all know what America’s idea of a man is. Strong, ambitious, driven, a provider, confident, intimidating, successful, social, and of course well endowed. I realize this is not EVERY females idea of a man, but is without a doubt the vast majority. When factoring in where I live, that majority turns into the entirety.


My problem lies in confidence and hatred. All of these factors have been massive blows to my confidence, and it has gone on for so long that I truly have no idea how to be confident, or what it would feel like.

Through all of this I’ve conjured quite a hatred for myself and others. I have jealousy with others who have what I want, and I have anger with the world for the set of standards that has been laid out as either “desirable” or “undesirable”.

I loathe myself because of this. I hate that I am different, I hate that I have always been the late bloomer, the sore thumb. I hate myself for not being what a man is “supposed” to be. I match with girls that I think are attractive on Tinder, but will never send a message. I immediately think.....”what are you going to say when she asks you what you do? What do I message her? What are you going to do if you go home with each other and you’re forced to reveal your shortcomings?” (Ba dum, tsss)


In closing...I tend to think of myself as a logical and intellectual person. I do realize that many of my ways of thinking are unhealthy, and are amplifying the problems. BUT, nonetheless, my feelings are real, they are there, and they are not going away. I don’t want to wake up at 35 and be in the same place I am now. How do I build confidence from such a low? How can I believe that I’m able to succeed when I’ve only ever failed? And how can I overcome my mental, financial, and physical shortcoming with women?

For those of you who made it this far, I genuinely appreciate it. I apologize for the movie script above, the paragraph structure is driving me crazy. But I had to get it all out, and quickly. I have never posted anything regarding my mental state on the internet before. I have seen therapists/counselors but have never been as open as I have been here. This is the first time in my life I have actually stated everything I am unhappy about, before today it has solely lived in my mind. It feels great. Cheers",03Oct2020,1

I’ve ignored both events until now, as I contemplate making a police report against my attacker. Reliving those memories of both events makes me relive the moments of feeling so entirely disposable, useless and just trash. I can feel my mental health deteriorating every day. I no longer find joy in whatever I used to love. I stopped hanging out with people and stopped taking care of my health. I stopped taking showers or eating. I’m slipping and I’m really scared. If this continues and escalates as I make the police report I fear I will just become so broken.",03Oct2020,1

24,"Hello all, I know meds are something talked about here (and any mental health circle) *a lot,* but I'm just having so many conflicting, and frustrating thoughts on this. I've been back in therapy for almost a year now, and my therapist has suggested meds multiple times (not in a pushy way, thankfully), and I always bucked up against it and sort of rejected the notion. It's not out of any guilt, or shame, or thinking that meds are somehow, ""wrong,"" or whatever. I think the fact that these kinds of medications exist and so profoundly change people's lives for the better is awesome...but I can never seem to get there for myself. 

My primary concern are the side effects. I've heard some horror stories about what they do to people. And I've put in such a huge effort to better my physical health, as well, and so to see that possibly get ruined because of a pill, really rubs me the wrong way. I know, it's sort of dumb to care about the physical over the mental, but ya know, this shit doesn't always makes sense, hah, and we still live in a society that conditions us to do so largely. Anyways, I just don't know if I can put myself through the whole trial and error bullshit. I don't want to constantly be going on, waiting, weening off, and trying again. That sounds just as bad as being depressed, in my opinion! 

However, I came across someone who seemed to experience their depression is a very, very similar way as me and they mentioned how they had finally given up their whole crusade against them, and started in on them...and it worked so unbelievably well, and they say they're so much better, and its the first time in decades they haven't just been in the absolute pits with depression. That's made me rethink my attitude and start warming up to the idea of trying it out. But! Whenever I do so that pang of fear rushes back in and taints the whole thing, and now I feel as if I'm just in this tug of war of choices. 

What do you guys think? Advice? Experiences? Insights and clarity? I'm here for it all! I just really needed to vent this maddening thought process, and in a place with like-minded folk, so, I appreciate whatever (pertinent) response you have to give!

26," I recently got into my ideal master's  program in the US. Things have been progressing well, and I've been able  to attend classes from home. I really begun to have problems when I  realised I wasn't happy anymore.

I  was excited at first, but seeing all the awful stuff in the news  (racism, climate change, etc.) has really robbed me of any hope for the  future. On top of that, I took out loans to pay for it, and the state of  financial inequality makes me feel like I'll never pay it back. I try  not to get sucked into the pessimism of subs like [r/LateStageCapitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/) or [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/)  but they're making more sense to me these days. I have a pretty  thorough understanding of the international system (that's what I'm  studying) and everything just seems fucked.

Lastly,  although I'm an American, I'm also black. I've never had any real  experiences with blatant racism and I don't know what to expect or how  to deal with it. I've never lived in the US for longer than 3 months, so  I've never really felt like an african-american. I don't know what the  impact will be on my life or how to react to it. Its scary to think that  you're whole life can be ruined just because of the colour of your  skin. How do I deal with the police, or getting followed in a store or  with a racist boss?

Colourism in  my country is a bit easier to navigate if you know what to do, and a lot  of it is less about the colour of your skin and moreso about being  close to some concept of ""whiteness"". It feels like a white man can be  anything he wants, but a black man can only be a white man.

27,"Some years back i [M29] was doing great. I got promoted to number 3 in my company, my fiance and I were living it upset it required me to constantly be working on my phone or laptop to do logistics scheduling and payroll or actually on a jobsite which would take anywhere from 8 to 20 hours per shift. My home life was met by a Filipino mother who constantly found something to scream or scowl towards me about, a always ailed father who seems to be dying all the time yet knew everything about everything and my fiance who is the regular angry white girl who screams at any and all criticism or anyone or thing in her way. Through all that I still love them I think. Anyway, at one point I had been working for 4 months straight foolishly thinking it'll be worth it some day and at a jobsite going into the 5th month I passed out bleeding out of my ears and mouth and other private area.

Over the last 2 years my fiance cheated on me and when I found out I flipped but somehow she managed to convince me to keep her around. Magically, after 8 years she became pregnant one the chaos of her cheating died down.....then covid hit which decimated my company( I had been promoted to ceo recently) I've been trying to do some contracting work but with 10 hours of dialysis daily and a body that isn't even half as useful as it used to.

My fiance is still relentless with screaming and her anger and she constantly threatens me with never seeing my daughter and telling everyone that I dont care about her or our child. She keeps saying that im selfish for not going into unemployment and not looking for a 9 to 5. I thought it was chz I was depressed and now its because I'm selfish. Im terrified that the stress will kill me at this point and my daughter will be raised to be angry all the time. I just wanna raise my daughter but there is so much working against me.
