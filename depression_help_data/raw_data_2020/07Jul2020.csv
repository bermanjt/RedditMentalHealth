TLDR: I have depression and don’t know what to do about it, I also fear I may be faking it - any thoughts/advice/anecdotes would be appreciated!

Hi all,

Sorry to take up some of your day.
I’m new to reddit and don’t know how this all works, so, sorry if I’m in the wrong subreddit or breaking any rules or something. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety three years ago. I have times (weeks?) where I’m what I call ‘fully’ depressed, and can’t do anything. I feel absolutely awful, and like my mind is lead. Thankfully, these times aren’t overly frequent anymore; I just have a few days every couple of weeks where I’m in that state. Most of the time, I’m just mentally exhausted and just kind of numb? I don’t know how to describe it. I’m not actively unhappy, but I’m certainly not happy. I just... exist. I’m too tired to meet friends or to go out, but I’m not ‘fully’ depressed, just disconnected. If I were to push myself to go out etc, I will then become ‘fully’ depressed for a while (probably a few days), because I would be so exhausted from the activity. I also worry a lot about talking to people and their judgement (it can take me hours to write the smallest of emails). But sometimes I feel like I’m faking it all or causing it, because I do have the odd day or evening where I’m okay (or good, even!). Idk.

I’m wondering what my next steps should be. I don’t like looking far into the future, as I’m not sure I want to be there (not to sound too grim, sorry), however, I feel like I need to do *something*. I don’t want to just keep existing like this and wasting my life. 

In the past I have been in therapy for short periods of time. It helped me get to where I am now (I was ‘fully’ depressed for quite a long time, and suicidal/self-harming). I feel I should make more of an effort to get back into therapy - but I’ve just moved back in with my parents, and don’t have an income. Also, the virus/general anxiety/exhaustion stuff makes it hard for me to leave the house, and ‘online/telephone’ therapy sounds like a nightmare to me.

I have looked into SSRIs, and they terrify me. There are such scary stories about their side effects, etc. Also, because I have periods of being ok, I’m scared I’m just being over dramatic, and don’t need them. Also, I start work soon, and need to learn to drive as soon as I can, and am scared about the meds preventing that. Finally, I am going through a lot of changes right now (aren’t we all?) with moving and graduating, and fear that it may not be the best time to make any big decisions, idk.

I have read many self-help books, tried yoga and mediation, tried exercise and a ‘healthy diet’. Nothing changed. 

Any thoughts, stories, and/or advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance.",07Jul2020,1

3,Ive posted a few times here at this point because i apparently don't have friends. I thought i did but when i was down and spiraling the other day only obe reached out to me he asked if i was ok i said no and he said youll be ok i believe in you and then went about his day. I dont know what i wanted him to say maybe a dont do anything crazy or a id miss you if youre gone but alas we move on i had several friends  but i cant remember them reaching out to me i always initiate so i made an effort to not go out of my way to talk to them and suprise suprise they dont seem to care. Honestly hurts really thought we were friends but hey guess im to much of a burden with my whole drowning in my sadness thing. Atleast this makes it an easier decision if i ever decide enough is enough and just end it.,07Jul2020,2
4,I was in discord with a friend who had some girls over and my friend ended up showing a picture of me to the girls. All the girls ended up viscously making fun of me for the way I looked and started saying awful shit like how I’ll never be loved by anyone because I’m so ugly. Why are these the people that get to succeed and live long lives and get married and have children and be happy? Why are these the people that have a “purpose” in life? Why is it almost like you’re rewarded for being an asshole?,07Jul2020,1

8,"I've had chronic depression since \~13, off and on. I was doing really well for a couple of years, got my degree and a job and an apartment, and two promotions last year -- but this year the depression has just come back and really, really hard.  


Which is ridiculous because I don't even have anything to be depressed about. My life is pretty decent. I'm in a much better place than I've ever been. And yet here I am, chasing after serotonin, after something that makes me feel anything other than how empty I am right now. Wake up, grind, waste time, repeat. The days go by all the same. Is this just what it's going to be like for the next forty years until I die?

10,"Oh gosh where do I start? So my boyfriend and I have been going out for almost 10 months now and things got really hard when we went into quarantine. I really missed him and I cried a lot. Now it’s become a feeling of whatever. This has been bothering me for a little while now so I’m going to lay it on the table. My bf says he’s sad sometimes and doesn’t know why. He has no family dynamic. He doesn’t eat with his family or interact at all. He eats in his room and plays video games all day. He hates school and he won’t try new things. He hates walking, drawing and he complains that he doesn’t look right and won’t workout. I’ve given him suggestions of things to do to cope and stuff and he throws it in the trash. I’m his only support system and honestly i don’t even know if I am support to him. He makes no effort to make friends or keep in touch with his old ones and he has an awful relationship with his dad. They fight often. He has no inspiration to do anything other than eat chipotle, talk to me and play video games. I don’t know what to do. I care so much about him but he’s falling down a hole and won’t grab my hand. I asked him if he’s tried to consider therapy or family therapy and he said it doesn’t work. He won’t make an effort to try to mend things with his brother, mom or dad. His sister has Mowat Wilson syndrome which is tough for him but he doesn’t interact with her much. I’m worn out and I’m lost. I had depression and I’ve recently been taken off of my meds and I feel great. I have many goals and things I aspire to do in my future. We both went through tough times a couple years ago. We are both adopted and that really brought us together. I know what depression looks like when I see it because I’ve been through it. I’m scared for him and he refuses help so to him I’m a basket for him to put all his troubles in. I haven’t let it get to me too much because I’ve talked with my therapist about it and it’s helped me manage stress. I don’t believe that this relationship is going to last much longer. I don’t want to break it off because he doesn’t react well to those things. I’m letting our relationship simmer down more. I really do love him but he needs help. He really does. I don’t want him to be like this anymore it hurts. I love life and he hates his. I’m stuck and I mmmm scared. Please help and I’m so sorry that I made you read all of this I just don’t know what to do. 😭😭😭😭

I'm not sure if my doctor guy who talk to about my depression and deals with 
my antidepressant counts as therapist or psychologist because some countries it's seen as different or same thing, also not really too sure what one he is because my mum deals with all my mental and medical stuff due to my aspergers, so i don't really know much and i just refer him as my doctor to make it easy.

I have depression and been taking the same antidepressant for two years now, his only up the dose once and it was only a little, for while now, i just felt worse, I'm constantly having breakdowns, even over the littlest things, i be watching a movie and something sad happens and i just breakdown.

I also having suicidal thoughts, few times in my breakdowns, i come close to self harm, only once i tried to actual attempt suicide, i got no appetite even when I'm hungry, i have to force themself to eat, i got no motivation to do anything, even things i love to do, i have no enjoyment in them, all i want to do is sleep.

I have told him this, how i feel and all he did was nothing, i asked him if we could change my meds or up the dosage, for some reason he refuses, even though I'm at my breaking point and had an suicide attempt.

I told my mum all this and she doesn't seem want to do anything either, i can't get different doctors because most of these people aren't covered by Medicare and i don't want to spend alot of money on new one just for them to be the same.

And what really gets me how he says to me, what can make me better is to get put of the house, 1. There is an pandemic going on. 2. My mum is high risk person, i can't risk her getting it, I'm not sure if i count as high risk but i do have bad immune system and get seizures. 3. I've got very bad anxiety, being out in public doesn't make me feel good, i get panic attacks easily and 4. I'm way unstable feeling and no motivation what so ever to go out.

I just don't understand how is going out gonna make me emotionally stable when the public is one of reasons, why I'm not well, I don't know what to do, feels like no one listening or cares, I'm just tried of feeling like this, i want to feel good, not feel like my mind is at war, I'm scared that my next breaking point might actually end up with me succeeding in an attempt.",07Jul2020,1
32,"Hi all,

Context: I've had counselling since March, provided by the university for free but we only have one session left.

I have suicidal thoughts, episodes of low mood and have hurt myself not so long ago (nothing life threatening though). She asked me to contact my GP to be referred to a long term counselling service but I'm scared and anxious because I've never contacted a GP in the UK (I'm from Belgium). Considering the sessions we've had so far (and also because it was nearly the last free session provided by my uni) she asked me to reflect on why I have this reluctance to ask for help and care for myself, and also why I always laugh when talking about my suicidal thoughts and don't seem to take it seriously enough, like why do I think my social anxiety of calling someone on the phone is a bigger issue than me wanting to hurt myself? 

I understand that it is work I have to do myself but I don't really know where to start... Any recommendation of stuff to read to get my reflection going? Any similar experience?

After a suicide attempt at the age of 19, I was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety, but I have started to feel really depressed at the age of 14 more or less. At school (from elementary school to high school) I have experienced heavy bullying, mostly for my looks. I was called names, I was never invited, I was marginalized and verbally abused (they told me things such as ""ugly"", ""disgusting"", ""you will never find a bf"") and I didn't make friends. Actually , I never had a real friend. So I felt and I feel extremely lonely. Plus I have never had a bf. Unfortunately, they were right about my looks:I am ugly and extremely unattractive. No, I don't have body disphormia. I post photoshopped and filtered pics which don't show bad I look like in real life. My face is ugly, my body too. Due to anorexia when I was 14, then bulimia and other eating disorders my body is flabby and saggy.
Other than depression and anxiety, I suffer from bulimia nervosa and self harm. Due to my mental illnesses, I didn't start university and I don't work right now. I live with my parents but they work all day long so I am extremely lonely. As I said I don't have friends or a partner. I post on degrading subreddits because I think that if I get used to abuse it will hurt less someday. I basically feel and am unlovable, unwanted, unacceptable. I am ugly and disgusting. And worthless. Nobody wants me around. I havent been able to make a friends in years, I am really useless. And I will never experience love because of my looks. Whats the point on keeping living if I am so lonely and worthless? Loneliness hurt af. And I want this pain and this feeling of being marginalized by the world to end. That's why I am suicidal.

Everyone in my family keeps telling me that working isn't supposed to be fun, or be enjoyable and I know that. I understand that. But having a job for me makes me anxious and angry and short-tempered afterward because the rest of my day afterword feels like I'm just wasting away until having to wake up once again and do it all over. I've been feeling suicidal lately too and I can't just push it aside to wake up and go to work when just being alive doesn't matter to me.  
Now since that's all pretty vague I'll get into it literally.

I've only worked 2 real jobs, my first job was as a dishwasher when I was 17 years old, part-time after school, 15$ an hour, about 6 hours 3-5 days a week. I was stressed out all the time because I would go home from school at 2 and then I felt like I was wasting away from 2:30-4:30.

My 2nd real job is one I just got 3 weeks ago working full-time doing golf maintenance, 9 hours a day, 14$ an hour, I have had to wake up at 4 am every day, speed to work and then bust my ass working maintenance all-day with older men in their 50s. One guy at work has taken to hating me for no reason which has made things worse and weird.  
I feel that since these 3 weeks working there, my mental state has just quickly deteriorated. In general, my depression has been had ever since returning back home from college because of Covid-19. My family life isn't the best and I don't get a lot of professional help with my mental illness because I need to save up a lot of money - aka the reason I tried getting a job.  
I don't want to be shamed anymore for how I might be *lazy* or making *excuses* ( that's what my family would say).  
I want to watch out for my own well-being and mental state. I have felt myself slipping away.  I don't know if I could apply for unemployment or disability.",07Jul2020,1

Euthanasia should be an option. Its unfair to make a person continue to suffer, when clearly they aren't going to get better. Sure there's suicide, but that forces the individual to go it alone, spending their final moments isolated, anxious, and with the fear of getting it wrong. A hospital where you could go, and have friends/family by your side as you experience a loving and peaceful end of life. Jack Kevorkian had the right idea. People shouldn't be forced to suffer beyond what they can bear.
