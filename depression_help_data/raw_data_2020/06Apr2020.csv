1,"I don’t know why it’s so hard to be content with myself. Be on my own. Rely only one myself. But I need people. 

Do you feel like you stopped caring about yourself and stopped actively ‘living life’ because it seems like nobody in the world gives a damn whether you’re dead or alive?


Like, nobody ever contacts you or reaches out to ask how you’re doing. you spend so much time pouring into relationships, doing your best to make sure people like you and then in the end...they just forget you. You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact.

I guess i’m just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you can’t keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And that’s what kills me....being the only one that cares. It’s always been this way.

Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you. I guess i’m just having a hard time accepting the fact that I don’t mean anything to anyone. 

How do you guys cope with the silence? Waking up every day with this intense emptiness that almost paralyzes you. Knowing today is another day I won’t hear from anybody. Today is just like yesterday and tomorrow will be the same. Feeling forgotten, like you’re just a ghost roaming around aimlessly. A ghost.",06Apr2020,1
2,"so recently, my mom got interested in losing weight and getting healthy so she decided to make me do stuff with her so i can “motivate her” even though the rest of my family will be there too, she specifically needs me. my mom is making me wake up early to go on walks with her and even tho i told her it would make me more unstable, and my moods would be very bad because i take sleeping pills and it would interrupt my sleep. she’s still making me do it. when she walked away my dad said that she’s counting on me to get heathy and lose weight and when i told him it will fuck with my mental health he said “yeah but it’s her health though. why don’t you just suck it up and just do it?”
i tried to not fucking have a breakdown right there.",06Apr2020,3

4,"I'm watching an online lecture video and keep realizing my mind has drifted off and I don't know what he talked about for the last two minutes. It is sort of inefficient to keep having to rewind two minutes and rewatch things so I'm trying to shake off these feelings of depression (and feeling of longing to kill myself to be free from depression)

&amp;#x200B;

Longing to kill yourself (longing for the next life even if you don't quite believe in one) is somewhat better than crying/feeling hurt, at least it acknowledges there is a way out and is more progressive than just crying. But it is still somewhat distracting in day to day life and still decreases enthusiasm for day to day activities.

5,"Hey! First of everything. I'm AuruShuri. I'm new here and all of this regular things. (Sorry for my bad English, I'm still studying it)

Well, I'm going to say some little things that keep me awake.
First, I think that everything I really do is total nonsense. I contextualize, I always try to be that light for those who feel lost within their abyss. Being that guiding light in the dark. But ... Why? Why try so hard if later when I need someone, nobody is there? How can I try to make others happy if I can't even feel happy with myself? The rejection that society gives me only makes me go much deeper into the labyrinth of my mind from which it is impossible to get out. It is a repetitive cycle in which I must pretend that nothing happens, that everything is fine. While little by little everything is filled with garbage and nobody knows who is who. What I can do? What am I supposed to do in situations like that? I stopped eating normally or even obeying my appetite for a long time, I feel that it is not worth spending anything on me. Why? By rejection, if everyone rejects me after they use me, why waste essential resources on a toy?",06Apr2020,2
6,"So my girlfriend has struggled with depression her whole life. This has been coupled with drug addiction as for a long time that has been the only thing she thinks makes her happy. Shes recently come to the realisation that this isnt making her truly happy and shes finding it really hard to find any sort of meaning or fulfulment in life. She started councilling a few weeks before the corona outbreak and it went AMAZING. She finds it really hard to open up to anybody and for the session she asked me to go in with her because she felt she wouldn't be able to open up. I expected it to be me speaking for the whole session giving the councillor everything I know about her situation but boy was I wrong. She instantly opened up to this woman straight away and I was over the moon with excitement about it. It seemed so perfect she even said herself she could'nt believe how open she was being. Then this corona thing happened and it's got a bit shit again. We spent the first part of the lockdown (we're in the uk) together at her house and it was great. The thought of being locked inside didn't matter because we had each other. Now im at my parents house the thought of spending months apart is horrible for the both of us. We've decided to ignore the government guidlines slightly (and the views of our parents lol) for the benefit of our mental health and meet in Bristol where we both attend university to spend the rest of the lockdown together. I wish we could start councilling again with this woman however I don't think that's going to be a possibility. We have asked her to do a video councilling session however I'm not sure if that will be as good for my girlfriend but it's worth a try. I'm so fucking extremely worried about her I just want her to get better, it sucks so much that she started to make great strides in getting better and this shitty virus has fucked it all up.

The main point of this post however is because she has just sent me a message and asked for my advice and I wanted to ask the people of reddit for their advice too. I have told her the advice that I can give which is basically take an hour once a day to chillout. Use part of that time to meditate with the headspace app but mainly focus on taking a break from these thoughts and emotions to try and take a step back from it all.

Here's what she sent me anyway, If you guys have any advice that can kind of work in the moment to help feel okay while all this is going on in her head that would be great. and apologies if i don't reply instantly. Thanks in advance

9,"I’ve always been depressed. Ever since a child. I was severely neglected and 40-50 hours a week as a young kid with no human contact. As a teenager I rebelled and mom kicked me out blah blah I will spare you the sob fest. 

I just feel like I’ve always been fighting the monster of depression and the last couple months I feel like I was winning. At this point I might only have like one day a week where I laid in bed all day with all my responsibilities piling up. It felt like progress. Met a cool girl and stopped feeling lonely as much. Have a really good best friend. Money was ok for the time being. 

Now I feel that holed up in my house that the monster is just circling. Getting closer and closer. I feel like I can only evade it for maybe an hour a day now where my motivation to do stuff gives way to nothingness. I feel so alone.

11,"I think it will make me feel better, distract me from the reality of being me for a while. I don't think it's worth the resources. I don't think that easing my own suffering is worth the whatever the hell it costs.  I don't think it's worth wasting the water for me to be able to look at my own reflection for more than a few seconds. I don't think it's worth it to have a little time where every other thought is how much of a piece of shit I am.

Now I'm wasting electricity, taps on my keyboard, revolutions on my hard drive to just whine to everyone here about my stupid shit because I'm not smart enough or motivated enough to just deal with it. Cluttering up the feed, making it potentially harder for people worth the time of day to get help that they need. 

I don't know why I'm like this, all that I know is that it's my fault. I don't know what initial mistakes I made to get the ball rolling, nor any of the follow up mistakes that failed to fix anything, but I'm to blame. I didn't fix myself years ago when I was just a little messed up and I'm not fixing myself now that to me I'm really messed up. 

I'm lazy, that's what's really wrong with me. I'm too lazy to do any of the things that could potentially improve my life. Of course the only solution to lazyness is to not be lazy, which is the real trick. If I could not be lazy I already would be. But I can not be lazy, but I won't, because I'm too lazy.

I don't even know why I'm still alive anymore. I'm not going to get better, I'm not going to be able to pay everyone back the cost of raising me, all I am is a waste of resources. The longer I keep myself alive, the more gets wasted on me. I just need to find a way to die by hurting the fewest number of people.",06Apr2020,1

I worry about them and do what I can to make it things as stress free as possible for them. I cook, clean, do laundry. Taking them things to work when they want. Offer support. Try to understand them, but that gets difficult sometimes.

22,"Hey y'all. 
This very hard to write about without bursting into tears again. 
My grandfather died from cancer back in December of 2018. I never got to say goodbye. He was in Arizona with his parents but we never got to hear his voice. I never did one more time. It hits me like a train everytime I think about it. I just feel broken because of it. 
And recently my great grandpa passed.. (Last Tuesday night). I haven't seen him in years too. He had a stroke and he had Alzheimer's so that last time I saw him, with my grandpa, he didn't remember me. That was almost 4 years ago. He died with family surrounding him. I only wish I was there... But once again. I never got to say goodbye. I'm not realizing that I'm slowly losing my family.. I feel completely broken and I'm sad most days.. I try putting on a smile and I try to stay strong but I just can't sometimes. It hurts way too bad.. I feel like I'm stuck in this deep, dark pit that I can't escape from.

23,"I don't entirely know what to say or why I am entirely making this post but I know it will feel good if someone hears me. Also I'll try to make this short but there is a lot I want to get out so bare with me. I guess I'll start by saying I've been feeling very low lately and especially lonely. I don't really have any friends except the ones I play xbox with online, some of them I've been talking to since I was 12 and I have formed very good relationships with them. Growing up as a teenager I didn't have any irl friends, even though I really desired to fit in, hang out after school and do all that stuff but my social anxiety was so bad I avoided talking all together for the most part.

When I came home from school I'd at least have my friends online to talk to... that was when I felt ok showing my real personality and the only time I would feel any happiness. We've all grown up now and over the last few years they barely get on anymore and I quite literally don't have anyone to talk to regularly. I fully understand that they have lives outside of getting on xbox and I'm genuinely glad they are living their lives like everyone our age should be doing, but ever since I turned 17 and dropped out I feel like my life has been on pause and everyone around me keeps growing while I'm stuck right in the same spot.

Now that I'm 20 it makes me feel so pathetic that this is where I am, unemployed for over a year, nobody to talk to or go out and do things with and hating my self every second of the day. I just don't have any gas left in me man, I feel so trapped I don't know were to go from here. Everyday I'm so lonely.. thinking about it makes me tear up I'm really starting to believe its just because people think im boring and I can't hold conversations very well. Also I can't bring myself to ask for help. The only help I ever got was getting put on lexapro a few years back but it never worked and I guess my parents just looked at it as ""problem solved"". 

I just want to feel fucking normal dude.. I'm a loser, at least based off where my life is atm. I also suffer from depersonalization disorder (thats a whole other situation)  so even typing all this out and trying to make it somewhat coherent is a bit of a challenge so I hope this is readable.

The pandemic has closed my uni for the rest of the year and my deadlines are being pushed back. More time to get everything done you think, but then you realise you can barely push yourself to work for 5 minutes before you get angry and give up. 

I hate what I have to do for this module but I need to do it. I’ve reached out to others on my course but the best response I’ve got so far was quote “lol idk I just do?!” No one I reach out to seems to understand how bad a situation I’m in even when I literally state that I need help.

I hate the look of everything I do. My course leader isn’t expecting the world and I know that but jesus christ, I can’t look at it and not despise this project. The rest of my degree work I love and I want to work on that but If I stop working on this project I will never pick it up again. It’s not even difficult I just have no energy or motivation to do it.

After ten minutes of trying to write this I had to walk away. I picked this back up and read through the next paragraph. What I was trying to say was that I am not getting enough done for me to be happy with the amount of work I get through in a day, I can’t do what I would usually do due to the pandemic and that what I have tried isn’t giving me the results I need. That being said I want to leave the next paragraph in to show how easily I work myself up into a complete state over this

(I’ve tried the whole ‘reward yourself with what you want to do’ thing but I’m not getting anything done quick enough. I’m cutting corners to stop myself from giving up altogether. Due to lock down I can only get out of the house once a day and I have to use that to walk the dog at night so taking a walk to clear my head isn’t an option right now and my parents are starting to get mad that i’m wandering around the house in an effort to not lose my shit over this fucking project. I am completely fucking done. I hate this fucking thing i wanna scream and cry and throw my laptop out the fucking window and i can’t even do that. I can’t even cry how can i get work done when i can’t get water to come out my eyeballs)

I seriously got mad at myself for not being able to cry. I still am. I have no energy, no motivation, i’m getting pissed of at the slightest thing. The pandemic has probably heightened everything but I was having trouble with this before the lock down was put in place.

I’m sorry this completely got away from me but I don’t want to shorten this as it was really helpful to just get it out.

28,"The past few months have completely changed my personal life. There is too much to explain every detail but I have recently turned 18. My parents became separated on the night of my 18th birthday after being married for 20 years. I have a 10 year old sister which means despite me being 18, there is still a legal custody situation involving my sister. My parents are currently on a 50/50 arrangement where we alternate parent every 2 days. My sister only being young finds it very hard to sleep without our mother nearby so for those 50% of nights since my birthday, when we are with dad, she has basically cried for hours until she falls asleep. It has been miserable. I’ve been mum’s replacement so I have had to be in her room and listen to her cry for hours and trying to tell her everything’s gonna be okay until she falls asleep. I really can not last any longer. I cannot live the next few years of my life where every 2nd night I have to listen to my sister cry herself to sleep. I am writing this right now after she has just fallen asleep. Tonight was the worst it’s been. I know she’s young and probably over stressing but an hour or so ago she said she didn’t want to live anymore. I know I’m legally old enough to do whatever I want and don’t have to abide by custody rules, but I follow them with her just so she doesn’t feel more alone than she already does in this situation. So either I continue this way and spend 50% of my nights in misery or stop and go elsewhere for those nights but I wouldn’t be able to deal with the thought of her feeling miserable in the back of my mind. At least when I’m there I know she is not feeling completely alone with my support.

How do I proceed? I am definitely telling my mum about what my sister said tonight when I see her next but I doubt that’ll change the situation much.

35,"Hey everyone,

I am currently riding the struggle bus and would really appreciate some insight.

Just a quick recap, my ex-girlfriend broke up about a month ago after experiencing some sort of anxiety attack or depression slump. More specifically, she suffers from depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and potentially a few others. To make matters easy, our story was exactly similar to every other mental illness-fueled breakup, so hopefully you can rationalize why she decided to break things off.

After about a month, we reconnected as friends after genuinely missing the presence of each other. We were best friends for over a year previous, so transitioning into this relationship type was very easy. Still in complete shock with how everything has unfolded this past month, I felt that befriending her would \[selfishly\] answer reasons why she decided to break things off as well as ensure that her mental and physical state was at least safe and okay.

However, I am slowly forgetting why we fell in love with each other.

I am starting to forget the happy moments between us. I am starting to forget the bond we formed between us. I am starting to forget the life we built between us. I am starting to forget why she was the best friend I have ever had and it terribly scary—I do not know why, though I am so so scared that the personality I once fell in love with is washing away.

She has transformed into such a different and, honestly, robotic person these last few weeks and it is really difficult to grasp. Not borderline-like personality change, but emotionally void-like personality change. Quite honestly, I find it somewhat annoying because it is so *not* her, similarly how teenagers fake being tough and mature. This new personality is overwriting everything that I have previously liked about her, and coupled with the quarantine, my mental state is not holding too well.

I know deep down she is still struggling and is experiencing some stage of a depression downswing, though it feels so agonizing and so weird. I feel forced to walk alongside her while she is trapped within her own mesmerizing thoughts, and while I have always loved her unconditionally regardless of the mental illnesses, the dynamic is much different now given our newfound friendship.

**TL;DR**, my depressed/anxious ex-girlfriend's subliminal personality is destroying the genuinely good pieces of our relationship and it is scary.

As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didn’t want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends (obviously) and my family is abusive and toxic there isn’t a single day in the house that there aren’t screaming matches. I lost my motivation to do any of my classes that went online. I stopped eating, I started drinking, and taking pills in incrementing amounts hoping I would gather the courage to kill myself. I started cutting myself so I could distract myself from the emotional pain. All I do is lie in bed, and get water once a day. I cry so often starting as soon as I wake up, and even more so at night. I haven’t been able to sleep well, sometimes at all. I only fear this situation is going to get worse and it feels like there will be no end. It was a shock to come from months of being with my person so happy to have it all stripped away so suddenly. If anyone has any tips that would help me, I’d appreciate it.",06Apr2020,2
37,"Before I tell u my sad story I m an below average looking really fat depressed 20m year old ) 
(She is living outside the country with parents so she would only come in vacation) 

Let me start from where it begun 
2018 I was 18 I had crush on girls before but this was love we were friends and I like her so my only best friend said that u should go and say to her that u like her like an idiot I said to her I like her (by the way I knew she will say no) and she said no 
So now we were friends and I had only one group of friends but we would handle the Awkwardness
I stilll like her
( I don't live in the same state now but I visit my friends once in 3 months) 
Now 2020 January she asked my best friend on a date he said yes (didn't ask me anything but he knew that I still like her) 
He told me that he went on a date I was angry so we didn't talk for a few days but he wanted to talk with me so we talked and he asked that I want to be in long distance relationship with my crush who just had 1 date yes only 1 date so I had two choices 
1.to say  no to him and I will lost 3 to 4 good friend which I only have 
2. Say yes to him and tell him that I am fine with there long distance relationship 
So I chose 2 option 
Now in the present my best friend is not telling me why he broke up with my crush which I don't know that I still like her or not
Now I don't know what should I do 
(There are other factors to consider with my life like my fathers 50+ heart patient had a heart attack I m the eldest son and my father mother and only brother 12  don't live with me and I am really bad in studies 
Like I got 50% in my 12 th and failed a year in  b. Com and now studying b. A  literature 
Failed in my first semester but I can give re exam and I live with my grandparents and I don't like to live with them I like to live alone ) 
What should I do now please help I don't how to make new friends I am an introvert ;I have Social phobia I am a porn addict I over think I procrastinate

41,"My depression hasn't been this bad since I last ran away from home.

Firstly, I wanna say that I don't plan on doing this again . I have friends who are my family and who always will be my family so I don't plan on running away. Nor do I have any 'other' intentions like I have done before for the same reason - I love them all and care for them all.

Part of the cause of my poor mental health is the isolation, I've always struggled living at home even if it's only a 'normal' holiday. I struggle to be myself at home due to transgender issues (it took me running away across half the country before they accepted my name but I still can't wear proper clothes at home) and there's nearly always a negative atmosphere which hasn't helped my mental state at all.

Another cause of my poor mental health is being scared. I've had a really bad past with friendships and with my own self and I'm scared that it's happening again . Last time this happened, it took a lot out of me and mostly destroyed who I was. Lots of people have helped bring me back up , and honestly it meant the world that I had everyone's help, but I'm scared that I'm slowly going back to who I was before and that I'm letting them down  . I also lost a lot of other friends and people I loved due to having the depression which just makes things spiral out even further.

There have been some tearful nights lately, and plenty of dramatic mood swings but I am doing my very best to get better and I am trying to get as much help as I possibly can - which is where you guys come in. University is only 5 months away and I'm sure that things can only get better from there.

Any advice or support would be well appreciated.

Thank you",06Apr2020,1

45,"Like the title says, I’ve been having feelings of hopelessness and dread a lot lately. For starters, I’ve struggled with being overweight basically all of my life and about two years ago I finally managed to lose a bunch of weight but then some very stressful moments happened which caused me to turn to food and I gained it all and then some back. Now I’m trying to lose it again but I can’t go to the gym because of this stupid virus and my house/ room is much too small for me to do any workouts at home without no one hearing it or bothering me. I’ve been eating pre made healthy meals for almost two weeks now and the scale basically hasn’t changed at all. I’ve tried meditation but that doesn’t do much for me as I have ADHD and can’t really concentrate- additionally I’ve tried four or five different types of ADHD meds including Ritalin AND Aderol and none of them did anything for me. I do have a small friend group but I feel like such an outcast in it and I always feel like they tolerate my existence at best. The last big things that’s bothering me is I’m terrified of the future, I’m terrified I won’t get accepted into my dream school and/or I won’t succeed at my dream job, I’m terrified I’m never going to find someone and have a family, I’m terrified I’m basically just going to float through life and not really accomplish anything. I could go on forever about all the other things that’s bothering me but that’s the big stuff I guess. Sorry for the long read",06Apr2020,1

47,"
I recently broke up with my SO who’s depressed. And he messaged me today and we chatted for a bit and he said he feels shitty. I asked what can I do to help? He said “no you shouldn’t help me anymore” . What does that mean??? I’m afraid he’s thinking of suicidal thoughts tbh. 😭 I’m scared.",06Apr2020,1
48,"I already broke down and cried this morning right after when he left. I am even having trouble to function on my day to day life.

We are not in a relationship. He is not taking this forward after seeing him every weekend for over a month. It feels way longer than a month because we actually spend the ENTIRE weekend together. He would come over to my place and we would have an amazing time. Around 2 weeks ago, I asked him where is this going, he told me he has feelings for me and he's confused. Initially, he was not looking for something serious because he had always been in relationship. He just want to stay single and explore. But the fact that he started to have feelings for me, he's really confused. We have really good chemistry together and definitely, we have an amazing time. I already told him that I also have feelings for him and I don't want to get hurt. I suggest maybe it's best if we should stop seeing each other. He disagreed and that he really wants to keep spending more time with me. 

I am really depress by this and my heart will not be able to handle it. When he left this morning, even though we ended in a good note and he was very affectionate, I still feel really anxious. I'm very scared that one day, he will no longer want to see me again and poof, he's gone. He's not someone who would ghost somebody, but I am as scared receiving a text from him saying he no longer interested. This can turn out into nothing! There is NO commitment and it's NOT even exclusive at this point. Even though, he seems to really want to spend time with me, but makes me really upset that something is holding him back from commitment. 

I couldn't even focus at work today. The entire day, I'm just thinking about him and if this will ever be something. 

I never double text him and I always await for his response. During the wait, I get anxious and checking my phone to see if he responded my message. After he left this morning, we haven't spoke. I didn't send him any message and I'm hoping he would message me first. I'm now also having a minor panic attack and feeling really anxious. What if he doesn't message me? I don't think he would cut me off like that but I am still very depressed by it.

49,"recently i came across another redditor’s post within this subreddit and i resonated with every bit of it. in the comments someone mentioned how the op reminded them of their mother who struggles with bpd. 

now, i know self diagnosing isn’t cool. i haven’t even been diagnosed with depression, but my family history, overall mental health, and self harm does a pretty solid confirmation. but researching bpd was a slap in the face. all the emotions i could never explain were written down and organized in a medical article. emotions i could never understand. emotions i thought were a figment of my imagination. 

i can’t go to a psychiatrist right now because of the virus but i’m going completely insane. i keep switching between being comforted in knowing my emotions are real but the thought of possibly being diagnosed with something new to me is scary. i was prepared to receive a diagnosis for anxiety and depression for years... i became comfortable with it and i accepted it, but this feels different. this feels scary and i can’t stop dwelling on it. i feel like the thought of a possible diagnosis is just making whatever is going on with me worse. 

what can i do while i wait to see a psychiatrist? how do i keep myself from getting worse? i may have posted this on the wrong subreddit. not being diagnosed with anything i feel a little out of place to be posting something like this within that community. so, i came here. :(",06Apr2020,1
50,"I’ve been suffering w actual diagnosed depression and anxiety since I was a young teen and I’ve been in meds and all the counselling sessions And they all helped for a while but it always relapsed back into it 
But being a younger teen there’s always a lot of help available , in schools and clubs etc 

And now I’m getting older it seems a lot less ‘socially acceptable’ and I get that constant message to ‘grow up’ and ‘get off your arse and stop feeling sorry for yourself’.  And it’s just a lot harder to seek the right help or solutions , 

So now I’m in a very bad state feeling suicidal and I either convince myself either ,I’m dying from a medical condition, or that any little thing that I know isn’t very big will somehow come out and ruin my reputation but it’s stupid because I haven’t got anything that deep 

But now I feel very suicidal I’ve set a list of things I want to achieve and then after that I’ll kill myself 
The only thing stopping me is my family but everyday it seems more attractive",06Apr2020,1
