0,"So I'm a teenager in my junior year of high school. For the past few years I have been dealing with depression and I have been dealing with social anxiety and OCD for most of my life. This year has been especially hard and everything seems to be getting worse. I don't care about anything, I'm not motivated in school or anything. I'm just ready to die not that I have any plans to commit. 

In January, I transferred to a small school for people with similar issues to mine. Things were getting slightly better but worse again. Now with coronavirus I am not in school and have essentially given up. I'm very behind on schoolwork and my teachers and psychologist have tried to contact me. I've been avoiding a lot of it because when I try to think about I just get really upset and anxious. 

They say they want to help me but I know that everyone just hates me and is disappointed in me. I'm afraid to talk to them because I don't want to hear all the things they think about me. Even if they said something positive I know it's just a lie. I can't trust anyone and at this point I'm stuck. I'm close to failing my junior year and I've pretty much accepted this. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I was previously on medicine for my depression that seemed to be helping somewhat but my psychiatrist decided to put me on medicine more dedicated to my OCD since her and my mom feel like my depression doesn't really affect me and my anxiety is the bigger problem (this isn't really true). Now my mom is taking me off that medicine and just giving vitamins but I just want to die at this point. I've completely given up. I was also in therapy with someone I didn't like or really talk to. There were plans to find a new therapist but those have been halted due to the quarantine.

I'm sorry to everyone who had to read this. I guess I just wanted to get out my feelings to some people who might understand. I know my problem isn't as big as most people. I feel like I haven't really been through anything and all my problems are caused by me. I'm sorry to everyone.",12May2020,1
1,"I feel like im in a big depression since im 10 years old (im 25).  
The only thing that helped me ( a lot) was beeing with my ex, who was my first gf and the only person who showed me love.  


Now that she dumped me for the guy she cheated me with..im..im not feeling very well.   


IM thinking about trying to kill myself again everyday.  


Its been two month since shes out of my life. I cant seem to be able to get over it. I tried a lot of thing, Beeing active, new activities, talk to friends, eat well, taking medication, talk to a psy, etc. Nothing work.   


Sorry if my english is not great, its not my first langage and I must admit ..I may have drank too much to dull the pain.",12May2020,1
2,"I am a young teenage male, and believe that I might have some sort of depression. I understand that everybody (at least that I know) seems to either fake depression for attention, tries to hide it, or clearly is sad or has something wrong going on in their life, and a few seem to be happy. From reading online, I do have a lot of the symptoms of depression (lack of interest, lack of will, lack of care extremely antisocial behavior, always trying to make everyone happy) but I am not sure if this is actually something I need to take with any weight or something that is normal, because it seems normal but definitely isn't good. I don't feel as if I am not wanted, not loved, or a burden to other people although I do think that these are true from a logical view, and simply don't care if anybody else cares or not so I don't put enough thought into deciding if these things are important. I don't want to tell anybody in person because I believe that they will either brush it off and hurt me in doing so because of society's view on male depression, or tell somebody and get me some type of therapy or medication and rack up massive debt for my parents which I couldn't forgive myself for. I do want to get better, but without needing therapy or medication or affecting anybody else in a negative way. What are some things I can do to be more happy in general? Is there a catch-all thing to help that doesn't cost money? Does it sound like I am just faking being sad because I want attention or something else?",12May2020,1

5,"My girlfriend has bad depression and anxiety. It’s gotten bad again when this whole lockdown thing started to happen. We’ve had an incident where a family friend who was addicted to drugs tried to set our house on fire the other day, and he’s been caught now but just the trauma and the stress she has been dealing with is terrible, and she says if one more thing happens she’s going to off herself. What can I do really? She refuses to get professional help, she just wants to die. What can I say to make her feel alright? If I tell her everything will be fine, she doesn’t believe me. I think he anxiety is just too much for her to handle.",12May2020,1
6,"Woke up this morning feeling like absolute shit. It feels as if I have something in my stomach thats heavy. I am suffering from OCD and intrusive tohughts. I recently decided to stop drinking alcohol, because it makes everything worse. I know Im also going to lose some friends because of this, and It just feels so bad! I went to a doctor yesterday and she upped my prozac to 30 mg a day, and im supposed to see a new therapist this week. Im so stressed out by my studies and just life in general.",12May2020,1
7,"For instance I tried to shower and the shower head moved and drenched me with water. This was a huge trigger because my face and hair routine is very important and were critically messed up and could not be fixed because I can only shower in the morning, no other time. I had to immediately strip the nasty wet cold clothes off, and I ended up yelling at my housemate and trying to pull out my hair -- which I put tons of effort into, so it made me feel worse -- and I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore. The smallest thing makes me snap.   


I was crippled from a young age. Abandoned by both parents since birth. Always neglected. According to psychology I'm basically crippled, without even a choice in the matter, because it wrecked up my stages of development. Abusive step-parents. No friends. Nothing matters. I'm cold and I'm tired and I wish someone cared about me. I hate myself. I'm tired. I'm cold.  


I wish it all went away. I wish it stayed away. I'm tired to being.... this. A terrible person. I'm not worth anything. I mess up everything. I'm a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was free from pain and misery and self-doubt and self-hatred and everything. The paranoia. The demons. The fear. I wish I was free of it. I hate my life and I want it to end. I want to stop existing. I wish I wasn't so weak, because then I could take action, but I can't do anything. All the helplines are useless. I call several times a week and it makes me feel worse. None of them care about me. Not a single one of those people cares.",12May2020,1

10,I've suffered from depression for about 4 years now I've had moments during when I stop taking showers. It's not because I'm this lazy gross person who doesn't care about my hygiene it's just because some days I can't even get myself to shower let alone brush my hair. Am I the only one?,12May2020,1

13,"So many people are being impacted by COVID and I am one of the lucky ones to keep my job. I feel thankful and fortunate to be able to work.  On the outside I am smiling, laughing, helpful, and kind.  On the inside my stomach and heart literally hurt, I cry nightly lately, and feel massively overwhelmed.  I feel like I can’t keep up with my workload, and I hold a manager position and have people relying on me that I’m terrified to let down.  Last night I slept maybe an hour because I just couldn’t sleep, then husband came to bed and asked me to move over a bit because I was on his pillow, and I had a massive panic attack which was a first for him to see.  He is incredibly supportive and means well but I know he doesn’t understand why I am acting like this, and frankly neither do I.  I called out of work today and feel so guilty about it, but I know in my heart I need to step away and catch my breath - I just feel so guilty doing so and like everyone will judge me or think I am just being lazy.  I am so stuck right now and I want to give up - not active suicidal thoughts, but leaving my job because I feel like I am not up to par with everyone else.  How can I be so lazy and miss work when there are thousands out of work who need to get by?  But I feel like I am not in control of my own head right now.",12May2020,1
14,"So here's some backstory...(this is my pov)
I was born in a already broke family. My sister and brother already lost there dad at a young age and had to quickly move to our mom's best friend's(my dad's) house. I think around a year later found out they were having me. Growing up my sister and my mom would fight every week and everytime I provoked my brother(who is highly autistic and had severe anger issues back then but is getting better). After I was stubborn and kept provoking him, he would yell at me and punched to wall making me frightened and run away crying. Him, with his anger issues and me provoking him a lot, made me and my sister lock ourselves in my parents room. They were always gone while this happened, dad worked nights and slept all day while my mom worked all day and fell asleep everyday once she got home. She tried to help all her children and give us all love and worked very hard. He would threatened to either kill himself or kill everyone. This scared me a bunch as a child but slowly got used to it. As I got used to it, I wouldn't even need to provoke him to get him like this. He would just out burst at random times. My sister would defend for me while I cried on my parent's bed till my mom got home. Once my mom got home, she would calm down my brother or yell at him if he hurt us. After an hour, she would be yelling at my brother in his room(all our rooms were right next to each other) while my sister tried to calm me down from a slight panic attack. Sometimes when my dad was home at night or had to come home cause it was too severe, he would be in there with my mom and a belt also yelling. If I had provoked him, they would yell/lecture me after they screamed at my brother.
Every night since 6-7 years old,from what I can remember, cried myself to sleep almost every night and prayed for a god out there to ""take my soul away"". With all of this as my home life, I had bad and toxic friends that all tormented me ever chance they got. One physically and verbally assaulted me throughout the years I lived in that neighborhood. They would all bully me every chance they got. For example, I would go over to one of there houses and they would be all nice to me. As soon as we got to another's house, they would call me names, just to name a few they called me b*tch, useless, ugly, etc, and just flat out harassed and emotionally and verbally bullied me. At the time I thought that this was what all friends were like, I mean they were my only friends at the time. 
Soon after I moved to a different street, they pressured me into stealing alcohol from my mom. Oh and don't get me started when they found out my mom smoked. The blackmailed me, they knew I have attempted to commit suicide a few times but never when through. Mind you at the time they did all this I was around 7-10 years old. 
A couple years later, I finally got away from them after moving a couple miles away but sadly still close enough for them to try and manipulate me to let them sleep over and to also still go to the same school. I gladly lost contact with most of them. Some have came to me and said they want to be friends again, so I let them but we rarely talk to each other. We are still mutual. A little back in fourth grade before moving a couple of miles away, I met a girl who we will call K taught me what REAL friendship is and protected me a much at she could from the constant bullying and rumors about me in that school. The school was small and we all knew each other. After a few months she moved to a school that I would go to for middle school. My mom didn't wanna transfer me to the school I was zoned for, she made me stay in the school where I was bullied and picked on all 5th grade. I survived and finally made it to the school that I mentioned earlier. 
I made a friend that I thought was like a sister to me(we will call her C) and still is but there are some problems I will mention later. I finally saw K again and I realized that I had a crush on her. I trusted C and told her. She knew I was genderfluid at the time and I told her I was pansexual. I finally confessed to K about my feelings and she thought she liked me too so she agreed to dating me. We took it slowly and she knew everything about me. She didn't really give me much attention cause she didn't wanna overwhelm me due to neglect at home for awhile. She got picked on for it but ignored them. We broke up a couple months after the new school year started. We both agreed we lot feeling for each other and stayed friends. 
During my 6th grade year, I was bullied a lot but never told anybody. Some rumors about me spread and it just made things worse. My home life at the time was better than before but my sister would fight with my mom constantly. I trusted my sister enough to tell her that I was feeling really down and said I was thinking about cutting. You'll never guess what she told me...she legit told me I was taking it for attention and was just to shut the hell up. I remember crying that night so much that a week later I found a box cutter and took out the blade to cut myself. I hid my cuts and blade every day. K and another friend confronted me about being so distant and why I was always wearing either long sleeved shirts or hoodies. I fessed up and they comforted me all throughout lunch. A jump to February the next year, I was dating K at the time...I planned to OD on the weekend before Valentine's Day....I went through. As you see it failed. See my family believed that was my first time attempting suicide, and never noticed the long sleeves on really hot days and such. A week later, C's family started to blame me for C cutting. Let's just say police were called and her parents hate me. Also to this day, we still talk(of course) but abuse and neglect still goes on in her house making her depression worse. They won't even get her therapy or a psychiatrist for Gods sake. 
Things have gotten better but I have found out a couple of my friends used me. A couple of people I have dated tried to do things to me but I broke up with them. One didn't like that and tried to get everyone to turn on me but her plan backfired and she is still getting her karma. I also found out that during the time I was in the hospital recovering from the attempted OD, a guy mocked me for actually doing it. Safe to say all my friends reported him to the dean and principal and he was expelled. Apparently that was the last straw for him because a lot of people have reported being bullied and other sh*t about him. I'm glad he is gone. 

A lot of this sh*t happened when I was little, I've been diagnosed with MDD and a borderline anxiety disorder. I also have very severe PTSD of yelling. No matter who is yelling at I have a slight panic attack and just shut down immediately. It has gotten better but I still shut down at a slight raise of voice. I've also gotten better with my anxiety but my depression hasn't really gotten better. I've gotten off my med cause my a$$ faked being happy and ok to get off the pills....I regret that but I right can't go see a therapist nor my psychiatrist cause of the pandemic. Thanks life....while all this quarantine sh*t is going on, my anxiety has increased and depression has gotten worse. I've tried everything to detract me from the emptiness I felt inside from YouTube to gaming to even music, art, and sleeping. Nothing is working. I've dyed my hair multiple times. 
During all this stuff, I've had long episodes that just made me sit in my closet and cry. I've done this for days and making myself starved, dehydrated, and sleep deprived. All I'll due is just sit in my closet and just cry...I've already given up on doing my school work. I've thought/attempted of suicide but never mention it to anyone. I have saved C from OD-ing but I've been thinking of doing the same. All I do now is sit and just do nothing. I have, at times, felt nothing but numbness. 

I need advice or some copping activities I could do to distract myself from doing anything stupid. 
I know I gave you a lot of background for this one request but I just thought I need to explain everything or I would have a panic attack....kinda cried while writing this...",12May2020,1
15,"Hi. So my girlfriend is quite depressed and it's been long since she has been that way. We're talking one moment and it's going all okay and then she shares depressive lyrics time to time or she just says "" Something wants to escape from my body. Desperately."" Then I ignore it and go on with anything else and she replies saying, "" I think it's just my soul."" 

I just feel so helpless. :( I don't even know what should I even reply to this. If I act all loving and say don't say things like that, it's not okay. Or it's going to be all okay.

16,So I keep trying to wake up early so I can be proactive and change my life with spiritual practice and hobbies.  But I can't stop hitting the snooze.  That goes on until the last minute before I gotta leave for work.  I'm just so addicted to sleep because I don't have to feel the misery.

17,"Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop.  It’s like a movie that never stops playing.  I currently take 120+ mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms.  

Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication.  To put it in imagery, It really feels like it’s a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me.  

I need a long term solution.  it has gotten so bad that I can’t stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress.  Sometimes I cannot even function without it.  When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt “normal”. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life.  

I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted.  Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me.  And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal.  It almost feels hopeless.  

Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication? At this point my liver just has to take the hit because for my mind to feel the way it does without it I can’t keep going like that.",12May2020,1

21,"Hi, this is my first time posting anything like this and I’m not sure how well I’m going to be able to write this but I’ll try anyway.

For a while I’ve been feeling a horrible feeling come over me at least a couple times a day, sometimes I’m able to feel okay or maybe at least sort of responsible to do things but most of the day I’ll feel not sad but just numb.  It’s hard to describe but I’m not able to complete things like schoolwork due to being unmotivated, it’s not that I don’t want to do things it’s that I feel like I can’t.  Throughout the day I feel numb and unresponsive and sometimes the feeling gets worse.  I feel incredibly tired although I don’t want to sleep, I find myself doing things like playing video games but not actually enjoying them just doing the same repetition over and over again for hours on end.  I feel especially horrible at the end of the day for no reason.  These feelings happen way more frequent in the winter (but they still surface constantly in other months.)  All of this has become more obvious to me during Quarantine.  I don’t even mind Quarantine because I usually don’t like interacting with people anyway and hate crowds or large places, in the past these fears have prevented me from doing things like going to Six Flags with my school’s Jazz Band.  I’ve seen a Therapist for a couple years because I had trouble making friends and being able to stay out of trouble and complete schoolwork (a weird combination I know) and I was diagnosed with A.D.H.D and prescribed medicine for it and since then I’ve been doing way better in school and socially but I find myself feeling this way when I’m not around people.  I put up a facade when I’m around friends or family and act happy and crack jokes but when I’m alone I feel shitty.  I don’t know what’s going on with me and I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but these feeling seem similar and I was hoping I could get some advice or help.

24,"Don't really know how to describe this feeling. I have a deep sense of not being worthy. I just constantly feel like I'm not doing well enough at anything and not giving enough towards the task at hand. 

I teach a course and we moved to an online space. I'm new to this and I'm trying really hard to produce good content, make myself available to respond to student and tutor queries, prepare good questions to test them and help them with tutorials and worked examples. Yet, all I feel is that it's not enough. The only feedback I've gotten has been very negative and has critiqued the work that we have done. And maybe they're all correct and I'm just doing a really bad job. Maybe, someone else should take over as they would do better and would be enough.

All the teaching work has really taken it's toll on my time for my PhD work and I've not been able to do any of that and I feel like I'm failing my supervisors. I've not made progress and I just feel like someone else could have been doing this all better. That maybe I'm just not capable of any of this. Maybe, I'm just a failure.

I don't think I've been a great friend to anyone either (true forever, not just recently), and while I try to reach out and check in, it still feels like it's not enough. I'm not able to support people and be what they need. And probably someone could be a lot better at being a friend to them.

26,"I've struggled with anxiety from a very young age. I also have had depression for 7 years. I've had therapists and psychiatrists and have tried numerous medications. I've gone through phases of eating healthy and exercising, and phases of not. I'm also very high functioning. So, even though my insides are going insane, my behavior on the outside is typically pretty functional. I can tell that I've made progress since it all started, however, I am exhausted. I'm growing hopeless and feel that I will never feel better or good or even like my true self.

I struggle with bringing it up to my friends. I'm afraid of making them worried or angry. I don't plan on harming myself. But I honestly cannot fathom feeling this way for another 5 years or 10 or 25. I'm sick of struggling. I feel as though I might be untreatable. I don't think I'd ever harm myself because I know other people care about me and love me, and I don't want to hurt them. But I think about dying a lot. 

How do I talk to my friends without ruining the friendship? My therapist says she's unconcerned as long as I am not making plans.

27,"Hello everyone, I hope you’re all ok and staying safe in these difficult times.

I’m posting this on my throwaway account, as I talk about a few personal issues that I’m not comfortable talking about on my actual account. TW I mention eating disorders, anxiety, depression! 

So the Coronavirus has put me in a sort of bad situation. I’m studying abroad in Europe and I am currently stuck in my university dorm unable to fly home. My dorm is a very small studio, with a small kitchen and bathroom. There is little to no space to walk around in as it is the size of your average college dorm . My building has completely shut down (apart from security) so we have no access to communal areas, so I am confined to my room, or I occasionally step outside for a cigarette. 

I’ve always had issues with my mental health. I recently had a bad reaction to anti depressants and was working through it in therapy. 

But ever since the Coronavirus being so alone has completely heightened all my issues. The thing is , I just feel super uncomfortable talking about it to my friends as I know the virus has affected us all in various ways and I feel like a burden if I make people worry. Same goes for my family too. 

But my living situation has gotten really bad . I have relapsed several times into my ED (I don’t want to go into details as I don’t want to trigger anybody) and now I feel paranoid even eating? Everytime I eat I now have a constant struggle of being too sad to eat/ wanting to eat because I feel like a bad person if I fast/ feeling repulsed by food. I’m having more anxiety attacks a day and having nobody around to sort of comfort me is awful. 

I’ve lost a bunch of weight since isolation and now I feel anxious as to what people might think once lockdown is over and we start socializing again... I was on a call with a friend and she started commenting on how I lost so much weight and I couldn’t help but feel like she was suspicious that I wasn’t eating again which made me feel really guilty. I don’t know why I can’t eat I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings. 

My school work is also suffering. I am supposed to hand in my final in a month and I have missed the last 2 weeks of class. I’ve struggled with working and haven’t replied to any emails . I have an essay due tomorrow that I haven’t completed. 

But I just feel so depressed these days that I can’t seem to do anything. I spend most of my time sleeping , or lying down in my bed crying, or smoking. I watch movies or tv but I can’t seem to concentrate, I’m just constantly worried and panicking. 

Part of me feels really ashamed because this is a global pandemic and so many people are struggling more than me . I think everything is my fault and so many people are in the same situation as me and doing fine . 

I don’t really know what to do now or why I’m even typing all of this. I’m just in a very scary and alone time in my life and I am handling it very very badly.",12May2020,1

30,"TL; DR at the bottom


I've always been depressed. I'm 17 going on 18, and I've been struggling since before I can remember. 

I give a breif synopsis of my life,  I had cancer at 2, constant hospital visits for broken bones and what ever else was wrong with me, I have chidhood and teenage trauma, and ive lost nearly all trust in men. 

My depression got worse when I was 13, after my dad (even though he caused my CSA trauma)  passed away, it still hurt. I had free counselling, so I've pretty much moved on, and I was happy for a while. 

My mom remarried, and that's kinda where things went down hill.  My step father (though he claims to,) doesn't want a big happy family.  My step brother who's a year younger doesn't wanma be a family, where as that's all I want. We used to be friends, then our mutual friend took advantage of me in my sleep (my then boyfriend convinced me to tell my mom the next morning, I got tested and stuff, I'm clean but they found his DNA and someone elses, so who knows,  that's a big factor)  so I'm pretty sure that's what broke my poor semblance of a family,  since right after is when everything collapsed. 

I've had suicidal thoughts, often, ideation, but no attempts past some self harm. My relationship turned toxic, so I broke up with him (he tried to kill himself to make me stay, my then best friend had to talk him out of it, which caused a lot of 'he made me feel worse' drama, Chris, you're the true mvp) 

I got a new boyfriend (Jericho, if you're wondering)  and he's made my life s lot better.  We talk and tease each other (if someone else heard it they'd  it abusive, but trust me its all in good jest)  and yet, I'm still depressed. 


I have numerous mental disorders (some diagnosed and others not) and aspergers,  so a lot of stuff is really hard for me as it is, with everything else on top...  I haven't been able to take care of myself, my schoolwork, or anything. I'm 2 grades behind, both of which I have to finish or go to public school (overstimulation nightmare, I'm also homeschooled,  so no corona break) yet I don't understand why it takes me 5-6 hours to get out of bed every morning, why I can't just.... Function?  My boyfriend fought with my mother a week before the corona virus to get me to a doctor to get me medication, which she gaslights me about, and she finally agreed, but guess what? Corona. 

Due to her gaslighting I don't know what to believe or think anymore. She's been buying into herbs smd stuff because my step dad brainwashed her to join his cult like sect of Christian beliefs (I wouldn't say extremist, but definetly cult like according to the BITE model) and she wants me to take this anxiety oil which, I've already tried all of that when my last counselor suggested it, it didn't work


I don't know what to do anymore, should I try to persue antidepressants?  (I do want to get adderall again, I used to be on it and man, where my grades good...) With all her gaslighting (stuff like ""when you were on it you used to say, how horrible it was,  you wouldn't even tell me half of it"" and stuff,  I was 9-11 at the time, I don't remember those times besides a hand full of CSA moments, of course a child would have symptoms being on ~180 mg of adderall) my boyfriend has,  they've worked well for him besides the fact he forgets sometimes, and the newest one isn't working well so he has to change RX again. 

Tl; Dr, I'm filled with trauma and mental disorders, my family life ks non existent, and I need advice on how to function again",12May2020,1
31,"Am I an incel?

I really hate myself. Through and through I hate myself. And I think people should hate me as well. I’ve become a worthless, soulless, empty shell of something not quite a person, but often mistaken as one.  

I am incapable of making friends due to crippling shyness and awkwardness. Aside from work I do everything I can to avoid people. Social interaction is not just uncomfortable, it’s wholly paralyzing. I think many I’ve interacted with would say I have some severe mental inhibition. 

I had friends in high school and college. I even had girlfriends in high school, though I’m surprised I pulled that off. They went well, albeit only as well as high school relationships tend to go. But that was a certain context wherein I was far more comfortable with my peers than I am now. There have been sparse dates here and there over the years, but nothing came to fruition out of them, and I of course made them unbearably awkward. One girl in college seemed genuinely interested in me somehow, but I let it go because at that point I couldn’t bear to let any self-respecting female put up with me. 

I live at home still. I am addicted to porn and video games. Aside from that my only hobby is learning about ancient cultures which I am exceedingly obsessed with, the Vikings and Native Americans being my favorites to study. I have also never had sex - and to be honest, I don’t care in the slightest, save that I must endure the scrutiny of those who take issue with a 27 year-old virgin such as myself. I believe I’ve lost interest in sex, even porn doesn’t hold my attention for long as it once did. Of course I’d be lying if I said I had no desire at *all* for a significant other, but I do feel I can either take it or leave it. 

My parents and I get along very well. I work and pay for everything I own - car/insurance/etc. Which is more than some people can say, at least. I don’t ask for money. But this too is something which furnishes much scrutiny. I hear so many stories about how so-and-so Johnny, or such-and-such Susie left their house at 18, made a life of their own, own a two story house and a dog. And here I am, finding it an endeavor of cosmic scale to speak with even shaky confidence to another person. 

I feel as though I’ve destroyed myself socially. I feel overwhelming guilt, that I’ve disappointed those around me. There’s this sensation that I need to be punished somehow, and that I am deserving of nothing good. 

I tend to lose track of my purpose when writing these, and as of right now I’m not really sure where I’m going with all this. I simply hate who I’ve let myself become.",12May2020,1
32,"Context, i make jokes etc, about myself but recently i've started to really struggle and i think i need help soon. 
If i go to the doctors and end up in therapy or on antidepressants, how do i bring it up to friends? How do i mention it to family?
In a way that protects me but also explains for them.",12May2020,1
