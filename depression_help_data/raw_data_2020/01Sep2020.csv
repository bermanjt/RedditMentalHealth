I am looking forward for a happy new chapter in my life and not chapter full of pressuring and having people to support me not to compete and tear me down.

I went out with some friends and drank way too much, so much that I blacked out and don’t remember the rest of the night. This has caused a serious increase of anxiety and my depression is crippling. I just wanted to voice this and put it out there. 

I’m just scared, tired, and worn out.

4,"Hello friends, I am aware of how hefty this post may be but I'm in dire need of help as of the making of this post, this is going to be a mouthful but please give it a read.

I am a Moroccan citizen, 18 years of age, who suffers from what i'm almost positive is depression. The reason I am skeptical is that I never had any proper diagnosis, given the state that the world is at right now and that m family's income isn't high enough to provide me with proper psychotherapy.

Anyway, my 'story' started late 2018, where I chose to spend the night with some friends and then have passed by a suspicious-looking girl who for some reason fainted right in front of me on a dark alley (I know, it's all superstitious and now I think of it as nothing but ridiculous), and later that night, at about 4 am I woke up trembling and started throwing up. This of course has led to my head being all over the place and I lost my cool, at least in the present I'm sure it was just a reaction to how scared I was of the situation. All in all this weird turn of event made me enter what I believe to be depression. It had absolutely nothing to do with the incident but it was there anyway, it's like the suffering following this very incident opened my eyes into how dark the world is for some reason. By the suffering I mean throwing up once a weak for no reason, loss of appetite, loss of interest in activities I used to like, constant obsessing over what exactly happened, having to do plenty on counseling meetings, but the ones i wanna keep an emphasis on are lack of appetite and constant vomiting, because these two are going to become way more relevant later.

Luckily enough, after 4 months of so, my depression just... disappeared! I still had some symptoms of it but it was very minor and I went back to being able to live my life normally, I believe It was mostly due to me being so invested in my final exams in high school that it just faded away and became nothing but a bad memory, nevertheless, i was always terrified of entering the same sequence of events again. Inevitably, mid-January 2020, at 5 am right after watching a movie that somewhat shook my emotions I went to the kitchen, and right as I wanted to eat the food right in front of me it ALL came spiraling back, I  threw the food away and the first thought I had was going to my computer looking for solutions. Nothing helped and everything made it gradually worse, especially considering that my mother with whom I used to share everything was mildly sick back then. I felt my body trembling (Again in the 1st time in a year) and I felt so cold (it WAS winter back then but I felt extra cold than normal) so I tried opening some comedy videos and maybe they can make me calm, but I just couldn't help it, and before I know it I wanted to vomit, and so I did.

Depression then came sprinting back, I then decided to take a 2 week break from college so I can sort things out, and in the meantime was taking antidepressants of SSRI type under the name of fluoxet (for 2 months) and another antidepressant called sulride (for a month) in addition of an anti-anxiety/calmer medicine called anxiole to help with the consumption of the SSRI . And from that day onward a cycle kept repeating itself. I'm constantly sad and hopeless but still able to eat and sleep up until I hit rock bottom and I choose to express my feelings to my mother (My only available support ad the only one that can listen to me) and shortly after i'd vomit and i'd refuse to eat for one or 2 days. And after enduring for a duration of about 4 days it goes back to 'normal' state, meaning I can stay in my comfort zone and being able to eat despite my lack of appetite but still incredibly depressed, and so the cycle keeps repeating itself once every 2 months or so.

There are things in my case that I think make my depression stands out

\-The toughest moments of my depression are always marked by vomiting

\-(This one is important) Shortly before the start of any of these events I started playing a game you are likely to be familiar with called League of Legends, to which now I am addicted to and is one of my very few things i do when feeling miserable. In a sense I think it was the reason my depression began AND why it faded away for some months, basically because whenever i was out of home or traveling or attending to college (My college was in a different city than the one which I live in and I can't move my desktop computer around which made me lose access to the game for 5 days each week for 4 months), all I thought about was league,  it gave me a reason to exist, waiting it out so I can finally come home and play the game, a feeling which now mostly faded away and all is left is addiction

\-I was always a person that lacked physical activity, I rarely ever did any exercise

\-My sleep schedule is always so bad, even before any of this happened, some days for me sleeping at noon and waking when the sun's down became the norm.

\-I always obsess about suicide but not in the way you might think, I never considered suicide, matter of fact I've always been scared of sudden death. More so I was scared that it would come to that point of there being no other solution other than suicide, up until this day in which I did consider it for a split-second which made me very scared and what actually pushed me into making this post

\-It was neither incredibly random nor was it caused by a loss of a dear someone, it was just the aftermath of a weird turn of events

\-Depression does exist but from what I've researched it might also be accompanied with anxiety and panic disorder, as I do show many common symptoms of the former.

Right now I am truly lost on my journey to combating depression, so any insights you might give at all is highly appreciated.  Again I had nothing but the internet and some counseling to make me understand my case more so any help is highly appreciated because as of the making of this post I am suffering so deeply.",01Sep2020,1
5,"I just need some advice and to talk about this. My best friend sent me messages saying that I’ve been a good friend and that she decided she’s going to end it tonight. I just sprinted over to her house and talked to her and her mom because she was refusing to talk to her mom for help. She said the reason why she wanted to end it is because she thought that all the pain and stuff from high school would go away after she graduated. But she says she wants the pain to end. She also just doesn’t know what she wants to do with her life and says it’d be easier to just end it. Her mom just took her to the hospital to get her some help. 
Is there anyway I can help her",01Sep2020,1
6,"So my friends constantly just decide to fuck with scheduled meet ups and such, well more so one of my friends because &lt;insert literally any excuse&gt;. It’s so ridiculous and stupid. Makes me feel annoyed and like I don’t even wanna be friends with him. 

Last Friday I ran a d&amp;d game and he decided to not show up. Granted, he had real life issues going on like how he needed a class for school and the school wasn’t responding to him. That’s awful, but he said it was like that all summer. We even hung out that day from 2am to 5am and such. So out of all days he has to do it then. Well, so what does he do? MORE emails and shit. So explain why he had to miss the game? He tells me the next day he’ll have to go pester them in person, which would’ve been my first thought as to why he had to miss. Idk why he couldn’t email and do the game then reply mid game if need be.

Real quick, I know it sounds pretty selfish and I think so too, but in my defense my game was cancelled the week prior and left me upset and then this friend who cancelled this time was like “yeah it’d suck if someone cancelled again”. And then he does. At last minute. We still played a minor session to keep stuff going but he is known for cancelling stuff or having complications last minute, every time. 

But now we do raid nights in a game on Tuesdays and recently I guess he decided (or just told us) that Tuesdays he does something else now, but can be here. Not a huge deal but this is kinda draining me a lot lately since I’m closer to this guy than anyone else in the group, and when this guy is constantly changing shit then acts like “no you CANNOT feel mad about this” it’s so annoying to hear his entitled crap.

Onto the second main point, due to these reasons and many others with the friend group, I sometimes think I should leave it, but idk if I can or should. Just so tired of two of them not liking me being myself because “sex is cringe” (which I’m not partaking, just making jokes), one of them barely talks to me, and the other is a double-edged sword (super fun and understanding, unless he has an issue then he’s an emotional and “logical” brick wall and it’s always your fault).

I also have had my mental health taken a toll on me due to covid, disinterest in my d&amp;d games, not having a job, and more recently losing my father to cancer. I don’t know much about being an adult but it seems like people only offer empty promises or are just assholes.

Due to all that, I’m starting to think about training myself to stop thinking myself as a person, and instead train myself to see myself as a tool. I don’t exist outside of helping people, I just do bare minimum to survive. That’s about how worthy I feel right now. So I’m probably gonna start doing that.

If I should leave my friends, I wouldn’t know how to do it and they’ll ask for evidence which I don’t have because they have poor memories and I do too sometimes. I don’t know how to bring it up, but it might be for the best I guess. Only other options is to think I’m a tool and not a person which will justify all their actions. How they like and value my opinions until I’m against them, how they never talk about my game but will talk for days and days about their own games, how they don’t vent about things looking for advice or council, only to say their views and wanting me to 100% agree with them.

I wish I wasn’t afraid of pain, then I would just kill myself. My life has little value or worth. Even if others care, they don’t show it well or maybe my brain is just bad at perceiving their love and care. I just always thought friends are there for you and ask you how you’re doing and such, but I’m always the one to initiate those conversations over text. Anyway even if others care, I think it’s my right to choose if I die or not. It’s the fucking least choice they could grant me at this point.

I don’t know what to do, please help. I can also answer further questions down below. Sorry for jumbled ideas and text, my brain always gets fuzzy when I talk about my issues as it tries to grab at everything I feel I can’t tell to people in my life.",01Sep2020,1
7,"One aspect of my life that I've noticed causes me a lot of problems is my ability to manage expectation and being able to change and adapt to situations whether it’s small or large.

It affects my mental health and I understand that it's a part of me, something I need some help to perhaps understand more and deal with better.

So I'll give you a couple of real life examples.

We go out for a meal, I'm told the restaurant serves food like roast dinners. So I get to the restaurant with my family, they were serving roast dinners until an hour before we arrived. I was expecting a roast and built it up my head and got disappointed.

It's such a non-problem, it really doesn't matter at all, they had plenty of food. (they did serve me the incorrect meal) but it really doesn't matter. What I should be focused on is that I had an okay meal with my parents and i’m lucky to be going out with all this pandemic nonsense.

Okay another example. I've built in an expectation of myself, I’ve worked as an assistant manager, I've done warehousing, I've owned my own successful business. I currently work for a diy retail chain. I came in at sales assistant level (because I didn't need the hours). I'm now a supervisor.

I've been working my butt off to become an assistant manager, hopefully moving up to Branch manager. But it feels like I'm being held back at every turn by management that doesn't see how hard I'm working, going above and beyond and really going hard for that promotion. (Or to at least be on the in-store course to get me too that level).

I've had conversations which the store manager, we’ve spoke about it plenty of times. But over the year I've been putting everything in, nothing ever comes up and it's getting me down. 

Maybe I should be managing my expectation a little better. Maybe what I think is the problem, just because I know where I want to be and I know how hard I push myself, it's not on the cards.

Another example...

I plan a day trip with a friend, on the day we are going, they cancel because of the weather. It did give me a blip of rage but it's okay it's not a problem we’ll reschedule.

Reschedule for the next day, ”okay we’re supposed to be going this way John”. Then the reply ”Ah I forgot to tell you, we’re going to this city instead, it’s nicer”

I didn't say anything to them. Inside I was a mess. I can't handle change like that, especially not on route when it's happening. If i’d have had perhaps a days warning, i’d have gotten over it.

Instead the entire trip was ruined for me because I couldn't get past the fact that the destination had changed with so little regard for my feelings.

If I could have let it go, I would have enjoyed myself. There was nothing technically wrong with the day. It was just decimated in about 10 seconds.

Perhaps I should have said something, but why invoke a conflict over something that didn't matter.

I hope I'm not the only one like this. I don't mean to be selfish or spoiled or ungrateful. I'm very happy for the things I have, the people around me who support me. I just feel like I'm having bad days because I cannot adapt to change or manage expectation.",01Sep2020,1

Warning: a lot of this is aimless venting, sorry

I’m sitting alone in my bed, in my shitty room in a shitty house in a shitty neighborhood. I’m 21 years old, working the same job I’ve been working since high school. I dropped out of college and I only have a year’s worth of credits towards a degree. All my friends are already graduating and I’m 3 years away from a degree. 

I’ve spent the last three years in a horrifying manic depressive state, triggered when I was 18 and about to graduate high school. I’ve never had a girl/boyfriend for more than a few months, I’ve only had maybe 3 real friends my entire life. 

I spent endless hours alone in my basement playing video games instead of socializing. I had really bad social anxiety and self esteem issues after being violently bullied, and borderline molested, by 8th graders while I was in 6th grade. So, I shut down and didn’t put myself out there. 

I had a group of people I hung out with, but I was never really friends with any of them. I always felt a little more sensitive and emotional than them, so I felt out of place. Nothing against them: they were just different people than me I guess. 

I never got to be close with anyone. I never got to be what I wanted to be: someone who’s there for people, who looks after and loves them. I wanted to make relationships with other sensitive/artistic types, but I was paralyzed by fear of judgement and rejection. I’d have casual acquaintances I really liked and talked to often, but I never pushed anything further into a friendship or relationship. 

So, I went off to college, only 15 minutes from my hometown: manically depressed, feeling like I was in constant danger. The first year went by in a blur. I failed half my classes and dropped out early. Did the same first semester of my sophomore year. At that point I was suspended from the University. I had a disastrous, embarrassing relationship with a high school friend and crush, where my depression caused me to behave erratically, and now she’s afraid to be near me. 

I basically spent another 6 months teetering on the brink of suicide. Then, I slowly started getting better. I don’t really remember how it happened, but by the following spring(2019), I was feeling *not horrible*. I decided I wanted to go on a really adventurous trip. I spent the summer saving up and went on a 2 month backpacking trip. I had some great experiences, and some shitty experiences. Then, I got home. It was traumatizing to be back in my hometown, where all that shitty stuff happened to me, after forgetting about my life for 2 months. My depression came back in waves. Some days were okay, others were bad. I went back to my old job, and I was back in the rut. That’s where I find myself now. 

I just don’t want to be weighed down with regrets. I want to move forward in my life and not look back. How might I do that? Thank you.",01Sep2020,1

20,"to **suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, depersonalizaing, etc.** (this is a depression thread so I'm sure it's expected but I thought I'd mention it just in case.) 

Hi. I'm not quite sure why I am writing this I just had a very emotionally exhausting moment and I think I just need someone to hear me because I feel like I don't get that a lot. For context, I'm 19/F and about mid June I had a bit of an overwhelming experience with shrooms, nothing traumatic, nothing visually frightening at all. Honestly all that happened was that I had a panic attack and it was a bit emotionally unsettling. I figured I would be fine in the morning and everything would go back to normal but instead I had a bit of a depersonalization/derealization episode that extended itself for quite a while. I started seeing a licensed psychologist as a result and really started reassessing my morals and values. In the beginning, it was absolute hell. Continous panic attacks, depressive episodes, etc. and I felt immense guilt about the ""root"" of how it was triggered because I was raised in quite a conservative, religious family that is really against all that stuff. 

Over time, I familiarized myself with what the disorder was and my days got lighter and times got easier. I'm not 100% yet but I am way way better than I was to begin with (it's been about two months). In fact, I think in terms of my values I'm better than I was before it all happened. It motivated me to get back enrolled in college and focus on my future and prioritize myself more and to stop doing drugs and drinking alcohol and basically wasting my life away. Completely changed my idea of what I wanted from myself and the kind of people I wanted to surround myself with. You might be reading this and asking what the issue could possibly be then but the truth is where I've had a lot of room for improvement I've also had a lot of room for criticizing myself. 

Back when I was in middle school/high school I suffered pretty intensely from depression and suicidal tendencies, eating disorders, etc. and I was able to reabilitate myself back into a state of what I guess I thought was self satisfaction and joy. It seems however after everything has happened I've had a bit of relapse back into my depression and have been experiencing anxiety (which has been getting better over time). It isn't all the time, in fact, more than not I've been pretty okay and distracting myself with things to do. 

But when the sinking feeling comes it is quite overwhelming. It starts as fear and intrusive thoughts about everything I experienced that are pretty irrational and obsurd (for example: i messed up my brain, weird existential stuff, typical depersonalization thoughts) but I guess it's just a part of the depersonalizing/derealization recovery process. However, after the fear passes a really deep depression kind of overcomes me where I just feel like I get suicidal not because I want to die (which is how it was when I was a kid) but instead that I feel suicidal because I feel like I ***have*** to die. In fact, I don't want to die at all, I want to live to be able to experience all my joys and dreams but when these moments come it feels like I dont even have that option. It feels like death is all there is in store for me when ironically I am quite afraid of death. 

 It's like a feeling of my soul being claustraphobic within my body. I've also come to realize that I have quite an issue with the sensations of immense loneliness, escapism, and grounding. I honestly don't even know what I'm asking at this point, I guess I just wanted to get it out. Although my therapist is extremely helpful and wise I can't get in direct contact with him when I go through these moments and I have a loving and supportive family (except for my older brother but I know he cares hes just bad with his words) I feel too guilty to go to them with my stuff because I've always kind of been the ""troubled"" one in the family. 

I have little to no friends after everything too because I realized that they never actually cared about me and that they weren't the group I wanted to surround myself given that I feel like I'm a worse person when I'm around them. At the end of the day, it just feels like I have no one. And with this whole quarantine situation I can't even go out and meet people and it's all so incredibly lonely and sad. I can't help but feel guilt towards my past, I can't stop criticizing myself, and I never knowingly experienced anxiety to a point that it was an issue so this is all new sensations. I just want to be happy, normal me again (but better) and be in a position to be able to use my new found wisdom from my experiences to guide myself to a better position but sometimes it feels like I'll never get to that point.",01Sep2020,1
21,I need support I don't know if this has happened to anyone else but I was with my boyfriend for 5 years and he broke it off with me and said he didn't love me anymore. Said that we could find people who like each others personalities better. Well hindsight is always 20/20 I guess and after going to therapy over the break up my therapist explained to me that I've probably been depressed since about October. Boyfriend told me when he broke up with me that he probably hasn't really loved me since the December January area. So now I'm just feeling even worse. Like it's all my fault and if I had gotten help sooner (I couldn't have afforded it til recently anyway) that he would still be here. I stopped having any motivation to do things or clean or take care of myself. Not getting enough sleep. Getting upset or frustrated over nothing. And he stopped loving me before I even realized what was happening because I've never been depressed before. So now I just hate myself even more than I did before. Has anyone ever felt this way?

My dad passed away over a year ago and my mom remarried 6 months ago. My mom's husband wants to spend every minute with my mom, and he has even told me that he thinks God wants them to be constantly together. What bullshit. Anyways, I work with my brother at varying times most weekdays but my mom/stepdad (as much as I hate that word) require that I work 100% a full two days every week. It isn't the work that bothers me or my brother. He's not even very hard to take care of tbh most of the time. It's the way my mom/stepdad mostly isolate me on those days. I strongly think it was the stepdad's idea b/c it wasn't like this before. They will barely even talk to me at all or anything. They say they ""need their complete break from him"". But they can't seem to get through their heads that they are always together and have each other constantly for company/support and I have to go w/o that for 2 days straight every week. I'm sure at least some people would think this is nothing but I am in so much emotional turmoil. I have been anxious and depressed and am scared I might be having a nervous breakdown or something. It is at the point now where I want to cry all the time at home and am scared to even be home. I just visited my bf (25M) who lives 2 hours away and I notice I don't really even get a trace of anxiety/depression there but when I get home it comes right back to stay until I leave. It feels like hell. I'm honestly scared I might break any moment and have to go to a mental hospital or something. My mom feels bad that I cry so much and am miserable but still is ignorant about what they're doing to me. My stepdad basically just cares about having his 2 days of total alone time with my mom and thinks I just want attention or to escape responsibilities. He even mostly wants to be alone with my mom on most other days too. I make $20 an hour at my job but idk if it's worth it anymore. I pay $900 per month in rent. My stepdad has no job or income. He is not trying to find any either. He just wants to mooch off us and be with my mom every damn second like it's his right. Please help, thank you...

I just joined this subreddit because I really need the help and motivation to stay alive. I've struggled with depression most of my life, but the past 4 years it has gotten worse. I've been taking meds for 4+ years and have been in therapy for 12 years. I'm just so tired, lonely, feel absolutely worthless and like I'm a waste of space. I'm doing everything I can to keep myself busy and try to be happy, but I can't seem to be truly happy. I feel like people are better off without me around.

37,"I have 2 cats, a dog, a bearded dragon, and a couple fish. They're all well cared for, but I know I could be doing better. The only two pets I had when I moved into this apartment was the one cat and my dog. Since then, the stay kitten came asking for help one night. She's had her shots, been spayed, has flea and tick treatments... the works. All are well fed, bathed monthly (sometimes more often if my dog get in mud or whatever), and my bearded dragon has all the bugs, fruit, and veggies his heart desires. He was also a rescue, sort of. Long story. My fish were a new years gift because I had been wanting something with water to make sound, something peaceful I could sit and watch when I'm feeling anxious. Their tank is clean, they're well fed, they have plants. 


And yet, I feel like I should have more to offer them. My dog seems sad. My beardie seems bored. I feel like I have a lot on my plate suddenly. I know I'm doing a good job, but why do I feel guilty? I feel like my dog should have a yard to run in. My beardie and fish should have bigger enclosures. My cats should also be safe to run free in a yard. I don't know. Maybe I'm projecting my feelings of feeling trapped onto them. The weather here got colder suddenly. It's been grey and cloudy. My second term of classes started. The country I live in feels full of selfish people, I feel like the whole world is this cruel selfish place. I know I need to go back to therapy, but I don't have the money or insurance. 


If someone's out there reading this, its okay. If you relate to this, you're not alone. You don't need to reach out and reassure me everything going to be okay. I just hope someone gets that feeling of ""yeah, me too"" and feels less alone and isolated in their feelings.

38,"This last year has been hard. I moved literally to the other side of the world (from the US to Taiwan) to pursue my Masters degree last year. Due to COVID I wasn't able to go home this summer. At the same time, I've never felt worse in my life. There's just a feeling of hopelessness and sadness that I can't get over. When I was in the US it was there, but I was always able to move past the depression. But here, it's not been possible. There's a constant sadness and hollowness that I've felt for the last three months or so that I can't shake. A constant feeling of despair and ""nothing will matter and you will always be a failure"" had haunted me. I can't get over it. And, instead of even trying, I just drink to try and ignore it. But, it doesn't work. 

I love it here. I love the friends I've made here and have some very close friends. But, this feeling won't go away and it's killing me (metaphorically). I can't get over it and it isn't going away. I want to reach out for help, but I can't. I was always taught that men don't ask for help or show emotions and it's led to me.trying to bury it all. But it keeps getting worse. 

In the past, I've always gotten over these lows, but now I feel I can't and it's destroying me and I'm scared. I don't even know how to ask for help at this point and I don't know what to do. Drinking myself to sleep doesn't help and I'm too scared to ask for help, but I need it.

 \- I really hate myself. I beat myself up both mentally and physically when I get something wrong, and I never feel happy about anything I try.   


\- I believe to an extreme that everyone hates me and wants to avoid me because I'm some sort of idiot and socially awkward with no defining personality, and that no one loves me, not even my parents.  


\- I just want to die sometimes to see how people would react, but I'm too chicken to find a way to kill myself, so I'm stuck in a limbo of wanting to slit my throat and stay alive.   


\- I'm constantly hating on myself for venting, discussing, or even thinking I have problems, because I literally have no reason to hate myself, and even my own dad has told me I'll grow out of my ""anxiety"". So therefore, I'm faking it for clout, so I beat myself up for faking it for clout, then think ""Why the fuck am I beating myself up? I have no reason unless I'm depressed"". And then the cycle loops over and over and over again.  


\- I only have one real friend, and he's probably moving away to Oregon sometime in the next year, and everyone else hates me. The only people I can hold long conversations with besides my one friend are people on the internet.   


\- I'm afraid for my future because I know it's inevitable I'm going to end up working a boring 9-5 job with no social life alone in my apartment.   


\- I just don't know what to do. My dad has told me that these feelings I have I'll grow out of, so I should know that they're temporary, yet I refuse to believe that. Am I actually depressed? Am I acting like a one-dimensional Netflix teenager, who's a drama queen?",01Sep2020,1

I haven't told anyone other than two close friends that I have depression, and I don't think most people I know would understand or believe me. My mom especially would be against medicating, and that hurts more than anything right now. My two friends are super supportive and loving and they've both had experience with mental illness, and I can't be more thankful for them, but it's still hard to rationalize medication to myself.

47,"How do I get better and also maintain the better?

I’m 19. I live with my father - we don’t really have a relationship with each other, which is okay, but this means I can’t really rely on him for any support beyond that of shelter. I have a partner, and she is wonderful, but she’s frequently upset with me because of my tendency to go on long drug binges and behave degenerately. I don’t have many friends, I used to, but they’re gone, and lately I’ve questioned how much depth the friendships really had, because I’ve realized that I can’t seem to emotionally attach to other people the way that other people do. Reality feels different for me, I think. 

 I’ve lived a certain way for a long time. I have no inner autobiographical narrative of my life, so I can’t be sure, but I think I’ve been living the same day over and over again for some years now.

In the morning, if my sleep was okay, I eat breakfast, take my medication (concerta for adhd and Wellbutrin for anxiety), and then I spend the entire day in a daydreamy haze, seemingly unable to steer myself toward any goal. Then, I drink and spend a few hours falling asleep. My lifestyle is also VERY sedentary. I probably spend about half an hour each day actually standing up or in a sitting position, the rest of the time I’m laying on my bed. Sometimes I socialize, which leaves me ruminating for days after. Sometimes I abuse my medication and spend days awake, and sometimes I binge other drugs. I have difficulty in adequately expressing just how empty I feel every day.

I don’t blame people for not believing how bad it is. I mean - how can I possibly be this miserable, and empty, and yet completely content? How can I almost be in my 20’s and still dedicate years to ruminating over what happened to me in elementary school?

So - to the point of the post. How do I get better and then maintain betterness? It took me months to even add breakfast to my daily “routine”. I haven’t given up though, I still feel that somehow I will discover my true talent and I’ll have the will to dedicate myself to it obediently. I’ve also been hoping that something catastrophic happens, perhaps some near-death experience that will give me the jolt I need to really start living my life. I’m sometimes upset at myself for lacking the will to stage some dramatic suicide attempt, because it goes without saying that I can’t just go to the hospital or some clinic and beg them to treat me - it has to be more severe, or they won’t believe it.",01Sep2020,1
48,"I am 20F. I struggle to connect and relate and talk to people. I believe this is because when I was younger, I found out that my dad sexually abused my older half sister. My mom decided to stay with him despite that fact. So growing up with that knowledge was awkward and uncomfortable. I would talk to people online, my dad somehow found out and told me never to talk about our family’s life. So I didn’t. I went all through high school without many friends. I wasn’t bullied or anything but I just didn’t talk. Couldn’t find a way to relate. I’ve never really cared for celebrities or TV shows, movies, musicians, all these basic things that everyone seems to connect on. I’ve always been an artist. Creating visually pleasing things has come naturally to me for as long as I can remember. I felt that college was a ridiculous scam. So I decided that I wanted to be a tattoo artist. After I graduated high school, I spent a year working at a tshirt shop. It ended kind of badly. So after that I decided to go ahead and pursue tattooing. I found myself at a shop in the city willing to take me on and teach me. A month in, my mentor came forward to me about feelings he had. I personally found myself very comfortable around him and able to connect in certain ways. So we started talking more personally. I admired his passion, strength, outgoing nature. He had a lot of qualities I wish I had in myself. After about 3 months, It lead to us moving in together. I had a lot of doubts, but he always reassured me. We have spent our time working together to improve the tattoo shop, our skills, our art, which is a dynamic of our relationship I really enjoy. I like working here, and my coworkers I think they are overall good people. However, I think I have horribly underestimated my anxiety. You see, my boyfriend is 27 years older than me. I didn’t have a problem with it at first. Boys my age have always proven disappointing and just.. dumb to me. And there’s plenty of attraction between us. The sex is amazing. Anyways, there is a huge stigma around dating such an older man. I am rather empathetic and I can feel all of the judgements around me. There’s also not a lot of room for anxiety in the tattoo business. I can do good tattoos, I just get real overwhelmed. I start to question if I am cut out for this job or this relationship. I feel like I’m losing my sense of identity. I don’t know what I want. I have let my boyfriend totally sleeve up my arm. So if I decided tattooing wasn’t for me, finding a job is now going to be that much harder. Sometimes I really think that the relationship I’m in never should have happened. I should have just stayed his friend, and this would have been a lot easier. But I didn’t. I wish that I was stronger and could just be myself and feel free. But I’m not. It has been almost a year and I have not connected to anyone else around me like I wish that I could. I can’t say that would be any different if I wasn’t in the relationship I am in, but it definitely doesn’t make it easier. I just don’t know what to do. I can continue this relationship despite my misery in hope that things will get better. Or go off somewhere else, probably just to find more struggle to connect. The thought of leaving really scares me, because I would really prefer not to mooch on my parents anymore. And I have no friends. There’s no telling where I would go. Not to mention... the world is so painfully obviously ruled by corruption. It’s just getting harder and harder for me to feel like I belong here at all.

57,"Over the course of 2/3 weeks my depression has skyrocketed astronomically, I am even surprised how bad it has been. I went from being mildly depressed and anxious in mid August, and my condition gets worse and worse every day. For example, I was in such a low mood I could not even taste the food I was eating, and became significantly more tired and did not want to get out of bed. I also get very bad pain relating to anxiety such as heart pain and feverish symptoms (feeling too cold)

Family life at home is a pitiful state of affairs, and I don't have any friends or acquaintances to contact. Everyone has drifted away from me.

I know most people resort to drugs and drink to get by, but if I ever decided to start I would have already signed my death warrant the moment I started putting that drug in my mouth, I know I would never stop. I am tempted to start trying them however so that I could enter into a clinic and get help and somebody to talk to, but I feel like if I do that, I'll die or get kicked out whenever I finished my course of treatment, causing me to start again. I am expected to do well in life but if I start drugs I will end any prospects.

I have no friends online or offline, I don't and I long for contact. I don't really want to contact a counsellor, I feel like they are only there to take my money and give me basic advice. Oh what I would do for somebody to listen to me, I am such a bad communicator, when people talk to me I become very slow and I don't get the point across, they leave me shortly. My heart really aches, and I can't even bear the brunt of my pain with drink or with anti-depressants.

Warning: a lot of this is aimless venting, sorry

I’m sitting alone in my bed, in my shitty room in a shitty house in a shitty neighborhood. I’m 21 years old, working the same job I’ve been working since high school. I dropped out of college and I only have a year’s worth of credits towards a degree. All my friends are already graduating and I’m 3 years away from a degree. 

I’ve spent the last three years in a horrifying manic depressive state, triggered when I was 18 and about to graduate high school. I’ve never had a girl/boyfriend for more than a few months, I’ve only had maybe 3 real friends my entire life. 

I spent endless hours alone in my basement playing video games instead of socializing. I had really bad social anxiety and self esteem issues after being violently bullied, and borderline molested, by 8th graders while I was in 6th grade. So, I shut down and didn’t put myself out there. 

I had a group of people I hung out with, but I was never really friends with any of them. I always felt a little more sensitive and emotional than them, so I felt out of place. Nothing against them: they were just different people than me I guess. 

I never got to be close with anyone. I never got to be what I wanted to be: someone who’s there for people, who looks after and loves them. I wanted to make relationships with other sensitive/artistic types, but I was paralyzed by fear of judgement and rejection. I’d have casual acquaintances I really liked and talked to often, but I never pushed anything further into a friendship or relationship. 

So, I went off to college, only 15 minutes from my hometown: manically depressed, feeling like I was in constant danger. The first year went by in a blur. I failed half my classes and dropped out early. Did the same first semester of my sophomore year. At that point I was suspended from the University. I had a disastrous, embarrassing relationship with a high school friend and crush, where my depression caused me to behave erratically, and now she’s afraid to be near me. 

I basically spent another 6 months teetering on the brink of suicide. Then, I slowly started getting better. I don’t really remember how it happened, but by the following spring(2019), I was feeling *not horrible*. I decided I wanted to go on a really adventurous trip. I spent the summer saving up and went on a 2 month backpacking trip. I had some great experiences, and some shitty experiences. Then, I got home. It was traumatizing to be back in my hometown, where all that shitty stuff happened to me, after forgetting about my life for 2 months. My depression came back in waves. Some days were okay, others were bad. I went back to my old job, and I was back in the rut. That’s where I find myself now. 

I just don’t want to be weighed down with regrets. I want to move forward in my life and not look back. How might I do that? Thank you.",01Sep2020,1
59,"Hey everyone,  it's me cooper again... so I found out my girlfriend has been talking to other guys and even fucked her doctor. I'm losing my god damn mind and I'm afraid that I might do something stupid. I honestly ran out of ideas on what to calm me down or even make me happy anymore... maybe I am just a waste of space and is better off just jumping off a damn building at some point, who knows really. At this point I give up and is open for any tips or questions ect ect . 
Thank you for reading my stupid story or whatever and sorry for wasting your time

60,"Why are you upset? Tired? Hungry? Bored? Restless?  Need the toilet? Had too many sweets and now you feel sick/ anxious?

Often I have no idea why I am upset and then I realise it's just cos of something simple. 
Just before typing this j was crying my eyes out cos missed my family. I do, but I'm also I credibly tired and it's late. I know I'll feel even just a little better in the morning. 

Yesterday I got hit with existential dread at work. I wondered why until I remembered all I had drank that day was soda. I drank some water and felt loads better for the rest of the day. 

Baby steps! We're depression stems from the tiniest things. Even if you can knock off 5% sadness from drinking water instead of coke, it'll add up and you'll feel better xxx

Stay strong my dudes. Sending love to you all x",01Sep2020,1
