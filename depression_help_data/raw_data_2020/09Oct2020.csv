5,"Hi. I've had a friend who's been opening up to me alot about how she's been feeling and she hasn't been good. I'll try and paint as great of a picture as I can in order for you to understand what she's been through. Right now she's in a high school about 20 mins away from me. We met back in February but have been hanging out a lot more since around August.

From what she's told me, she started to notice that she was feeling down about three years ago, and she largely ignored it. Over the past year, she's felt increasingly helpless and empty and has attempted suicide once, which was around a year ago. 

Her main symptoms lineup incredibly well with depression: Constant feelings of emptiness, helplessness, loss of enjoyment in hobbies, as well as inability to focus at times and generally feeling down.

Her family haven't helped at all. Her parents don't believe that her issues are real or can be treated, and don't take her seriously at all. Even when she told her parents about her suicide attempt, they brushed it off. She's mentioned seeking therapy and getting medications for her problems, but her parents believer that therapy is a scam and won't be worth it. According to her, they just say that she'll go to hell if she kills herself and that's it. So there's a 99.9% chance that's out of the picture

She's tried almost every generic depression or anxiety coping method. She's done exercise, ate healthy, focused on hobbies that she legitimately enjoys, various time management methods, etc. When we've talked, every suggestion I could think of she's already tried and seen little to no success.

I know what it's like to go through this, and I don't want her to just suffer for the rest of her life. With therapy and meds being the only things she hasn't tried, and those seem impossible to get for her, I'm running out of suggestions for her. I care about her and want her to feel better but it's incredibly frustrating when I don't know how to help her. Her school counselors haven't helped either. It seems like it's just me and her who care enough to help her. I don't know what to do.

If you have any suggestions or questions, I would greatly appreciate it if you would post them in the comments and we can discuss them. Thank you so much for reading.",09Oct2020,1
6,"Hey, I don't know who's gonna read this, but I am in a lot of pain. I am 20, Asian and a guy. First of all I like to start out by saying that my family hates me. They think I am a waste of space and that I didn't deserve to live with them because I'm lazy and unmotivated all because I told them that I wanted to become a streamer. So they kicked me out and currently  I live on my own but with 1 roommate. and the worst part is that We both recently got fired due to us living close to an hour away from work and we were struggling to make it to work on time, I'm a college drop out because I spent most of my time focusing on my work and trying to get money just to live. I hate working at retail cuz it makes me regret working everyday I wake up, and my dream is to be a streamer anyway. I always wanted to be a streamer because I love video games and I miss having people to talk to because I always feel so alone but honestly nobody watches my streams so I barely get to stream because I don't make enough to even try to go into full time streaming... My girlfriend is leaving me because I can't afford to keep my apartment and she basically told me to give up on streaming and that I'll never get anywhere doing it. I spend most of my waking hours trying to apply to another job but I'm getting nowhere... I can't pay my bills, or my rent this month and my girlfriend left me... I feel like I'm on my last legs.. I want to continue streaming but maybe she's right and that I wont go anywhere with it. I don't know where to go and I dont know what to do. I'm probably going to get evicted soon because I cant pay rent... Please someone help me.",09Oct2020,1

9,"Hello, so over the past year I’ve been having bi polar like tendencies (no actual diagnosis) where one day, hour, minute I’ll be ok and content with life the next I’ll just loose all self worth, and motivation for everything. This has been a long lasting emotional struggle for me, and near the end of 2019 I broke up with the girl I thought was “the one”, and it hit me hard cause it blindsided me. Thankfully I’ve talked myself out of hurting or attempting to hurt myself but I still have these swings. Was wondering what y’all have done or doing to help yourself improve?",09Oct2020,1
10,Currently its 3:33 am and I cant stop crying. I went through my first depression episode 2 years ago and I knew there was a chance of it coming back but I didnt expect it to hit this hard. It's like I'm realizing new fears and anxieties. I know my family and friends are here for me but somehow its feels like I'm alone. I'm scared that I'm alone. And because I'm scared of being alone I'm scared to ask for help. I dont want to be a burden. I put everyone through enough last time and I dont want to do it again. I feel stuck. I dont want people to tip toe around me anymore. I feel isolated and I know it's my fault but I cant break out of it. I'm scared.,09Oct2020,1

12,"I’m having a few weeks of feeling fine and then a week of feeling absolutely depressed. I’d say about a third of the time the past couple of months I’ve been feeling crap. 

Is this normal? I’ve upped my meds, seeing a therapist regularly, keep going to uni to keep myself busy. Why does it keep coming back?

Are these episodes going to get less severe/frequent/long? Has anyone experience depression in this episodic way? 

I have to say this latest episode wasn’t out of nowhere. There were obvious triggers and it’s not as bad as last time (I can force myself out of bed a bit easier this time). But I want this to end. I can’t go on the rest of my life like this.",09Oct2020,1
13,"Here to rant a bit, my depression is high. Again.
I miss when I could genuinely enjoy things, major depression/anxiety is such an idiotically high stat of mine, why, it should have capped off ages ago you think? 

Rewind 10+ years when I saw all of this starting, but fought to support someone who was grateful, but also dealt with their baggage and my own, alongside a completely ungrateful clod. A rant I won't go into for the fury does not need stoking. If the grateful see this, this post is not anger at them.

Too often these days, I force myself to feel, because all that rumbles in my core is detachment. I have no interest in the reality that surrounds me.  I try and try not to be selfish, but battling myself is so hard, and existence under all this rebounding pressure is hardest of all. Especially when all I want to do is create- but that's not logical, because the world runs on money, and I run on, and on, and on, boring deeper into the ground in depressing monotonous circles until I 'get over it', or succumb and crumble. Society is broken, and creative peoples starve into the palms of overwhelming corporate businesses.

I know I'm not the only one who feels like this, but the words echoed in the brain chamber, no matter how I parry them, are terribly alienating. Tried talking to someone about it in person and was told that the only one stopping me is me. Perhaps that view would make sense if the planet wasn't run by currency hogs that stifle creativity.

The thought of being alone for a long, long time so that I can heal is so very appealing. 

How do you keep on going?

Sorry if this is the wrong place, for not elaborating too much on some subjects, or seeming curt or scattered. Revisiting memories just invoked frustration that I had to brush off while typing. Hope this doesn't sound like a shallow, massive complaint. Thanks for reading",09Oct2020,1

16,"Here are five things you could do if you are experiencing symptoms of depression while working remotely: [**5 Things To Do When You’re Too Depressed To Work**](https://www.workingden.com/too-depressed-to-work/)

* **Get Help**  
During quarantine, many counselors have seen patients via virtual consultations (Zoom meetings). Your doctor or psychiatrist may also prescribe you with medication to help you.
* **Practicing Mindfulness and Meditation**  
Meditation is the practice of training your awareness and attention by setting your focus on one task.  
Mindfulness is a form of meditation, it is the art of focusing solely on one task and acknowledging when distracting thoughts cross your mind without judging yourself and the thoughts, then bringing your focus back to the task at hand.
* **Journaling**  
Journaling will not only help to improve your writing skills, but also help to self-reflect, boost your memory, and help to manage and keep track of your thoughts, especially the negative ones.
* **Exercising**  
There are various online exercise regimes that you could follow from home, there are even downloading apps to help you get started with a routine, as well as free collections of home workouts.
* **Spending time with your family and friends**  
It’s important to surround yourself with people or loved ones who genuinely care about you and your well-being.",09Oct2020,1

18," So I'm a fan of the weeknd and I listen to blinding lights regularly. This morning I put the song on and it had a completely different tone. It sounded a little sharper and the synth was completely different, even though I was listening to the same download. I thought it might be my headphones, but it sounded the same on my phones speaker. Then I thought it might be something weird with my download, so I tried on my PC but it still sounded off.

Meanwhile I was walking I saw that a guy around age 20 was staring at me  like a pervert, I felt bad but I didn't say anything. I walked further..., then after some seconds I turned back and came to that guy and boldly asked  why he was staring at me, to that he replied who can even look at you, I was staring at my brother, when I clearly remember he was exactly staring at me with a creepy smile. I kept saying he was staring at me and he kept  denying.... Then I began to cry . Then two kind hearted people came to me and told me to stop crying and they said that he (that creepy guy) was a pervert and he did the same thing to their sister.

It’s getting colder and darker where i live already and i think i’m beginning to feel the effects. i feel really depressed, my anxiety feels worse, i feel slow, my appetite is going away, i randomly cry throughout the day, and i have no energy to talk to people. just last week i was feeling really good but last week was also sunny and very warm. What can I do to ease this a bit? I make sure to eat/drink enough throughout the day from healthy-ish food sources, I have a routine for my bedtime and I don’t get into bed until i’m going to sleep, I try to brush my teeth and shower daily, I make sure to open my window blinds as wide as possible, I keep my room as neat as possible, but i can’t get rid of this sinking pit of my stomach feeling.

25,"Hey I'm a physician from India and been suffering from moderate to severe clinical depression since last 4-5 years, on and off on meds (currently off) and currently also recovering from Covid-19. I have been in isolation for about a month now and it has been hell as most ppl would understand here. But still I coped up and have managed so far and expect to get out of isolation in next 3-4 days. Recently for last 4-5 days I have been pampering myself with good food and stuff like that so as to make it because before that I was extremely affected and suicidal thoughts weren't leaving my mind. Though we all know how much self motivation stuff works but still trying everyday is what we all do right? But still I was feeling like it's more of toxic positivity than helping one, having all these thoughts I spent last few days and I kind of just made peace with my thoughts yesterday that whatever it is I just have to bear for 5-6 days only now....so let's just hang on. No pun intended.

Anyway, coming to the main reason I'm posting this, I realised something this evening which I was facing whole day today. For no reason at all I wasn't able to focus on anything. Like we all know how that is a part and parcel of depression (and being a physician also I know how it works n all) BUT it was different this time!
The whole day I didn't realise that i was losing focus from things......like repeatedly doing same task again to realize that u have been doing it again n again.......i know that happens a lot normally too but this time it was like even after noticing, my brain actually didn't react to it......like everything that went on through-out the day kind of went subconsciously. It's like I was kind of disoriented the whole time. Not that I wasn't able to understand things, but kept losing my focus every few seconds, throughout the day without noticing. And you can guess that I'm in isolation so there's already not much I'm doing but still everything felt wierd when I noticed how I wasn't paying attention to anything throughout the day! I talked to friends on phone and while some of them noticed that I'm not paying attention to the conversations, I still wasn't noticing. Even while writing this I'm losing focus and writing and rewriting as best as I can to explain this but I don't think I'm able to. It's like my thoughts are fleeing (which I know how often they do) but this time mind is not really going anywhere, it's just blank or maybe I can't think what it's thinking. Idk

Will try to communicate with my psychiatrist asap, but hope someone here would atleast help me out if they ever experienced the same or similar situation.
Thanks

26,"For the record, I do not believe that you can just “stop being depressed”. I also don’t believe in “just think positive”, but I do to an extent. One habit I got into was trying to contradict the bad with the good. It didn’t even have to outweigh the bad. So for example, _ and _ happened, but my mom is cooking my favorite food tonight. I eventually found that this helped my mind start to value the good more and more. Eventually it got to a point where the good outweighed the bad (at least my mind thought it did) which is when I would consider I beat depression.

29," **\[TW: mention of suicidal thoughts\]**  
Hello everyone. I have posted this on r/DepressionRecovery so I thought I'd also give this subreddit a try. Firstly, if you take time out to read this, thank you so much! I will try to be as brief as possible, however I believe this might be quite a long post, so I apologize in advance. Also, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask for this type of advice, but here it goes:

For a bit of a background story, me (f24) and my boyfriend (m24) have been dating for a bit more than a year and a half, and he's without a doubt the love of my life. Literally couldn't think I'd ever love a person in this way. Whenever I think there's no possible way for me to fall even more in love with him, he proves me wrong. To me, he's the kindest most understanding and lovable person ever, and he is also the funniest. We have a very healthy, committed and happy relationship and he's changed my life for the better in ways I can't describe. He's my bestest friend and I wouldn't rather spending my life with anyone else, and he has expressed the same. If all goes well I'll be moving in with him soon, which we are very excited about.

However, he has been dealing with severe depression for years. I believe it started in his teens. This later evolved to things like alcohol abuse (he's been sober for a few weeks, and very committed to this, which I am so incredibly proud of) and suicidal thoughts. Recently we've had a few talks about this matter, after his depression started flaring up more often, especially when we're not together. He has always shown interest in getting better (despite sometimes feeling very hopeless), but he's not quite sure how. I have suggested therapy, but he's not really into that idea, which I respect. I have also suggested reading certain books, maybe learning more about depression and, through that, finding ways to cope and get better. And he agrees! Since his birthday is coming up, I'm going to be gifting him his favorite book series of all time (which he already knows of), but I also thought about gifting him a book related to depression and recovery.

**So, my question is:** what book/s has/have helped you with your depression and mental health in general? This goes for other resources like videos, movies, websites, articles, etc.

I'm aware that we're all different and that only certain things might work, and we're taking a step-by-step approach, tackling one thing at a time, as we go. In hopes this will help you help me, here are a few of the things he's been struggling with, that especially trigger his depression:  
\- uncertainty regarding financial stability, and the future in general;  
\- self-esteem issues regarding his image (struggles with self-love);  
\- feelings of irritation, anger and dread;  
\- being aware of the bad things going on in the world and feeling powerless;  
\- feeling not worth it/not enough (he has had suicidal thoughts, and expressed that the only reason he's been hanging on is because of me..);  
\- irregular sleeping schedule, poor diet, being indoors for too long (we've actually been tackling this and it makes a huge difference!);  
\- expressing the feeling of wanting to feel 'normal'.

I apologize for the very long post once again, and thank you if you've made it this far, I'm truly grateful. Any book that covers any of these struggles and/or depression in general would be really helpful. I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit to post this on or if I haven't used the right trigger warnings. I will do anything in my power to help him with whatever he's going through. I myself suffer from anxious episodes and panic attacks, so I know mental health can be a very complicated thing to address. Any help and suggestions would be appreciated. **Thank you for reading!**",09Oct2020,1

34,"A girl was very close with me and open day she removed me of socials at like 2am and around that time she had been different to how she used to be. She told me later that day she has depression, she started lying about things a lot I think she also lied about being in a hospital. She told me she was scared I would leave her like everyone else.

Since then she has been pushing me away and bringing me close. She has told me she doesn't want to get attached to me and she doesn't want it to be how we were even though she says that's how she wants it to be. I remember she said she was her happiest around when we were really close so since she started being different it's like things went downhill or something. She said she put me first and now when she puts herself first things crumble around her. 

The last few months she has been slowly fading out, she has also been talking to some other guy overseas also. I think that guy left her recently. But more recently she has been acting like a b**** I don't know why she wants to push me out of her life. She knows I've been there for her. She even backstabbed me with some person that I connected to her. When I try contacting her or someone else contacts her sometimes she makes a lie as if she doesn't know who this is or it's a new phone. Why does she make up so many lies when there's no need. I feel most of the time she just pushes me away so she doesn't have to talk about the truth about what she's done to me. She ended up leaving me on read a lot of time recently so when I did the same to her once or twice she didn't like it. I know it's good to move on and I've been trying that but she was a big part in my life and I miss the girl I used to know. Any advice on this situation??

36,"I've had struggles with depression before (years ago) to the point where I had was completely content with not being around anymore. Over time I got passed it and I started to think I had gotten away from it completely. Then relationships/marriage ending started dragging me back into that feeling, but I felt like I was more prepared for it that time so I really didn't feel as low as I did during my previous episode. However, now since I moved to a new place (which i always struggle with a little) with new people not really having a support system in place. I feel like I've been living 2 lives.

I know how terrible it feels to feel like there is no one around, but she. I get home. Everything changes. I can feel it almost as soon as I walk into my apartment. It's empty, quiet, and there is no one there, but me. I enjoy being alone a sometimes to recharge, but overtime I can tell that the only thing I can thing of is how hollow I feel. Like if someone saw me at home they wouldn't even believe I was the same person. I'm not happy, I'm not chipper. I just exist for the most part until I have to repeat it all the next day. I don't even feel like I really have anyway to fix it either. Besides trying to encourage people and be a happy person with others I'm afraid of actual connection because of past relationships. I always feel like my own self-destructive tendencies are better off if I just keep them to myself and not force others to deal with them. I just don't really know what I'm supposed to do.
