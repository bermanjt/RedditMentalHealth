10,"I cried in the lunchroom at school. I couldn't handle all the stress from school and the mental distress I feel on a daily basis.

I just grabbed my things and walked out of class, suprisingly no-one noticed, I bought a water and just sat at a lunch table and cried. The same things repeated in my head.

""How do you wake up every morning feeling miserable and tired everday, day after day after day after day"". 

""How long can you keep this up until you cave in to your misery?""

""You try and try and get your still a miserable sack of shit.""

I replied to my own thoughts. It seems like the way I keep myself going everyday is just my mindset that I need to keep going no matter how much it hurts, that things will get better.

I see so many of my peers and family members succumb to their demons, weither its drugs, self-harm, hiding themselves under a facade to fit in with people, and sex.

I don't want to be like the rest of my family, I want to break the pattern of dysfunction, my dad and aunt and uncle are the only normal family members.

I'm so depressed I so no purpose in living a self-destructive life. I'm to tired to dwell on things that I say to myself that make me hate myself. My answer to the thoughts at this point is just ""I know"".

I have been trying to talk more positively about myself, it works sometimes. I am trying to keep occupied, get sunlight, exercise, they help, its no cure but then again nothing is.

 That's the thing about this whole dreaded process of recovery to dumb it down it is simply about ""Are you willing to take the chance of a better tomorrow by waking up the next morning, but also risk the chance of the demons taking another piece of your humanity?""

It's like a game of tennis and you're the ball.

12,"  I find it difficult to start the day. Not every single day. Some are harder than other days. Sometimes i feel like its so much that i have to take take it a step at a time .  like get out of bed. Then brush teeth. Theen feed myself. 

  I want to be happy to be alive. Im do not feel that. I feel kind of mopey i guess would be the word.i act mopey. Laying on couch alot, probably have a sad/ pout expression on my face. I want to be excited to start the day, but i dont know how to get from this point to that point.( mopey to exicted ) 

Im on a anti depressants/ anti anxiety pill. I also have hypothyroidism. In case anyone was going to bring either up. 

My life is not super horrible. Its okay ish. I have a place to sleep and i have family trying to help me. But i just feel unmotivated and without passion . i feel like a car running on fumes . im trying to change and improve things, by socializing more to get out off the home. 

 I've felt kinda down for a while now. Ive been socializing more than i used to. Ive been going to different activies and such to keep busy, i go and socialize with people on average about 2 a week sometimes 3, but i feel like something a missing. I dint feel satisfied or happy. I know feelings of hapines can come and go. I mean like a overall happy of ones life. I Dont feel that.

19,I will be graduating college in less than two months and I feel like I have done nothing. I’m 22 and a virgin (never had a girlfriend/been in love either) and it’s eating me up. I’m scared to ask girls out now because I’ll be embarrassed when I have to tell them I’m a virgin at this age and it looks like I’ll stay one for the rest of my life. College is a time when people have fun and sleep around and date but my anxiety prevented me from having the confidence to get into romantic relationships. People in high school used to make fun of me and call me a retard and loser and said I will never get girls. My parents were super strict before college and rarely let me go out with friends which stunted my confidence. I have partied in college and done drugs but I rarely had fun. I keep having mood swings that take a while to go away and there are moments where I feel a bleak despair for the future. I also don’t have a job lined up after I graduate and I think I will be wage slaving for the rest of my life.,07Mar2020,1
20,"
My girlfriend is going through a bad phase in life.  Her personal problems, family crises and and things going on between us all affects her but at the moment, more than any of those things, what really affects her is something that’s more like a traumatic reminiscence. 

There’s a feminist movement going on in our country and there’s sort of a social media riot going on which affects her mental peace too much. There’s this growing hate around and it all reminds her of all that events she has been through. Anti feminists insulting her, harassments and blackmailings she has received from different people.  

This all is affecting her so much right now and she is feeling too depressed. I feel helpless as to what to even do. Like, she wants something different happening, talking about and being engaged in something otherwise than that. 

Is there any way I can help her feel distracted from all those depressing thoughts and shift her mind to something apart from that? She isn’t into small talks at all. Just wants to feel engaged for some time at least. A temporary escape so that she could get her thoughts aligned again and focus on something else. Is there any way I can do that for her?",07Mar2020,1

My days are filled with feelings of either numbness or just unrelenting sadness that I truly dont know what I can do to enjoy life at this point. I go to the gym, I keep in contact with my support system, I cook for myself, I read and write and am going back to university this spring, but none of that seems to affect how I feel.

26,"I met someone 3 months ago and a noticed that he tends to be unreliable when it comes to regular communication. However, I had the feeling that he was not the guy who'd be ghosting on me or not putting enough effort into it. (we couldn't meet often because he was travelling a log for work)

Turns out he just told me a week ago that he's suffering from depression and ptsd as a result of a fatal car accident with his then-partner and watched her dying in the car. This happend 4 years ago.

Furthermore, he told me that he is under medication and from time to time he suffers from severe depression phases where he couldn't do anything... Not even answering his phone or text me back. 

With all of this knowledge, I'm even more worried whenever I don't get a text back. And often 3-7 days without a sign is a common thing. I want to be there for him, but I have the feeling that he is pushing me away and locks himself up. This makes me feel desperate and frustrated... I want to be selfless and be there for him, but since I can't, I feel like beating myself up for this. 

I don't know what to do tbh... I'm quote often at the edge where I'm about to end this, but somehow I don't want to let him alone after he confessed his situation and also he is the kindest and sweetest person I've met and I'm falling for his personality and the way he treats me... It's just that he tries to keep me away from him...",07Mar2020,1
27,"Hi, I am a 21 year old female student from england. I am currently taking a maths degree. I'm not really sure where to start with this thing because it just feels like there is so many variables and barriers stopping me from being happy atm. Sorry that this is long...

When I was little I was a really slow learner and couldn't read after all the other kids could. I don't think I was stupid or anything, I in fact just HATED learning. Even as a kid the idea of picking up a book and learning to read pained me. I don't know why it just felt like i'd rather be doing anything else. My mother became very concerned with this and made it her mission to teach me to read, bribing me with sweets for every book i read out loud. Over time I progressed and caught up with all the other kids in english and maths (after having previously been put in a small group for those  'struggling') . My mum continued to oversee all of my learning, making me do my homework when i got home from school till i had to go to bed. 

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything she has done for me but this is just the tip of the iceberg. She has always controlled everything in my entire life. I am an only child, have no one else in my family around this age- youngest cousin is going towards 30 now and the other two are 40+. In my household her word is law and my father is her puppet. He works full time (25 miles away), cooks, does most of the chores and tonnes of other errands including looking after my 89 year old remaining grandparent who has dementia and a bunch of other health problems but he lives around 20 miles in a different direction. My uncle used to help but has recently got bladder cancer so is having chemo and unable to do so much. My mum is unemployed due to 'stress' and does nothing but sit home with the dogs all day. Recently it has been rough because our 7 year old dog has been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and everyone, but especially my mum is taking it rough because he is her whole world. I travel home from uni every weekend to see my dog to enjoy the time i have left with him, but unfortunately have to live with my mum again during this time. 

She is a complete control freak, has ocd (a WHOLE other tremendous factor in my life), and almost every decision i've ever made has gone through her approval first. At school being as good as the other kids didn't mean she'd lay off, nope. I can't even put into words the amount of blood sweet and tears i've put into my education. I've cried and panicked about homework and coursework and exams daily ever since I was young. And the sad thing is i feel like i did it all for her, 17 years of my existence working to the bone and she still isn't proud of me. In my GCSE's (exams taken at age 16 in uk) I achieved 8 A*s and 3 A's in a public secondary school rated unsatisfactory that year by Ofsted. Not to toot my own but i got the highest results my school had gotten on record ever. I am not naturally smart. I poured hours and hours and hours of studying and training into it, and it's where i physically peaked, i hit my boundary.

 Then i started A-Levels and realised your GCSE's didn't even matter in comparison. All that work i put in for nothing. Defeated, i still worked hard and managed to get an A in maths, an A in Further maths A-level, and a B in Biology, all subjects i took because my mum wanted me to be 'employable'. 

Wanted to take a year out to work but she wouldn't let me because she claimed no one would hire me because i have no experience and waste a year and have a gap on my cv and make me even more unemployable. Note that she has never allowed me to get a job because it interfiers with my studies. So i started a degree i didn't want to take. I wanted to do biology but she said there weren't enough careers which didnt involve chemistry (not my best subject), so i started a maths degree. Im going to be honest, i don't like maths. I used to a little, just degree level maths is so hard :( . Every day it pains me to get out of bed because i hate my life so much. 

In 2018 I had a major breakdown. Cried for the whole Christmas holidays, having several panic attacks a day about my first second year exams. I had to suspend my studied for a year because i just completely fell apart. I got diagnosed with anxiety at the start of that year and am on my third type on anti-depressants now. I have also started smoking a lot of cannabis as i feel like its my only way to get through the day. 

I am still a disappointment and not good enough. I've given up going to class and am months of class material behind. I feel so depressed i don't know what to do. I hate my life but my mum won't let me get a job. She emotionally manipulates me and ensures me that all my ideas will end in peril and that she'll say "" I told you so"" when i'm on benefits and have to crawl back to her for help. 

I told her i have a job interview at a cafe (16 hours per week), because i'm not being productive at the moment and thought it would be good for me. I also want to be financially independent from my parents because i feel so trapped. She told me that it's a terrible idea and that it'll stop me studying, i'll catch coronavirus from handling the money and that she' disappointed that i'd work somewhere 'like that'. I feel crushed to be honest.

I want to quit my degree but everyone keeps telling me i've put in too much time and money into it and that no one will hire me if i dont finish. At this point i'd rather jump off a bridge than do this for another year. I really want to do a course in carpentry and take another year out of uni, maybe save up some money doing part time work and travel.... Here are my mothers problems with this: the dust will be bad for my lungs also people who work in trade ingest chemicals and die sooner, i wont get any part time work because im unemployable and will have no student loan and become homeless, and many more reasons.

Guys please help me i don't know what to do with my life. It'a unbearable right now please give me some advice. I don't have many friends because to be honest i have cut myself off from everyone because i'm tired of blowing them off to 'study' even though i know very well i can't bring myself to pick up a pen.",07Mar2020,1

It feels like all my happiness is being drained from me. My family don’t believe I’m depressed. The won’t believe it. I just need help. I used to be beaten by my mum and step dad everyday. I my step doesn’t live with us anymore. My mum still doesn’t understand that I can’t forgive her for what they did to me. I’d go to school with black eyes and cuts and I would be bullied because of it. And then I became socially awkward to the point where I’d go weeks without taking to some one. My sister told me that I am the reason why people don’t love me. And when my brother saw me cutting myself he just told me to do him a favour and cut deeper. I’m nothing. I’m fucking useless.
