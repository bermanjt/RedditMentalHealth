0,"I have a good friend who has struggled with depression since he was a teenager (we went to high school together and now are in our 30s). We talk regularly, game and would hang out before covid pandemic. We have a lot of good times together but it still throws me off when he is negative about things such as receiving compliments. This can be very frustrating when he beats himself up over situations that could be a “feel good” moment for both of us (sorry if the “us” comes off as selfish). There have been occasions where I point this out to him and communicate my feelings which he usually blows off with a halfhearted acknowledgment. I know battling depression is something I can never fully understand and I do not take it personally. He is suffering. Any advice on how to address these moments with the intent of making an impact but not coming off as critical?",14May2020,1
1,"Used to greatly struggle with even basic hygiene for a while and i was lucky to shower once every week or two. I was better with oral hygiene but not by much. Luckily i am getting help now as it used to be worse. 

I want to make a list of things that helped me continue even basic hygiene during my issues, hopefully this will help others like it is me. 

None of this is proper hygiene but it is simple stuff that is better that nothing. most of this can be kept near your bed for the days where you just cannot get out of bed. put it all in a open box in arms reach of you bed.

\-Wake up call, ask a friend or family member to call you every day and speak to you for a few minutes. if your brain is kept active it is harder to fall back to sleep and the longer you spend awake the more time you have to maybe do things. You don't need an early time but AM would be best.                                                                                                                        I asked my grandparents as it gave them an opportunity to speak to me more. Probably the best thing on this list, wish i thought of it sooner.

\-bottle of water, gotta keep hydrated, i have often just felt more depressed if i spend the day without drinking anything. I also splash myself with it to help stay awake.

\-Baby wipes, using these on your face and extremities will help lower that constant oily feeling. use them anywhere you tend to sweat.

\-anti antiperspirant deodorant, the less you sweat, the less disgusting you will feel, i think the stick deodorant lasts longer than spray but whichever you can get is good.

\-mouthwash, even a swig of this will be a lot of help to your oral hygiene. there is even a tablet form you can chew on if used with a bit of water.

\-disposable toothbrushes, with a bottle of water these you can use from bed and just toss after.

\-just scrubbing your teeth with your shirt can get rid of that annoying sticky sensation.

\-Chewing gum, the extra whitening kind is also better that nothing. Work much better when combined with the above advice.

\-Dry shampoo, you only have to put in on before you go to bed and just leave it over night. Spray and forget!

\-Car air fresheners, if you stay in bed for any length of time it is gonna smell, so put these suckers all over the place. I prefer the gel ones that dissolved so you can see when they need to be replaced, but the paper ones can be hid in you blanket and pillowcase.

\-scented candle, could be use in place of the above. I don't trust myself with a match wont be discussing these further.

\-Family, I repeat if you have any older family such as grandparents or retired parents, they will be overjoyed if you asked them to call everyday to wake you. If they are retired, it is harder to convince yourself it is a bother for them, they aren't doing much that it will interrupt anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

This is stuff i used to help maintain my health till i got round to showering, picking even a few of these will help you maintain even some feeling of  basic humanity. Taking even minor steps is a sign of improvement.",14May2020,1

4,"I started antidepressants again eight or so months ago and promised to stay on them and I had. Lately, though, past two months or so, my depression has gotten much worse. I have started creating crying spells and generally awful days. I feel like I’m falling apart.. a water balloon burst and splattering in the floor. I have been trying to talk to people a bit, but the feelings don’t fade and I don’t want to rehash my bad feelings again and again. It would bore me and my loved ones. This happened last summer too. I think I get depressed almost every summer. All my hospitalizations have been in August. I feel like I’m going absolutely nuts. I’m walking down some dark tunnel and the walls are pulling in like the shutting of a drawstring bag. I sound like an idiot so I’ll call it a day. Maybe I should try therapy?

5,"Nearly a month ago now an event that happened a year ago was revealed that caused disgust and anger and I was kicked from the discord servers I was in with the friend group I've had for a bit more than a few years. It wasn't until recently that I took a step in the situation and found my answers. I knew for sure that everything was over with them when I tried to be on good amends with someone then received messages from someone else yelling at me and telling me that I won't be welcomed back ever and to not be expected to be friends with me again at some point. So after a month of suffering and anxiety I have my answer that I can't be on good amends with them again and I have to move on. I've never dealt with a situation like this before and it really sucks because I was looking forward to things and the nightmare of them hating me is true now. So I have this like empty space in my heart and I feel lonely even if I still have my other friends I can talk to. The only way I'm like hope with moving forward is motivating myself with the positive things they've told me, trying to do things they've wanted me to do like trying to draw everyday and such and just keeping these friends in my heart and remembering the good times. I'm hoping to get my counsellor soon but I just need advice on what I could possibly do to help me move on and the confusion of what to do now because I'm not gonna try to make new friends especially since this first happened. On a side note also is that I've been disgusted to feel sexual attraction since and idk how to get over that hurdle either.  
Tl;dr I need advice on the moving on process, I feel an empty like space in my heart and also I've become disgusted and uncomfortable with having sexual feelings and idk how to overcome that either",14May2020,1

I feel bad for feeling this way but its getting harder to fight.

9,"So when my depression acts up, I have a tendency to just go quiet and internalize everything. This does nothing but get me into a spiral of self loathing and it's not good for me or anyone I'm with. It's usually pretty obvious too cause I'm normally pretty talkative with my friends. In particular it stresses my best friend out cause she thinks I'm mad at her, and I'd really like to not do that. (We've talked about this and she knows I'm not. And I'm comfortable enough to answer direct questions from her when I've shit down. But I'd still like to not put her in that position of possible.) Normally theres no direct trigger for it. I just start internalizing a random thing until my brain turns it into a massive negative.

If anyone has tips on how to not go into internalizing and sending yourself on a self hatred spiral I would really appreciate it!

Btw: I've been on medication for about 5 years and love it. It helped me get back to a normal place emotionally, I just have some occasional flair ups. Current situation is not helping that. Currently not in therapy but have gone to therapy for several years in the past.",14May2020,1

12,"Hey guys. I’m kinda lost as of right now. I made a post detailing the full story of what’s going on over on r/depression so I’ll just link that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gjjh7q/caught_in_this_loop_i_cant_seem_to_break_warning/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for anyone interested in the full story.

Basically, I (17 Male) started off this year confidently. I had everything I could ask for. I had nice classes in school, a side job that paid me pretty good money, a girl that meant the world to me, and more amazing friends than I probably deserved. But what goes up must come down. Everything started when I lost my girl over a seemingly small argument. The pain of being ghosted the person I cared about the most led to my work performance and school performance falling off, leaving me with shitty grades and a lot of stress. This caused me to become distrustful and bitter towards my friends, which resulted in me losing about half of them. Trying to keep my head up and move on only left me more messed up as i was taken advantage of by a girl I had let myself be vulnerable around. Now, I’m caught between the thoughts of wanting to win my ex back and the realizations that it’s not going to truly make me happier. I’ve been having a hard time trusting the people that I had trusted for a long time since it seems like they don’t give a shit about what I’ve been going through. Even tho I find to feel somewhat better when talking to my friends, this quickly fades away. I don’t really know where to go from this point on. I can’t trust anyone, not even myself, and I’m having a hard time moving on from this girl, who was perfect in my eyes.",14May2020,1

I honestly do not know what to do, I'm tired of this emptiness and being alone. The isolation is killing me. Everything is going wrong in my life. I'm sorry if this just comes off as mindless rambling but I honestly don't know how to put my misery and suffering into words, I don't know how to describe this feeling.  I try to do everything right and recover only for it to mean nothing. I don't know how people get out of bed in the morning and face the day with open arms.",14May2020,1

But maybe the problem is me. I’m just not lovable. I seem like I am at first, but I’m just too broken from all the trauma, and it causes problems, and I end up just being a burden, a thorn in the side. 

I’ve done so much reading, so much therapy, tried medication, but it just doesn’t get better.

I feel completely alone, even though I’m not. I have loving friends, two loving family members, a partner... but at the end of the day I still feel alone, because at the end of the day no one can really be there for me the way I seem to need.

I’m just so sick of trying to function. I can’t. I’m nonfunctioning. I’m a broken fucking human being who doesn’t deserve love and can’t support herself financially or mentally or emotionally.

I’m 20 years old and a psychology student. Life right now seems really hard. I have been depressed for the past years but this year seems to be better. I’m not actively thinking about suicide anymore but I still have passive ideation. I seem to be getting bad grades at some subjects in college despite busting my ass and trying the best I can. I’m at the point where I cant see a light in the end of the tunnel (at the time being at least) and on top of that, my abusive mother came back home and she’s here to stay.

I’m feeling overwhelmed about the assignments I have to complete and I seem to experience a burn out.  

I have only two people in my life that I can trust ; my father and my girlfriend (which I love to death). I don’t have any friends due to the fact that I don’t have time to dedicate to them

I cant open up to either of them, as my father will look down on me and say that I should be already able to deal with this because “I’m a psychologist” , while I don’t want to risk making my little girl sad. 

Going to therapy is out of the question since I don’t have the money nor the time for it.

21,"(14 f) I've been sexually assault many times for a long time the oldest one I can remember I was about 6 or 7 and the latest one being this February. It has happened by strangers, people I know and people I trust and I dont know which one is worse. But what confuses me most is the ""assualt"" from my family I remember my brother doing things to me not extreme things like rape but still sexual things and I remember that I didn't know it was weird I almost liked it because my brother always hated me so it was nice having him care about me for once and I would always join him. It started happening more and more and sometimes even my cousins would join in I didnt mind back then i was 7 i thought it was normal so i never told anyone. I got older and for some reason I was a victim for a lot of catcalling and gropeing but again I thought it was normal until it went to far one time at a houseparty a bunch of my friends were sleepinh over and they were all guys the entire night they made jokes about doing things to me and sometimes even trying them but I fought them off which took a lot off strength but when I was trying to sleep one of them started spooning me, I didnt want it but I didnt move I froze up just laying there looking at the ceiling. One of the other guys saw it and took a picture of it I was so scared I ran outside and threw up I couldn't deal with it anymore so I decided to never ever be sexual/romantic with someone the next day I went to school and everyone knew everyone had seen the picture and my life just shattered all my respect and dreams were gone after that day. Everything I loved was gone. All love from my family was gone. My friends were gone. Any respect I had for myself is gone. Since then Its still been happening my grades are awful and I'm going to fail this year I cant sit down to do any work because then I give my mind time to think and when I do that I remember. Every single day I relive those experiences and there keep coming more. I want to tell my mom I want to tell here why I cant work or do anything i want to tell here what happened to her daughter but i cant because then the life and connection of my family would be ruined all because of me.",14May2020,1
22,"I posted a few days ago about feeling hopeless and not knowing how to express those feelings to my friends.
Yesterday, I went on a hike with a friend. We'll call him Sam. 
We went traipsing through the woods and Sam thought it would be a good idea to climb this mountain/ridge. I'm not in very good shape, and really didn't think I could do it. But I tried.
Sam knows I've been going through a rough patch. I shared with him my feelings. 
I don't know if he planned it, bit Sam turned the climb into an inspirational life lesson. I remember saying, ""We have a long way to go..."" and he said, ""Look back at how far you've come though!"" 
He said, ""Just because I took a different path, doesn't mean yours was wrong.""
There was also a point where every sort of flat area we got to was covered in deer poop. I jokingly said, ""It seems like all my life paths just lead to a pile of crap."" He asked me, ""Where will animals poop?"" I thought he was joking. He said, ""Animals poop where it's flat and stable. Life will come with crap. You gotta keep going though. Leave the past behind and keep moving."" Like, he turned into a real live Rafiki.
There were other lessons along the way. And I made it to the top of that mountain. And we watched the sunset together. And I have never been more proud of myself or happier in my life. 
I NEVER thought I'd find success. And it was hard to climb that mountain. But I did it. Because I believed that Sam thought I could. And I haven't felt like anyone has believed in me in a long time. And now, I believe in myself. I can do things. I am capable of overcoming, because look at all the progress I've made so far. The mountaintop is waiting, my friends. And it's beautiful. Hang in there, and give yourself some credit. You're doing it. Just by staying alive, you're doing it.",14May2020,1
23,"The only phrase my family has left when my depression gets at its worse. I’m 28 and have been battling depression since I was 10. For many years I was medicated and able to see councilors. Unfortunately most of my adult life I’ve had to choose between meds/treatment and rent/food so I’ve been on my own for awhile. 

Experiences come in waves so I may be at an ultra low for a week, find something to mentally latch on to that brings me relief for a month, start to sink again, and repeat. 

Friends and family now seem to just think that this is my natural cycle and “I always bounce back when I feel this way”. They don’t seem to understand that I’m suffocating in my own mind and each time I “bounce back” I feel a little less whole.

Yesterday mid shift at work (temporary full time job because of COVID circumstances) I hit another mental low. I woke up crying this morning for no reason (well all of the reasons, just not a particular one). I think I have mentally collapsed from my normal weight plus the extra burden all the COVID chaos has brought with it.

With the cancellation of school, what would be my final year, I have lost contact with my friends, the only people who made me feel like I’m not lonely. But I don’t have the motivation to contact them or anything like that.

The biggest problem is that I don’t feel like doing anything. I’m so filled with depression and anxiety that I feel useless and hopeless and that I can’t do anything. I feel so disappointed in myself for being in bed so much throughout the whole afternoon.

29," Hello, Depression\_Help. I’ve finally decided to post here because I really need advice. 

I am in an online, self-guided training program for a field that will hopefully finally help me get a career. Most people finish this training program in six months. However it’s taken me almost a year to finish mine. Less than a month after I signed up for it, a bunch of things in my life started going downhill. There was one big traumatic thing that happened to me, and I quickly found that my brain fog came back the same way it did when I had a nervous breakdown in college. I could not understand or retain any of the information, it all just felt like words on a page. I was struggling to learn the material, it made me feel stupid and that made me feel frustrated and more hopeless. So I stopped working at it for a few months because I really just couldn’t handle it when my mental health/life was such a mess. 

I picked it back up some time later and have gotten through most of it. Frankly, despite my hesitance, I’m not bad at the stuff I study. I’m actually quite good at it and I do well on the practice tests. I think this field would be a good fit for me and I would enjoy doing it for a living. But now I’m down to the last few chapters and my certification exam has been scheduled for later this summer. I am panicking. I think I’ll do well on the exam, but the thing is, there’s a part of me that fears that it’s not really going to help anything. That I’m still not going to be able to find a job, a real career that actually helps me live the kind of life I want. Thinking about this career has kept me afloat for the past year, it was always a light I had at the end of the tunnel. I really think that if I still can’t find a job afterward I’m really going to want to hurt myself or kill myself. I’m embarrassed by my life and I’m so tired of struggling financially when I see others with secure, decently-paying jobs that they love. I don’t care if the first job I get in this field isn’t particularly high-paying but I need SOMEthing that I can work up from, that makes me feel like this wasn’t all for naught. 

Every time I think about starting the last chapters and finishing up the program ahead of the test, I want to throw up and I actually feel like I’m trembling. Like it feels physically difficult to even look at the books. Additionally, I’m extremely embarrassed at how long it’s taken me to finish this program. I feel like a joke. I’ve searched all over to read about other people who took longer to finish theirs because of unexpected tragic life events/mental illness but can’t find anything. For some reason I have this persistent intrusive thought that someone from the organization is going to email me and ask me why I’m taking so long to finish the course, why am I even bothering, and that I’m lazy and don’t really deserve a career in (field). It sounds irrational when I type it out but it feels so real. 

Nobody really seems to get it. My old therapist said, “Do you see job listings on Indeed and stuff for this job? Well there you go, jobs are available, you can get one.” My mom says that I’m the only one with those negative thoughts about taking too long and “But what if it DOES work out for you and this changes everything?” Really I don’t know how to handle this. I know I should be positive but I’m so exhausted and tired of being disappointed by life. I thought a BA would change everything too, and it didn’t. It’s been a difficult week for me, my depression has flared up big time. I’m trying to get through a chapter right now and it feels like I’m stuck on top of a roller coaster.",14May2020,2

It's okay for recreation  but he is doing it as a habit rushing things just to get done even if it's not okay, proper or fully finished like the dirty dishes or eating. 

I dont know what to do. He is blaming me he cant concentrate because I'm stressing him. He is always mentally abusing me by verbally blaming me and making me feel the bad person. He never wants to admit his mistakes:( he denies or pretending he dont know what's wrong.

I just don't know where to go from here. What am I supposed to do.",14May2020,1
37,"Hi... 
Im a very lonely and depressed guy. 
Normally I can deal with it but a few months ago my ex and I broke up. 
Well.. she dumped me for the guy she cheated on me with. 

Im feeling better and better with times but right now its rough..

Im feeling very lonely and sad. If someone have a few minutes to pm me it would be great..

Thank you and have a nice day everyone.",14May2020,1
38,"I don't really know how to feel like or what to do
I want to create nice things. I want to change the world but I feel so helpless and so alone.
I'm so severely anxious that I don't understand my feelings anymore
I know that I love my girlfriend. But I feel like a failure.
She often tell me that I am great and worth living and amazing. But nothing change.
I am very very worried for all of my friend but I am afraid to talk to them. Because I don't want to show them how miserable I am.. But I love them so much. I want to be the same as before 
I always think of shitty people. And how they kinda destroyed me. How it's my fault. And how they would mock everything that I do
It's hard. And the only thing that come to my mind is death.
Even things that I love can't detract me from my anxiety. It's everywhere. And I will soon have to choose what I will do next year in university
Every day a part of me is telling me that I should stop. That I can't do anything. That I am fat ugly. And should destroy every part of my body.
Even when I have the energy to do something. Everything is a blank page. Is tasteless. Absurd. And strange. And I feel so alone.
I just want to be normal. To be the person I want to be.
Sometimes I thing am that I should take medecines. But the time that I tried it was kinda horrible.
So. I don't know. Should I continue to even though not many peoples are interested in what I do
(sorry it is very confused. And sorry if you read ll of that, I hope that you will have a great day, you surely deserve it)",14May2020,1
39,"I don't think this will get far and I’m somewhat hoping it doesn’t but I’ve just been so unhappy for so long I need to do something to get this out because I know I cant handle the rest of my life being so dead inside.  I’m a twenty-five year old male who works a job in a field I’ve always wanted, making a solid amount, not enough to retire at fifty but I can afford everything I need, I order from amazon almost compulsively my apartment gets items weekly thinking each new item would fill the void but they never do.  I don’t like to eat, most of the time it feels like a chore I have to do or this shell will shut down, I'm not exactly unfit I'm able to play soccer and volleyball and do things but I’m not really fit either.  I try to do nice things for people daily hoping to get some glimmer of joy from the reactions of the gift or action but even that just makes me feel hollow like it was just selfishness that made me do it so I don’t deserve the joy from it.  I have never had a successful (more than a month) romantic relationship; but I have a few different friend groups and none of them know me, they know carefully curated personas I project.  I have such a hard time seeing people as people I see them as puppets in a massive game I don't know all the rules to, but I know enough to hate that they have to be positive and so do I even whenever somethings going wrong, the societal rules don't allow for any flagrant shows of weakness so while I mourn inside I walk around with a big smile, no matter how much I dread when I’ll again be alone with my ghosts.  I’ve always been alone but it really became obvious when I realized all of my colleges are in long term or engaged relationships, I’ve tried dating but it’s hard, I was gifted a very nice car from a dear family member and now most girls I go out with see me as someone who can afford to get them the finer things when in reality I am no where near that level.  I’ve tried meetups but I am unable to express myself in any form but text and it evidently shows when I go making me an  outcast.  The only time I’m ever happy is when I’m playing a 2005 computer game that is obviously dying, whenever I try and play I can see the decay, towns that were once vibrant are barren, servers get so bad sometimes you cant even access outposts, I worry that when the game really dies I will be unable to continue, for fourteen years it has been my only escape from a world where I have what I’m told should be enough to make me happy but as much as I try I have no joy.  I feel stupid just for posting this because I know so many people have it worse, working jobs they hate due to obligations, struggling just to get by, but I don’t think I can carry on like this.  

&amp;#x200B;

I’m here asking one question., what must I do to be happy, because each day the empty grows and I fear the day he takes over.",14May2020,1
40,"I have been on my own most of my life, and really struggling with the loneliness and longing . Find I spend my time uselessly looking at pretty women, wishing  and wondering if I should chuck it all sell out everything and just roam the world. Sad at 66 life has come to thinking like this. I have started to have break downs emotionally, just start to cry from some emotional trigger I think. It isn't the virus effect I have been like this for a long time. Today started tearing from a segment on TV, I hide this from the few friends I have . I drive long haul after retiring from professional management, wanted to see the country and I am , and with a good understanding many probably never realize about all our lives, and see some cool places. But today this crying just out of the blue, I have it happen on the road too but nobody sees it . Now I am wondering how do I stop or in this stage of life what the hell do I do?",14May2020,1
41,"Hello everybody! I'm feeling incredibly down, I've posted here before. And I got help and everything, but recently, honestly, the past month and a half I've been slowly falling back into that deep hole that I thought I was climbing out of.

I'm gay, havent told anyone, not even friends. And I feel horrible, I feel like there's no way that I'll ever be able to find love and that I'll never be able to feel anything with another guy. A part of me knows it's wrong and tries to deny the feelings but it just feels like it's such a huge part of myself. I think about telling one of my friends, but I dont think I could trust him enough to not tell my family.

Being gay isnt the only thing, there is another facet of my life, which I wont comment on. Basically, I feel horrible. And the thought of giving up on life enters my head atleast 2 or 3 times a day, and it has been that way for the past month. I feel trapped in a box, a box that's slowly filling with water, but the water's already above my head, and I'm sitting here drowning.",14May2020,1
