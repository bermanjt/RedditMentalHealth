0,"My bestfriend is with a douchebag

My bestfriend is a girl ive met in my first years off school. We really didnt hit it of at the start but we slowly connected or at least i like to think so. She comes from a background of multiple divorces and depression but i felt like she actually talks to me about it or maybe im just delusional. Anyway she is currently being visited by one of my former friends whom has changed alot over the years. At first i tried to set them up witch at first backfierd on me cuz i said some dumb stuff and was a terrible wingman for them but it evolved into them talking alot. I cant tell if she is okay with it because whenever i ask she says oh its just fun but im really worried beacuse hes not the guy i once knew. 

Am i just jealous? Or just delusional? I dont know im a dumb peice of shit either way requsting advice",10Feb2020,1

The last few Psychiatrists my doctor recommended really sucked and made me feel worthless when we talked.

Minor inconveniences I think to myself “it doesn’t matter I can just kill myself”.  But that’s so fucked up. I need to schedule with a therapist I’m just so lazy. I’ve been getting drunk more and more. My relationship is on its way out. Everything’s coming to an end. Shit is just so hard right now. I’m only 21 but I feel like I don’t want to go on anymore.

Here is some context: I’m 24 years old and exactly a year ago I moved to a new city. It was fun and exciting at first because it was a new beginning. I had recently moved on from a guy that I was in love with and I thought I would never get over. 

Well... now I feel totally isolated and so, so lonely. My friends that live here are all in relationships, so a lot of the times on the weekends they are busy with their boyfriends. I thought my friends with benefits would eventually turn into a relationship and I have been holding onto hope, but we have been in the same situation for 10 months now. He can be extremely rude and disrespectful towards me, yet I just can not let him go. He fills this void of loneliness whenever I see him, yet the next day I feel empty. 

On top of all that, I feel very lost in terms of finding a career. I’m in grad school and have been taking online classes, but I’m now on academic probation because my grades have slipped due to my clinical depression and anxiety. I’m not even passionate about my degree and it was obviously a huge mistake even going to grad school. 

I know this community can give great advice and words of wisdom so if you have any, I would greatly appreciate it.",10Feb2020,1
8,"I've been dealing with mild depression and anxiety for the past few years of my teenage life, but lately it's only been getting worse. I literally can't get myself to do the things that I used to do to get myself to feel better. I also am extremely ashamed to ask somebody close for help, even though I know that it's better if I do. Thats why I'm doing it anonymously through reddit. Over the years I've found it harder and harder to connect to new people and form any kinds of relationships, but now I lost the interest of trying to. I feel way better when I hang out with friends I already know, so I mainly try to focus on this. But hanging out has been really difficult, as I find it really hard to leave the house. I also really want attention, but don't want to be labelled as an ""attention whore"", and so I don't know how to get it without sounding like one. I've talked to people about these issues a few times before, but it was easier to do so back then. I'd say it's been around half a year since I've had a good face to face with someone to just listen to me, and it's totally my fault for not reaching out. Also, recently I've been having thoughts on if it would be better if i just end it all, but thankfully I've been able to battle those thoughts.

A huge thanks to anyone who reads this, any advice would be appreaciated. I'll try to get some sleep now.",10Feb2020,1
9,"(16 F ) About a year and a half ago I lost my dad. I thought I was doing better but here I am now hitting rock bottom yet again. My dads death was sudden and unexpected. And that took a toll on me I went into homebound school and eventually full on homeschool since school was just to much. It caused me so much stress and panic attacks that I just could handle it. I would come up with every excuse in the book to get out of going to that hellhole. I’ve tried to make myself happy but nothing seems to stick.I’ve went to New York, Florida all on my mom escapade to try to get my mind off everything and yeah I had fun and all of that. I just couldn’t get my dad out of my head. And now my mom has started to move on and see 2 new guys and it hurts so bad, she didn’t even bother to tell me and actually talk to me. All she did was say “Hey I have a date tomorrow night” and nothing else. All of this is taking a toll on my love life my poor boyfriend of 2years is getting so stressed out because of me since I am a constant nervous wreak, he tries to take me out to do nice things and buy me stuff but I find I so hard to show I’m happy. I say thank you and everything but still he feels like nothing he does for me is good enough and I hate making him feel that way like today we did out Valentine’s Day since he’s working on actual Valentine’s Day and I just randomly started crying over a choice of shoes and the color . I just don’t know what to do. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m dragging everything and everyone down around me. Everything is just falling apart. Everyone is dying like my dad, my best senior friend Harold. All of my dads brothers and sisters are just slowing getting sick one by one. Everything is just crashing down on me while i keep on trying to put the pieces back together. I feel like such a horrible person, girlfriend, daughter and friend.

13,"Hi, I'm James.  I'm 17 and I get decent grades and I have friends.  I have parents who love me and a stable life and passions and interests but I always feel empty.  I always feel like I'm the black sheep in every circumstance.  In my friend group, my school, my own family, I always feel like the outcast.  

I'm a compulsive liar, I'm socially awkward, I cry myself to sleep a lot and I rarely ask for help but this is one of those rare occasions where I'm acknowledging my own personal needs.  

I hate myself.  I don't see myself succeeding in the future in any way even though others tell me I can do it.  I make new friends with people only to start avoiding them because I feel like I don't belong.  I hate myself when I have so many people who support me.  I don't understand what's wrong with me.  

I make a lot of mistakes.  I say the wrong thing at the wrong time, I'm bad at comforting people, I'm bad at hearing people's emotions and understanding them.  Every attempt I make at being better at talking to people or being more social backfires tremendously in my face.  

I spiral.  A lot.  I cry myself to sleep.  A lot.  I feel sick in my throat from holding back tears at school and at home.  A lot.  I understand that I need help but I don't know where to start.  My parents have already tried therapy but it never works; I always dodge questions or change the subject.

14,"I (27f) decided to end my 2 year relationship with my bf (27m). He has depression. At the beginning  it was okay and wasnt that bad but lately, it had became to the point that their depression made them unable to do things beside going to work. Whicj they hate a lot that they would complain about how it made them depressed even more almost daily. I had told them that it was draining me cause i ended up doing almost everything in this relationship at this point: i decide where we should go, i decide what to do, i help book their appointments or remind them of their appontments or else they forget. I even tried to find a solution to their problems or try to stay positive for them but they said all they want to do is vent and find no solution. 

 I talked about money lately bc i wanted to decrease the aid from my parents and thought about our future but to them money isnt that important to them and that spending money alleviate their depression. They thought since my parents are helping me finacially i shouldnt worry about that but I beg to differ. They want to think of their present and the future can wait.

Ill admit i have a mild form of depression and have been trying to better myself as a result by going to the gym and what not. But they told me they didnt wanna change along with me. They dont see the point. They honestly thought I was going to the gym to hang out with friends and when we discussed about it, he still think i shouldnt go bc he thinks i look fine despite what i think. 

At one point they told me that I was their only source of happiness and i learn how codependent they are in general. I got really concerned but let it slide. 

It came to the point where i just couldnt handle them anymore. It was weighing me down and when i tried to tell him he told me its my duty as a gf to listen to him to vent and to take in all his problems as well. 

After another fight, i decided to call it quits. 

I feel bad becuase i couldnt handle his severe depression and his lack of getting help. My friends think im being too hard at myself and this feeling is bc i care in general. What do you guys think?

16,"Hi,

My Dad told me tonight that he has struggled for 30+ years to find happiness and has all but explicitly told me he is going to end his suffering. Trigger warning ahead for idealizations of suicide.

My dad is my stepdad. He divorced my mom 6 years ago and she has the kids due to his finances being rather poor. He lost the love of his life, who dumped him last month. He feels that he has failed his children. He feels that his military career was a huge joke and thanks it for ruining his life. It gave him false hope, he says, and then would turn around and completely screw him over. He’s been essentially homeless. Staying with me for the past few months, he’s been applying to jobs that make quite a bit of money, but after a few month of searching, he says it doesn’t matter. Even with a company wanting to hire him for 110k a year— more than enough to get him on his feet— he says it doesn’t matter, and that he’s done. At this point, he took a drag from his cigarette and said casually, “I have a life insurance policy. You and X, Y, and Z will each get 25%.”

At this point, I look at him and say, “No way. I don’t want that.” I thought maybe he was showcasing some of his famous dark humor. He wasn’t joking. He is completely serious. He explained and explained and it’s all a blur, but it ended with me just *falling* facefirst into his chest, arms at my sides, just sobbing into his shirt. I said he means so much to me. I need him. My kid siblings need him. I said my sister will graduate from high school in a few years, probably at the top of her class, and how he can’t possibly miss that. I said how I will be having kids one day, and how he’ll be a grandpa, and won’t he stay to meet them? I started to sob. 

And for the first time in 45 years, my dad cried. And cried and cried. We just cried together like that, outside on the back porch. Between labored breaths and tears, my dad told me he’s a lost cause. There’s no hope left. He said that he’s only good to us dead.  My dad sobbed that he wants us to take the life insurance and be happy. I cried that I don’t want it. That we don’t want it. That we want HIM. I even tried bargaining for time, by saying “can you please hold out hope for just one more year?” To which he would just laugh the most defeated sounding laugh. I told him he’s the only dad I’ve ever known, and I can’t lose him yet. He said “you’re going to be fine. You have (boyfriend). The kids have (mom) and (their stepdad) and (me). And you’ll have the check. I’m done. Let me go.”

And he just continued to beg me to let him go.

This was not a cry for help.
This was more like... a heads up.

What do I do? I’ve been in the military for 8 years. During suicide prevention training, you’re taught ACE— ask, care, escort. But what the fuck are you supposed to do when all your attempts to ask, care, and escort are met with laughter?

21,"Trigger warning...

Its getting so hard to fight. I am constantly being hurt by those who I thought loved me and I can no longer love myself. My boyfriend and I got in a 2 hour screaming match because we both blame ourselves for my unstable emotions. I always catch myself and calm down when I get angry because it is always for silly reasons like a crappy pun or a mug I bought him and as soon as I realize my unreasonable reaction I get so guilty I apologize constantly and shut down, sometimes for days. Full unresponsive shut down.

In December, my Father abandoned me for a woman for the 5th time in my life and I no longer plan to contact him or let him contact me. But that doesn't shake the agony. He told me he didn't want me because I look and sound like my mother. The worst part is I understand. My mother is just as awful. She made me hate myself and then convinced me I was the one hurting her. I cant protect my sister from her either.

Shortly after my father and I stopped speaking to my father he had me fired from my job. He is personal friends with the owners and they didn't give me a just cause. Simply dismissed me after they mysteriously had lunch together. 

It has now been 2 and a half months and I have not received a single call back from any business in my town because no one is hiring and I dont drive. My boyfriend only works part time a d we are barely getting by. 

I constantly blame myself because I have this seemingly cursed life. Every few months, without fail, something really good crumbles out from under me in such a drastic and negative way that it shakes up my whole life. This has been consistent since my first birthday. 

Nearly everything bad that can happen to someone has happened to me. I had my innocence stolen as a child by my grandfather, if been taken against my will by several different people on several different occasions in several different ways. I have been kidnapped, beaten, bullied, abandoned, manipulated, and so much more. 

Unintentional anorexia is now slowly sapping away what little there is left of me. Each day I eat less and less, and physical activity takes more and more of a toll on me. I want to eat so bad. I want to look at food and not feel like vomiting. 

Marijuana was my only escape. I was reliant, but it made the pain less so I didn't care. I genuinely enjoyed it. I had control, I could do it with my friend or alone and no matter what it never failed. Now I have no money for such things. I cant sleep or eat without it so I lie awake at night silently crying next to my sleeping boyfriend because I dont want to make him worry even more than he already is.

I have no options available to seek the help I need. All of my town's doctors are not taking any new patients so I cant get a proper diagnoses to get my mental health care paid for. I cant take medication because my family has always had intense negative reactions to that sort of medicine. I can't even talk about this with my boyfriend anymore because I'm ashamed and embarrassed and sad. I feel so weak. 

It took me days just to work up the courage just to type this... I feel like the world has set me up to fail and I have to just suffer. I don't want this. I don't want any of this but I take it and I want to give up so badly.",10Feb2020,1

I'm looking to feel as distant from my hopelessness as I can, but that doesn't mean I'm happy, just less hopeless. I feel like I should limit my impact on real people as much as I can, and not get in the way of them being happy. I feel like this world is created for real people and I just slipped through by accident, and as long as I don't get in the way they will tolerate me when I'm with them. 

I feel like they can see me pretending, and they know I'm not real, but they go along with it because of how pathetic I am, and they don't want to feel bad for showing me that I'm not real.

I know that this perspective is not reality, but that's how it feels. I've never met another not real person, I feel very alone

I'm not in danger, I got past that a few months ago. I finally asked for help about 6 months ago after hiding it for 10 years. I don't really know how to talk about or think about the way I feel, and I'm trying to figure that out.

I'm posting it hear because my next therapy session isn't for another 2 weeks and I don't really know what to do with this. I wanted to ask if anyone has felt this way and eventually not, because I don't know what it's like not to feel like this.

I've pushed him completely over that he has zero incentive to even think about coming back. I've never heard him speak this way. It really feels lonely. I feel like just dying. Who the fuck is ever gonna love me if even the one I love most doesn't feel the same. Who's gonna want to even DEAL with me if the person I thought was my forever and always now hates my guts.

I have so many responsibilities weighing down on me, it makes it harder to start working again. I feel like I'm a wind up toy; I can only begin to continue to thrive in daily life after my battery has gone down when I pick myself up. It's the hardest part in my opinion when you're struggling with depression. The in-between state of wanting to be better or to remain as an empty shell of a human being. 

I feel like I *need* to get out the house, I *need* to go to university, I *need* to get out there and do something with my life. Otherwise what's the point? Yesterday I slept all day because I had no energy at all and today I want to push myself out of my house and do what I need to do. It's so difficult though, there's this deep feeling that rubs against my heart like sandpaper and I feel like a hopeless, worthless cause. I've been struggling for years and yet, the progress of getting better is slow and tedious and I can understand why people would want to put an end to it. 

I don't know if I want advice or just support. My family finds it difficult to understand, telling me I should go out for a walk or just, think positively. It's obviously not that simple but they're trying their best to help me.

So I’ve (23f) been diagnosed with depression since 18. Meds only semi work and i have a few people i know i can count on as support but over the last couple months I’ve been experiencing extreme night terrors. 

What makes them worse is how realistic they feel, as I’m sort of semi conscious when they happen. It makes it harder for me to distinguish what’s real and what isn’t. Someone im incredibly close to saw me have one, apparently i was crying and thrashing like crazy and when i finally snapped out of it i was a mess for ages even as they held me and tried to bring me back from the horrible head space i was in. It’s made me reluctant to sleep as I live at home with parents and sleep alone and when it happens i end up getting no sleep as I’m terrified of it happening again so won’t  try to go back to sleep.

I’ve tried adapting the mentality of ‘suck it up’ and forcing myself back to bed after it happens when I’m on my own but I struggle to get out of that head space and still lose a good hour or so of sleep before i finally feel comfortable enough to sleep. I was wondering if there’s anything i can do when im on my own to calm and ground myself quicker after it happens?",10Feb2020,1

I've been struggling with my depression on and off for the last year. I've recently come to the realisation that my job is putting a lot of strain on my mental health and I feel like there's nothing I can do about it. What's also bothering me is my manager (the woman I support as her PA &amp; causing a lot of the issues) has this whole open communication thing she wants do that she's always in the loop. I get this, and I understand she needs to know but sometimes I don't want to share my shit with people. I don't want to tell her how I'm feeling all of the time, I don't know how to say this without seeming unreasonable or it coming back on me as a reason to get rid of me or something. The other part of me is telling me I'm just being lazy or complacent which is of course really not helpful and is just fueling the fire.

I just feel so drained, I feel physically sick and I don't have any drive to work for her whatsoever but I'm so stuck financially, I just feel like I'm drowning.

He’s been talking about wanting to get married but the idea gives me the worst anxiety because we aren’t even in a good place right now. We never fight but we both don’t bring out the good in each other.  We make each other lazy and don’t push each other towards our goals. There’s no romance or passion just comfortability. It feels like I’m living with a best friend that I occasionally sleep with. Our sex life is boring and routine. Lately I don’t want to have sex or even kiss because i just feel nothing from it. I can’t figure out if it’s my depression or the relationship. I’ve also been having dreams about another man and in those dreams we’re passionately in love and it makes me feel more resentful towards my boyfriend because he doesn’t give me those feelings. I’m scared I’m settling because he loves me so much and he’s comfortable but I don’t think it’ll ever be enough for me. I’m even more torn because if we break up I have nowhere to go, no family or friends I could stay with and it would be a really hard transition. I guess I’m just scared that I’m thinking the grass will be greener on the other side but I can’t kick the craving for it. 

Any advice???",10Feb2020,1

40,"Sorry for making anyone read this but basically for a while now anytime something good is either happening or about to happen I get really distant from people or a wave of sadness or anger crashes over me. For example, I don’t have many, if any friends, but in the past I used to have plenty. Recently I got a new group of friends and things were going good for a bit when suddenly I thought it’s unfair they have to be around a garbage person like me so I started talking to them less and it just makes me sad. If anyone has advice please share.",10Feb2020,1

Hey reddit. I am at wits end and just want to get better. I can't afford professional treatment right now as it is out of my financial ability.

A bit of a background. I am an immigrant in a really lovely place where I came alone 3 years ago. Before this I was away from home working overseas in the middle east for 20 years. I have been fairly successful in my career. I work in the Restaurant Industry in a Managerial role.

I have been married once but was separated and have one son from that marriage. I provide financial support but an absentee father. I cannot be with my son cause of said above issues. I'm too unstable which cause a lot of issues with friends and colleagues. I get impulsive and due to hating everything growing up.

I just want to get better and need help. Due to my very difficult childhood I have developed a lack of self confidence. My father was an alcoholic and I have anxiety because of this. I also have problems building meaningful relationship with people due to the above. I also suffer insomnia.

To get better, I commit to exercise, eat healthy and try to get busy.

I don't have a close friend that I can confide into.

I am tired of being sick and just want to get better.

Thank you so much.",10Feb2020,1
42,"Every single year of my life I’ve made valentines for whatever class I’m in, and I always get super excited. I would go all out spending hours making and creating whatever thing I decided to make that year. Origami was usually my thing, I would make cranes, butterflies and eagles. This year though I decided to sew plush ducks for my class. I would make the ducks about one a day, I had all my pieces cut out I was going to do it.



Well, two weeks later I’ve only made one duck. I need to make at least 8. It takes 3 hours per duck. That’s 24 hours if I did my math right. I have 4 days counting today. 




I was depressed. I didn’t want to make the ducks, I kept saying I would do it later. I didn’t want to make them because I knew it would be worthless. I thought there was more time. But here I am with one duck that I know I won’t give to anybody, because deep down, I know nobody in my class would care. Who would care? I know I’m being selfish and missing the point, but it hurts. I just wish they would care. I wish they would see me falling apart so they would help me. So they could see I need help. 




I’ll continue sewing ducks, but in the end I don’t think I’ll give them to the class. It’s stupid. I’m stupid for thinking my class would give a damn. Here I am crying over ducks when I could be doing something useful. I don’t know. Sorry if you read this far, I just needed to let this out.",10Feb2020,1
43,"Okay, I’ve learned a lot on how to cope with depression from this sub so I wanted to give a piece of advice back :)

Don’t discredit my point for this but I am 13 years old. I have suffered through and with anxiety and depression for the last 2 years of my life and my amazing girlfriend has helped my so much. I’m a bit overweight and wanted to get into shape, so long walks became a normal hobby for me, it helps to take my mind off of things when I’m depressed and gives inspiration for the short stories I like to write. I think that walks and jogs can help many people with getting in a good mood. Sorry if this was a bit off topic or didn’t really help but hopefully it will:)",10Feb2020,2

45,"I (20M) am beyond confused as to how I can help my girlfriend (20F) get out of this rut. Her and I are very close and we can talk about anything at all. 

Today she had a huge anxiety attack at school and when I brought her back to her house she was hysterical- she was screaming and crying and would not stop for an hour or so no matter what I did. I feel like I’m an extremely supportive boyfriend to her and I know that I treat her right and help her all the time. 

She told some that she wishes she was dead and that she genuinely is wanting to take her pills and kill herself today. She’s attempted it before, but it’s been 2 years since she did. I took her pills away from her so she couldn’t and now she’s asleep on her bed and I’m here in the dark looking up ways to help her even more than I have been. She’s been down like this for about a month and is falling behind in all of her classes, her work, and she hates her body. 

I was supposed to be at work 2 1/2 hours ago but said I’d be late because I had to stay home for a little. I’m afraid to leave her alone because she gets very frantic when she’s like this, but I don’t know what else to do as I’m a personal care giver to blind and dead individuals who need me to be there ASAP (nobody can cover my shift). 

HOW DO I HELP HER. I’ve never been in her position and I need to know how I can help her throughout the day rather than just when she needs me.",10Feb2020,4
46,"Has anyone felt this as a side effect of depression?? There have been days where I would come back from work and sit in my room try to remember whether or not I went to work, because I literally could not remember a single thing I did that day. Days like this gives me such anxiety and stress because I just sit there and worry, thinking that I'm gonna be in trouble the next day for not showing up to work but no one has messaged me anyway asking me why I didn't show up to work, so I guess I did go to work on those days but why can't I remember what I did at work?? even to this day I still don't remember.,",10Feb2020,1
47,"I’ve been on medication and in therapy for about four or five years now after being suicidally depressed. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, general anxiety, and trauma. I went into full remission almost a year ago when I met my boyfriend, but life set back in and I’ve been relapsing harder and harder. I think some delusions are setting in during the peak of episodes. My finances are crumbling and I’m afraid if I don’t fix this now I will lose my house, my roommate, my boyfriend, my job, my dog, and everything I’ve worked so hard for. I wonder if I’m psychotically unipolar depressed and would benefit from a medication change and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Has anyone tried ECT? Is anyone depressed with melancholia/delusions/catatonia?",10Feb2020,1
