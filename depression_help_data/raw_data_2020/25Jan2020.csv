1,"Literally my first day taking zoloft after 10plus years unmedicated, I've had a headache, I was sleepy for parts of today (that's not unusual for me though) some dizziness and the worst is my stomach has been upset ALL DAY  

Anyone else have the side effects on day one?? I dont expect it to do anything to make me feel better for a couple weeks at least as is standard so I'm bothered to have side effects so damn fast!! I only took my first dose this morning",25Jan2020,1
2,"Lately, I've been soul searching within myself and been thinking about my life personally and professionally. Professionally I want to reach this level of Artuer ( basically a high level of creative artist; music, art, anything really creative). Personally, I want to be reliable without having to prove it. I want to be able to rely on myself because I don't seem to do that much. Be that confident person I know I can be professorially and personally. 

**Things that have been Bugging me Lately** 

* Feeling that I have to always prove myself as a friend
* Feeling guilt that I might have out grown my friends
* Not being the family member that I wish to be 
* Caring about things that I have no control over
* Letting problems interfere with my crafts as an artist
* Self-hate because I can't seem to stand up fro myself for things that I strongly disagree because I'm scared of losing that person as friend
* Wanting to branch out but feeling stuck
* Fear of being a bad friend because I'm Trying to be the best artist 

I know theirs more but lets have discussion on here, I would totally apperiate that. I would love to talk about these things with others. Except just trying to solve things on my own. Ive learned a lot about myself and I'm ready for the next chapter of myself. Thank You for your time and hope to hear y'alls advice and ill response as quick as I can. Thanks again :)",25Jan2020,1
3,"I’m a senior in highschool and I have been being prescribed anxiety and antidepressant meds. Some days, I can’t get out of bed because my entire body feels completely numb and stings whenever I try to move, leaving me render-less for hours. I don’t know if this is emotional numbness, a side effect of the depression, another problem that I may have, or a combination of them.

Any help, please?",25Jan2020,1
4,"I tend to push my feelings under the rug/come up with excuses/delay the inevitable. I'm not exactly sure what to say besides I'm jealous of people with a support system. I go to community college and don't know anybody there, and outside of school I don't talk to or see anyone. All my friends from middle/high school are gone. I've never experienced being truly alone but fuck is it hard. I had the same friends for years so I don't really know how to go about talking to new people. I'm not expecting replies just needed to at least type out how I'm feeling so it's not on my mind 24/7.",25Jan2020,1
5,"Hi, so I'm an amateur artist (like REALLY amateur), my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I can't seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing (on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightly-less-s\*\*\*-than-usual drawing at least) so feeling like my art is stuck at the sub-deviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. It's getting to the point that I'm beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the self-hatred at bay.

The problem is that I don't know WTF I'm supposed to do about it. I tried to ignore it for a couple years, tried to tell myself art was just a phase and I wasn't into it anymore, but that didn't work. I've tried multiple methods of improvement; I've taken both private instruction and community college classes, but I seem to have terrible luck as they've all been pretty crap. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options. I haven't tried online classes, but judging by the reviews I've read for places like Udemy and Skillshare I doubt they'd be any better.

I've tried looking for tips online, but all I get is basically the artist equivalent of ""git gud"". It seems like the only option I have left is just practice nonstop for the 20 years and hope I magically improve Saitama-style. Unfortunately, I just don't think I can do that. I've had so many setbacks and failures in my life that I genuinely don't think I have the patience to wait until I'm in my mid-40's before I'm halfway decent at drawing. Even worse, the fact that I'm colorblind and extremely nearsighted (as well as lacking whatever Matrix-vision lets you visualize an object as brush strokes and color values) makes me wonder if practice would even do me any good at all.

Anyways, I've rambled too much. TL;DR - I suck at art, I don't know how to **not** suck at art, and this makes me really f\*\*\*ing depressed.",25Jan2020,1
6,"After almost a decade of therapy and meds, I’m officially “treatment resistant.” I don’t think I can keep going with how I feel but I don’t want to give up. So I’m looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. 

I (21F) have depression (dysthymia, cyclical depression), anxiety (GAD, panic), OCD (with dermatillomania), and PTSD. 

I’m currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they don’t work. 

Some things I’ve tried: 

1. Dozens of prescribed meds: Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax (got addicted), Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc.

2. Therapy: talk, exposure, acceptance, etc.

3. Supplements: NAC, l-theanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D

4. Illegal drugs: mescaline, LSD, LSA

5. Legal drugs: Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD (not in a legal marijuana state), kava kava (tried today, helped but worried about liver + interactions with other meds)

I can’t afford ketamine therapy. I’d consider microdosing LSD but I don’t have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas? I’m kind of at the end of my rope here.",25Jan2020,1
7,"Depression hurts.  I know this, took years to work mine out.  I’m mostly stable now but hubs is struggling.  Been to a couple therapists over the years but never really had any success/found one he could connect to. The few meds he tried made him worse.  He holds it together pretty well most times.  But when he drops he pushes everyone away, yells, and gets very defeatist; it hurts. I often find myself saying and doing the wrong things and making it worse.  I have the kids go to their room and be quiet. Sometimes I get mad at his behavior until it sinks in what his brain is doing. I apologize but it doesn’t take the pain away.  I don’t know how to help him.  I suggest therapy but he poo poo’s me.  He’s getting worse and I’m worried. Advice welcomed.",25Jan2020,1
8,"Trust me, I'm not technically qualified to give advice on nearly anything, but I'd simply like to share the single most effective tactic I've used to combat my chemical imbalance. 

Firstly, we have all our own strengths and weaknesses, and for many of you this simply may not be an viable option. 

UPDATE: I initally wanted to give advice but feel I cant do that without providing my personal story.

If just a single one of you finds comfort in being reminded you're not alone in fighting an internal battle, it has been worth writing what may become the longest personal essay I've written since.. high school?

So as not to waste the time of any of you who either have physical limitations or litany of other valid reasons this just isn't feasible option:
My secret is 45 minutes of DAILY aerobic exercise.

I know this isn't earth shattering news to the majority of you, but I promise that if your mind/body connections reacts to exercise in a way similar to mine, this is possibly the single most important thing you can do for your overall wellbeing.

Let me provide you with my own ""scientific"" life data to back this up. I've always been naturally athletic;  I'm talking high school varsity level at peak, not overly gifted in the least bit. But up through high school, I had always been physically active whether through games and practices or workouts to gain an edge in between seasons.

For most of us, high school is the last time we had a chance to participate in team sports or other organized activities that forced us to keep active. Once that outlet was gone, it took a few years for me to gradually notice that I was getting more and more depressed as time went on.

Back story, I'd moreso struggled with anxiety rather than that empty feeling of good ol' depression through my childhood and adolescence. So much so that I would have full blown panic attacks, including crying, freezing up and being nearly paralyzed by fear, and sometimes even puking before and sometimes during games or any performance-type thing, starting middle school.

Im blessed to say I have AWESOME parents (another incalculable asset in the personal battle against my own head.) So one day when I was 11 or 12, my mom kind of lied about where we were going and before I realized the situation, we were on a couch across from a therapist. (She had to deceive me, she knew what my reaction was going to be.) I FLIPPED, acting so embarrassing and infantile that to this day I cant believe that man fought through my bull**** and ended up being a tremendous help. I'm talking at least the first 5-6 sessions of me fighting with whichever parent brought me to even get out of the car, going and in telling the Dr to f*** himself in 100 different ways for 30 mins straight while he talked with and assured my parents this was an extreme, but natural way of acting out when feeling cornered etc., walking out of his office multiple times while he just calmly followed me as I circled the halls of the office building just ignoring him until time was up. 

Anyways, after utterly horrifying my parents and wasting God knows how much of their money, I realized he was an truly awesome dude that just wanted to do whatever he could to help teach me coping mechanisms etc etc. I think he won me over cause he told me it was cool if I wanted to swear when telling him about how I felt , and in turn he also swore in conversation, maybe a tactic to make me feel equal? Or like I was just talking to a friend? Cause at 12, the F word just feels cool to say, right? Long story, he made more progress than we could have hoped for in less than a couple years.
Side note: It was all him and the techniques, SSRI's never really seemed to do anything for me, I tried 3 different ones over the course of about 6 months each. Havent taken them since I was like 14

Anyways, fast forward about 15 years and honestly didn't realize how deeply I had spiraled into the prototypical depressive state. Was unaware my s/o and parents had even been keeping in touch behind my back to (in a wholesome way, not the negative connotation) to try to team up and make sure the were doing what they could to help.

I didnt have an aha! moment, but decided I could no longer accept that I was essentially on autopilot and allowing time to trickle away to the point of years. Years since I had felt.. Alive? Enthusiastic? Hard to describe the feeling, or lack thereof.

Anyways, as an adult, it seemed like a no-brainer to see if the therapist who's advice had been paramount not so long ago was still in the area.  Luckily for me, he was, although I didn't know his expertise was technically in adolescents, and didnt typically treat adults.

This is irrelevant, but I can't explain how heartwarming it was when he realized the kid who, in his words, ""fought like a feral animal"" against having to see him had ended up holding him in such high regard that I wanted his help again. This is irrelevant, but I hope he felt as validated as I feel he deserved to.

So we catch up a bit, laugh about what an absolute maniac i had been in our first meetings,  and got to business. He asked the usual questions like what brings you back, describe how you feel, and a couple other basic things.  When I had given him all the basics, he just sighed and said,"" welp kiddo you just hit every bullet point describing classic clinical depression.""

So he took a moment to gather his thoughts and told me based on what he knew about me, the usual approach of long term cognitive behavior therapy would be a complete waste of our time. He also knew that though my brain had fully developed since I was 13,  SSRI's weren't something he thought we should try again, especially I wasnt going to be seeing him weekly

Then he brought up the fact that I had first seen him because of my anxiety getting to actually get out on the field during a game and asked if I still played whether in gym basketball league or did local 5k races or anything like that. When I told said no and that I hadn't been going to the gym or going on runs for a years ,he laughed and shook his head.

He was almost giddy when he told me he'd bet his house that based on my lifestyle, all I needed to do was add a daily aerobic exercise routine back into my life. Make it 45 minutes a day a priority, if all possible. He explained the science of endorphin release afterwards and all that and then we talked about how crucial staying motivated to do it every day was.

So after years stuck in a pointless depression, on a 10 scale of 1 really depressed and 10 as always happy, I went from a 2-3 to a 5-6 in a about 6 weeks. It usually boosts to about an 8 for a couple hours directly after whatever exercise I do. The gym high is real.

I'll leave you with this: while this isn't possible for everyone and won't work for everyone, it is 100% worth a shot. If you've never done any training, start small. A 15 minute walk maybe. But do it everyday and gradually increase as you feel able. I promise over a relatively short period, you will feel SOMETHING. And hey if not, it's still good for your heart.

Whatever keeps you going, keep doing it. Try to win your daily battles and remember that it's always worth fighting for yourself.",25Jan2020,1
9,"(sorry for length + formatting + grammar)

So some background, she and I have been together since July 2019, I've learned a few things that I had not  previously known before hand, like that she has anxiety and depression and she gave me an opportunity to  opt out of the relationship.

everything went relatively smoothly from there, can't think of any major scenarios but  then October 23rd she called me crying and saying she didn't want to live anymore and that there was no  reason for her to be here, kept  me up late  but I  was able  to calm her down enough and we both went to sleep,  and  she was still there in the morning,  a date I haven't forgotten, I was  on edge of different things after then but eventually  I thought things began to be handled.

January 12th turns out I was wrong.  same situation as before except  more  dire, there was a point where I almost had to call  her dad.  Her dad is aware  of the depression and later will be talked more about. I knew  that she would hate me if  I did but I  had really thought she was going to do it/doing it, I ended up  not having to as she called me after I had said that--I thought it was to break up with me honestly--I  was  able to  keep her  on the line and eventually we went to sleep and again she was there in the morning. Something I continue to pray for.

present time: It's exam  season, we're in  high school, everyone's stressed, which I know isn't helping, the night before the first exam she ignored me  after  I mentioned studying for her  exam.

Today was  our second exam (before  situation got worked out) after the exams we would  go to my  house and do whatever. We  both had a great time and  eventually  she had to leave, we're about a 45 minute drive apart now because she's moved to a different city, but stayed in school with all her friends ( and myself) so she had gone down to the bus station and they hadn't let her on the bus to get back to her city, so she called me crying, her dad went to pick her up.

Once she  arrives home, she hadn't texted me on the drive, which i found irregular but i  thought  she had just been stressed, then I get a message that says :

""You're going  to be mad at me""

so we get into that and she says that she jumped  out of the car while it was  moving, she tried reassuring me with the fact she said it  was slowing down but she said her dad refused to pull over when asked to, so  she did that...I let her explain everything  to me without much comment,  she said  she was okay, she called me and we talked about it there for a bit, she said she knew I was mad at her and could not deal with someone who would be mad at her as it  would increase anxiety.  She also  says I need to actually  do research on her conditions because it seems like I don't care, and proceeded to break up with me, happened before, I get  to  find out if it's real or not tomorrow. Was I mad? well  yes, honestly, I never voiced it but she said she heard it and that had stopped conversation. I hadn't been saying much as well i wasn't happy with what just happened, so the understandably so the silence that I  kept leaving also made it  seem like I was  more mad, there wasn't much conversation that I could  have  without  getting to mad, because the questions I had on my mind were things like ""What was going through your head"" and ""What were you thinking"" so i chose to be quiet instead, sadly its something I've had to do before.

&amp;#x200B;

I  just need some advice on this, she's gone to bed now, which i think is  a good idea, but I need  someone  to help me understand, or send  links for me to help me. I do what I can when we're together to keep her happy but when she  goes  home it's hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Another  note that might be relevant  is she's talking  to  her ex boyfriend again,  not that  I really  think to much of it but today she was trying to  hide that she had been texting him, neither of them are that kind of people, she knows I know  it's happening because I said it was  okay because she said it helped some when I wasn't understanding (previous relationship was 2 years with him) and recently with the increase in exchange texts between them, even when I'm with her  in person worries me as I  don't know what it  is  they talk  about, and I don't ask, I put a lot of trust  into her.",25Jan2020,1

13,"Hey, I'm 20 and my very shortened version of my story is this. About a year ago I was all happy and good. Working as a store manager at a grocery store. I was loved and appreciated and everything was great and I loved my job and life. I had a Porsche at 20 years old and things were going amazingly and I was living alone, I worked hard to get to where I was at. Really hard. 
One day driving from work I got rear ended and back and neck injurys. My car was totaled and I was in the er getting x Ray's when my boss called and said I don't care if your injured we need you to work. Right before this my whole family left me and went to Boston and all my friends moved to cali so I had no support to get through it. I went into work injured and in pain and decided that putting in my 2 weeks was best if I was going to be needing to work in such harsh conditions, i switched over and worked for a soda company and within 6 months back in September 2019 I started having panic attacks every single day non stop, wave after wave after wave. Reality changed in a heartbeat. Severe disassociation happened And I've been in a very very dark place ever since. I got the panick attacks and anxiety down and now only having anxiety attacks two to three times a week. However, this caused me to be depressed. I am finding it hard to want to continue living if this is what my life is going to be like now. I've moved out of my state to cali and live with my friends but I've been unemployed since November because I feel incapable of being in a workplace right now. I lost so much but I never thought of losing my mind. And I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been trying to get into therapy but I'm just waiting to hear back from them. I just wanna be able to do things again. I'm tired of this. It feels like im not even living anymore, just existing, slightly. 
I'm not looking for sympathy or anything like that, this is just all new to me and I would like tips to pull out of this terrible mess I've gotten myself into. Thank you in advance if anyone can help.",25Jan2020,1
14,"I’ve been having a rough go of things.  I just discovered this subreddit, and thought it might be therapeutic to vent.  

Since November 23rd I’ve had a chronic sinus infection.  I’ve had numerous doctors visits and I take the full course of antibiotics, do the inhalers, do the ear drops, do the nose sprays, and I feel better for a bit, then I get worse when it comes back when I finish things and the cycle continues.  and me, being 26 with hardly any idea how the US health insurance system works, am now stuck with a $500 bill after insurance even though nothing works and feels defeating.  On top of that, my livers getting worse from drinking from being depressed.  More on that in a minute.  The upside to the sinus infection is I’ve stopped smoking and vaping for a month as of today.  I Smoked from 15-19 and from 23-26 and since I started back up, I’ve had no success as long as I have today.  So you’d think I’d be proud.  

However, I’ve been maniacally depressed since Christmas Eve.  I’ve cried myself to sleep every night since then.  Felt suicidal.  The whole 9 yards.  I’ve dealt with depression since a young age.  I’ve tried killing myself numerous times over my life, but it’s either failed, or I couldn’t follow through from fear.  So I constantly feel as though I’d be better off dead, but too cowardly to commit.  A big part of this is living at home.  

In 2015 I moved back home and dropped out of school due to a bad semester, two severe car accidents that make me fear driving in wintry weather, and numerous other things.  I consistently fight with my mother especially.  I WANT to move out.  But due to my financial setbacks that keep coming up, I cannot.  And I feel consistently defeated.  

My mother used to be my closer parent.  But as we’ve aged she’s no longer comforting.  But harsh.  I can’t remember the last time I saw her genuinely happy without faking it.  She claims she doesn’t have bipolar disorder, but I don’t know which mother I’ll get sometimes.  The normal one, or one where she’ll walk in screaming and targeting people.  I have bipolar disorder.  But I’m medicated for it.  As well as my depression.  My mother also will go out of her way to bring her negativity onto other family members.  She’s very unhappy.  She smokes pot at night and has an overeating disorder that makes me uncomfortable to see her that way because she’ll try to talk to me when I get off work and I can’t hold a conversation because she’s in a haze.  I no longer feel comfortable telling her my problems.  She either doesn’t listen, or is harsh about my concerns.  

My dad on the other hand refuses to let me speak when I try and tell him what’s wrong.  I’ll cry and try to explain why I’m upset, but he constantly interrupts after I ask him to stop, or he’ll blame it on me,  I try and ask him to let me finish why I’m upset, but he won’t listen.  And after a number of attempts I just stop talking and don’t say anything and he’ll try and “comfort” me but it feels hollow because I haven’t gotten my points out, and they just feel useless.   

I’ve recently tried reaching out to my middle brother (who my mother hates because he’s left the stoop and is married and has all kinds of ill will against him and his wife) and I don’t know who to believe about my little brother because part of me doesn’t believe my mom, part of me does.  He’s been supportive.  He’s all I’ve got right now to listen to me.  My youngest brother (I’m the oldest of 3) is 17 and I don’t think he’s mature enough to handle what I’m dealing with.  

I’m seriously at the end of my rope.  I feel I have no one to explain my depression to, to comfort me, or anything.  My family keeps pushing me further and further away.  My friends have expressed they’re fed up with me saying I’m depressed.  And I feel I have no other routes to take.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 28th but I don’t want to be put back on more meds.  He’s seen me my whole life.  And I need a counselor.  Or someone to talk to.  I just feel powerless.  Useless.  Like I’ll never break free and my family is pulling away from me.  

I’m sorry for ranting. But it’s good to get it all out.  

Please let me know what you think.",25Jan2020,1

But now I'm struggling so much. I've become slower, I keep failing major subjects, I can't even get through a day without having my self-loathing thoughts creep up to me and tell me how worthless I am. I just want to give up at this point. 

Recently I've been having really bad mood swings, which is quite new, and it affects me. Just out of nowhere I'd be sad or angry over something and end up hurting myself. I don't know why I'm like this. I just can't keep myself together and control my emotions. 

It's been a year since I started going to a psychiatrist, but honestly it just doesn't help at all. Those pills they give me don't even work. 

Everything's hopeless. I can't save myself, and nobody can save me.

18,"I was abandoned by my father since I was 17 years old and I lived in a developing country. So, I could not get support from the government for my living and education. The subsidy in my country based on family approval and bureaucracy and my dad never applied it to me and decided to disappear. Last year I discovered that I was adopted by my parents. 

It was hard to get a job and I was very poor. I could not get a good job (a decent salary, good working environment, stable contract) and keep got a scam job (job description different from the reality etc). Somehow without grades, jobs I got a job only in a hotel, cafe, bar, restaurant and those jobs sell body/appearance in my country. Office jobs always rejected me. I was very traumatic because the environment was really bad, I got harassment, promotion based on affair with the boss or foreign shareholders, etc.

I decided to fix my life by savings for education but the university without subsidy is too much for me. And, in my country, I have a time limit for subsidy 2 years after high school and it was impossible for me to apply. Then, I enrolled in vocational college but still in the tourism industry. It was still hard for me to get a job even I graduate because the degree is not that popular. But I decided to take the master and abroad because there are many opportunities for scholarship abroad.

I got a partial scholarship so I need to contribute for flights, first settlement allowance etc. But, I don't expect if I live with low scholarship allowance in western Europe is very difficult

I thought life is similar to my country but in Europe money is needed more than in my country to be independent and not rely on other people. Students from my country mostly snobs here so they won't care about my difficult life. Work also very hard due to my resident permit. I had lots of debt for moving here. I got harassed and bullied by snobs students from my country. They also make a group based on social status. But to find local friends is very difficult. If I need help or something I need to pay. I am too stressed and my grades suck. I demotivated and committed suicide. Local people told me I should do sports and association. I am not used with sports and join clubs to get friends and be active (for me it just a waste of money). I am not used that I need to go to psychologist to talk (usually with friends). I am not used with spending money on happiness such as vacation etc. I also stressed out too many students focus on sex-oriented here, so that, finding a true friend is difficult.

People from my country told me the best way to get out of the problem is to marry someone. It is a culture that poor women need to marry but I don't want. On the other hand, I don't have an option. Even my embassy told me without family then no one would help you now. They advised me to have a family. I only need a friend but with my age now, people are busy getting mates and family, so it seems only partner/boyfriend that would listen to me, give me support and help. It is not because I am needy but my life has been so harsh on me. I have been diagnosed with PTSD.",25Jan2020,1

Even the things I usually like seem so tiresome and I everytime I have to force myself so hard to do them. Reading is the only thing I still enjoy.

Im pretty young though thats the problem also i cant remember who i am. Its hard to explain. Sorry if you can’t understand me,25Jan2020,1
23,"Hi...uh... I'm scared.. I tried therapy once and the therapist was rly bad... and uh... I don't know what to do.. I'm very shy and can barely talk to anyone, I don't have many friends in school, and the one I have is leaving soon..

So my question is, what do I do? What do I say? What can I do to not have a panic attack for this.. I don't know what to do :/

Don't get me wrong, I want medication to be happy and help with anxiety, but the talking is what's making me anxious..",25Jan2020,1

Not attention seeking but more seeking advice....

All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.  
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.  
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?  
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.  
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.  
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?  
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.  
But im losing hope every day more and more.  
I feel like I dont wanna talk about anything of this with my parents.  
I'm awaiting to finish high school and then try to tackle life myself.",25Jan2020,1

26,I really don’t know... title says it all. I’m worried I’ll go completely under with no one there for me and lose control of myself,25Jan2020,1
27,"I have 2 semesters left in college and I've been married for 5 months. This is the first time I've lived outside of a busy household. My husband works out of town for the week and comes home on the weekend. I am a theatre major who works two jobs and I feel overwhelmed constantly with school. I don't feel good enough or like I want to finish. I have a hard time cleaning and keeping my space organized which I feel bad about when my husband comes home cause he's been gone and I've missed him and I want to make him happy. I feel bad putting this stuff on him cause he has also suffered from depression. I was cutting myself a few months ago but I stopped cause I felt ashamed, instead I've chopped all my hair off which is kinda nice cause I get a lot of compliments. I feel useless and dumb and like I don't need to exist. I don't want to get help cause I am on my parents insurance and I don't want them to know I am depressed. I also just feel ashamed that I might need help. Life feels so dark and I cry too much. I feel dumb and weak posting on here.",25Jan2020,1

30,Finding it hard to keep the smile on as my money situation seems to keep getting worse I seem to spend all my time nail biting worrying about my problems rather than doing anything to solve them I feel like I have to keep positive but it’s getting harder I’m not living any normal life for a 25 year old I haven’t had a relationship in over 5 spend pretty much 24-7 locked up at home and I have nothing to worry about nothing major anyways seem to be my own worse enemy sabotaging myself over and over if advice?,25Jan2020,1
