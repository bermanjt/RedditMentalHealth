0,"ive been so depressed for a couple of months now and usually i‚Äôve been that functional type of depressed. i don‚Äôt know but something derailed me from everything and ive been behind on my assignments and exams for uni and now it seems i‚Äôve crawled into a hole with no way out. ive managed to isolate myself from every single one of my friends, i have no social contacts other than my mom. i just want to leave and start over again and vanish from all existence, i just want to give up just lay on the floor and never get up again. my heart is my throat and i feel like throwing up as my school keeps calling, i don‚Äôt know what to do. my heart feels like it‚Äôs in the middle of a panic attack but my body and mind do not give a fuck. i‚Äôm sorry for writing so much. sending love to everyone.",06Nov2020,1
1,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm not completely sure if this is the right place to post this but I wasn‚Äôt sure where else to go. 

I‚Äôve struggled with depression for about 6 years now. Four years ago, I attempted suicide and almost succeeded. I had to spend a month in the hospital, and then about a year in treatment for mental health. I am so grateful I did not succeed, and genuinely feel lucky to be here today. But the reason I‚Äôm posting this is because ever since, I am unable to take pills or talk about pills without throwing up or feeling extremely nauseous. It‚Äôs gotten slightly better over time but it‚Äôs still a major struggle for me. I have gone to multiple therapists about it, and even tried hypnosis, and none of it has worked. I have constant nightmares of being force fed pills. Consciously I‚Äôm not scared of pills or anything, and if I need to take them I find a way, but I was just wondering if anyone else has experience the same sort of phobia (for lack of a better word) after a serious suicide attempt.

Thanks guys, and stay strong",06Nov2020,1
2,"I don't know if this belongs on here but I've been finding it so difficult to concentrate on work and university.

 I'm behind in both my job and uni and I just can't motivate myself to work on either for more than a little bit at a time. And that's just not enough. 

I feel terrible and like a failure. Like it's just inevitable that I'm going to fuck it all up, and then where will I be? 

I was miserable in my previous jobs and I don't want to go back to that. I earn the most money as well out of my mum and my older brother so what am I gonna do if I lose my job and can't help out anymore? 

I don't want to ruin everything just because I was too lazy and unmotivated to get anything done. 

This is turning into a rant but, I just don't know what to do right now.",06Nov2020,1

*I'm going away for a while, but I'll be back / don't try and follow me, cause I'll return as soon as possible*


*See I'm trying to find my place, but it might not be here where I feel safe / we all learn to make mistakes and run from them...from them / with no direction / run from them...from them / with no conviction*

*Cause I'm just one of those ghosts / traveling endlessly / don't need no roads / in fact they follow me / and we just go in circles*

*Now I'm told that this is life, and pain is just a simple compromise / so we can get what we want out of it / would someone care to classify / our broken hearts and twisted minds / so I can find someone to rely on*

*And run to them...to them / full speed ahead / oh you are not useless / we are just misguided ghosts / traveling endlessly / the ones we trusted the most / pushed us far away / and there's no one road / and we should not be the same / but I'm just a ghost and still they echo me*

*They echo me in circles.*",06Nov2020,1

I've lost energy and motivation for just about everything. My family thinks I don't won't to help myself and I'm just using and manipulating them my friends probably thinking dreadful to be around and lie to them when I say I'll be better.

I have created this fake persona to even seem like a normal fun,creative person and a joy to be around but in reality I'm crying behind that smile they know how depressed I can get I'm not good at hiding my emotions.my games my friends my art used to make me happy but now I can't.my motivation for drawing has been taken from me.my promise to my friends has been broken many times.my appetite has been shattered my voice has gone numb.i am tired of feeling this way I want to be better but I struggle to commit.

I don't eat because I want to punish to myself it's because I don't have the energy to go get the food now even making a sandwich is too much effort.my family thinks I don't care and manipulate them and tell my friends how evil they are when in reality I'm just scared they have so much troubles to begin with I don't want to add on to it so I don't talk about it even when I'm upset I don't want to upset them so I keep to myself.when I want to tell them what's going on my voice disappears as I sit in silence listening to their pleas and worries.my friends get the worst of it I can't manage my depression so they always see me at my worst as I was never good at hiding anything.i get so anxious they'll leave me bc of my depression I'm scared they're gonna find people better than me and abandon me.they've always been able to make me smile and laugh but I'm loosing it .now when I'm with them I'm just there pretending I'm okay and being quirky having a good time when I'm numb inside.

My art was my passion my hobby my favorite thing to do but now I can barely pick up my pencil to create something new I have no energy or motivation to do anything.i struggle with keeping my hygiene on top.i can't even find fun in watching anime or video games like I used too.i thought about ending my life many times and had  plenty of opportunities to but I never had the the energy to get up and follow through.im tired of making promises to things I cannot commit to. I wanted the help to get better and stop feeling this way but I'm so drained I can't fully commit to the things I need to do to get better.so I'm here listening to the tormented things my mind feeds to me I'm the imposter of my life and have no will to move on I'm so tired but I'm too weak to attempt to escape my shackles I can't lift my head  I'm dying inside I can't do this by myself anymore..",06Nov2020,1

7,"hey

im in my mid teen years and i feel pretty bad. ive got a bunch of problems and i feel like i have a negative mindset. 

Ive been feeling really lonely as i dont have that many friends. I have some close ones that care for me but they dont really enjoy me being around them (which really hurts), i always feel like a sideman. i kinda understand why - im negative, not exactly the funniest and try hard to be funny as i am impatient and want my social position to improve. i get pretty bad social anxiety in front of my friends and ""popular"" people, and end up saying awkward and stupid things. Overall im pretty reflective and realise problems like these - eg how negative this whole post is, but idk how to improve / change. Since joining a new school, ive had the mindset of trying to impress people to fit in and ""become popular"". Ive spent my time trying to be enjoyable and funny but its done the opposite, and im at my lowest now. I dont know what to do now - i dont have people to go to like that, and i want to be having the time of my life rn like other people around me, but everything seems to be falling apart and im finding school harder and harder, as i dont fit into most of the little groups of people in each of my classes, once again making me feel lonelier and worse. all these things build up and i just wanna give up sometimes.

how do i become a better version of me? i want to go party and be with girls but i end up in my room blasting music and scrolling on my phone like a loner...

some people have come from worse places than me (being nerdy and not really liked), to having lots of good friends and girls. i feel jealous of many things like that, and sometimes am a cunt out of anger and laugh at people who have it better to make them feel worse to hide my own problems.

i want to enjoy life, and by that i mean hang with friends after school, have a good friend group, fit in...

i realise im saying like i want to change who i actually am, which is stupid, but i think i need to. i ùò≥ùò¶ùò¢ùò≠ùò≠ùò∫ need more confidence.

overall, how do i get out of my position??

i would appreciate any help or ideas, im desperate",06Nov2020,1
8,"Right now, I (18F) feel like I want everyone in my life to push me away so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the burden of letting everyone down. I recently started college after being a 4.0 student in high school, but I‚Äôm failing every class I have. I‚Äôm not in a hard major, nor are my classes hard but I‚Äôm still failing. I feel so upset when people try to help me because I‚Äôve done everything and I‚Äôm not improving in the slightest. Every time my mom checks in on me all I feel is guilt and shame. At this point, most things I say are a lie to cover up the fact that I feel like I have nothing left inside of me and I noticed the other day that my feelings have gotten so bad that I barely feel anything at this point. I‚Äôve reached out to my campus mental health center but I just feel disgusted with myself after. I would reach out to friends but I‚Äôm either away from them and our friendship is fading or they‚Äôre here at college with me and are making new friends and finding people who love them and who they love. I honestly feel like I would feel better if everyone just forgot about me and I could start over or at least have a break from feeling like this, and I‚Äôve been debating just running away from it all and living in a tent somewhere. I‚Äôve done everything I can for my depression, I take my medication regularly and I keep my environment clean and I eat healthy and I keep trying to surround myself with positivity but it feels so wrong.

9,"Life is shit. We all know this, but life hits different for everyone.

So I picked up some sports to not get picked on. √Åt the begining I loved every second of it, but after the 5th year, it started going downhill. I had a thought at the back of my head: ""I have way better stuff to do"" so I had to decide to continue or leave. Chose to continue but only if I had some accomplishments earned in the next 2 years. Here I am at my seventh year, not having any accomplishments, having next to no social life, no will to live in a family that doesn't show support. I need help, I realized that but don't know where.

I have never felt like this. I simumtaneously feel sadder and angrier and more defeated than I ever have. I really, really feel like giving up. I don't even know how to talk to my friends about these things because I've never needed to.

13,"Some of us sufferers may have trouble explaining to others what it‚Äôs like to have debilitating depression. This may give insight to some or words for those who have trouble expressing their feelings...   


**What Does It Feel Like To Have Major Depression?** 

***A collection of testimony from different sufferers*** 

&amp;#x200B;

What is depression like? It‚Äôs like drowning, except everyone around you is breathing.

You feel utterly helpless, leaden, dull, unable to move. ¬†You are trapped‚Äîan unwilling witness to those living what appear to be happy lives. Anger at everyone‚Äôs obliviousness to your condition invades your lungs, heart, and spirit.

The waves of pincer-like pain keep pummeling your brain as your body is dragged down, down, down onto the inky, cold depths of the ocean floor, choking you.¬† 

Depression is like a nightmare. Its like you don‚Äôt even control your own thoughts, your thoughts control you. Usually anxiety is right there along with the sadness. Having anxiety and depression is like being terrified and exhausted at the same time. It‚Äôs the fear of failure, coupled with no urge to be productive. It‚Äôs wanting friends but hating socializing. It‚Äôs wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It‚Äôs feeling everything at once, yet being paralyzingly numb. There is no way out and it feels like no one truly cares or understands. No matter what you achieve, you feel You‚Äôre never good enough, worthless, and hopeless (now image those who‚Äôve achieve little to nothing). No matter what you‚Äôre doing or who you‚Äôre with, the feelings are always there. It feels like an endless circle of guilt, worthlessness, pain, fear, and weakness. You feel like there is no point in trying anymore. It's an endless circle of failure. You feel empty, like you're not really existing. Sometimes it even hurts to smile, hurts to laugh, hurts to breathe. It‚Äôs like LIVING hurts, and there's no getting away from it.

Can anyone understand what you're feeling? You're silent, often the quietest one in the room, but inside you are screaming in pain, hoping for help and yet knowing no one can save you or even hope to understand. You're on your own. People will often think you are cold, distant or unfeeling because of your introverted, dark &amp; quiet demeanor but nothing could be further from the truth. You feel EVERYTHING, usually much more than the average person. You feel empathy for others in abundance, the only people it‚Äôs hard to be caring towards are ourselves. You often wish you could express your positive feelings towards others, but there again, a catch 22. We often learn through experience that in those moments of ease, when the depression lets up a little, opening ourselves up to others may cause them to expect us to always be that way. Generally, we ourselves have no idea how we‚Äôll be feeling from one day to the next, one moment to the next.  And when we are depressed and quiet the next day, others often feel we are upset with them when it is really just our own depression eating away at us. Sometimes it‚Äôs better for all concerned to just keep everyone at a distance. Sometimes, we discover that our sadness had spread to others close to us. Talk about feeling guilty...

Everything you do leaves you tired. Things you used to enjoy, they don't bring any comfort to you. The only thing that might bring relief is the feeling of the cold blade, the taste of alcohol, the smell of the drugs. People will try to take those things away from you, but you don't let them. Often, drugs are our only sanctuary. It‚Äôs somewhat understandable why we might drink or abuse drugs, but why cut? Why do we scar ourselves? Sometimes, it‚Äôs a dry run, a rehearsal for suicide. More often however, you‚Äôre feeling so numb or you have so much emotional and mental pain, focusing on the physical pain can actually be a comfort. Depression is a nebulous, difficult to understand kind of pain (even for the person suffering from it) so creating psychical pain and watching the blood flow can be therapeutic. You‚Äôre doing SOMETHING about it, even if it‚Äôs probably the wrong thing. But then again, you‚Äôre probably already used to doing the wrong thing or being told by those close to you how bad your decisions are. Depression does not exist in a vacuum, it‚Äôs a reaction to stimulus combined with some misfiring hormones. 

When you‚Äôre depressed, it‚Äôs like hoping that every night you don't wake up, that maybe the pain will finally stop, you just don‚Äôt want to suffer through it anymore. A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel... HOPE. But depression is so insidious‚Äîand it compounds daily‚Äîmaking it impossible to ever see the end. That fog is like a cage without a key. You lose hope and you just become ever more numb. Everyone needs some glimmer of hope, the depressed usually have none. 

It's always lying and saying ‚ÄúFine. Thanks!‚Äù when someone asks you, ""How're you doing?"". **People think depression is sadness. People think depression is crying. People think depression is dressing in black.**  *But people are wrong.* 

Depression is the constant feeling of being numb. Being numb to emotions, being numb to life, yet when you do feel it‚Äôs with an overwhelming intensity, overwhelming darkness. Whether your eyes are open or closed, existentially all you see is full-eclipse blackness. Watching a comedy that‚Äôs always made you guffaw, all you can summon is a plastic smile.  You sleepwalk through your days, craving the ‚Äòlittle death‚Äô of sleep to escape the torture of being awake. You wake up in the morning just wishing it were night so you could go to sleep again. When you force yourself to eat (likely chided to by worried loved ones), food is tasteless.

Depression is feeling like you‚Äôve lost something but having no clue when or where you last had it.  Then one day you realize what you lost is YOU. Everything that made you YOU has been diluted by the depression. 

Depression is all of those things, and so much more. Did any of this truly explain it? Only you know what your depression feels like. You know how horrible it is. You know it sometimes feels like it'll never end. 

The last thing we hold onto is this tiny scrap of logic that says, ‚Äúfeeling like this isn‚Äôt normal. You can get help if you seek it out...‚Äù and there‚Äôs the catch-22. The last person a depressed person wants to help is themselves.

14,"My big brother might as well not exist. Just a note: he‚Äôs seven years older than me and nine years older than my little brother. We used to be so close. I looked up to him as my biggest role model, and he just shut my entire family out back in July. He‚Äôs in college, so I just assumed that he wanted to hang out with people his age during COVID. We accepted it for a while: bringing his food up to his room, not bothering when he was literally laughing and screaming with his friends at 2 AM on FaceTime or something like that, etc. But it‚Äôs November now, and nothing has changed. He doesn‚Äôt talk. He doesn‚Äôt eat with us. All he does is live in his room, wait for my mom to bring him his food, and do whatever he wants in there. Since then, I‚Äôve been managing my little brother, who has been struggling a lot with online school, and making sure my mom is okay. My dad could be considered an absent parent (he basically lives in our basement), as well. Recently, my dad got really angry at my little brother with his grades, and hit him in the face. I went psycho and I said some things to my father that I really regret now. I keep on having violent dreams where I hurt someone to protect my brother, and I‚Äôm just so damn scared that I will hurt someone I love while I‚Äôm angry. I feel like it‚Äôs my fault that I didn‚Äôt notice my little brother failing school, and thus it‚Äôs my fault that my dad hurt him. I should have protected him, should have taken the blame in time somehow. I‚Äôve been engaging in self harm ever since 6th grade, and I‚Äôve dropped it, but I‚Äôm scared it will come back. I have no one to talk to. My little brother is too young and wouldn‚Äôt understand, my mother would pat me on the back and expect it to heal me completely, my dad would brush it off as me being dramatic, and (obviously) my big brother isn‚Äôt an option. Was there anything I could‚Äôve done, that I CAN do now, to just handle all of this like I was before? I‚Äôm second-guessing myself on an hourly basis now. I want to have that feeling of confidence, that feeling of knowing what to do again. I want to be in control, but I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a possibility.

Not expecting answers, just wanted to vent in a place no one I know would see. Thank you.",06Nov2020,1
