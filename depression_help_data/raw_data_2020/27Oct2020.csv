0,"I've had depression for a while. I've dealt with it since I was 14 or so. Even still, I'm usually not someone to post things like this(or ask for help. I did it once with counseling but It didn't help.) because that's never been my role. I've always had to be the person to uplift others. To try and be there as much as possible, hoping that someone with do that for me when I ended up there. Well, I'm here, and all my friends are gone. I feel like I was supposed to be something different, maybe something better, or at least trying to be better when I got to this age(I'm 21), and I'm wasting everyone's time including mine even being alive. I have little motivation to push myself to get out of bed. It's looking like I'm going to fail my classes, but I do still have a chance. I just don't see the reason. Get a degree to what, do nothing with it like I'm doing with my life now?  I'm not even sure if there was a question I wanted to ask, I just wanted to say something to someone(or a group of people, I guess.) before things got worse.",27Oct2020,1
1,"I’ve been idealizing death for some time now. 

Have had anxiety/depression my entire life, and although I came from a good home and have a good job I feel so alone in the world. I am a frontline healthcare provider in the ER, and having so many of my patients die during COVID with the accumulation of denial about the pandemic has been incredibly disheartening. Not only do I have COVID fatigue but now provider fatigue. 

A good relationship of mind ended months ago, and I had been doing okay until recently when she reached out again. 

All I think about is death. Something quick and painless. I wish I would get cancer or die in an accident or something. I just want it to be over.",27Oct2020,1
2,"I'm just pissed off and now I'm crying my eyes out. I have a paper delivered tomorrow, after much struggle I managed to finish it. Asked my bf to see it so he could correct some mistakes or incoherences and he commented that my paper looks more like a compilation of articles than something of my own.

I'm just so angry!!! How can I write a paper on a classic, canonical book that is ""original"" if EVERYTHING THERE IS TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT BOOK HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID? And how am I supposed to write something I thought and was written before by someone else, without giving the credits for the article???

Not only that my professor, when I asked her what were we supposed to write about the novel, she said ""write what you thought about it"". Like, how??? How do you want an academic article about what I thought? How will I write 5 pages of my experience  my thoughts and not sound like I'm copying people or creating a paper that is a compilation of articles????

I just want to learn. I wasn't made for writing critics and academic papers, I just want to be a teacher, I don't want an academic life, I hate eveything about it. Why should I be obligated to write an academic paper if I won't write it anymore once I'm teaching? Correct me if I'm wrong please.

The worst part is that it isn't even in my primary language. I speak portuguese, this class is in English. I hate writing papers and then I have to write it in English? Seriously, I just can't stand it! And I hate myself for not knowing how to write this stupid shit!!!!!

5,"Because of COVID, and my particular situation with my parents, I decided to get a telemedicine appointment. This is my first time getting help for my depression, and to be honest, I am hoping to walk away from my meeting with a prescription as two of my immediate family members are functioning well on these medications. To cut costs though, (I am 18 and don’t have insurance) I booked with a Nurse Practitioner. I don’t even think she is specialized in mental health. Does any one have experience with being diagnosed/getting their prescription from a Nurse Practitioner? How about being first timers and doing telemedicine? Thanks!",27Oct2020,1
6,"I’m still living with my mother, but to her I am just lazy. When I get a job I will search help. I want to know what is the thing that is happening in my head. I have tried the school’s psychologist, but they didn’t look like they really cared much and just wanted for the lesson to finish.

7,can someone give me a real reason to life? like being deadass a real reason,27Oct2020,1
8,"This is a long one and frankly i need to tell it. I will start from the beginning i guess. It all starts when i was little maybe around 4-5 year's old. My mother beat me daily every single day. For over 8 years she did but when i first started school it got worse. Way worse i was bullied all through school and with mom beating me and dad being a truck driver everything was screwed. I never got to see dad much. But soon after when i was around 8 i had severe depression and was prescribed anti-depressants. I shortly after attempted suicide 3 times. I had 2 mental breakdowns in school. I hated everyone and everything i was verbally abused constantly. At around 12 or 13 years of age i already took up stealing. I stole at least over 300$ and countless items. I was hateful of everything. I didn't care. Mom left shortly after just to return 3 separate occasions. I hated her. I soon got crippling anxiety. I then at the age of around 15-16 dropped out of school. I couldn't take it anymore i wanted everyone dead. I didn't care for anyone's life even if it meant making my families a living hell. I tormented my 3 brothers and my parents for my entire life after she started beating me.


I just wanted everyone to feel my pain i almost died a total of 11 times. 3 by suicide the others were random crap. So more recently when i turned 18 i got my GED thinking i could turn my life around. I was wrong. I slowly was wasting away inside my past traumas creeping in eating me from the inside. I have no feelings of happiness or joy. It kept eating me i looked for help constantly but none came. I wanted to do something with my life but was told it would never happen. My only emotions are guilt, jealousy, anger, sadness and resentment


I dealt with my stresses by bottling them up. Throwing them in the back of my mind. I soon after getting my GED got a job at walmart. It was going good but the hours where tough then my anxiety kicked in of im not good enough. So i called out of work constantly and 3 weeks later i was fired. Broken and defeated i gave up. Around 4 months passed i got a new job at ingles i worked there for a little over a year. I quit the job to try to support my father who at the time was dying he passed away april 18th 2020 of pneumonia. I felt so many things when he died. I am 20 years old and i didn't even say goodbye to the man i loved more than anything deep down my father. I blame myself for his passing i have night terrors. I just found a job only recently. Yet i find no joy in anything i find no happiness nothing. I only more recently became extremely close to my brother sam. Because my brother james he tournaments me more than anything. After dad passed he moved in and cares nothing for me. I sometimes wish he would just die. It until around a week ago to warm up to me. But i don't care. He never cared for my feelings or anything. I take strong medications for my issues. I currently suffer from : major depression, anxiety, insomnia, ADHD and night terrors un-confirmed ones that i think i have : ptsd and bipolar all in all i was a horrible person with a horrible background. Yet all i feel now is empty and alone i feel so lost and confused i don't know what to do anymore.

I am sorry for this long story but to tell you the whole story i would have to write a book.",27Oct2020,1

How can I assure that not everyone is like that? This world, no one should be alone. I wish she wasn't what she saw herself as.

Recently i've read an interesting scientific article where smart people said that listening to some natural sounds like rain or thunder can help. I followed this advice and found an awesome channel [Relaxing Nature Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXcUM1ppMBX2FqiRn47N7uA/).

16,"Tonight (at least where i am) i ended up writting a bible to someone i met online, and i really felt like this was going to be the good one, i’m on meds, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzos, a lot of stuff, she reeeeeally was my type, my kind, physically, mentally, emotionally, she knew about my problems (Severe depression and anxiety) and i asked her to never let that info make her treat me differently, we where “dating “ , “sexting”, all that stuff, my last relationship was 8 years ago, it ended up pretty badly, since then, just a couple of women, not serious relationships, just casual sex, one nighters, that just ended up filling more my depression gauge, a week ago, i apologized to her cause of my attacks, my general negativity, and constant need for help, she said that i should keep on looking for someone else cause she started a relationship the day before, it broke mah dudes, like, hell, i ended up carving my arms and chest heavily, not because of being rejected by her, but because of the hope that the situation made me feel, like, finally seeing the light at the end, maybe a really faint light, but light amongst all the dark, and, as i was saying, tonight, I wrote a bible (very large text) to her, just to throw my guts outs, all that i’m really feeling, maybe that could chsnge something, right? Well, she ended up answering back, something that i didn’t expected to be honest, and as kind as she is, she asked me very politely to not hurt myself again anymore, cause eventually someone will come, and that made me drop to my knees, a polite “fuck off bugg”, i ended up sending a song “Mr Kitty - After Dark” a song i told her that makes me think about her, i that i wanted to sing it with her while in bed, now, means nothing to her, just another nosy text by the depressive fucker trying to make me love him, i’m high on benzos righr now, and with a friend, but i’m going to carve my body heavily, don’t care, not because of her, but because of desperation and rage with life, just because its always the same, life always gives me a lick of what i want, but when i want the full spoon it hits me till i’m black and blue, just to give another lick years later, i feel like a mistrested stray dog, s dog that fells in love with the first person that gaves attention to him, but ends up being kicked snd abused by the same person, just to get out to being stray again, in hope to find somebody again, and maybe this time, for a little longer, maybe even expecting to be poisoned by someone to end the suffering, just fuck, i’m fucked, and sick, and ragging, at the same time, that the fuckin benzos seems to not be working even tho i took way more than usual.

He barely texts me, Eventhough he told me he wants to, and he lost so many friends... i am tired of trying to explain to people what is going on with him. And most of the time they don’t even understand.

20,"You do not have the right to be a shitty person to someone simply because you have depression and in case of a more extreme mental illnesses people whom are in your circle SHOULD be warned about your triggers and mood swings in anticipation to one.  


I admitedly am guilty as charged aswell with throwing rage fits from piling up things inside me and added the anger issues i have from growing up and constantly getting into physical fights so yeah i'm not innocent,but growing up and further learning how to control/cope with my issues the only thing i really got out of those fights and tantrums is the feeling of regret in the back of my head.  


You do not have to be a \*good\* person and you do not have to force yourself to like anyone either but you DO have to NOT be a horrible person to others cause let's face it A LOT of our issues stem from people beeing shitty to us aswell growing up isn't it? This is something many of us realise as we get older but it's a good thing to know from younger ages aswell.   


As with all this is my opinnion wether or not you agree with it is up to you but truth to be told it's always better to mind your bussiness and develop yourself and not try to vent your frustration on others in a bad way nor force yourself to talk.",27Oct2020,1

24,"Hey everyone, I hope you're ok. I'm kinda new to this and I'm really anxious about being judged for the things I'm going to write or about being somehow identified by someone I know so I'm going to keep as generic as I can. Also English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for any linguistic mistakes.

Some things that happened in the past put me in a situation where I had to start trying to fight with myself to remain as happy as possible by hoping to find a motivation for my actions, but recently I understood that I have nothing. Even if I had something, that thing would have absolutely no meaning to me. I really tried to fight as hard as I could but now I just don't know what to do. I am constantly sad or indifferent. Most of the pressure that I feel comes from my social life. I understood that every friend I have doesn't really care as much as I would care for them if they became a little closer to me and I just feel not worthy. I'm also sure that I am going to ruin the relationship with every person I care about because it happened before and it's happening right now. All the close people that made me happy lost interest in me, but they're still happy also without me. To me, it means that I cared more than they cared about me, and I have no reason to think this won't happen in the future. What I want to say is that I know that I am going to be unhappy with every possible friendship and relationship that I will have, and no one wants to be friend with a constantly sad and indifferent person. Some people defined me as ""too sensitive"" and maybe they're right, I don't know. I can't find the motivation to try to be happy but I would love to have one and to be happy. I don't really have any ""serious"" problem in my life though. I'm still a student so I don't have to worry too much about money and surviving, I don't have any family problems, I am healthy and even considered a good looking guy by some, so I feel extremely guilty for feeling like this. The only thing I constantly want to do is to sleep, but I am at the same time scared to fall asleep because I don't want to dream things. Before I was sure that loving someone and being loved was going to solve everything but now I am not sure about that either. I'm just tired of faking my happiness in front of everyone and I'm sick of always crying.

I hope that what I wrote was clear enough because my thoughts are really chaotic right now; also, I am really sorry if something I wrote hurt someone that read this. I hope someone can relate to what I said maybe that helped someone to feel less lonely.",27Oct2020,1
25,"I’ve been on and off with my nofap journey but something that I have noticed is that whenever I mess up my streak and go back to jerking off I have a tough time dealing with my depression. It hits like a truck and it’s even harder to get out of an episode. But when I’m on my streak my depressive episodes are non-existent! Granted I do get sad when bad things happen to my but I bounce back right away.
Along with my depression I also deal with social anxiety and being on the nofap streak helps me deal with it as well, I am a lot more open to socializing with my friends who, normally, I would avoid socializing with for weeks.
If you are struggling with depression and have little to no options left for help I would give nofap a shot. You literally have nothing to lose from trying it. My inbox is always open if anyone needs to talk/vent or has any questions about trying out nofap. Stay strong.",27Oct2020,1

I just got myself Spotify premium to try to help encourage my interests but I feel like I don't even know where or how to start lol. I find excuses to stop myself from engaging in these interests (like I'm working so I can't play/explore music because it'll distract me). Whereas when I was younger I would listen while working.

I shouldn't be looking for someone to love for the hope of being happy and I should get help I know but as much as I want to I can't go through with it i can't show how i really feel with out getting judged for being weak,

My mum has a go at me all the time even when im just trying to help her she always asks me to help and most of the time I do when I'm going out I might ask If we need anything from the shop she says she's there for me but when I ever ask for a small favour because I need it not because I want it it's a I'll sort it later and she never does when I remind she just gets angry at me for asking about it when I try to explain stuff she gets annoyed I just feel like I have to listen to hear about her day at work or about shit that's happened and she never listens to me and it hurts I don't blame her for not being there for me all the time when i needed her i just wish she was there when i needed it a few times i kinda just feel like i never got the love i needed from neither  of them, on top of this I'm not locked in my house for 12 more days I know that's not long long but I had a routine something to look forward to even if it was shit now i don't, 

Everything sucks and that's life it always will for most I know and that's a horrible thing to think about but sometimes thinking about suicide may make you think you have an escape that's not always the case I know that but yet I still feel like the opportunity is right there to take to stop the pain permanently",27Oct2020,1

Today was a really bad day. I've experienced anxiety and paranoia about my relationship that overall led to a horrible mood crash, and now I have this tightness in my chest and a need to cry, but an inability to.

And the thing is, these kinds of days happen often. Not as often as they used to before I started taking medication, but they still happen a lot, and they are so overwhelming. I'm tired. I'm tired of being unable to function like a normal human being. I'm tired of my insecurities and the way my brain bullies me and torments me.

When it comes to my relationship, I'm sure it's just my brain making a problem out of nothing, but it still feels real. I need so much reassurance and comfort, which my boyfriend doesn't seem to be able to give at this very moment for his own reasons, and I hate myself for needing it since I'm the one who created the problem in the first place.

I'm just tired. I really can't keep going like this. The relationship thing is just what happened to trigger this mood swing today, but it could've been anything. My inability to exercise due to depression, my weight, my body, my friendships, my loneliness, my fear of studying at uni, my fear of failure, my overall exhaustion with life. It could've been anything.

I really want to die. I really do. All that's keeping me here is the thought of ruined lives I would leave behind. And honestly... it's starting not to be enough.",27Oct2020,1
34,"So I’m 17M in high school. I recently have hit a really tough brick wall in terms of my emotions and mindset. I’ve never claimed to be depressed or anything I don’t want to say that I am.... I’m just sad a lot and can only seem to think negative thoughts. A lot pertaining to school work, which I have lost all motivation to complete my work. For a while I thought that finding love and a girlfriend would solve all my problems and make me happy. But I just woke up one day and now it feels like even that, the literal only thing I thought could pull me out of this state, but now it feels like nothing can. There’s this girl I really like but I don’t talk to her and I don’t see a way of talking to her. I still like her a lot and have for a while but I just don’t have the same weird feeling as I did when I saw her everyday. I have also hit a point where my friends are kind of annoying me because I just want to sleep or listen to music and cry. Idk what’s wrong with me or why I feel the way I do or how to stop it.... I need help but idk how to get it. If anyone could help I would appreciate it a lot",27Oct2020,1

36,"Everything in my life is good. I have a loving supportive girlfriend, im making good grades in college, I love my job. Why do I feel so down? I feel like the world is crashing down and nothing can pick me up right now and it is starting to hurt my girlfriend because she tries so hard to bring me up, but it ultimately brings her down when she can't. Any advice would be wonderful. Thank you.",27Oct2020,1
37,It’s right there. I can feel it. But I can’t fucking get it out. I just want to lay in my bed and cry all day but it’s not working,27Oct2020,1
38,"The move, as in moving from one address to another, without friends, without family, all on my own; while my NORMAL state is that I can't get myself to do anything: I brush my teeth twice a week if I'm lucky. I can't get myself to exercise, instead lay 12 hours per day in bed and another 8 to 10 on my couch.

But enough about my sad life.

I do not expect anyone to read this, let alone add a comment... Yet, it WOULD help me, it really would if I knew people are going to read this. So, if you read so far then please, I beg you, vote up this post: I will pretend that that means you will read all subsequent comments that I will add to this post later on... See it as a diary, of ""How I managed to move while being all alone and near-suicidal depressed"". If even just one person will truely be there for me while I go through this (I am crying now) then maybe I can do it...

So thank you for your vote (of confidence in me).",27Oct2020,1
39,"I work so hard on myself.

I have been going to therapy for 10 years. I studied self-compassion and do my best to practice it when negative self-talk comes up.

I still backslide. It's especially hard with a strenuous work schedule and with a shitty telemedicine app that makes trying to seek individual therapy a pain in the ass.

I know it's going to be a continuous process, especially with lifelong programming from a perfectionist and emotionally abusive parent. Still, I'm tired of the pain and grief it causes me and my partner. I'm tired of saying and doing the wrong things, and not being able to handle my imperfections and humanity in a healthy way. I'm exhausted of being insecure and having to reason constantly with my negative thoughts.

I want so badly not to be this way. I wish I had a better grasp on this. It's my fault I'm not a better partner. There's no honor in this martyrdom. I work hard not to be the victim in painful events that happen, and not to be the victim of my triggers.

For having worked so long and hard on this, I deserve better for myself. I'm a really kind and considerate person. This part of me makes me so selfish. I wish I could stop ruining myself and the good things in my life.",27Oct2020,1

I broke up with my ex boyfriend about a year ago. He was 20, and I was 14 when we dated. He did a lot of wrong stuff and just used me to satisfy his sexual fantasies. I thought I had blocked him everywhere. But a few days ago we started arguing and I told him that he hurt me a lot and that he was fucking mentally ill, I called him a pedophile and said that he had no idea of what he did to me. He sent me four images of fresh cuts and blood in his arm and hands. He said he tried to kill himself because of me. I can’t get those fucking images out of my head and I can’t go throughout the day without feeling guilty. I know that he’s sick and he probably just tried to emotionally manipulate me again but deep inside I feel so guilty. I don’t know how to tell my therapist or my parents, I know I have to tell about this to an adult, I just don’t know where to start because I’d have to tell them about my relationship with him that I wish I never had because I feel so ashamed of myself.",27Oct2020,1
41,"I’m a high-functioning/atypical autistic male in my 20s. I’ve been taking dietary supplements, including multivitamins and iron for the past few months. I’ve taken St. John’s Wart, 5-HTP, Omega-3s, and I’m going to start trying SAMe. Nothing seems to actually work, and I’m afraid of relying too heavily on prescription medication!

I have fatigue/tiredness, low motivation for MY goals, and crave sugar to the point of me feeling like I’m damaging myself with it. For instance, I’ll eat cookies or brownies until I’m full, and then STILL keep eating them, and I have no idea why. Their has to be a chemical imbalance at that point, because it goes way beyond a sugar addiction. 

This isn’t a major depression issue, but it feels like something I normally like to do isn’t shooting electricity in my brain that day, and I become numb and useless on my days off of work. Given the chance to do anything I want, I always feel like nothing!

I’d appreciate any help with this problem.",27Oct2020,1

47,"Over the past few months, even years I’ve come to realize that the human race is a pathetic being. Everyone is a coward and only serves themselves. While I don’t agree with everything boomers and shit say, I will say I agree when it comes to the instant gratification we all seek.  This is especially true with love, romance, and sex.

Humans all go on dating apps and lie about themselves to appease each other and within weeks ghost the other person because you did not get the instant romance or fuck they desired. Disgusting people, all around. I truly hold fast to the belief everyone is equal, especially equally disgusting. 

In order to attain love, you must have the best sex appeal, height, etc etc etc in order to woo someone. If you’re slightly overweight or “cringey” in your profile people may judge you based on that and forget you. It’s hard for me to feel anything anymore knowing everyone is getting hurt and ghosted, makes me believe there is no such thing as love, only lust and attachment. 

All my life I’ve felt alone, not just romantically but for companionship it’s impossible to have people care for you. How can I know someone cares about me if they only wait for my texts? Or they ghost me? Or they tell me everything I think and know is wrong? The world is truly a cruel place and humans have no right complaining when they add to it.

Some people may see me as wrong or even hate me during this post, and not be able to see past the vent to see someone who is truly hurt and struggles every day and night to just attempt to believe people care about him. I feel nothing. Nothing but the judgement and dissatisfaction from everyone around me.

I really wish I could bring myself to suicide, this world that hates me, spits on me, and beats me down demands it, but I am too weak to watch the blood rain from my body. And for that, I am sorry.",27Oct2020,1
