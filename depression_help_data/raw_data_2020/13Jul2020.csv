0,"I cant get out of this rock bottom. Its been 2 years since I left high school but all I did was stay in my room and do nothing productive. Two important years I’ll never get back. The past 3 weeks made me literally suicidal, I asked for advice wherever I could. 

I watched motivational videos to get pumped up, I biked to get my blood flowing, I wrote down some advices I could use. So why? Why Im in the same place I was last month?

In the last couple of years Ive gone to therapy, I tried hobbies, I tried getting a job, I tried working out, I tried talking to people.  

My life flew by so fast since I got out of high school. Im still mentally a teen. 

I feel like I just hit rock bottom. I fucking need a miracle to get out of this. Nothing I do has any effect.",13Jul2020,1
1,"I've played video games for as long as I can remember (Casual and highly competitive). Helped me fill the void of loneliness during high school while taking anti-depressants (Citalopram for 3-4 years now). Although I was socially inactive, it didn't interfere with my daily tasks of finishing school projects and working at Walmart as a cashier, which was very stimulating and gotten a lot of praise for my performance.

During the second semester in college however, the classes were becoming more and more complex, and I retreated into gaming (10-13 hours daily) instead of seeking tutors, thinking I was simply losing interest in the program.

When I returned from college I suffered a [gaming withdrawal](https://cgaa.info/gaming-withdrawal-symptoms/) just two days in my new job at another grocery shop, the symptoms lasted for 2 months, and were more intense during any physical activity. 2 weeks after I started working in a new job (Municipality maintenance) in late June I felt better, and returned to gaming with a tight schedule (2 hrs max), but relaxed during the weekend. 

4th and 5th July I played for around 7-8 hours, since the weather was too hot for any activity. I felt tearful on Monday, then on Tuesday the depression skyrocketed, I was on the verge of a panic attack and literally started having suicidal thoughts. I had to take two days off due to how extreme the mental and emotional pain was, and I'm still recovering from it.

Is it time for me to hang up on games? Am I cursed from playing them?",13Jul2020,1
2,"hi, this is my first real reddit post. this is supposed to be a throwaway account. holy shit i have alot to say and i need to say it somewhere. i hate myself. i started having sex at 14 (im now 15), and i hate myself for it. my girlfriend is the most beautiful, amazing, kind hearted, and perfect person in the world, but latley ive been just numb. I feel nothing, and all i can think about is how much i just want all of it to stop. i know i have many things to be thankful for in life and i was raised in the catholic church, so i like to think that i have some sort of higher power guiding me. im so sorry to the people that read this, this is so jumbled up and inconsistent. i feel numb, i dont feel anything anymore except really sad. i don't know what else to say other than im starting to get really desperate to stop my hurting and anxiety. im so grateful for the life ive been given, but its really hard to appreciate things when im so idk lonley all the time. im sorry this is stupid to read. idk if i should post this into the r/depression_help subreddit, but thats the only place i can think of. thank you for reading if you did",13Jul2020,1

Today I helped my grandma by picking up sticks a bit and then finished one of my newest favourite games; 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors.

Helped my gf a bit by listening to her rant about a toxic community that we both are in and made a post about that. Watched Tyler1’s reaction to reckful’s passing and that’s making me tear up now; that and the fact that today I’ve just been genuinely happy and haven’t gotten any intrusive thoughts.

7,"I didn't have many friends growing up, still don't. My mother, though a lovely lady, was a drug addict and had many medical problems, and my father is the devil incarnate. They split up when I was ten and a half, and I have lived with my father since. I chose to live with him because my mother was moving to the ghetto, and I thought that my father was a good person, despite all of what my mother told me. I thought she was lieing when she said he put a gun to her head. I thought she was lieing when she said that she got beaten bloody and almost to death multiple times, only staying to keep MY parents together. I had an older brother and two sisters, all three half-siblings, my sisters with a different mother, my brother with a different father. This information will be useful later on. Also, since they split, I had to move, which caused me to lose all of my friends. Never had too many close ones again, partially due to trust problems.

After my parent's split up, me and my father had to share a room in my grandad's house. 5 months in, I would wake up to my father masturbating a mere 2 feet away from me, loudly, with some woman online. I didn't dare open my eyes, but this would be one of my many scars. When he went to clean himself up in the bathroom and came back to bed, I pretended to wake up and I asked what he was doing up. ""Just using the bathroom,"" he said. 
A lie. The first time I was truly disgusted.

Fast forward to January of 2019.  I have some pretty nasty lungs. Not too bad, but not great. Anyways, by this time, I had learned my father has some really bad anger issues. He beat my dog nearly to death at one point. My baby. Also, he would always point out how awful I am, once a day. It would be about random things, but I was apparently not living to his expectations. The only thing he would praise is my beliefs. He would always say I learned my morals from him. This always made my chest ache, as I thought about that night when he masturbated right next to me with some women online. I didn't learn your morals you sick fuck.

One day we were driving down the road, and he lit up a cigarette. When I asked him to roll the windows down, as mine did not work, he told me no, knowing my lungs are already not too great. He then proceeded to play the radio, as loud as the radio can be. I asked him to turn it down due to sensitive hearing and really it just being obnoxious, yet again, ""no."" 
I reached for the knob and turned it down for myself, which was then he struck me, pulled the car over, and told me to get out. I tried to grab my phone, which I bought with my own money, and he threw it. Said I didn't deserve it. Said a whole lot of nasty things, about how I'm a piece of shit. A dumbass. A brat. He yelled at me to get in the car. He pulled us into a parking lot, and he pushed and shoved and got in my face screaming from one end of the lot to the other. He was threatening to kill me and throw me into the ground, a lot of nasty things were threatened.. to his child of 15 years.

The next day, I met a beautiful woman, soon I would call my best friend and girlfriend, and the love of my life. I mean, she was perfect, no doubt in my mind. Unfortunately, around 3 months later, she learned she had a medical condition. On June 27th, 2019, I lost her. Before she passed, I had dressed up and proposed to her. We had so many dreams and we were bound together forever until she was made an Angel... The night I went home, my father asked what happened. I told him she was gone. His response? ""Well, it could be worse. You could have [her condition].""

Fucking sick of him to say.

Fast forward to September 16th, 2019. I get a phone call from my older brother that our Mom was dead. Distraught. Destroyed me. I never saw her enough due to my father's manipulation, telling me everything she said about him, about the abuse, was a lie. Only at this time was I truly not blind, was a time where I could fully see that my father was a fucked up human being. He acted like I shouldn't go to the funeral. MY MOTHERS FUNERAL. HE TOLD ME THIS NOT 20 MINUTES AFTER I LEARNED SHE PASSED. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT?

In January of 2020, I met a woman who, for the first time since the last, I was somewhat interested in. Due to coronavirus in March, and her having to go to Connecticut for college, as she is a year older than I am, we called it quits. This relationship gave me hope, but after it ended, and the covid lockdown began, and I had to spend every day at home with my father, my mental health worsened.

Not only that, but due to COVID in march, my ACT scores are going to be worse, and information regarding college apps is lacking. Im deathly scared I wont get to go to a big school like I want to. This sent me even deeper into depression.

My older sister visited us in june. I hadn't talked to her since before my parents split. Shes 25, 8 years older than I am. That cheered me up while she was here, but we had important conversations, ones about our Dad. She confirmed my moms insane abuse, nearing her death so many times. And I didn't believe her. I called her a liar all those years. This made me EVEN WORSE.

I don't have the motivation to do things anymore. I sleep 12 hours a day. My final ACT test is in a week, I've done almost no further studying... my father is only getting worse. I stopped working out, my abs are gone. Im lonelier than ever and schools will be open in 2 weeks, where masks aren't mandatory... as if my life isn't in danger from the covid...

I'm destroyed. A shell of myself. I don't know what to do.",13Jul2020,1
9,"throw away for reason. im not sure why im posting this now, might just need a place to unload.   
... thoughts will most likely be scattered so read at your own risk lol.

&amp;#x200B;

idk why im depressed, have been for a while.but once your in the shit it just seems like stuff keeps piling on.

quit my job as a electrical apprentice last year something just flipped and any and all motivation to get up was gone.

still have my side business of bike repair but demand is up, supply is down, and stress is way up trying to find parts for a half decent price

when i quit my job i also lost drug coverage, now the drugs im on to get me out of bed are costing me more than rent to actually have a bed. i dont qualify for any new coverage because depression is an existing condition

other than feeling tired, bored, and sometimes angry i dont really feel much

life keeps getting smaller and smaller other than my gf i dont really have anyone to talk to regularly

constant thoughts of death, but no motivation to do any of it, and my dog wouldn't understand why i never came back 

covid isolation came and went, other than having to wear a mask my daily activities haven't changed one bit 

not sure what else to do. ive stopped in life while everything keeps going

im tired... just so tired, mentally, physically, emotionally tired",13Jul2020,1
10,"Every time I go to sleep, I end up laying awake wondering why I exist, sometimes to the point where in the morning, I'm angry at myself for existing. I can't go outside and do anything because I can't do anything good if I don't feel like it. And it doesn't really help that when I don't go outside and do something I get scalded by my mom in a pasive aggressive manner.

I'll often fall asleep with knives in the bed on purpose, or lay awake with a knife laying on my throat, like death is just some sick joke... The joke is getting stale and I don't know what to do. Help",13Jul2020,1

13,"as the title states... i feel really hopeless and i can't even get myself to listen to music or to watch things for fun anymore because it feels like there's no point anymore

i barely eat and this morning i forced myself to try to eat breakfast (bc i was hungry) with my dad bc i didn't want my mom to worry about me because i'm basically nocturnal now and i don't eat more than a couple bites a day anymore

and i saw my dad and how old he'd gotten and how slowly he moved now because of medication and i felt extremely sad again and i tried holding it in but then my mom took the opportunity to dig thru all my shit and pretend to clean my room but i told her that made me uncomfortable and she completely lost her shit and snapped at me immediately 

i was really hungry, but everything was so overwhelming that i just completely lost my appetite after literally 2 bites and had to retreat to my room. i ended up laying in bed staring at the wall with no feeling but numbness and emptiness for like an hour, and then my mom came in to yell at me about my behavior, but i was too tired and numb to speak so i just closed my eyes and pretended to sleep while she stood there in front of me for another 30minutes trying to get me to argue with her until she finally gave up and left and slammed the door

i wanted to order food and eat later, but because of my mom i was too scared to come out of my room to even grab food or water so i just cried and cried until i fell asleep and slept until 10pm (waking up intermittently to try to reply to my boyfriend, who probably was super confused why i text so sporadically nowadays, though i told him i'm kinda depressed).

my mom tells me dealing with my ADHD is hard for *her* but i've done nothing but stay out of her sight and lock myself in my room for the past two months, even keeping myself from, again, getting water to drink or food to eat.

my one best friend reached out to me and asked what was wrong because i was clearly acting different, and i didnt want to speak too much so i just told him im feeling depressed again and my mom's on her bipolar swings again -- and he said he feels like im always overexaggerating and that maybe the crazy behavior runs in the family

at this point, he was the only other human being other than my boyfriend in my life who i had trusted enough to consider my friend and felt comfortable opening up to. i thought losing him would make me cry more, but i just stared at that text and didn't feel anything but just completely empty.

the reason i want to listen to music is because otherwise everything feels so still and empty, but i feel too vulnerable right now and i'm scared it'll push me over the edge and that i'll hurt myself.",13Jul2020,1
15,"The weekend just went too fast and now I have to work in an hour. I really don't want to right now. I'm going to have to go to that Monday morning meeting and I hate that meeting. I'm gonna have to roll over all my tasks from last week because I'm stupid and can't get anything done. 
I'm almost starting to think that working as a programmer or at at least working in a office is just not for me. Or maybe working completely from home isn't for me. 
I've only just finished my first year of university and I can't back out now. But I have another 3 years to go and that's so long. 
Maybe I just really don't like apprenticeships the way I thought I was. I'm constantly embarrassing myself and anxious. I'm always anxious about meetings. I'm always anxious around my colleagues and it's so embarrassing asking for help all the time. It makes me feel so stupid.

19,"Im gonna delete this later but its 1 am and im in the feels rn so hopefully my little voice reaches out to someone ig 

to keep it simple, my older brother (who isn't actually my relative but is basically an older brother to me) hasn't been able to talk to me for a while

this is going to sound dumb as hell but since we live apart and it would be weird to have each other's phone numbers (for personal reasons), our main form of communication is through animal crossing's chat system (weird, but it works)

well long story short he just stopped playing one day

I havent seen him or talked to him in a long while and I miss him

Hes my support system when my parents can't parent right and the first person I came out to 

Im worried about him and honestly I would have hugged him so so much tighter if I knew it would've been the last time

I've tried reaching out to him in other ways with no response 

Its so silly but ever since covid I haven't been able to see him face to face and having your only parental comfort gone like that really stings

20,"I've been having this problem for a while now (3-4 Years) and I've just recently decided to do something about it.  
I have a lot of friends and a lot of families. Still, I feel isolated, lonely and empty. I don't feel like I'm the kinda person I really wanna be. I don't know how I can engage a conversation with people on feelings, thought etc. and I'm afraid of really showing who I am... I've become an IT-expert, not because I think it's funny, but because I've used it to get away from the world.  
This summer I laid IT on the shelve, which made me feel even more empty, and honestly, I don't know any longer what to do... I know I'm not destined to live the rest of my life like this, but it sure feels like it.  
My story:  
Well, where to start? My mother has a temper, only Satan himself could have created... and just to make matters worse, she's also over-emotional. She takes everything you say and twists it to something hurtful, or negative. Then she becomes aggressive, starts yelling, calling you a useless prig, and uses everything you have ever trusted her, against you. Finally, one of two things happen; A) she becomes violent and starts throwing things like ladders at you, or b) you finally get her to shut up, whereon she becomes really sad, and gives me the worst conscience ever.  
My classmates have been a\*\*\*\*\*\*\* for the majority of my life. From kindergarten till 8th grade I was bullied for being different, more emotional, and not a ""typical guy"" So I learned to try and play ""typical guy"" which I failed horribly, and right now I just feel I'm a d\*\*\* because this is not the one I am, I just don't know how to get back.  
In 4th grade, for example, I got an operation in my lip, which went wrong, so I got a scar in my lip, which makes my lip look double.... the second people saw it I was known as the botox disaster, and this latest until I switched school in 8th grade.  
Now I'm not 100% sure what to do, because everyone knows what ""i"" am like, but they don't know what I am like (if it makes any sense) and I don't know how to engage this change, or how anyone will react to it.",13Jul2020,1
21,"Okay I'm going to try and make this short, recently the 2 people who helped me the most with depression was my girlfriend and best friend. My best friend attempted to commit suicide but I stopped him and tomorrow(technically today) he's going to start seeing a therapists for his depression I already have been(an online one because of my situation which I will explain in a bit) but both left me my friend hates me because I stopped him, and my girlfriend(who helped me a lot) dumped me for no reason, and it hurt me. Also how this all started was from my step-dad at first his cancer(liver cancer) was fine he was able to get around a lot play video games with me. And during school some of my friends came and go, during hockey I was bullied for being different and for liking the same gender as myself(I'm part of LGBTQ, please don't judge) and the bullying only stopped for a bit which she was out of town. Which caused it to go deeper, during the rona my step-dad has gotten worse which now if he gets it he has no chance of living, and I'm the only person going in and out of my house so I would blame myself for his death, and I would try online therapy(because rona got me trapped) Also my parents are divorced, my brothers would even bully me for not being able to stand up for myself. So I've been really down recently because of this.  


thanks for reading this, and I would appreciate some advice.",13Jul2020,1
22,"Today was my birthday. About a week before was my friend's birthday. Prior to my friend's birthday, I suffered through some homelife troubles that was crippling enough I couldn't even talk to anyone for three months whilst it was ongoing, and was crushed by the additional stress of the homework I wasnt emotionally equipped to handle. Overtime, I even felt weighed down by the fear that Id become out of touch with my friend group having ignored them for so long,and that the next time I tried to reach out to them itd be awakard since I left immediately after ranting about my home problems ontop of the months apart. Furthermore, I was even juggling some gender identity issues to top it off.

My friend's birthday happens, and I break out of this emotional rut to text him happy birthday, 12 am on the dot, and even join in on the call my friends set up for him. I even pull an all nighter drawing him some birthday fanart. I help arrange a full three days of online video games to celebrate. It felt great, like I never lost my place with my friends.

The day before my birthday comes and Im pretty excited, though dont have much time to hang out with ny friends since I had chores to do. Still, I wanted my last moments being 15 and my first moments being 16 to be as awesome as possible, so I think what better way to do that than with my friend group?

I join the call while Im finishing up on dishes, 30 minutes until my birthday. Only three people are in. The mood is is fucking... gray. I try to lighten it. I mention how excited I am for my birthday art they all were goinh to draw me, and it turns out none of them even bother to get started on it. The aforementionned birthday friend seems to be going through this mood, how hes hit this crippling art blocks, hates having feelings. Not crying, just really tired sounding, like everyone else.

Its okay, it fine. As long as I have some of my friends to hang out with while I wait for my birthday. No one talks at all. Remotely. I cant because my only wireless headphones dont have a mike and i cant have my phone nearby e
Without getting it wet. Its so fucking depressing. Like a retirement home.

Its fine. Theyre all tired. A little depressed. 

12 o clock hits. Nothing. Fine, they cant notice it, but they will. They do. Ten minutes later. Ten minutes of undistracted, pure silence. All I get is an ""oh yeah, happy birthday"" from the closest of the three, and some drawling revelations from the rest. I know ten minutes isnt even that relatively long, but passing by each minute of it wondering when they were gonna remember hurt so much. At some point, it became less about counting down the fanfare and guessing whoever would be the one to care enough. When they did, I just disconnected without saying anything. They didnt ask what was wrong or anything.

I understand depression. I know no one controls when or how hard it hits, but fuck. It burns me up, every problem or suicidal thought I choked down because I knew it would only stress out the people I knew were going through the same thing, and all the times they broke down immediately and vented to everyone. The one time I felt vulnerable enough to vent to them, and they let me dissapear without months of contact until I forced myself to break out of it because I decided my friend knowing I remembered his birthday was more important than my own feelings. That same friend, and everyone else couldnt even be bothered to say two words after 40 minutes of silence and me alrwady being there and waiting.

I know I cant expect everything to be about me, that I cant force my own importance above someone else's depressive rut, but didnt I just do that to myself? Is it really unreasonable to wish theyd have done the same for me? Not even the game night or all nighter, but just two words on time and the presents I was promised? Was it really too much to expect? I cant even feel mad at anyone, I know they would never have done anything like that intentionally and probably love me as a friend, but they probably didnt even realize how much it destroyed me to see that the one day of the year meant for me was so, so isignificant. I dont even get to be mad at anyone but myself for having the audacity to be so excited about one thing.",13Jul2020,1
23,"Things have overall been looking up, but the last two days have been difficult. I barely had enough energy to contact my school's counselling service - they only deal with ""urgent cases"" over the summer, and I hope that growing suicidal ideation fits into that. I want to tell my best friend / roommate about this, and I have briefly, but I can't help but feel I am burdening and inconveniencing them. After all, I'm filling them with so much empty negativity. I also want to reach out to my partner, but I don't think he'd understand. He wouldn't know what to say or do, and I would feel worse knowing that this is something I could've kept to myself. 

I've been struggling with depression for years now; yet, when a ""bad one"" hits, I still don't know what to do. I just brace myself and hope it'll end soon, or that I'll die in my sleep. I'm not even struggling against it at this point because struggle requires energy. I feel so helpless.",13Jul2020,1

I want to be happy, my head feels like a black scribbly cloud and I feel it assaulting my soul constantly.

I've been wanting to kill myself fairly often for months. Yes i have planned it. No i dont intend to do it until a later date. I dont think losing my job having no car and living in a isolated area that i dont fit in on a third of my usual income really makes that surprising that those feelings manifest almost daily. My money situation is managed but bad.

I was officially diagnosed with bulimia years ago but not much has been done about it. Ive also been strongly suspected of depression and SAD and cyclothmania?(whatever the milder form of bi polar is) but I've never officially been diagnosed with those.

I now have frequent panic attacks and cry often.

I can keep my house under control and showered and bills on time but otherwise rarely have a productive day where i actually achieve anthing of substance.

 I'm just existing in this waste of time of a life bubble of hell and struggle to do worthwhile prodcutive things like follow up job leads, cook proper food, fix things in the housd, exercise, list items inwant to sell, teach my self new things. I just have no interest and want to dissappear.

I just want to sleep, I'm not sure what to do. It could be too late once I feel better. I think that's a big part of my fear, taking too long and getting left behind.

Should I just push through this? Or should I wait this out until I feel better about working...",13Jul2020,1
36,"Wife suffers from documented depression. She takes medicine. Takes the edge off. Pass few years she has withdrawn and sleeps all the time ( I chalk it up to being a night nurse) but she sleeps 20+ hours up even if she hasn’t worked in days. She makes “passes” at me but still a dead bedroom. I do almost everything around the house. I’ve been doing projects around the house to take stresses of “things need to be nicer” away from her. She finally started therapy in January but quit because her therapist “kept going in circles”. I’m going to have a discussion with her about finding a new one (she will feel attacked and annoyed, doesn’t matter how nice I am) I’m thinking of asking her to set small goals on a list and ways to obtain them. I want to help her get back on track. She is finally eating healthier and I do everything I can to support it.

I’m just beating myself up and I don’t know what to do. I’ll go on walks to clear my head, I’ll try to get exited about the college Im going to.

38,"This might not be a depression thing but I don’t know where else to ask.

I’ll start this off by saying that being ill with anything and having to be hospitalised is not something to be romanticised and desired, I’m in no way promoting this way of thinking but it’s something I’ve struggled with for the longest time and I wanted additional perspective.

From what little bits of my childhood, I remember wanting to be ill. I remember wanting to need to go to hospital. If I got any kind of symptoms, I would really make a point of making sure my parents knew so I could get help. Majority of the time, they would talk it down and say that if it got to a certain point they would take me to a doctor - it usually didn’t. 

This thought has lessened as I’ve gotten older, since being in hospital for legitimate reasons and suffering with depression and anxiety for years, but I still get it from time to time. I keep thinking I’m ill or that I should admit myself to hospital for mental health reasons. There’s the thought that I just don’t want to deal with real life and I want to be looked after but there’s also the thought that I wouldn’t want to lose my independence and being ill is pretty damn awful. 

I don’t know what to think or what this is. I know it’s wrong. I don’t know why this thought continues to manifest. Any thoughts?",13Jul2020,1
39,"I had planned on going for therapy this summer but the pandemic has delayed it unless there is a vaccine. I am not comfortable with online therapy. I have been self isolating and wearing mask whenever I go out.
My question is, can I heal at home? If yes, where do I start? Is it even possible? I quit smoking cigarettes a month ago, which was a major step in itself. But I need to heal in order to improve other areas of my life. For example, I’m a creative person, but I haven’t made anything good in the past 5 years that I’ve been depressed (plus ptsd from a family event that led to the downfall). I don’t know what to do anymore till the pandemic is controlled enough so I meet a therapist. I am trying to look within and to help myself meanwhile.

40,"Hello, 

I've been in between jobs for as long as I can remember. Even though I did everything I could (go to school, try to get good grades, avoid getting into trouble), I'm still broke and I don't have a career in my field (biology, ecology, that sort of thing). I've been close a few times, but everytime something goes wrong and I'm back to applying. I recently had to quit my terrible part-time job because it was simply too stressful and honestly....kinda degrading. I went to college for 6 freaking years and the best I can do is RETAIL?! I did all kinds of research work and was a teaching assistant. Why the hell can't I find work in my field? Am I really THAT bad of a candidate that I never get selected? 

I'm at my wit's end. If I can't become some kind of scientist by the end of the year, I'm seriously considering ending my life. That, or admitting myself to a mental hospital. Someone, please help me!",13Jul2020,1
41,I fucking hate myself. I have no friends and I’m too scared to talk to anyone. I sit all the time in discord watching people talk and playing video games in fighting game servers because I wish that I could have some sort of interaction like that. I wish I could laugh and talk with someone else or I could just stop them from having fun.Even in small servers when people talk to me I cannot stand to speak back on the fact that I know that they’ll hate me. I left school the last term before coronavirus and I did all my work from home because I was scared of going to school. I have been to three separate child psychology therapists in the last year and I’m currently going to one and all they could tell me was that I had autism and they did not help me at all. I’m going to kill myself within the next year when I get a chance to leave home.,13Jul2020,1
42," Author's Note: I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, and I am also a little OCD.

So, a couple nights ago, my best friend and I decided to hang out. He told me we were hanging out at his ex girlfriend’s house (I had been living with him and his ex when they were dating, but then they broke up and my friend was moving out, so I decided to move out as well). Anyway, on the drive over he told me not to talk about their past relationship. But then he proceeded to play songs about guys who’d had their hearts broken. When we got there, I thought he was making occasional references to their relationship. He was also slapping her ass. I felt like because of the way they were acting with each other, I could say pretty much whatever I wanted to about that situation. So, at one point, I was trying to make a joke about how fucked up it would be if I tried to date my friend’s ex. I should’ve stopped there, but his girlfriend wanted to know what I was gonna say. I asked my friend if he knew what I was gonna say and he just told me to let it go. I brought it up one more time, but then I started feeling guilty. And when I feel guilty about something, I want to talk about it with the person who I feel I have wronged. But he didn’t want to talk about it, so we got into an argument. His ex literally went to bed, and we started there for a little while longer (he was playing a game on his phone, I was watching YouTube, occasionally we would say something to each other, more me than him, though). On the drive back to my place, we started singing songs together. I apologized again for crossing a line and he said “Don’f worry about it. Apologies are for people who’ve done something wrong.” And I also texted his ex the next day and she also said I did nothing wrong. But I feel like I’ve done something wrong. Advice?",13Jul2020,1

I have adjustment reaction with depression and anxiety.
Recently, the therapist in the town left for further studies.

Today, a female friend of mine visited me. We had lunch together. Afterwards, we kissed passionately and she let me fondle with her breasts and make hickeys on them.However, we didn't have sex. And although she was sexy as hell, I felt little pleasure. No adrenaline either.",13Jul2020,1

I know life is unfair for everyone in this world and people have it worse I don’t feel sorry for myself I feel sorry for others for having to go through to much and dealing with me I just wanted help and could never get it I’m sick of carrying on with my life but I can’t end it either life is a rollercoaster of emotions/feelings but only 2 ever seem to exist always a few others but never for long and never often,

My life has been boring, uneventful except  from stupid actions I’ve done nothing has really caused me to be this way it’s just my actions if I just didn’t ask her my life would be better if I didn’t bother to say sure I never would have met them maybe my life would be better maybe it would be worse music was my way to escape life now nothing is even when I’m sleeping it’s not enough I can’t escape this reality of being me can’t handle being that pathetic person people have to deal with all the time I just feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.

I’ve got nothing to live for and it kills me knowing that I will never have anything to truly live for there’s no point to life no point to care or to fight on but yet here I am complaining.

49,"Bit of background, I’m a 27 year old woman who’s in a long term relationship that, up until recently, was also long distance. I have been diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety, both of which I am treating with the antidepressant, Mirtazapine. My depression is on-going but intermittent if that makes sense? It's basically a depression that lasts a few days – a few weeks at a time, that I experience multiple times per year. I don’t know if it’d be accurate to describe myself as chronically depressed as I do have good days and even days where my mood is particularly high, but more often than not I experience periods of incredibly low mood, low energy, low self worth, and massive rejection sensitive dysphoria. 

My partner has always been very loving and supportive of my mental health though I’ve always been able to put on a bit of a brave face with him whenever we would visit each other during the long-distance portion of our relationship. Talking to him about my depression was a lot easier over messenger where I could do it clearly and cohesively, safe in the knowledge that he wouldn’t have to see me in such a ‘state’.

I relocated to move in with him in January and, whilst living with him is categorically one of the best things that has ever happened to me, I currently feel the lowest I’ve ever felt in a long time. I started taking Mirtazapine this time last year due to inability to sleep and suicidal thoughts. Things improved thanks to the medication and I was able to maintain a level mood up until recently. I now feel as though I’m right back down to rock bottom and like I’m fast losing control.

I know times are tough for everybody right now and I’m not the only person to find themselves unemployed and financially dependent on a partner during COVID-19. I’m just really struggling to handle what it does to my self esteem. I know it’s not healthy but I’ve always derived self worth and fulfilment from independence and my ability to provide for others. Not necessarily financially but on a holistic level by actively going out of my way to be a great friend, employee or - in this case - a great partner. 

When we first met I had a great job and a tonne of hobbies and interests to occupy my time. I felt like a well-rounded individual who had a lot of love to give and that I finally found someone who I clicked with on every level. I had a varied and interesting life with plenty to talk about and stories to tell. Now I’m unemployed and getting less than half my rent on income support (all of which I give to my partner to supplement our outgoings). Since the move I haven’t had any opportunity to cultivate my own group of friends or hobbies in this new location and my day-to-day is much of the same thanks to the global pandemic. I have things I enjoy doing at home such as gaming, gardening, cooking, and going out running but my depression is making it very difficult to find the energy to do/derive joy from these things.

My partner and I have very little to talk about because there is very little going on and when we do talk I find my mood is so low I’m unable to hold a conversation or be fun and engaging no matter how hard I try. My thoughts are scattered and I cannot concentrate on anything at the moment. I feel like a huge burden on him and a total mess as I’m now swinging from pulling away and isolating myself one minute to hysterically crying the next. I know it must be incredibly difficult to deal with and my uncontrollable moods just make me feel even more of a burden. The thing is, when I say uncontrollable I really mean it. Most of my day is spent wearing my human suit trying to function and the cracks are really starting to show. 

I’m terrified of what this is doing to my relationship and to my partner’s mental health. To top it off, my partner’s best friend and ex romantic partner is currently staying with us due to a housing issue. I have absolutely no trust issues with my partner and don’t for a second think he would cheat on me, hence me having no problem with his ex moving in. However, his friend is obviously providing him with a much needed distraction and the two of them get along so well and laugh so much that I feel like they’d be better off together at the moment since he obviously has the capacity to be attracted to them and I am bringing absolutely nothing to our relationship besides daily tears and the occasional panic attack.

In the past when things have been rough I’ve always thought I could fall back on the fact I was kind of fun to be around or was relatively intelligent enough to converse about interesting topics. Thanks to my low self esteem and massive brain fog, I now feel like the dullest person alive and that I can’t help the awful stuff inside of me spilling out and impacting the vibe in the house. I feel worthless and I feel like I’m asking far too much of my partner to support me through things. I need help, advice, anything I can get to not let my shit brain ruin the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had.",13Jul2020,1
50,"And I don't know what to do about it. I don't have depression, and I cannot truly understand what she is going through.

She is often sad, dark and unmotivated, and I don't know how to deal with that. I heard, that when you have a depressed friend what you need to do is tell them you'll allways be there for them when they need someone; never judge or try to change them in any way, and litsen to them when they wish to open up. That's what I'm doing with her, but I feel like it's not enough.

Not to long ago we talked and she told me how stressed she was about an upcoming test, tears in her eyes. I didn't know what to say to her to make her feel better and reassure her. I'm really bad at talking to people as it is, and with her it's even harder. In the end a teacher saw her and they talked in privetaly, and the teacher helped her.

Please help me. I don't know what to say and do. I don't know what kind of friend I need to be for her, and I allways end up feeling like I made things worse. How do I deal with her?

52,"Hello! I’m just looking for some help for something I’m experiencing. So I have been diagnosed with depression for about 7 years and autism for 1 year. I’m currently a student at a university about 35 mins away from where I grew up. Currently I am living near the university in a house with friends, but our lease ends at the end of the month so I will probably be moving back home because I have an internship in the fall. I should mention that I was doing an internship in another state in the spring, but I went back home mid march when corona was getting bad, and I stayed home until May, which is when I moved in with my friends. During quarantine when I lived at home, my mental health was starting to get worse and worse. Once I moved in with my friends, it got a lot better. However, I’ve noticed that every time I go to visit home even for a few days I get super depressed, and it seems to be for no reason. I’m taking a summer semester right now, so I am a little stressed, but still doesn’t explain why I feel so bad at home. I don’t really have a toxic family, although my sisters and parents get in fights. I just don’t know what it is about going home that makes me feel like this.

But nobody starts a convo with me or asks me how things are very often. It's felt that way for a while and I'm not sure if the depression is clouding my judgement about how much people are reading out to me.
