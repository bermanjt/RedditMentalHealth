0,"Hi, I \[34F\] started taking fluoxetine three months ago for anxiety and depression. I've noticed that it's significantly helped with my anxiety and mood -- I feel much less anxious and sad. However, I've also noticed that it's hard to motivate to do self-care. I have been binge eating junk food, and I have had a more difficult time keeping up with my usual hygiene (like making sure I shower, brush my teeth and put pajamas on before bed instead of just sleeping in my clothes). I've also felt simultaneously like I have more energy and interest in being there for friends and family and like I'm getting more burnt out because of it. I'm not sure if this is common, or just depression but without anxiety. I wondered if this board had any thoughts/advice?",16Feb2020,1
1,"I have really few friends (which I appreciate) but sometimes they stop talking to me for months, or they are busy, at college, at work or whatever. And I understand it, cause I’m a busy person too, but sometimes I feel like I’m a burden for them so I keep everything to myself so I don’t bother them. 


I have been depressed for several years, which has made me feel nothing. I've recently felt several things at the same time that I don't know how to explain it and it’s hard for me to process it since I’ve felt empty for so long and I don’t even know what to do. 

But right now none of my friends are here for me and I just want to talk to someone",16Feb2020,1
2,"hi. i guess to start i’m 15F who was diagnosed w depression at 13. it got... a lot worse in around november when i straight up stopped wanting to be alive. upped the antidepressants, sort of helps sometimes. i guess the thing is, i don’t know how to take care of myself. well, i know how to do everything, but i can’t bring myself to do it and i don’t know why. for example, my room being messy makes me anxious, but i haven’t cleaned it in months. i haven’t done laundry in nearly two months, despite the fact that i am fully capable of doing it and it would probably only take about two days. i haven’t brushed my teeth in longer, let alone washed my face with actual face wash instead of shower water. i want to clean my room so bad, but it is so so so so hard for me to get up and do it and i don’t know why. help?",16Feb2020,1
3,"Suicidal ideation without a plan is more like it I guess. I've spent the past 5 years improving my life and I've accomplished many of the goals I've set for myself, I cut out drugs, alcohol, toxic people and behaviors, I've got a lot going for me and I've accomplished more than most of my peers. I keep pushing forward, assuming god has a reason for my life. I have no desire to keep going, yet I dont want to make mom sad. I've put effort into making myself a more likeable person and I have a lot of friends. I've spent a lot of time trying to find how to make myself happy. I've been on a lot of meds over the years. I've taken time off work to go ""find myself."" I have a lot of wisdom to share, although noone is interested in hearing it. I feel so alone and I see the people around me having a great time. I just cant remember the last time I've had a day without the heaviness. I am trying so hard to ignore the comfort of death. The world is going to do what it does, why do I have to suffer along with it.
Sorry for the rant, but anonymity is hard to come by and I've kept my mouth shut for so long.",16Feb2020,1
4,I haven’t been eating much lately because I feel a mixture of not having appetite.. and feeling guilty. I feel guilty that I cost my mum money in food because I’m not worth the money that goes into raising a child. I don’t think I’m worth it for the amount of happiness I give her. She’s told me I’m being silly and of course I can eat whenever I want to and help myself to food but I just don’t feel like eating,16Feb2020,1
5,"I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and self-harm for about six years. About a year ago I went to the doctor for the first time and was prescribed anti depressants and referred to camhs. It didn't help and my self harm was getting deeper each time, and I ended up in A&amp;E for sutures four times over the year. In summer last year, I reached my breaking point and took an overdose, but ending up being taken to hospital, then spent four months in a psych ward, which was just horrible. 

I've been on 5 different medications (Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Quetiapine, Mirtazipine and now Citalopram) but I don'#t feel like any have helped much. 

I'm moving to adult services sometime next week and I don't know what they can do to help to be honest because I struggle so much to talk to anyone like I just sit there panicky unable to say what;s going on because half the time I just don't know anymore. 

I try not to cut myself but it's so hard because I feel like I deserve all the pain  I get and I feel like an awful friend to everyone and just a horrible burden on everyone's lives. I have nightmares almost every night and my sleep is never restful. I wake up exhausted all the time.

I feel so numb a lot of the time, and feel so flat like I just can't think straight and nothing matters. Or other times I'll just sob because I'm so lost about what to do because I feel like it's all my fault I'm like this. I feel like my two friends genuinely hate me and only speak to me out of pity but they don't actually like me at all. People say they care but I just don't believe them. They both have better, nicer, more worthwhile friends they hang around with I'm definietly not worth their time.

I don't even think I'm mentally ill despite being diagnosed with severe depressive disorder and anxiety, I kinda just feel like it's just who I am, like my personality and not an illness and that I'll be stuck like this forever. 

I'm 18 now, starting my A Levels in September because I had to quit college cos of how much I couldn't cope with even getting out of bed. I only leave the house to buy dog food, visit my dad and go to appointments. I get so anxious just being in the shops, especially on my own. 

I'm so goddamn tired of living like this I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die, but I want to stop feeling like this and I can't see what else I could do to stop it. 

Someone please help me I'm so sick of it all I don't know what to do",16Feb2020,1
6,"So I lost my dog back in December. She was my best friend and a really sweet dog. That hurt like a mf. Then the girl that was just a really good friend to me, who ended up becoming really close to me, moves to Vegas for her job for 6 months and I was going to shoot my shot but I was out of town for work and didn’t get back until after she left. Then this same job I work at is just making me so damn miserable but it’s a decent job and I’m not an idiot who’s just going to quite before I find something better. Home life sucks too, which is probably why I spend most of my time alone. Sometimes I wish I could just check out until things get better. It does get better, right?",16Feb2020,1
7,"I recently had to ask her about the lack of sex / and her disallowing me from playing around with her boobs, ass, etc.  because its been about 2 weeks of me not being able to really do anything sexual with her, and this has never happened before. I asked if she's losing interest in me. She didn't really answer me, but later texted me at when she was at work and said it had nothing to do with me, she's just been feeling depressed lately with her grandma passing a few weeks ago, then more recently, our cat who quickly had its health deteriorate very rapidly, to the point that the vet recommended she be put down which we had to. she also said she was sad about her dad who passed away last year, and her mom isn't too healthy either. 

I said i would be there for her, and i try to make her happy, but her emotions range from annoyed, to blah, to trying to allow me to make her happy but quickly goes back to a more depressed state.

Today she goes to work and texts me [this](https://imgur.com/a/El42xL9) and i have no idea what I can do to help, or don't know if there is anything i can do. I am writing to this sub to help gives me ideas on how to react to her state of depression, and to learn if there is anything i can do at all.",16Feb2020,1
8,"I don’t know why I post stuff like this anyways, it feels like screaming at a wall. I guess I just talk to myself too much, it’s good to let someone else listen. I see the word introvert thrown around a lot. It’s like when people say “oh I have such bad ocd” when it comes to which way the toilet paper rolls. I’m not an introvert. I don’t have social anxiety. I can have problems with crowds, getting overwhelmed and weak, but I’m not afraid of people. I’m not the person who relies on like minded people; I already talk to myself, I don’t need to do it again. Isolating? That’s probably the best term, but no I don’t cut myself off. I’m just as socially capable as anyone else. Yet, I like to be alone. I guess I’m just one of those people; the kind who where headphones all the time so they can hear something else. I just feel so lonely all the time, but when I try to do like others do, it doesn’t feel right. It’s like I’m a man out of time, like I was stuck in my headphones so long that I lost my humanity. My mom calls me an old soul, no one wants to love a 20 year old hermit. I’ve always been popular; the kind of person who fills the gaps, whoever they are. So I’m a fun guy, just to closed off. No that’s not right, I don’t really shut my heart. I pour it out whenever I feel like it, that’s why I’m old. People want to go to parties, not therapy. So I just go out and hookup with older guys; they don’t try to impress. I really want to fall in love, but I just never do. I get bored or something, I never go back to the same guy twice. So sex and love and friends and fun are all boring, and I’m left with myself. I’m not boring, that’s why I spend so much time alone, right? No, that’s not right. I’m just as bored of me as I am of everything else, so what am I supposed to do? I wish I could find somewhere empty. There’s more than one kind of empty you know. A ghost town is empty, but so is a studio apartment. I want an empty room in an empty sky, looking at a city packed to the brim with smug superiority. An empty job too, where I could work alone, and an empty bar, where I’m famous. Problem is, there’s not a lot of empty left. I sleep too much, dreams are always empty. I wish I could sleep forever",16Feb2020,1
10,"    Well, I don't know exactly how to start this off but hello  name is Christopher, 16, and currently a high school student. I currently in a bad spot in my life and I wanted to ask Redditors for support or advice. I'll talk about a numbers of topics but it's mostly about people who I thought were my friends but it didn't end up being the case now that I think about it. 

My Last Girlfriend (High school year):
My last girl was the focus of my life for about an year and a half before we broke up due shit was saying to most of my friends such as ""I'll kill them""and etc. Even, with these issues, I still loved her. She always seemed to care about me and cared about my depression currently those years but of course that isn't the case now. She didn't exactly take our breakup lightly but I tried to make it as painless as I could. Once I got home that day, I just seemed to throw away a part of me that I hated but still let loved but, I tried to move forward either way.

The rest of the months after the event, it was never really the same for me. I missed having someone next to me, ready to be cuddled and loved. But now, I deal with the fact that she hates my guts and is possibly seeing other guy.. that's probably better than anything I could give her and I can't never change it back. I have to live with the choice. 

A friendship I killed (End of middle to current day High school):
While the end of my middle school career, I met a girl that I liked for a good while but we had a unfortunate situation during the summer which ended up breaking apart for a good while until we saw each other during the start of our high school year. It was all same until my last Girlfriend had entered my life and they both started hating each other. I was stuck on who to pick at first but I ended picking my girlfriend which ended up splitting us away from each other more. Now, I deal with the fact that she couldn't give two fucks about me now and sees me as a r/niceguy due to me trying multiple times to fix our friendship but it ended up fucking it more. We don't even speak anymore. 

Now, I just deal with the fact that I don't really have anyone to talk too or care for anymore. Most of my supposedly friends just seem like people I just talk too and nothing more. I try to hide my emotions by being a asshole whenever I can find the perfect time or situation.

I have one really friend I love to have with me at every moment of my life but I can't because she has a boyfriend and I don't trust her being with me. I don't wanna lose her as my friend or anything else in my year.

Please just help with my life Reddit",16Feb2020,1
12,"I have been suffering from depression for the last 7 years. Before that I had a good life - great childhood, good at studies, outgoing. Now when I  try to enjoy a rare moment of happiness even if they are small, my brain just recalls the previous times again and starts comparing. The thought of  having to tell myself to enjoy such a small thing  makes the whole thing meaningless immediately. Happiness starts seeming even more elusive. It's like the more I try to be happy the more I get depressed.",16Feb2020,1
14,"I've been going to therapy for a while now and I'm currently taking medication (I see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist), but it seems like nothing is changing. In fact, things actually seem to be getting worse. My psychologist is very kind and smart, but she doesn't know what to do with me anymore. I have things I know I have to work through, but I'm not able to talk about them, most of the time because I am ashamed and fear the judgement, even though I am aware that she is a professional and is there to help. I keep withholding information from her. 

So I've been thinking about trying online therapy. Just writing down my thoughts and sharing them with a professional I don't have to face. I think I have avoidant personality disorder, and that's why I am struggling so much with getting the help I need. 

Has anybody here tried this? Could you share your experience with me?

Thank you, byeee =\^-\^=",16Feb2020,1
15,"I’ve had a crush on this girl since high school , it didn’t really work out but we stayed as friends and recently became best friends (however it is important to state that I do still have feelings for her), it’s to the point that we never go more than a day without talking and we tell each other everything, I’ve been living with depression and anxiety for the majority of my life and its always telling me that no one likes me and I have no friends and that I’m alone, most nights I feel so alone that I don’t get much sleep because I’m in tears but she’s always there to talk and having her to confide in and talk to helps a lot.

recently she started talking to someone on a dating app and I have absolutely no problems with it, I want her to be happy above all else, but she seems so into him that I’m afraid that she’ll replace me because she likes him more.  I’ve told her how I feel and that above all else I want her to be happy but she doesn’t seem to see how it fully affects me seeing as how I still have feelings for her, I’m literally the first person she tells about everything he says and it’s gotten to the point that just to talk to her I need to calm myself down for a while, id never try to sway her or control her but I’m afraid of being left behind in her life as someone she used to be friends with but then stopped taking to.

The only reason I feel this intensely about it is because I’ve been left behind in the past, I lost my mother and have been cheated on and left for “better” men so I can definitely see where I’d get abandonment issues from but I’m not sure I’d be able to handle losing anyone else important to me

17,"I feel so alone. I'm in medical school and I'm depressed. I've never felt like this before. I've fallen out with both my Father and Mother, and almost my sister too because she refuses to see the different treatment I get from them compared to her. It makes me feel so unloved. 

So now that I have no family support, I am left with nothing. I am one of those friends that is the 'listener' and now that I am struggling, they have never experienced me asking for help so they are treating it like a joke. They find it awkward. 

I'm currently sitting in the car with my cat. She is purring and her tortoiseshell coat is soaking up my tears.",16Feb2020,1
19,"Obligatory:

* Please forgive my formatting, spelling &amp; grammar mistakes, etc
* Please suggest I post elsewhere if appropriate
* Other that I'm forgetting just now

Small summary first - I get these experiences I call ""emotional hangovers"" from dreams where I strongly feel the sorrow, sadness, incredibly deep love, misery, or similar sometimes up to weeks after the dream. I don't know how to handle this kind of thing so I'm asking for any advice you could provide.  


Some background information for reference - I'm led to believe from discussions with peers, reading online, etc, I don't dream as much as a person normally would. From early on &amp; throughout childhood and adolescence I would recall having had dreams overnight *sometimes* and remembering any part of a dream even less.   
At some time in my early-mid 20's I just stopped dreaming or stopped recalling any dreams at all, except on the rarest of occasions. Generally those dreams occurred when I was doing something abnormal like staying up til after dawn. I think always they were violent, but like over the top cheesy where you can't punch hard enough or shoot somebody enough times, that kind of thing.  
In recent years I've been medicated for depression and anxiety and during this time, dreams have abruptly come back into my life. Now though, when I dream not only do some of the scenes remain in my memory &amp; come back as flashbacks, those flashbacks come with strong emotions attached (or the emotions come first with the images attached), if ""attached"" makes sense.

It's my understanding that it's quite common for someone to be able to recall an element, a scene, or an entire storyline of a dream. Not so sure about emotions in a dream. I don't think it's common to relive moments from dreams - is this a common thing?

I find myself reliving moments from dreams quite a lot since beginning medicinal treatment for my depression and anxiety &amp; having my ability to dream return. Reliving the moments often means both visually and emotionally. Also this can last for different amounts of time, like - 

* from waking up, constantly, until up to 2 hours later depending on how visually or emotionally ""vibrant"" the dream was
* after that, short moments lasting a few seconds that, again depending on the ""vibrancy"" of the dreams, can last months, as in:

Also for some reason I can't comprehend, I'm convinced there is a link between each of the dreams, not like a continuous running narrative but like some places are repeated or they look different but it ""feels"" like it's the same place, a weird sensation like that. This sensation of a link can mean I can get these short re-livings of dreams that sort of 'build up' in emotional and visual weight. it's hard to explain or quantify in any other way than that - the 'weight' or 'significance' builds up like each re-living is made of multiple layers of different dream experiences.  


On top of this, I see it linking to my experiences smoking weed - where it's like one of the only true honest and happy times of my life, but it's 50/50 RAD/MORBID where I see all things as just ""one"". Like, when I get stoned I get soooooo happy but I also (I don't consider it paranoia but maybe it is?) keep thinking about what life is going to be like when I'm not high, to the point where I cannot fully enjoy the high itself. Something that encourages this is that, if I do have a decent high not just a light buzz, I get depersonalisation/disassociation for about 2 days following. So, if I get a good high going it's always 50/50 complimented with a dread about the upcoming disassociation crap, which I truly struggle with.

Okay, so I've been writing this over 3 days whenever I've got a break inbetween everything else in life.  While I have the chance, this will completely out me to anyone i've spoken about this to recently I think, but I've had 2 good dreams recently - which I perceived as amazing and real experiences that I have lived through but which in hindsight turned out to be completely imaginary - and have been left with positive emotional hangovers, these are quelled much more quickly by real live than the negative ones are, they seem to last forever.

I don't know if anyone will have read this far but if you have, sorry I wasn't able to do so before now but I'm just looking for advice on how I could best handle these ""emotion hangover"" things. Thanks in advance.",16Feb2020,1
20,"I’m just so so so sick and tired of it. Almost every freaking day, it’s an argument over something stupid and minor. I just want to get out of this house. 
It’s been like this since forever ! . At first I would just be quiet and try to ignore it but they’re yelling is intense. Like screaming to the point where their voices become hoarse and they’re banging doors and draws. I hated it so much I started becoming involved and whenever they’d argue I’d scream “STOP” over and over so each of them couldn’t hear each other and would just stop. I know it may be wrong of me to do that but I just couldn’t take it anymore. Every time I try to seek for help or soemthing ppl just tell me there’s nothing I can really do , it’s up to them. They hate each other but they don’t want to get divorce because of me and my siblings. I just cant deal with this anymore , I just want to disappear so I don’t have to hear their shouting anymore.
I feel like it’s too much to bear because whenever they argue my mum would start yelling at me and then she would tell me that if I keep stopping her from arguing / saying the things she wants she will probably go insane and have to go to the hospital ? And she kept on saying she would have commit suicide already , but because of the kids she can’t. 
There were times when they’d argue and my dad would take out a knife and threaten to kill himself. 
It’s just too much. 
Sometimes I think maybe if I was dead they’d realise that what they’re doing is having a deep impact on the kids. I know that’s selfish of me to think , but i just idk what to do anymore.

No one cares and honestly if i could disappear i doubt anyone would realise but such is life. my depression has killed my relationships with the people i care about and honestly i don’t have the energy emotionally mentally and physically to do anything about it. so for tonight i’m going to be praying to God that when i wake up i can forget about everything that happened today. forget about the people i said good bye to and wake up  feeling like i might be able to survive tomorrow.",16Feb2020,1

His sleep schedule is very bad. He won’t get to bed until 6 in the morning as he can’t sleep and he will sleep until as late as 5pm. He sleeps through alarms and often misses appointments or work.

That's the reason i moved to another country in the end, to make a better life for myself, not drown in self pitty and sorrow. But the lack of motivation and fear of repeating mistakes from the past is paralyzing and thinking leaves me with barely enough energy to get out of bed and drag myself to work. How does this happen, it was never this severe. Thinking about seeking professional help makes me even more anxious because of the language barriere.

27,"Hello! I am a 23 year old female working in retail management. I have struggled with depression on and off in life (the worst period being around 21) but the past few years have been able to keep it at bay. I got a new job about 6 months ago that I really like for the most part ( good benefits, pay, etc). I just was able to take 11 days  time off (5 of those days paid) and told myself I’d use it to get a bunch of stuff done around my new apartment. Well, my vacation ends in two days and I feel depressed and drained. It’s not like I got nothing accomplished, but I took many days where I did nothing but sleep half the day and watch tv. I ordered a bunch of furniture for my spare room and it’s just sitting there half assembled. I took a 2 hour nap. I feel unmotivated, exhausted and drained. Part of me is dreading going back to work because if I can’t get a good routine going when I’m off, how am I going to make time for it with my irregular world schedule? Another part of me just wants to be busy again and can’t wait to go back to work. Why can’t I just feel awake and not exhausted? Why can’t I feel motivated? I’m so frustrated with myself. 


TLDR: I feel stressed and like I have no time for myself with my work schedule, but just took almost 2 weeks off and feel depressed and drained. What’s wrong with me?",16Feb2020,1
30,"Friday night I had bad anxiety attack. I couldn't breath, I couldn't stop sobbing. I just wanted to die. I dont want be a burden anymore. I hate myself so much and I feel so terrible about what I am putting everyone through but I dont know how to change.

Somehow I have been ruining my life, one bad decision at a time. This year has been a slew of fuckups and we are only in Feb. I feel so incredibly insecure and depressed and I dont know where to go from here. I dont know how I became this person and I dont know how to go back to who I was. I am a pos that doesn't deserve the love I get from the people in my life. 

It all started going wrong last year. I took my amazing husband for granted. He supported me and loved me even when I was difficult. Then it's like I am just getting hit with bad karma constantly. 

First my car broke down, it's pretty much a write off so my parents were nice enough to let me borrow their car. Then I got robbed, it was my fault. It was the early morning hours. I didn't go home with my husband, I wanted to stay and drink more. I should have just gone home. I was drunk standing outside the bar venue when I got robbed. What was I thinking?! I fucking wasn't. 

My husband helped me get a new phone, which now has a cracked screen. I dont even remember dropping it! I was drunk the night before. Then I bumped my parents car and now have to get it fixed before I see them again. My husband told me not to drive coz I had been drinking. I just wanted to go home, I didn't want to listen to him. Its gonna cost quite a bit of money now and I am already in debt from my inability to work with money. 

I feel so depressed all the time. Maybe I am self destructing, I dont know, but I can't keep doing this.",16Feb2020,1
31,"I've been depressed since I was a kid. Meds have been useless. Seen various psychiatrists and psychologists between 18 and now (27). I have never found therapy helpful, and usually find that it makes things \*worse\*. I don't trust or believe in the process (I'm fully aware that many people swear by it) and I'm so jaded and skeptical after having half my life stolen from me. We quickly run out of things to talk about since there's usually nothing I want to talk about, or I'm not willing to be open about what I'm truly thinking. I feel like I'm being judged even though I know I'm not. 

Learning the cognitive distortions and such are not helpful because I'm fully aware that my concerns are irrational, yet the negative thoughts still occur, they still bother me, and I ruminate about them endlessly for years. It gets to the point where I stop bringing them up because it's just beating a dead horse. 

Meds are a dead-end, so I get inundated with friends and family telling me I need to go back to therapy. I primarily need to learn to stop comparing myself to others, stop ruminating about past slights (I mean every second of every day for years on end), and stop regarding myself as useless/worthless. I don't think talking things out will help with the insomnia/exhaustion, apathy, resentment, inability to feel satisfied with anything, etc.

Also in a highly confidence based career where one of my subordinates said I have “ no backbone” and she’s right. I’m fucking fat too. And don’t say-“go seek professional help” because that’s not an option for me. The services offered when I went said “you can keep seeking the help you’re looking for here but you’ll lose your job due to the fact that this goes on your record”. So can’t talk to anyone except talk to reddit apparently. I do nothing in my free time except numb myself to my thoughts and the world, because anytime I tune into my thoughts all I hear is “you’re a piece of shit” “you’re trash” or just the lain old “fuck you” I’m a piece of trash that will just wither up and die without anyone caring. I’ve tried pushing through this shit before but I always regress Fuck everything",16Feb2020,1
37,"I've not always been a good person, they man I am today would despise the man I used to be. In short, I've fucked up a lot in my past and lately I've been ruminating on it. How can I move past it and not let this interfere with my life any longer? Really struggling right now.",16Feb2020,1
38,"With the onset of my depressive disorder I also started getting grey hair. This started around 23, and now, being 26, I have pretty grey hair on the sides. It‘s as much as some people have in their 50s. 
I am male and it’s on the sides/back exclusively so that’s okay, but I feel way too young for this... some people are irritated lol.

The greying always increased during/after a severe depression (&gt;6 months), you know the increased stress levels and all that...

Has someone experienced the same?",16Feb2020,1
40,There was a point sometime ago where I just realized that I’m always a secondary friend and nothing I do really makes me happy it feels like all the emotions that I once had have been dulled to the point of just nothing good or bad no one really talks to me I really have anything to do I feel like I just want to do you nothing for the rest of my life,16Feb2020,1
41,"Hi friends! First post here so please excuse any formatting mishaps if they’re here.

I’m diagnosed with MDD and SAD (and some anxiety-related things) and I’m on the rise out of an episode right now. I want to clean my room to help with the progress I’ve been making lately and I know that I do well with a set list of things to accomplish, so I want to make a game plan that I can work off of. My room’s pretty small (student apartment) and I share it with my boyfriend, so I don’t have much space to work with. We do have our own bathroom though, and that’s usually easier to maintain than the bedroom.

Does anyone here have any tips or tricks for how you clean your room and maintain it after it’s been pretty messy/unorganized for awhile?

Thanks for reading! Good luck today",16Feb2020,1
42,"Currently I'm a freshman guy in college and been having a lot of fun with my new friends, especially one who has become really my best friends. We do almost everything together but now he wants to join a fraternity and I gave it a shot for a couple weeks but it just isn't for me. Don't get me wrong all the people there are great but I just don't enjoy the events as much as my friend does. Whats really been upsetting me is that I'm going to drop but he will almost certainly stay in the fraternity, so then I'm left alone to do nothing until they come back. I'll miss out on all the inside jokes and funny things that happen and just will feel pushed away. The other unsettling thing is we are rooming together next year and even possibly room together off campus junior year but once you're in the fraternity you're in for life and I know that once he's in he wont want to leave. I just feel like I'm going to be left out of everything interesting or fun for the rest of my time. The only solution I could have is to find new friends to do things with but then I feel like my best friend would feel like I'm pushing him away. I've really been struggling with this and have no idea what I'm going to do, so any advice would really be appreciated...",16Feb2020,1
