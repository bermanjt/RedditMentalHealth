0,"Diagnosed with severe depression. 

Let me start by saying, I am very lucky, being a key worker in a hospital I am still working throughout with job security and means I am still able to find some routine. I understand many are having a worse experience. 

My depression is dragging me under. I live alone and despite my being able to go to work a few times a week (working from home on others), I feel as though I cannot physically take another day of this. I am isolated completely from my family and friends. I have no car or nearby outside space to go too and I am caged in my little flat with noisy selfish nasty neighbours. I was infected and battled covid-19 alone and again I was very lucky and avoided hospital admission, although did require medical attention. 

I recognise now that my mental health has declined, I will have to wait until tomorrow to contact my GP to see whether I can be put back on my medication, even though I have not long stopped it. 

I try to enjoy my hobbies and I have someone I met online that we have formed a really nice bond which helps me as a distraction, but lately it is adding to my frustration of being locked away from the world. My life like so everyone has a huge pause button pressed right now.

Working in a hospital I understand the reasons for these measures, but I see and experience so much now that it is chipping my reliance and strength even further that a friendly face or a hug is desperately needed. My colleagues are great but they all have families at home or I am not close enough with them to be able to see them as friends. When it was weeks 1-4 fine, but the realisation that this can go on even longer is draining. 

I want to see grass again. I want to see my grandparents, my siblings, my best friend without just being through a phone screen. I want to hug those that I love. I want my Saturdays visiting my family back, my train journeys to somewhere different. Like everyone else, I want and need something that resembles normal life. 

I cannot see the end. I just see endless days of nothing and work. One more, just one pointless day and I know I will crumble completely. I want to be strong for my team at work, for my patients, I want to show my siblings my huge smile on video chat so they do not need to worry. The urge to sleep for days however is getting overwhelming. 

Hopefully my GP acts quickly. 

Poor mental health is going to kill me and countless others not Coronavirus. I advocate adhering to lock down rules and keeping people safe. I am in no way going to put anyone at unnecessary risk as my mind is dragging me into the blackness. Therefore I rant, I despair and I wallow hoping to shed some of my negativity so tomorrow I can paint on a face of bravery and work through it.",24Apr2020,1
1,The older I’ve gotten the more hateful I’ve become. Every time I start feeling good I think back to a time someone did something bad to me. I still haven’t let go of grudges from the time I was in elementary school. I hate everyone so much on an individual level. It’s gotten to the point where hearing about mass shootings and homicide and people killing themselves makes me glad because I hate everyone so goddamn much. If I could nuke the entire Earth I would and I wouldn’t even hesitate. And I’m not some angsty teenager who tries to be edgy for the sake of being edgy. The hatred I feel constantly for everyone is so immense I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t even really want to stop hating people. I don’t think I can.,24Apr2020,1
2,"Hello Reddit, Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. I am 20 years old and have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. So anyways, to give you context I live with my great grandmother who is 81 and help take care of her while I am also trying to get my life on track. My whole life she has been pretty mean, selfish, abd gets angry for reasons that make no sense. She never takes the blame for anything and tries to make me feel bad if I do something she doesnt like or approve of. So anyways, both me and my grandma got the stimulus checks from the government. I used some of mine to buy new headphones and pay for college things. I feel bad becuase I know a lot of people are really struggling and we are not, I don't really need the money. Before the money came I offered to just give my grandma the check to help pay the bills or whatever.  She said no keep it its your money. So ontop of the things I spent it on, I donated $100 to charity and put the rest in my savings. I was excited and happy that I could give money to help someone in need during the situation we are all in. Well, that got shut down really quick. When I told my grandma she asked how much did I donate? When I told her she became extremely angry and said ""oh I coulda used that!"" So I got kinda bummed out and said sorry, I didn't know and you said before you didn't want any of it, and I offered to at least pay the phone bill for the next few months. She just continued to yell at me and put me down telling me ""you need to think about and help us out HERE at home first!, not just give your money away!"" So I just left crying becuase she made me feel like shit and put me down yelling at me. Now shes is super angry and will not talk to me, all she's said since is ""you hurt my feelings because you know we are not rich and how high our bills are."" I feel like an asshole now and I've just been in bed all day scared to leave my room. She's was fine with me buying things for school but as soon as I said charity she lost it and just keeps ignoring me and saying I hurt her.",24Apr2020,1
3,"I’m lonely and need help

Hello everyone. It’s my first time making a reddit post. I am 24 and suffer from severe depression. It runs in both sides of my family.

Anyway, I think my mental state has been getting worse and worse lately. I’ve always had thoughts about suicide but nowadays it’s all I think about. I even make plans sometimes. I wish I was in California. I’d take a walk, get high, and jump of the Golden Gate Bridge.

But the thing is i can’t do it. I can’t leave my mom behind. I don’t want to hurt her. 

I have no friends and I am not super close to my family. Nowadays I cry multiple times a day and I have no one to talk to. I feel pathetic. I’m even crying as I write this.

I don’t want to kill myself because I can’t do that to my mom, and I don’t imagine I’ll die of natural causes anytime soon. I’m just in a state of misery. I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford therapy and my antidepressants never work so I stopped taking them a few weeks ago.

I can’t make friends. I think I might be on the spectrum or something. I don’t know though. I have no one to talk to and I’m just so lonely.  I haven’t been to a good doctor since I was like fifteen so I wonder is it just depression? Sometimes I think I might be bipolar too or even schizophrenic but I’m not an expert. 

I never feel like myself anymore. I am just sad pathetic person living in my body. Nothing brings me happiness and I don’t want to live anymore. Some days are awful, some are tolerable, but overall it’s getting worse

Anytime I try and reach out to people I overwhelm them and they stop talking to me. I’ve been self destructive and pushing people away.  I can’t even do my school work anymore and I’m swamped with work I need to do

My girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago and she’s living a happy life. She told all her friends (people I thought liked me) that I am suicidal (even though I never wanted people to know). Even though people know this no one has reached out to me. No one asked how I felt about the break up no one asked how I am no one cares that I’m quarantined. No one cares about me. 

I recently hacked into one of her accounts. I know I shouldn’t have it’s an invasion of privacy and a dick move. But I was reading her messages with her friends and all they say is fuck him (me) and that I’m a piece of shit. I know I’m not the perfect person but I didn’t think I was that bad. I can’t see all the messages cause it’s only one social media account out of many. She said in the messages that I wasted five years of her life. To me those were the best five years of my life. I never meant to be a bad person. 

People always talk about mental health awareness and acceptance but when they see an example of it they just label me as a jerk or something. Anytime my ex tweets that she’s sad or something she gets like a dozen replies telling her she’s loved and supported and her friends are there for her. But why not me? Am I that bad of a person? 

My entire existence meant nothing to her. She moved on. She’s talking to other guys. She even is getting with her ex again. How am I supposed to live knowing the person who knows me better than anyone on this planet doesn’t love me or care about me. I meant nothing. She already replaced me. 

I am sorry for overwhelming you reddit. I just have no one to talk to.",24Apr2020,1
4,"So I’ve just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I’m not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I’m not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn’t want even live. I’m just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It’s really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren’t working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

And I’m totally fine so you don’t need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported :)",24Apr2020,1

7,"So, my friend suffers from depression and anxiety, nd she always used to come to me for help whenever she was low. We got really close and I started to develop a crush on her. I never told her about it though, because she was still upset about breaking up with her ex and she kept saying that she wouldn't be ready for another relationship for a while, so I just thought there wouldn't be a point in telling her. She recently just met another guy that she has been dating but she feels conflicted and confused about him and keeps asking me for advice. Hearing about this has made me feel really upset, and I feel like I need some time away from her to get over it, but I don't know how to tell her that. I can't tell her that like her and I'm upset about her getting a boyfriend or whatever, because I think that would just make things worse for her. I also don't want to just randomly ghost her and not give her a reason as to why I'm ignoring her, because I still want to be her friend.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to pretend that I'm alright, because im not.",24Apr2020,1
8,"I've been getting to know this guy lately, and he's very sweet and wonderful. I have slowly started opening up to him about my anxiety and mental issues I have. I noticed after doing so, I hear a bit of a ""You're telling him too much."" ""He doesn't care."" ""He'll probably leave now for someone without these issues"" voice in the back of my head. I want to know if anyone else has this problem.",24Apr2020,1
9,"I am so tired of existing, and I don't want to be alive anymore. I can't/won't kill myself, because I'm a mom to a preschool-age child and married to a man who struggles with severe depression and whose mom is dying of cancer. Even apart from these things, I know that there are other people to whom I matter - and I'm so grateful for that, and I don't want to hurt anyone.

But... I'm so tired. It often feels as if I'm just struggling against a strong current with nothing to hold on to. In the past two years, my grandmother died, two of my uncles died, a mentor of mine died, and then last August my best friend (only 28 years old) died. I'm the godmother to her three small daughters. Everyone I know seems to expect me to have moved past all of this already, but how can I? I have one friend only now, apart from my husband - I can talk to her and I love her so much, but I can't open my soul with her like I did with my best friend. I didn't even really have to try - I just did.

And there are so many other things! Financial strife, parenting turmoil and guilt, medical issues, debilitating anxiety, fear of social interaction, fear of being close with anyone because they could all die any minute. And my husband, who is the kindest and most loving of husbands, is hurting so badly right now dealing with the impending loss of his mom - and he doesn't know how to process his feelings, so he's become almost robotic. And I feel guilty for being caught up in my own grief and sadness when he's dealing with all of this. I can talk to him sometimes when I'm sad, but I *can't* really. 

I feel like I've lost all confidence in myself, and all hope that the future will be brighter. With the COVID pandemic, it just seems like nothing will ever be fine. I want to be strong for my kid, for my husband. Everything is pressing down on me, though, and I barely even have strength to want to continue.

I have Borderline Personality Disorder as well, which basically means I have difficulty regulating emotions and can be more emotionally sensitive than others - I know I need treatment for this, but the only effective therapy is DBT which is never covered by insurance. And guess who doesn't have money for $150 a week sessions? I take medication, but that goes so far. 

I'm really just ranting, and I'm sorry. I just don't know anything anymore and I'm kind of hoping that someone will have some thoughts about what I can/should do, or even just not feel so lonely here in this black hole.",24Apr2020,1
10,"So I recently had my heart broken. It wasn't a relationship or anything. Just a friendship that was built up for over a year with tons of hints and flirting. Only to be rejected and pushed aside for another if not multiple dudes. I just don't fit her requirements I guess. I'm not over 6ft, have  military background, I don't have a buff body, a 9in dick, or a lot of money. But I still find myself, thinking about this girl who doesn't give 2fucks about me. Is there anyway,  I can get this woman out of my mind. I refuse to chase after or give my time to someone, who doesn't think shit of me apparently. But  since I have to see her everyday. I keep finding myself belittling myself and affirming my insecurities.

11,I’ve been noticing this strange feeling whenever I’m doing something enjoyable with my family. It’s always when it’s doing something fun. I’ll be distracted having an okay time and then I feel randomly really sad? It just comes on out of nowhere. I hate it so much..

12,My boyfriend has a porn addiction. And... I’ve always been raised with the belief that sex and lust is tied to love and should be kept between partners. And... the thought... of him... sharing what was meant for just us... with something else hurts so badly. I so badly want to be the only person he sees like that.. but I know it’s not gonna happen and it hurts so badly... it makes me so insecure and hateful to myself for not being what he needs and it tears me apart. I’ll rip at my hair and cry and hurt myself. I know it’s crazy to have such a problem with porn in this day and age. Call me old fashioned. But I feel so betrayed and awful... I consider porn to be cheating and I only found out about his addiction and... I just want... to be enough... that’s all I ever wanted to be.

13,"I have been living with depression since 2014, but I managed to have a job up until 2019, when I tried to “take time for myself”, that eventually didn’t work out at all and led to a long and hard depressive episode. Now I need to find a job (money is the issue), but HR doesn’t consider my CV seriously since I have a one year gap there and I barely receive any calls back.

15,"I’ve had major depressive disorder for 12 years. It’s pretty treatment resistant, I usually have periods of non depression when I start a new medication or therapy, but I build tolerances really quick. 

Since I’ve had it on and off (mainly on) for SO LONG, I feel like this perpetual storm cloud in my friend’s and family’s lives. I’m sick of telling them nothing is improving and I can’t imagine how sick they are of hearing it. So over the last 6 months I have completely withdrawn from every relationship I have. I ignore every text and every phone call, even from my parents. 

I started a new combination of meds and online therapy a couple weeks ago and am feeling a little “better” but am overwhelmed by how much I miss everyone. 

I’ve tried looking up ways to mend relationships after depression fueled social withdrawal, but everything seems so self involved and lacks any personal accountability.

do I avoid this if my depression gets really bad again?",24Apr2020,1

19,"I’m doing a one year course to help me get into university because I didn’t do well in school. I was so determined before this lockdown and was doing well mentally. Things have gotten a lot worse since then. My relationship with my boyfriend hasn’t been going well, I’m stuck with my family who treat me like shit, I only have one not very close friend from the course and whenever she calls me she just talks about herself and she’s also borrowed money from me a bunch of times without paying me back so I don’t really know why I’m friends with her. And mentally I’ve been doing really badly. 

I try so hard to be happy and positive and to get things done but it feels like a losing battle. I cry every day and I just hate myself so much. I feel like everyone hates me and I’ll never have friends. I’m really suicidal and the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I don’t want to hurt my mum. All I can ever think about is what a waste of air I am and how I don’t deserve to wake up in the morning. 

I haven’t gotten any assignments done for my course because anytime I try to, I get really bad thoughts and I go back to trying to distract myself from them. I find it really scary being alone in my own head when I don’t have distractions, it feels like my brain is trying to kill me. 

Whenever I would get upset about not having friends and whatnot I would think about going to university and making a better life for myself. But now when I think about that I just feel more depressed because I know it’s unlikely now that I’m sabotaging my future. I’ve tried so many times to work on my assignments but I’m literally terrified to be alone with my thoughts and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve spoken to my doctor and all she did was prescribe me sleep medication which has just made me drowsy during the day which makes it harder to be positive and get things done. When I talk to my therapist all she says is go on a walk. When I tell her that going on a walk doesn’t help she tells me I’m not doing it often enough. I honestly don’t know what to do. I really want to succeed but I feel like I’m ruining my future and I don’t know how to get out of this rut.

From comments about my weight to getting in an argument with my dad about petty stuff in my room like a sock on the floor. I recently paid off my car 😄😄 and I made my bank account separate from theirs so I can have financial privacy. This caused a huge argument that lasted for about a week. It got bad and my step mom told me she didn't want me cooking in her kitchen anymore and they wouldn't make food that I could eat by putting pineapples in a good bit of the meals.

24,"I’ll try to make this short... I have depression, anxiety and ptsd...and last week Friday I had a horrible nightmare. In my nightmare I was reliving how my life was 2 years ago as if I time traveled..the main parts were at at a park, in the car and at a dining table.. with my 2 sisters and my father.. I was terrified because everyone acted normal and I was so out of place.. I was jumpy, scared, and quiet.. they all questioned why I was acting so differently and it was because I was terrified of my father.. he was very narcissistic, manipulative, an alcoholic and emotionally abusive and so with that nightmare I told my mom because I’ve always told her my nightmares.. but for the past 2 years when I’ve tried to tell her she would listen but change the topic.. it made me feel upset.. and during this whole week I have been very observant of my surrounds like sounds.. all I’ve wanted to do is hide in my bed and sleep to forget it about the nightmare.. but it hasn’t worked.. I wanted to reach out to my friend but I didn’t want to tell her more about what’s been going on my life cause I think I’ve told her too much though she’s there for me I don’t want her to think that I turn to her just for emotional support ( I really don’t want it too seem like that), yesterday I was able to call my therapist but it was not an appointment ..

30,"So I’ve(19F) been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have vivid memories of crying myself to sleep every night since I was about 9 or 10. And over the years I became suicidal, I’ve never really attempted at taking my own life but I think about it most days (unintentionally). My depression seems to come in waves some weeks I am great I can get a lot done and have lots of energy; however some weeks I can’t do anything and I feel so empty. Although, my anxiety has just grown and grown over the past 2-3 years, and now I have anxiety most days.
Lately, thanks to quarantine, I have been feeling empty more days than not. 

I have dealt with a lot of childhood trauma, but I’ve only talked about it to like 2 people. My family was very abusive verbally and physically. My father was an extreme alcoholic growing up, and was usually not there(I have few good memories of him); my mother on the other hand I suspect deals with mental illness and she has tried to take her own life before(my father took most of it out on her). And I don’t think I’ve ever recovered from that ... I don’t know if I ever will. 
Anyways, now as an adult, I don’t feel like anyone will ever understand me. I feel so empty and alone. And I try and I try to make friends, but eventually everyone leaves me. I pretty much feel like the biggest loser ever lmao.

31,"Knowing your triggers is an important part in dealing with depression right? [I had posted on a different topic a few days ago but i wanted to share something more]

I'm finally healing from a long term depression after trying different methods(it even includes meds which didnt help me at all).

But I have anxiety too. I'm naturally anxious. It may suddenly happen than I think of something which suddenly triggers a mini episode again. One of those triggers is a fear of loneliness. I've been kind of a socially active introvert and had a lot of friends even when i was depressed. But my anxiety and depression kinda stopped me from approaching someone romantically and I have never been able to get that kind of closure for anyone(I'm 21.)

That hasnt been a problem before but recently, fear of loneliness has become my trigger which hits me often. Among other triggers.

During these random triggers, I have begun to view that situation and the state of mind in a third person's perspective, literally which calms me down. 

I dont know if this is dissociation but it really feels like it. And yes, I am quite informed about such medical terms so I'm trying not to misuse them. I'm still asking them because it feels weird. During these triggers, I suddenly take myself out of the situation inside my mind and I feel calm. Its like I dont feel anything at all.. and I'm able to view these emotions from an outsider's perspective. But not so much. I'm confused. 


Is this a good coping strategy? Because it seems to work the best. I tried my best to convey what i feel.
