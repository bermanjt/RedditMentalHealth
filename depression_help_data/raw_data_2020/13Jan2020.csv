1,"School is tomorrow and I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper as the day goes on. I don’t want to go, and I don’t really know why.  But the thing is, I don’t want to stay home either. I don’t really know what I want, and I don’t have a choice. I have to go to school. 



I guess I don’t want to go to school because I don’t want to fake the smile. I don’t want to wear the mask of “I’m fine”. But if I don’t, people will worry and ask questions in a bad way. I know what happens if I take the mask off. People will see my tears and the hurt in my eyes. They will see how bad I am feeling. If I say how I truly feel right now, they will send me to the hospital. But if I leave it on, I will break. I can already feel it happening. I’m stuck both ways. The tunnel is blocked on both sides.



It’s been like this for months. My school is amazed at how great I’ve been doing, being happy and all. But they don’t know it’s all fake. I’m broken inside. I have nobody to turn to. My mom just doesn’t understand and my dad has been believing in the smile. 



I don’t know what to do. I just want to cry. I want a hug from somebody, but someone who knows how I’m feeling. Not just a hug from my mom who thinks I’m doing great. Not a hug from my dad who thinks I’m always happy. I want a hug from somebody who knows how much pain I’ve been for the past months, no. Years. I want them to tell me it will be ok, even though it won’t be. 



I don’t know what to do. If you read this far, thank you. It makes me happy.",13Jan2020,1
2,"Lately, I've noticed that my little brother (16yo)  is having less appetite, he's describing himself as useless and talking about suicide and death and I don't know what to do and whether I should talk with our parents about it or not.
I remember this week he argued with our father and after that I caught him crying, I immediately jumped of my chair to talk to him and he said that he feel alone and nobody understands him. I hugged him and cried and told him that I am always with him.
Today he told me that all the food taste the same and not appealing to him.
The problem now is that I don't know what to do and how to deal with him exactly, and should I talk with my parents about it ?",13Jan2020,1
5,"I have clinical depression and anxiety and I'm losing it. I've been suicidal for a while and I've asked for help countless times for years but I have received serious care now. I'm on medication that helps lift my mood but it does not help with the existential dread and burden I carry. Therapy is too expensive for me, I've messaged counselling centers that have a cheaper fee but they take ages to respond due to the tons of people that have already registered.

I'm stuck. Everyday feels the same, the more I'm alone the more insane I feel. I don't like this. I need help before I drive myself to suicide. I don't know what to do anymore, it's so tough. I have so much self hatred I don't know how to be kinder to myself. What do I do? Please help.",13Jan2020,1
6,"Today is one of the bad days. It's been almost a year since I separated from my then-finace, high school sweetheart, and partner of almost a decade. I was somewhat depressed for the last few years of it, and I've been deeply depressed since.

Anyone who feels like they had a similar relationship - how did you ever feel a real sense of connection again? I literally feel a disconnect thinking about actually being intimate with someone again - mostly emotionally, but it feels like the thought of physically is only getting more alien too. 

 I'm slowly accepting a lot of ways I was treated poorly, and the complete lack of self-confidence and self-worth that made me too afraid to really, truly protest or leave. I'm at least looking at it much more clearly now. It's something I need to address personally before I can ever have a healthy relationship, because I see how codependency eradicated me. 

I will be going back to therapy again soon (fucking health insurance lapse between different coverage), and I know that's the best way for me to keep making make personal progress. I guess I'm just desperate to feel less alone in the specific circumstance. I am making myself rely on my good friends and siblings, who I'm more grateful for now then ever. But nobody I'm close to has nearly been through this. Not many 26 years old feel like a recent divorcee. My image of what my life was going to be is irrevocably shattered, and I still don't see a new image. 

Thanks to anyone who read this. Even just getting it out is something.",13Jan2020,1
7,"TW: self harm

I started to become pretty depressed before the break but managed to just keep it between me and my parents. I just finished my first week back at school and basically stared at the wall doing absolutely nothing, completely ignoring people unless they directly address me. My teachers have noticed and they check up on me every day which is embarrassing and I just want to disappear. I’ve started cutting myself every night because it’s the only thing that stops my anxiety attacks. I’m scaring myself but I don’t want to tell my parents because they’re dealing with a lot of stuff including my mom leaving soon to go visit my grandma in hospital so the last thing they need right now is for me to get them all concerned about me. My friends will probably immediately tell my parents or a teacher and make a big deal about it. I just feel like my life is going down the drain and maybe it should.",13Jan2020,1
8,"Some backstory: I have been in a depression for about a year now. It stems from last January when I was on the medicine Vyvanse for my ADD. I was prescribed to take 2 20 mg pills every morning, for a total of 40 mg. At some point, the psychiatrist or pharmacy switched the amount per pill, so I was being given 2 pills by my dad still, but the pills were now each 40 mg, and i was supposed to only be taking one. I'd always had my dad manage my medicine for safety, so that I never abused it, but in this instance he didn't notice the mg change and this went on for about 5 months, and it messed me up. I was essentially taking amphetamines and getting all the side effects with none of the benefits, but had no idea. It made my second semester of senior year, and my previously promising forensics season, a living hell. Eventually I noticed the mistake when my dad had to leave early one day, but by that point it was too late.

I fell into a really bad depression from all of this. We switched doctors and I was prescribed a new medication, but it gave me bad stomach aches and gave me flashbacks to when I was being overdosed, so I rarely took it. 

That caused my first semester of college to be equally bad, I basically had no motivation, I dropped two classes I was failing just because I wasn't showing up. The work itself was easy, but it was actually trying to care about it that presented an issue. I couldn't get out of bed for days at a time. 

Going into the next semester, my dad recently gave me a lecture about how he dealt with his depression. His answer to it was just ""getting my ass out of bed"", aka, just ignoring it. I dont think my dad's depression was as bad as mine is, as he just can't fathom having days that you cant be motivated but I have them regularly. He wanted me to promise him that I would never have another day where I didn't get out of bed and I refused to make a promise that I'm not sure I could stick to. I mean, I am now on medicine I take regularly, but I dont think that's enough to guarantee I'll be ok every single day. He then accused me of seeing myself as a victim of depression and just using it as an excuse for being lazy or not wanting to do things. 

Maybe I should just be able to just get out of bed and get to studying. Maybe I'm the asshole because I'm just still mad at my dad for the medicine incident and funneling my anger from that into this.

I'll probably put this in more than one subreddit to get different opinions, but AITA for being mad at him about this and refusing to promise?",13Jan2020,1
9,No matter what I do I just end up coming back to feeling like shit and wanting to die. I can't stand this stupid life. I go from feeling OK to feeling fucking awful so often it's unreal. Nothing helps. Nothing changes. It never gets better.,13Jan2020,1
10,"It's been 7 months, 12 days and 7 hours since I held you for the last time. 7 months since I heard your voice tell me you love me. 9 months since I called you before my big meeting because I was nervous. 10 months since you've seen my family. It hasnt gotten easier. I dont think it ever will. 

You came into my life 6 years ago, when I had doubts that love existed, you came in and you showed me what love is, you taught me how to love again and you taught me how to love my imperfect self, but most importantly, you made me believe in myself, in us.

I don't think I can move on with myself, the useless feeling I got at your bedside hasnt left, the hopelessness, the absolute agony. None of has gone and I dont think it will, I'm in pain every day, everyday I wake up and I wish I hadn't, 

The one thing out of this that brings me joy and happiness is knowing, that no matter how much I'm suffering, you no longer are.

11,"Hi all! First time publicly posting about how I’m feeling here so I’m a wee bit nervous. I’m not really sure what to say apart from recently I’ve been waking up every morning, sad that I woke up. I go through my days recently hating myself and everything around me. When I look at my life from the outside, everything is good. I should be happy. Don’t get me wrong I am thankful for certain things but recently I’ve just been sad about being alive. 

I’m not sure what to do. I spoke to my doctor and she told me to keep a journal every morning and night, writing down things I’m thankful for or things that I overcame this day etc. Right now, I’ve just had a great weekend with the guy I’m seeing, I should be happy and content but I’m riddled with anxiety and hate.

He told me that he’s struggling with a lot of things in life like college, girls, finding a job, and his family life. 

We’ve spoken about this before and I’ve tried to convince him to seek professional help but he won’t budge. I told him to talk to his parents but he doesn’t want to be a burden. He’s only told a handful of people about how he feels. He’s stated that he is not suicidal and that he’s tried self harm before but he didn’t like it. 

He pretty vocal about his depression. When he seems down I’d ask him what’s wrong and he’d vent and I’d listen. I always tell him that I’m free to talk at anytime. We both usually sleep late so if he needs someone to talk to late at night I’m there.

Sorry for the bad grammar I’m writing on my phone and I have tears in my eyes
Spiraling downwards 
That manipulative bitch that is my mother stopped giving me rides
So now when I have to go somewhere I have to go on foot
“ because all of the guys your age have the driving license”
“You don’t need the new generation phone (Wich I work with” because your iPhone 6 works perfectly 
While let me change my xs to an 11 because I need it to play candy crush”

She takes away half of my salary because “she grew me up”
And then she complains if I cannot reach the end of the month

Come and take everything from the shopping out of my car

The point is: I don't want my children to have to go through what i've been through. It's hell, and I bet nobody would wish for depression to be upon their children. I would love to see my kids, meet them too. I don't really want to kill myself. This is just another one of the reasons to die that I wish to get rid off. I'm on medication now, so i'm rational to reply to anyone.

On a separate point, how will I tell the person i'm going to live forever with that I have depression? And to make matters worse, how will I tell her that ours kids have a high chance of getting depression too?

Is there any way I can know how to prepare myself to teach my kids the importance of seeking help? Is there a way I can avoid my kids from getting depression? How do I know if my child has depression?",13Jan2020,1
21,"So, the title sums up pretty much the subject I am going to discuss about . I am going to see a new psychiatrist after 1 year and a half(almost 2 years) of not seeing my old psych and taking on and off sertraline and trazadone not prescribed by a doctor, I don't want to encourage anyone to do that, it was pretty stupid and out of my mind, I could be even in a worse state right now than I was before. My story is the next one: I was diagnosed with deppresion with psychotic features in September 2017 and been hospitalized for almost a week(5-6 days I believe), before I went to the psychiatric hospital, I went through one of the worst symptoms and state of minds I have ever been in my life since then, couldn't sleep, couldn't stop thinking and worry about my life, decisions, about the past, what I've could do to be better in University, what I've could do to not get so invested in the the girls I have been dated and not get so hurt, all these things together made me psychotic and really deppressed , I didn't knew the term psychotic or I was too afraid to look into before  I was diagnosed. 
Everything felt like hell, almost destroyed all my friendships during that period. Let's get back to September 2017 : in September 2017, I was put on medication since the first day I was hospitalized in this psychiatric hospital in Romania, where I live. I felt better from the first day, then after 6 days I went home. I have seen the psychiatrist every month untill the start of April 2018, where I started to get deppressed and psychotic again probably, and decided that I don't need the medication anymore(that decision was also influenced by a trip on acid that made me think that I don't need the pills anymore. The next months were horrible, I started smoking weed again and been worse than ever, then in September 2018 I moved to UK where my brother lives, because I thought that changing everything will change me as well and will be better(new country, new people, etc).I was actually wrong, the anxiety of being away from home hit me like a truck and started to be in the worse anxious state of my life. 
Started taking the same medication for 3 months prescribed from my GP, knowing the diagnosis and knowing the meds, not sure if it was a great idea without seeing my psych and talk about that, but it worked and everything was okay again, felt normal and motivated, got a new job and started thinking about my future more than before, started talking again with my friends and texting to girls. In January my GP couldn't prescribe me the meds anymore, then everything was bad again. Started abusing weed and other drugs, still had a job, then changed the job to a more stressful one, worked there from April 2018 to December 2018 while my mental health was getting worse and worse, lost weight, started looking worse, been mocked by co workers, been disrespected all those things made me almost suicidial. 
Now I am back at home and will go to a new psychistrist on wednesday because my old one has appointments all January, and from February won't be working anymore in that clinic.


What should I talk with her, I feel a little bit better now but still can't go out in public and be in social situations because last time I had a panick attack and almost left my workplace and then depersonalised/derealized myself and started feeling like everyone was talking about me and mocking me, I had these symptoms for 3 days, then calmed myself at home , been on edge and I still am in this present moment, pretty anxious and thinking about what people are talking about me.",13Jan2020,1

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational.

She hasn't eaten a proper meal in weeks and she usually goes 2 days without food. Her family is really struggling financially and they don't have a source of income anymore so she can't buy food or pay her rent. She has nightmares and wakes up with panic attacks. Last week she cut herself. That's the first time she's done it, I haven't seen her yet so I don't know how bad it is but she said she started with her keys then used a blade. 

I'm scared she might do something worse. I don't know what to do or say to make it better for her. Any advice?",13Jan2020,1
33,"Hi, 

So I have been feeling debilitatingly anxious for a month now.   
I have an exam on Wednesday (two sleeps/one full day) and I can feel a serious depressive episode coming. I honestly do not know if I will make it to the end of the week. 

I have had severe depression, not leaving the bed etc before but never since I started working full time.

I cannot afford (both through leave and cash) to go see a psychologist.

I am feeling so isolated, lonely and like I have no possible options. I just do not know what to do. I don't how I can prevent this episode coming and I am just desperate for it not to happen",13Jan2020,1

35,"I have really hated my life and self for a while now. I have thought about suicide but I care about my parents. Yesterday I was going to do it, but I got way to scared and just hid the knife from myself (it’s my pocket knife I got for my birthday). My parents have set me up with a therapist but it hasn’t really helped yet. My parents try to talk to me but I refuse to tell them how bad it really is. I just want someone who can help me who I can trust to give real help and also someone who I know can’t tell my parents about it.",13Jan2020,1
36,"I'm currently writing this off 5 shots of whiskey and smoking weed I'im just so caged in if I didn't have these drugs I wouldn't have made it this far. I just want to feel special again like I did as a kid .I hate my life I live in a nasty house because of dogs shitting everywhere and stiepping in dog shit and piss its so humilating I HAVE to wear shoes or else my feet will smell like dog shit cuz we have chihuahuas that piss and shit everywhere and. I'im only 19 I've never had a girlfriend and still a virgin I feel like I've never really felt love in my entire life my father who abused me left when I was 5 years old. I just feel  hopeless I graduated in 2019 and I just  have no abition to go forward, I dont 'have a ""dream"" in life or a dream job I just want to feel truely free to live without judgement and slaving myself away to a job. What's the point in existing as a human if I've connected to a societ;y that I absolutletlfly fucking hate. No wonder people want to kill myself I send videos as a joke to my friends with a gun to my head cuz I think its funny.... I just want be free and peaceful+",13Jan2020,1
