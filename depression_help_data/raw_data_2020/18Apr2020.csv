0,"My life was perfectly normal until I started questioning my faith in christianity. I was raised a christian, but as I   asked questions and found answers, I no longer beleived in a supreme being. I've been reading and listening to materials about astronomy and physics, and I am profoundly interested in it. (14 by the way.) 

However, as I gained more knowledge, I realized how insignificant and pointless our existence is. Even if we weren't here, the universe and beyond would still go on as it would if we were here. We are rare existence that has been around for a blip of time in the history of of a universe so large the human mind can't comprehend it.

These thoughts brought me to the idea: ""What's the point of life if everything you've experienced, seen, done, and thought about dissapears into an endless oblivion of unconsciousness after you die?"" Unless you make a major impact on the world, its like you never existed from the point of view of someone in the future. I don't know who my great great great great grandfather is. I dont know his name, what he was like, or anything about him. As far as I know, theres either no or very few traces of him left on this ever evolving planet. 

I've been dealing with this feeling of complete and utter  feeling of pointlessness and insignificance on and off ever since I denied my faith. I really wish I could go back to beleiving in a higher being, but I just can't. The reason I'm writing this is because I had a really terrible bout of it today. Theres usually one or two days of the month where I just don't feel like doing anything because ""in the end, it wont matter at all."" I sat in bed earlier today doing nothing but thinking about my purpose. There just seems to be days where I tend to overthink things too much, thats all. I understand the cause and effect of my problem, but with religion gone, I dont have a way to cure it.

I've come to the conclusion that although there isnt any purpose without religion, I can still try to make everyone else around me happy and try to do something impactful. I've been enjoying life greatly, but I do have extreme bouts of utter insignificance that I can't control. I have developed a ""I dont give a fuck"" mentality, and enjoy living to the fullest while it lasts. I find myself staring at the stars often thinking about other planets, and enjoying the proufound beauty of life and nature all the time.  I plan on becoming either an artificial intelligence engineer, or an astrophysicist, in the hopes to find my purpose without religion. 

I acknowledge that everyones ""purpose"" is subjective, but for me, I don't have one yet. However, I hope that in my lifetime, I can change that.

Sorry about the rambling, but I just had to get everything off my chest. I would love to hear about anyone elses experiences like mine and any suggestions that might help. Thanks for going through my insufferable ramblings.

Best Regards,
Naotsue",18Apr2020,1

TW: abuse, suicidal ideation

I'm 26 and live in Anchorage Alaska. I've had severe depression since around the age of 12 and severe anxiety since the age of 19.  I think I have an avoidance problem as well as I feel extremely guilty all the time and have problems socializing, interacting with people in public, or trying new things.

I first saw a therapist when I was 13. Since then I've seen more counsellors, therapists, and behavioral health specialists than I can remember. Most of them were really nice and genuinely wanted to help. But I don't think I got anywhere. I was also put on four or five different medications over the years. Like the therapists, they either didn't have an effect or just made things worse.

Almost all of the therapists seemed to think if I just understood why I was having these issues and that my thinking was incorrect, I would get better. They usually had a particular bend; one was really obsessed with meditation (I gave up on that, I would have the worst dissociative episodes), another with my mother's drinking, and others with the sexual abuse I had to deal with. We did CBT, that whole rapid eye-movement treatment, mindfulness practice, and just regular talk therapy. I would talk things over with them, spill my beans so to speak, and listen to them talk about positivity. I couldn't latch on. I would continue to feel awful. I frequently needed to go to a crisis center to avoid killing myself.

I know there's no magic spell to make your brain better, but surely I've missed something on the road. My last therapist couldn't remember who I was and would spend the session just asking me questions about the notes he took last time. The person before him openly admitted to me she didn't know what to do and asked me to research therapies to try. I don't blame the therapists. I know how big their caseloads are (Alaska has some of the worst mental health and substance abuse problems in the US). But the enduring rate of failure has given me grief on top of my illness; I'm the only common denominator in these stories. Eventually I just stop calling the therapy office to make an appointment because I can't pick up the phone anymore.

I'm married, I have a job and an apartment, and I'm trying to write my first novel. So life isn't terrible. But I'm addicted to cannabis, I have zero friends, and I spend about half of my time in a fog of guilt, self-pity, and terror. I still fantasize about suicide. I fear my life will never change when I want it to and I don't know what to do.

I'm open to trying therapy again after the quarantine. But I don't know how many more pointless sessions and reminders to """"""""""breathe"""""""""" I can take. I feel like Charlie Brown kicking the football with Lucy (another dysfunctional therapist), who insists it will 'definitely' work this time, only to end up on my back again.

Does anyone have any advice? Do you have similar experiences?",18Apr2020,2

I can't get a job because of Covid-19. My bf had blocked me, so I asked a mutual friend to tell him. He read the message and never responded. I'm afraid he's hurt himself or worse... Not only that but I attempted to take my life yesterday, by OD. So my child's father is missing, I could have a miscarriage any moment, and I don't even have medicaide to  care for myself during this time. Abortion is ileagle where I live, not that I could do it anyways. My child, if they survive, will likely be taken away from me. I'm so fucking terrified. I don't know what to do anymore.",18Apr2020,1

It’s so fucking overwhelming. This depression, this fucking depression.

My wife is no longer happy in this marriage, and I’m 95% certain there is no way we can make this work or heal. There is almost no joy in our interactions anymore, or if there is it’s fleeting.

We’ve abused each other too much. Me more so In This past year than her. The distrust is too great.

I’ve done some really shitty things, I want to be a good person however I do not know if I would be called one.

She’s my best friend.... I don’t want to lose that friendship. I’m afraid I will, she’s said before that she might not want to be friends if we ever did separate years ago. She might feel different now, I should ask.

I need to seek therapy, but the thought of waiting months to see a therapist only to possibly find out I need a different one and then repeating the process makes it a no for me.

ALSO QUARANTINE 

I’ve talked to many therapists in outside circumstances and they all have universaly complained about the troubles for them of using Health insurance to pay for therapy. If I end up getting divorced I can Only afford therapy with insurance, but how can I do that knowing I’m screwing over these good people?

BUT I NEED HELP. I have never sought help for the rampant child abuse, neglect, poverty, bullying, and malnutrition in my upbringing before. I can feel all of

8,"I am an adult living back at home because I had to flee a mentally, emotionally, and physical abusive friend-turned-stalker relationship. I am struggling with mental illness and my family is very unsupportive. Right now there are 6 adults in the house. My 3 siblings, my parents, and me.  They called me into the living room yesterday to shout at me using profanity, each taking their turn calling me names and telling me my diagnoses by several different doctors, for the last 15 years, is a lie and an excuse to get out of work and responsibility’s, when in reality I’m looking up painless ways to die at night while I cry. Tonight was the last straw when they attacked me for over an hour about an enchilada, it’s so asinine it’s like they are purposely picking fights with me to drive me back to the hospital, which is obviously out of the question right now. I am suffering and all I can think about is dying. Through this lockdown i have started obsessing over it, as well as having a day and a half of psychosis; including hallucinations and self harm. I don’t know what to do or where to go. I have no money and no car. The mental, emotional, and verbal abuse are too much for me and I am just lost. How should I deal with this situation? I’m not even allowed to keep my door shut anymore, but was given no valid reason. I’m not 22, I’m 35 years old. If anyone has any advice I would be so appreciative. The story goes much deeper than this but I’m not prepared to share the sadistic details. If someone can help, please help. I’m not sure I want to die, but it really sounds like a better option. I see no future, and no way out because of this virus and lockdown and how difficult finding employment will be when we can even go back to work.

My dad was always there for me to be a shoulder I could cry on, he taught me to self-made, to work hard, to say screw the toxic people in my life. Every morning during school he'd send me a text saying he loves me with all his heart and he wishes me a good day.

And when it took a bit for me to respond sometimes he'd ask if I was alright. We aren't the richest and I know he tries his best as a single father facing discrimination for being a single father being thought of as lazy and an unfit parent but I don't expect a lot, he likes getting me stuff but Im content and fine with what he can provide and I try to buy my own stuff when I can.

He truly is my role model even when we sometimes bickered. 

I love my sister, we grew up in a ghetto and always watched me whem my mom would leave me home alone at a very young age. She taught me how to stand up for myself to not take nothing from nobody, to fight back.

13,"Hi everyone,

I just want to ask those that have tried bupropion. Any success stories? I really want to know what is the likelihood it will ever get better, maybe this drug is just not for me. I know for SSRIs it is pretty common to have extremely bad days before any improvement. Those who did great on bupropion - did you go through any side effects like suicidal thoughts etc.in the beginning of the treatment till it got better?

First 6 days on this med were rad, I felt 10/10. Maybe I was slightly hypo - no appetite, no rumination, no dwelling on the past whatsoever, exercising, etc. And on day 6or 7 everything was gone. I was again in a miserable state. 

I know for some this med has helped tremendously, so just wondering how everything went for you. Did you have any initial bad side effects until it eventually got better for you? 

For me it is almost unbearable. Existence is unbearable. I am.constantly thinking about killing myself unless I am doing something and am focused on that activity. For example, I can concentrate and read, watch a movie, etc. As soon as I finish doing something bad thoughts come back with a huge wave and I can't help crying. I feel so dead already. I am trying to wean off Tegretol, just desperately looking for solutions, looking for someone/something to put the blame on, I had a phone conversation with my psychiatrist last week, she said she has no idea whether this drug is gonna be effective, in case I feel bad I am supposed to take Seroquel, and that is it. I just feel trapped in mind and body. I want everything to end. Every day is the same, every day is a burden to grapple with.",18Apr2020,1

I never thought I needed help because it always seemed like things were looking up Lmao.But no matter how hard I try, the overthinking and the insecurity won't go away. I'm just soooooo tired of trying. Just when I start accepting myself and things start looking bright,BAAM here comes the self loathing thoughts, the jealousy of those who are around you, and just utter sadness. I can't keep on like this. I continuously shut myself out from those who care about me. And pains me everytime. My social life is in the trash. I will go weeks at a time not speaking to anyone unless I have too. But even when I do open my mouth,  I can't seem to open up to them and talk about my emotions or what I'm going through, because I always feel like I'm bothering them, this in itself is killing me. I'm probably only doing this because I'm halfway through a handle of jack and can't seem to get off my porch at the moment. Also My love life has become nonexistent. Everytime I do my best to show a girl I like her it goes wrong. The overthinking and insecurities about myself come flooding in my head. Even when they reciprocate the feelings back at me I can't bring myself to believe it. No matter how obvious the signals are. I always feel so inadequate, like I could never be enough. Even with meaningless sex. I haven't felt the embrace of a woman for 3 ½ years. Worst part is, I've also been told I'm a good looking dude. But what they dont know is that.  I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis  4 years ago and the medication has severely ruined my hair. To the point that I pull handfuls out every morning(worst part: ppl say my long curly hair is my best quality). Due to that, I consistently wear beanies. So much so that, its completely noticeable to those around me. That they bring up that they never seen me without one. I've even had women straight up reject me because my hair makes me look like I'm in my 50's(I'm 23) because I'm completely balding. Plus don't get me started with my job/coworker's. I went from being one of the most beloved employees too a complete nothing because of my lack of ability to be open. It's to the point now that I'm more than likely going to lose my job(I've already lost the respect and love of my coworkers[more specifically one in particular] ). Whether you read this or not, I dont care anymore. If I lose my job in this coming week it really won't matter anymore. Between this shitty existence I call a life and this Covid BS. I really won't be needing to stay around much longer. But if somebody can give me any advice plzzz. I just want to be content with myself. I dont even need to be happy.

He knows basically everything about me, but lately it feels like he's been kind of avoiding my texts.
I've told him he could tell me if he was busy or not feeling great, but he never really does. I feel like I'm losing him and my feelings but I don't want to. Loving him makes me feel like there's at least one thing in life I can feel but depression. I really miss all the hug he and my other friends provided me with and now I've got no one except my mother who's pushing everyone to do something while they're at their worst and my 3 older brothers who always manage to make me feel even worse whenever they see me.

24,"I recently turned 18. For about a year, I’ve been in my room. I go to the porch to smoke, a lot. I go to the kitchen to eat a lot too. I’ve been getting a lot weaker the past year and I’m losing myself. I lay in bed all day, always occupied. Always watching a show or playing a game. I don’t go to sleep until I’m so tired I can’t stand it. In 3 days I could sleep the day off, and in another 3 days I’ll sleep the night off. I haven’t showered in 2 weeks. I am an unhealthy habit, a person, and a general disappointment.

Though I still have aspirations. I still have wants and desires. I want to join the Air Force and teach people how to evade capture. And how to survive the wilderness as well. Get nice earnings and healthcare, too. I want to get a van and live all over the country, scraping by just enough to see some beautiful sow capped mountains. I want to make new friends, some I may only meet once, and others may travel with me. I want to experience life without worrying about a daily grind, or a soul sucking job. I would rather not be anything similar to a slave in society, or a piece of a machine. I want to be free and happy, like many others.

I’m telling you this from my room. And I’ve been here for about a year. The days have melted together, and I can’t count the days. What was weeks ago may have seemed to be the day before. I definitely do not like this situation. I could get a job, clean up, and be an active person. It would be a pretty average thing to do, and millions of other people do it without a second thought. And I won’t. Why? I simply can’t make myself do it. I have no motivation to do anything, I lack the determination to pick myself up by the bootstraps, and the tenacity to remain in a healthy lifestyle. I settle in my little pool of anger and resentment, unable to do much about it. Dull moments without distractions lead to self pity, sorrow, and hopelessness. I have been here for so long, I couldn’t escape it, and I’m stuck.

It wouldn’t be a surprise that a person like me has low self esteem. I would be pretty arrogant to assume that one of the most useless people around has a very high self worth.  I’ve known for a while that I won’t be able to do anything positive. These late 12 months have eaten away at me. They’ve melded together. They are no different from one another. I’ve thought about suicide. It doesn’t seem so bad. But I don’t want to die. I want to live, so maybe one day I could visit the Rocky Mountains. Maybe explore Alaska, and visit other countries. 

I’m hopeless. And I don’t know what to do. You could call this a rant, or maybe a story. I can only think of the choices that led me to where I am now. All of my mistakes. How my lifestyle will certainly impact my future. I’m definitely depressed, but at the same time I feel like this is all my fault. If I do decide to opt out, it wouldn’t be nice to do it in my moms house. It would be better to do it outside, by a creek.",18Apr2020,1

31,"The most important book I’ve ever read in my life is about antidepressants and depression and is called Lost connections. It’s truly mind blowing. The very talented non-fiction writer Johann Hari (who took Paxil for 13 years) writes about how antidepressants are not too far from a placebo effect and how the real crux of being depressed are things like forming meaningful relationships and connections, which our current western society has drawn away from in preference for individualism, materialism, demeaning work etc. Your body is telling you there is something very wrong when you’re depressed and your depression is caused by how our society is structured. There are ways you can change how you live and love that will pull you out of depression. This is not a self help book, but a book pointing at tons of scientific studies and looking at western society and how things went wrong. It’s not your fault and the worlds top scientists and doctors say that having low serotonin is not the cause of depression nor is there something wrong with your faulty brain. That is just something that big pharma picked up from a very faulty study and ran with it so they can make billions of dollars by saying they have the antidote. This is not some conspiracy book by a quack author, it’s a nytimes bestseller and the author is extremely educated having went to one of the top universities in the world - Kings College at Cambridge. This book will change your life (it’s also very easy to read, simply written and not long) -

33,"Idk if something will eventually get better in the future, but here it goes anyway. Firstly, sorry for my bad english, I suck at it.

So, in the last 2 years a lot of shit happened in my life, on college, relationship with a girl, family, etc etc...

And in this past 6/7 months I really tried to move on, do better, self improve but really nothing works since I always cling to the past: to what hurts me, to my bad decisions (like 90% of all them) and to the people and the actions that, at the moment, made me feel like I should just give up on everything.

This struggle on trying to deserve living got even worse 3/4 weeks ago when I knew that a ""friend"" of mine, (I used the quotation marks because we weren't really close, we had a lot of friends in common and we used to talk sometimes when they were like parties or birthdays of those friends in common) has passed away... Like, she was even younger than me, and that is messing me up, since I am starting to blame myself for not enjoying life when there's people that wake up one day and don't have the choice of living it or not.

For a lot of time, I just live my days on my bedroom (even before the lockdown), in the bed, listening to music and staring at the ceiling, leaving all the college obligations to the deadline day, and I can't do this anymore but I still can't find the will to change. 

I often think if, taking some anti depressant pills would help me to let my feelings fade so that i can do what i have to do daily.

I feel like I still have a lot of things to tell that really may  help you to understand how I'm feeling, but I just can't write it for now, I really need to take brake.

Just feel free to dm me if u want, or write down idk. Thanks a lot for your help!",18Apr2020,3
34,"My whole life I’ve grown up around hate, anger, and just overall asshole behavior. Because of this I’ve been noticing that I’m adopting these bad behaviors. My friends say I’m an asshole, people I go to school with say I’m an asshole, my mom said I’m an asshole. The worst part is I know the problem, I don’t know any other way to act. I don’t know how to be kind and I just let my past of anger and sadness run my life and I take it out on others, whether it’s subtly or extremely noticeable, I just can’t seem to change my behavior and let the love in. I can’t even love myself, every time I mess up, or look at myself In the mirror, all I say is hateful things. “You’re fat” “you’re ugly” “you’re a fucking reject and no one loves you”. I’ve been Racist or homophobic at times but all I think it’s funny when it’s not. I reflect this attitude towards others and I can’t seem to change. (I feel as if I’m repeating myself, sorry) I want to learn how to love and be generous but when I try it translates to hate, being rude, or just being offensive in general. How can I fix my asshole-ish nature. All I want is help.",18Apr2020,1
35,"I have a problem with obsessive thinking. Untrue scenarios in my head, people, events, and among other things. This get extremely bad also when something negative happens to me. A boy I had a thing with over a year ago came back into my life only to get me to sext him/send nudes and then to tell me we shouldn’t speak anymore. I’m very upset and I feel like all my work in therapy last year as gone to waste and I’m back to square one with my obsessive thinking, anxiety, and sadness. I can’t stop thinking about our last conversation and mostly the sexts (even though I hate to admit it). Someone please tell me to just delete them and that it’s not good for me to obsess. I’m really emotional and I hate that I am this way and I wish I could just move on from things like this and stop obsessing over things.",18Apr2020,1
36,"Over the winter, I had been looking for a therapist in my city. After reaching out to several therapist with no replies, I just figured I didn't sound like a good candidate to them and I kind of got lazy and put it off. I have state insurance so maybe that's unappealing to therapists? 

Anyway I just tried to deal with my issues on my own and it was working ok for a few months. Then a month later the whole world kinda ended with this pandemic and people getting sick. Now the dread has returned times a million and I feel like I just can't cope on my own anymore. I know there so many others who have it WAY worse than myself. I have only been financially affected. I'm young and still healthy but I just can't pull myself out of this black hole. All my old problems have been dumped on with new problems from this pandemic and now its overflowing. I hyperventilate every time I think about my future and how I will pay my bills (event/gig worker here) on top of all the issues that I had before this.

Does anyone have advice or recommendations for online therapy or even phone therapy?",18Apr2020,8
37,"i’m not exactly diagnosed, and this is why i never really talk about my problems to anyone. i haven’t gone to the doctors because i’m scared of a lot of things; my parents don’t exactly understand mental illness and don’t understand that i have a lot of symptoms of depression and anxiety. i don’t let it show because i really don’t want to upset my parents; please don’t get me wrong, i love my parents and they’re supportive of me and i love them to fucking bits. the thing is, they’re polish so they don’t understand how mental illness works and i don’t exactly plan on educating them on it either since i can’t project myself in a way that will make me understandable.
another reason as to why i’m scared is because i don’t want the doctor or anyone knowing what the fuck i’m thinking and i don’t want therapy or medication, or anything like that. i don’t really want to tell them that i think about suicide everyday and how i could kill myself, i don’t want them knowing that i’m an unmotivated teen and is probably just going through hormonal shit and is just a normal teen, but it’s more than that. it’s way beyond that. i’m struggling to breathe because i can’t project myself properly. whenever i have the confidence i need to talk about my problems to a friend (which is really fucking rare, because a) i hate talking about my problems to other people and b) i don’t trust a lot of people due to emotional abuse in the past) they either brush it off and deny it because they only know me as the happy kid that jokes with everyone and they only see my mask, or they say “same, kms” and start to talk about their pet fucking goldfish that died; the point is, it’s like i can never talk about my problems without it’s worth being lowered into dirt and being treated as the therapist. 

i don’t really like talking as well. whether it be by phone call or texting or just verbally speaking, it drains the living shit out of me really quickly and can’t keep it up for long. i often burst into tears because i keep thinking of how pathetic i am compared to the normal being that i’m talking to and how great their life is and how i don’t deserve anything, etc etc. it’s hard for me to even form my own thoughts down, so this is somewhat of a miracle, even though this might get taken down or something. 
i tried talking to my history teacher who is a really lovely woman, and i used to really like her, and i told her about how i’m doing with my anxiety. i spoke with her because in october, my grandad died and i couldn’t be there to speak with him for the last time, and seeing as i didn’t speak much to him in august (which was the last time i saw him) i felt really fucking guilty. i broke down in the middle of my science lesson with everyone fucking judging me and i went into a panic attack. my head of year wasn’t much help and i had no choice but to switch myself off and carry on with the stressful day. this took a toll to my exams in december, where i went from a grade 7 in history to a 3. my teacher was concerned so i gave her an insight to my anxiety which worsened since october and how in the exam hall, i couldn’t focus and kept having constant headaches and felt like i would have a breakdown in the middle of the sports hall. she didn’t think of it as much and passed it off as me having exam anxiety and thought i was lying. i start to doubt myself if i really have anxiety and depression and if i’m worthy enough, etc. 

also, i’m going to keep this one short as well since i don’t really like talking about it and it brings bad memories back into my head, but i used to talk to this guy three years ago, and i never dated him but we were clearly in love. i have really bad issues with showing love and i hate saying i love you or calling people sweet names, whatever, and he shared similar mental health issues like me. this was until it was always about his problems and everytime i tried to mention mine, he would offer little to no support (again, i’m really not trying to say my problems are more superior than mine. i’m saying that i’m tired of being swept under the rug). when we got into arguments, he would say that i would think the whole world revolved around me, which i hated him saying because it was the last thing i want; attention, and would leave me without any support for months on end. i would be the one crawling back to him because i felt like he was the only one i could trust when he just didn’t really care.

all i want is someone to tell me that this year is going to be okay for me. i just want someone to tell me that what i’m feeling is okay without dehumanising me, and that things would work out for me in the end. 

tl;dr: i’ve been through shit and i’m stuck in a pit of misery and not getting out anytime soon. i just want support for just one second. i just want someone to tell my that not being ok is ok.",18Apr2020,1

Hi guys.
I slipped up and my Mom learned about my self-harm relapse yesterday. She reacted just as well as you could imagine. She keeps saying “I can’t go through this again with you” and I don’t tell her anything because of how harshly she reacts. I know it’s because she cares, but how can I explain to her in a way she’ll understand that boxing me in and guilting me is only going to make things worse?",18Apr2020,1
39,"i don't know how to feel better. i don't know who to call, to text, anything, i've thinking a lot about posting this and now i think it's my last opcion... i hate being at home, with my family, i can't do anything to distract myself of the garbage around me i know nobody will read this and if somebody does, they won't give a fuck just like i'm trying to do everytime i look at myself in the mirror and start crying bc i hate myself. the only thing that gives me hope or something kinda that is my cat but he doesn't deserve a karen as bad as me.. i don't know what to do, i can't help myself. im so sorry

Now its the 3rd week and we got it up and running again RANT INCOMMING:
With all the homework i havent even got chance to use it , my room is a mess I dont like it and I cant move it in a way to like it, I fall asleep at 2 am and wake ap at 11 am wich leads me to have headaches for the rest of the day and my back is sore from all the homework and the stress and my neck is sore from my sleeping position  ,  but I cant fall asleep in another position..

43,"I spend all my days scrolling through different social media apps, I do nothing, I don't even consume interesting media like I used to. And I hate it.
But I can't seem to find the motivation and even a quarter of the pleasure I had to creat story, reading, and other creative and purposefull media. The only thing which is still there is listening to music, I'm happy about that but it's not enough.
Sometimes I have phase where I will obsess over one thing only, it's very intense and I love it, but it's very fast to die down, and very passive.
The only thing which gives me life is my romantic relationships, before that, I always the type to despise people who had the center of their life romance, and look where I am now. Tho it is very unhealthy, when something isn't right, or change from usual, I can barely function. I already have trouble functioning in normal days...
It's been over a year or two I am medicated, and I just restarted therapy, but I'm struggling right now, it's not like I have suicidal thoughts, but I don't know why I am living, my day to day life is boring, I just exit, I don't feel like I am someone.",18Apr2020,2
