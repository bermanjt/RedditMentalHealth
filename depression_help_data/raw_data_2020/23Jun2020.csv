Took on too much now I'm buried in problems.
Me as a person is almost gone.

8,"I don’t have a heat support system to start with. My parents hate each other more than they love me, and they have pretty much destroyed everything they had to spite each other- including my college fund. I have to start getting into stocks to bounce back from their mistake and I work like crazy on a job that’s alright for a high schooler. I am pretty busy because of this and because of the stress of college (I was waitlisted for my goal college but I really couldn’t afford it if I wanted to). With this I am busy and can’t spend time with my friends when they can go out and the other times I can’t see them because of corona. I hate so much that I have to fight them out of their house to spend time with me and it feels like I’m the only one making the effort most of the time. I keep bringing up ideas like picnics and walking a trail and they keep turning me down with vague distractions like “this summer sucks” or “oof”. I am absolutely destroyed because I can’t trust people easily, and my friends had just opened my life to them. I genuinely loved them all and they supported me through my most stressful school year, but I am so angry that I just feel like I’m putting in all the work. I then just end up distancing myself to give them space, and it leaves me sadder. Then they’ll text me and I’ll end up confessing I’m sad about one of the reasons above, and they’ll just sound so over my sadness and it might be in my head but I feel like I’ve been so sad that they just don’t want to hear me say it anymore.",23Jun2020,1
9,"My husband is a veteran with rather severe PTSD. He had a suicide attempt about 7 years ago where I wrestled a loaded gun out of his hands. He did inpatient mental health, ptsd groups, therapy, tons of meds. Stabilized.

We have a 2 and 4 year old. He has regressed. We have been doing absolutely everything and he is 100 percent committed to his mental health. He sleeps all day. Has a short temper. Feels absolutely hopeless. Occasionally abuses his prescription drugs. (I keep them now).

I’m crying today. Our kids adore him, all they want is to play with him and all he wants to do is sleep. He says he doesn’t know what happiness feels like and he is sad every single day. He has a bad episode a week where he has completely flat affect, no emotion and cannot even speak to the children. 

He is trying so so so hard and it feels like no matter what we do nothing helps. He pushed himself to get his four year degree. He works full time and is good at what he does. He is in weekly therapy, magnetic brain therapy daily, we just met with a psychiatrist last week to rule out bipolar. He’s tried many many medications. This started out of the blue 7 years ago. 

I can’t imagine the rest of our life like this. I need words of encouragement or advice. I love him and my kids love him so much. This hurts so much.",23Jun2020,1

Yeah, I have all the comforts I want at home; I can hang out in my jammies, wrap myself in a blanket and be all comfy (as long as I don't have a meeting) and I don't have to go through the anxiety of talking to other people in the office all day or the stress of a commute. But I also can't concentrate at all! 
I'm an apprentice software engineer so I have to learn all this new stuff, I'm constantly sending my colleagues questions and I just feel stupid all the time. Especially now because, I have a tendency to overthink and usually I'd just have to hype myself up to ask in person but now, I agonise over a direct message. 
I also just finished some annual leave. Just two days off to make a four day weekend but, I'm not refreshed at all. I just couldn't seem to completely relax and now I'm coming back to work, to all my unfinished stuff even more worried because I didn't get anything out of my time off! 
I can't think straight but also I can't stop thinking. I get so worried all the time that I end up like this, unable to sleep and trying to sort my thoughts out enough to drag myself through the next day with hopefully enough will power to come across at least somewhat competent.

15," 

I made this account for this post,

I have been very suicidal for a very long time, and I have attempted several times. 

I was hospitalized for the first time as a 17 yr old for 5 days. I feel as though I left the pediatric psychiatric hospital worse than I arrived. My mom walked in on me hanging myself. I was a junior in high school

I am severely depressed and suicidal still. 

I found a therapist during senior year, but she irritated me; so I left after a few months

I then went on to college.

I was in my junior year of college (nursing school) when my depression went from bad to worse. 

I wanted to become a nurse, because I thought if nobody could help me, maybe I could help myself.

I had a therapist sophomore year, and a different one junior year in college.

Neither one of them helped.

Meanwhile, I had been on several antidepressants on several different dosages.

I had no results from the medications or therapies.

A nurse told me maybe I should take time off of school.

I went to the ER voluntarily, nothing helped again, I waited there for 4 hours explaining my depression, I was told that the area I was in was a psychiatric “deadzone” for mental health.

I leave school (junior year of college).

I call the crisis hotline, and explain to the person that I don’t want to kill myself, but I want help for once.

I hang up after an uneventful phone call, Say goodbye to the person.

At around 1 AM I receive a text from a police officer 1 hr away from where I live asking me if I’m okay, I say yes, and that I have no plans to hurt myself. He tells me to have a good night eventually.

2 hours later, 4 police cars show up at my house with dogs barking in 1 car.

I hear pounding on my door, so my mother and I answer; the police are looking for me.

A police officer tells me that I have to go with him to the hospital for a psych evaluation.

I go, and like always, nothing happens again.

The Dr. tells me that I have a liver issue (which has been caused by my excessive alcohol intake)

Later a nurse came into my room and told me suicide is selfish.

What hurt me the most is that nobody has ever helped me. I feel so alone. Suicide isn’t fucking selfish. I’m sure nobody will even read this fucking post, but the only people who are selfish are the people who believe that I should keep living my miserable life. This story is only abbreviated; I left sooooo many details out. So fuck anybody that believes I have to keep living. 

Death is part of life

Suicide is part of life

Not every suicide is preventable

It’s okay to be suicidal, because help isn’t always out there.",23Jun2020,1
16,"I've been talking to a person - they reached out to me at the beginning of my depressive episode.

I've been very very nice with them. I've complimented them. I've been patient.

I said I was hoping I can help them get better at social skills, so once they attend college, they can be ready. The problem is I'm too idealistic - so I didn’t think this through.

But I'm going through a depressive episode. I need to get my own life together - everything.

I have classes going on. I dug myself into a hole. If something messes up with them not reaching that goal, I'm going to be screwed. I'm scared. I'm really scared.

Problem is if someone helps me out - emotional support, I care for them like crazy. I'll do anything in my way - keep checking my phone ALL the time. I'm forgiving of their mistakes even if what they did is objectively wrong. I'm so damn scared. It's just I wanted to be there for someone bc I relate to them in that I hated that someone was not there for me before.

But I don’t know what to do now :(

They really care about me and really appreciate me. They've said they're glad they met me. They've said I'm nice, sweet, loyal, and genuine.

I feel like this huge weight/responsibility is going to drive me crazy and eventually hopeless. Worst thing is I opened up to them like crazy. I trust people wayy too easily if they give me emotional support online.

This is such a big burden. It has the possibility to getting me into an episode again. So, I need help on what to do.",23Jun2020,1

20,"I can’t understand why I’m still feeling depressed after so many years even though I took up a hobby I love, going to college for something I’m passionate about, in a healthy relationship, and having a stable job. There are days where I feel completely fine, and then I’ll have a mental breakdown/depressive episode and usually after one I tend to have more for a week or two. I won’t talk for hours, I keep replaying what caused me to feel that way, and then that’s it I just bottle it up. I hold onto grudges from my dark past and It’s really hard to stop. And it’s been going on since I was a child. I try to be mindful and think of ways to communicate it to either my SO/ friend/ family member but I struggle with communicating in general. I have a really hard time translating my thoughts/feelings (in generaI, literally about anything) into words. I just give up on being social sometimes because if I try all I do is stutter. It makes me feel like no one takes me seriously and sees me as intelligent. Because of this I’m scared to help, say my opinion, or engage in insightful conversations. I don’t feel useful. Though why I do I feel all of this if my life from an outer perspective is more than fine, and privileged. I have a supporting SO, and friends. But, I can’t seem to trust them, too. They haven’t given me a reason not to, so I don’t why I keep treating them as if they’re going to hurt me like the people in my life before. I’m in a really good place right now, but why do I still feel deeply depressed. It’s getting harder to cope, and I’m struggling to find healthy outlets rn to release my trauma/stress.

21,"Feeling empty, sad, helpless? study the signs, symptoms, and causes of female depression—and what you’ll do to recover.

Understanding depression in women

Depression can impact every area of a woman’s life—including your physical health, social life, relationships, career, and sense of self-worth—and is complicated by factors like reproductive hormones, social pressures, and therefore the unique female response to worry. However, it’s important to understand that you’re not alone. Women are about twice as likely as men to suffer from depression but depression is treatable and there are many belongings you can do to form yourself feel better.

Of course, the Catch-22 of depression is that feeling better requires action but taking action when you’re depressed is difficult. However, while you’ll not have much energy, you almost certainly have enough to require a brief walk around the block or devour the phone to call a beloved, for example—and which will be an excellent start to boosting your mood and improving your outlook. It’s important to also study the factors that cause depression in women so you’ll tackle the condition head-on, treat your depression most effectively, and help prevent it from returning. what do you do when you are depressed?

Has anyone ever taken themselves to hospital because they had an urge to kill themselves?

The thought of going in to work just seemed impossible to me at that time.  I just do not get it at all.

Im giving myself a week, no need for ""dont do it"" comments, if this helps someone else tho Im happy",23Jun2020,1
