Well these ""days"" of joblessness, forced isolation, nothing fun to look forward to, and society falling apart have gone on for weeks, months, and, at the rate things are going, probably even a year. You turn on the TV or social media, and it's pure negativity; people getting sick, everything being closed, corrupt politicians exploiting the pandemic, etc. I have friends, but they're either too far away, too busy, or aren't willing to risk spreading the virus to hang out. Just about every fun place or event has been closed/cancelled. As much as I love my parents, tensions have gotten higher being so dependent on them at almost 30 years old. 

I want to think that some semblance of normalcy will come back soon, but there's no indication we'll even be out of this by 2021. I have nothing left to live for anymore. I'm just existing to avoid making things worse. I've been on therapy and medication for years, and a 5th psych ward visit won't change anything.

I never asked for a lot of things, I rarely speak up for myself, to the point where I forgot how to talk seriously about something with my family.

Idk how I should tell 'em how I feel while being serious or without crying. I' m scared about their reaction, what will they think about it? I'm scared
I'm scared they don't understand how it feels, I'm scared they just look at me and tell me 'Are u using that as an excuse for being lazy?' or smth like that...

They have subreddits for a whole lot of things I suppose, just found out about this one, I think I really needed it. I’m a teenager diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I’m really struggling with growing up. Whenever I face any difficult emotions I become a train wreck and want to go back to being a child again. It’s not complete age regression, as I feel like I can’t go back, not like I am going back. I want to reconnect with my childishness (?) but the thought of doing so is depressing. If I try and do anything to reconnect with the things I enjoyed when I was younger it makes me cry because I’ll never get to go back to the way things were. I’ll never be able to feel that same way again. I cried because I wanted to watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I cried because I wanted to buy colored pencils to color again. I know that those aren’t necessarily things a teenager can’t do, but they remind me of my childhood and how I’ll never be able to go back. I miss when I was a kid and I just hung out with whoever and didn’t question who I was, I was just me. Everybody could be friends and nobody had right friend groups, just people they hung out with the most. Then being a teenager happened and everything is confusing. I haven’t gone through a real depressive episode in awhile so I’m struggling especially hard with this one. I want to be coddled all over again. I have a very kind mother who is the only person I feel safe with, but I think I hide away and seek comfort with her too much. I went to an outpatient program last year and I miss that place. It wasn’t perfect, but everyone was so concerned for me and I felt safe and cared for. All the other kids there didn’t care about who I was and they didn’t judge me because we were all going through some stuff. I just don’t want to grow up and face reality. I want to stay in the comforts of being a child and being carefree. But now I can’t even go on the swings at a park because I’ll look weird and it’ll make me cry anyways. I can’t see myself growing up anymore because I don’t want to, I want to go back to being a child. I know some teenagers struggle with that, but I was under the impression that I was supposed to want to grow up and be independent and be treated like an adult. I’m going to see my therapist this week but I have too much to talk about so I’m not sure how much of a breakthrough I’ll make on this issue. How can I reconnect with my childhood again without making myself so depressed about not being able to go back to it?",10Aug2020,1

10,"Hi, redditors.

I've (33/M) been sharing s house with my mom (70s) for several years, and it has been rocky. We have our usual disputes and personality clashes over things like cleaning and chores, but I have a serious problem.

She has Major Depressive disorder, and will not stay on her meds consistently. When she goes off an antidepressant, she gets extremely mean, a bit irrational, obsessive/anxious about some things, and spews vitriol about everything until she starts a different medication *and it takes effect*. Most of my siblings have some small to moderate depression and anxiety, including me. Most of the time I am pretty good, now that I have treatment for my ADHD and testosterone deficiency.

Between 3 times a year and once every few years, she quits her main antidepressant without warning. While she is taking it, her symptoms are quite a bit better, but some threshhold gets crossed, and ever after that point, she becomes convinced that drug X never did anything at all, she stops taking it, and she becomes convinced that she should absolutely not restart it.

I have accepted that I need medication for my health issues, which span physical and mental health. Several years ago, I wished I could just not need medication, but the results of stopping any are rapid and noticeable, so I have good reason to keep taking it. 

Is there something that helps anyone here convince themself or a loved one that staying on a/some medications permanently is worth it? I know there is a trend in some people to quit their meds on a cycle, but what are some strategies for seeing the value in a medication that isn't perfect?

My mom is aging, and has some mild cognitive issues, which does not help. She sometimes is pretty clever, generally is above average intelligence, and sometimes needs to be ""led by the nose"" in general. I've thought about moving out almost every time this comes up, but I want her to be on a medication and stable before I do. **IF** she were on a consistent medication and I believed she would stay pretty stable, I wouldn't really mind sharing a house with her for quite a while, but I am reaching the end of my rope. I am sure most of my siblings would not agree to share space with her.",10Aug2020,1

One reason has because I became a fan of a player from the team that left and every time I watch now I just hate it. I don't want to sound like some weirdo but I just became really attached to this one player and want him to succeed for one reason. it sucks because I ould really have fun watching my team and player but ever since this season, I just can't have fun.

15,"Let me start by saying that I’ve had a history with depression, taking anti-depressants for a couple years. They’ve helped with irrational things in my life that kept me down, but I’ve always been depressed about real things that feel out of my control. 

I’ve been in my same friend circle for about seven years. For a while now, I’ve felt like they don’t start conversations with me. Sometimes, it feels as if they avoid me entirely. We have a discord with everyone, but at points, things such as my friends canceling my ring on a group call, have been bothering me. 

I’m the youngest of the group, and everyone tells me to be more mature, get a life, stop being loud, et cetera. The pandemic recently has been aggravating these things, such as life decisions such as acquiring my driver’s license and enrolling in college. Most of my friends have been pursuing things like computer engineering and psychology, while making my passion of game design seem small and useless. 

My friends have expressed to me that they don’t like my attitude or my decisions, and I feel as if not sharing my life with them would leave me feeling better. I do question myself if I’m in the wrong or if they are, but honestly I don’t know. My one friend in particular has admitted to canceling my ring on group calls because it’s “not for me”. I feel hurt, but I don’t know if it’s my own doing that no one likes me. 

The pandemic itself is certainly not helping my issues, as they always pressure me to do more things with my life.. but I can’t do anything at the moment. I have medical issues that wouldn’t help if I took risks.

22,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Let me preface this by saying I have only ever had - and still do - have sexual interests in women my own age (22 and up to 26, in this case) or a few years older than me. I've always been disgusted by the thought that pedophiles exist and commit disgustingly revolting crimes on children, infants, and the vulnerable. Though I don't watch porn anymore due to not being able to reconcile it with my feminist values, even when I did, my 'appetite', as it were, was completely healthy and tame; that is, solely women and men involved together who were over the age of 18 and up to the age of mid-30's.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've had intrusive thoughts about being a danger to children for just over a year as a result of finding out that an ex teacher committed horrible crimes against young people by taking photos that were inappropriate. I've developed a strong aversion to touching my own body, especially as a result of finding this out: my brain can't seem to separate the two.

&amp;#x200B;

This has lead me to perpetually avoid everything to do with children both in person and even avoid looking at photos of them. I have Asperger's Syndrome, and while I've never been formally diagnosed with OCD, I've always displayed similar tendencies when under great deals of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday morning, my brain woke me in a deep panic up after I became convinced that someone could see me from outside my bedroom window privately moving my hand away from my genitals - which I felt uncomfortable has been placed there unconsciously during rem sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

After waking up and going for long walks, and coming home, I got into bed and watched a YouTube video of Kurt Cobain from childhood up until age 27 and while the duvet was up to my neck and hands rigidly on my phone and legs crossed, my brain started telling me that I was being inappropriate because my fingers slipped and hit (what my brain told me) was my pelvis or penis area but was actually my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

During this, I remember feeling a twitch of genitals, but didn't attribute it to anything sinister, as the immediate search query I made afterwards had to do with the intrusive thought of my fingers slipping down my phone. After this, I put my phone away and got into bed, and tossed and turned a bit and I felt my legs squeeze together, and then soon after faintly felt a wetness in my trousers. After waking up later, I couldn't remember where this had come from. I started having a panic attack and dry-vomiting due to fear that it came out during the Kurt Cobain video.

&amp;#x200B;

While on Tumblr recently and seeing a photo of a baby girl, my fear rose significantly and I had heavy heart palpitations but I did some exposure therapy as it were, and forced myself to look at it before quickly scrolling down.

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean, if the bodily fluid did come out while watching the Kurt Cobain video? Even though, I know it didn't. I'm revolted and disgusted by the implications, I don't want to be this, and I never have been.

23,"I am a 13F. The girl that triggers me is 11F. She is my sisters best friend. This year my sister and her best friend are moving up to secondary school and unfortunately my sisters best friend got into the school that I got to.

A couple of things to note is that she is tiny (in terms of height) and I'm fairly tall. She is very sweet to some people but a complete monster to others. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts depression self harm anxiety and depression since I was 7 (ish). She is also very bright (so am I so we are kind of equal in that department). I'm also a black belt in taekwondo.

The problems started in primary school. She started picking on another little girl (me and my sis have known her most of our lives and she is like a sister) who has autism. She also kept nagging me and my friends and bothering us for fun. Now I know this is normal kids stuff but it escalated. She would hurt my friends if I defended the other girl who is like a sister. She told me to kill myself and that if I was her sister she would wish I was dead. She also paid people to try and beat me up (they failed) and hit me with a wooden brick. Apparently I was too ""aggressive"" when I removed her from me while she was hitting me and removed her from the friends she was hitting and stuff. When she would grab me I wouldn't do any locks or anything I'd just pull my hand of whatever she had grabbed out of her grip. Just to note I have never hurt her but she has almost dislocated my knee before. But what really hurt was her telling me to go kill myself and my sis never did anything about it. The thing was she just reinforced everything I felt about myself. She told me to kill myself a couple of times a week. Once my mum found out about it I was moving to secondary school so there wasn't an issue. But everytime i see her i hear her voice in my head telling me to kill myself. And I end up cutting. What should I do when I go back to school? What can the school do about it? I live in the UK if that is relevant",10Aug2020,1
24,"I am sorry if this is too long, but I'm feeling very conflicted about this and would appreciate honest opinion and advice if possible.

So my (19F) cousin (15F) went to a public healthcare psychologist last week. Where I live, public healthcare psychologists have a bad reputation: long waiting times that can take up to a year, lack of care for the patient (they don't take their time to diagnose and are quick to medicate you), unpersonalised treatment...

On her first session, my cousin got straight up diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which shocked me because I've been to private therapy for two years periodically, then on and off until a couple of years ago or so, and I've never been abruptly diagnosed like that. My psychologist treated me with psychoanalisis, which made me understand certain attitudes and harmful habits I had and cut them off slowly but permanently. I've never considered that I have depression until I was like 16/17 and tried killing myself after thinking about it for years. It's been so hard to own up to it because it made me feel even more lonely, but it's what I have to do if I want to recover. (Enough talking about me, I'm so sorry about it!)

So when I saw my cousin's tweets jokingly talking about it, using quirky emojis and stuff (I know it's probably a coping mechanism, tho), and saying she's been diagnosed with SEVERE (all caps) depression and anxiety in her own words, I got a weird feeling.

After introspection, I think I feel like this because having depression has been so lonely. I no longer enjoy any hobbies and spend all day thinking about going to sleep and feeling anxious at the same time because I know I'm wasting my life, but when I scroll on social media she's doing what she likes; drawing, cosplaying, crafting, doing makeup. To me, waking up is an achievement. Over the years, I've lost so many friends and don't make any at all. I hang out with three school friends literally once a year, nobody reaches out to me and if it weren't for my boyfriend I would have no one to talk to or even love without feeling like a burden. She is somewhat famous on tiktok and instagram, constantly hangs out and has has support and people hyping her up whenever she talks about her problems online.

I felt like I was the only one going through this until I searched for help online to at least not feel alone and came across this subreddit. I feel like I'm invisible. I've asked for help from my friends, including her, and haven't got any kind messages, just the typical ""wow that sucks :("", which I've learnt is okay, because they aren't psychologists and giving advice to someone who is depressed is a great responsability. But she gets so much support and it makes me feel even more lonely and invisible, like I don't deserve love. Also, she constantly emphasizes that she has severe depression and got 99% on some test the psychologist made her do. That makes me feel like what I've been through isn't as important or as difficult, because I've never had a test taken, and definetly never even heard about ""severe"" depression.

I hate feeling so angry, sad and judgmental, especially knowing it's because of my cousin, who I care about, is young, and has her own problems and the right to vent and rant all she wants about it. It makes me sick being such a bad person and I just want to be more positive so I can finally recover, stop thinking about depression, anxiety, EDS, and stop wasting my life. I think I'm jealous and I should be one of those friends who hype her up, but all i talk about is me me me. I don't want to be a shitty person to others.

25,"I'm 24m and have a stable new job. My own place renting, and in theory anything I could really need.
Loving parents who want to be in the scene but I block them out, close friends who I've shared thoughts with and I think their fed up of me saying the same shit over and over and getting progressively worse 

I left my old job for these mental h issues. And thought this is a new beginning. But guess what I turned over a new page and it's still dark and stained exactly how I feel all the time.

I play an unhealthy amount of xbox, and perhaps that in itself is one of my issues the lack of major social interaction has never been an issue for me but now lately I find I'm clinging onto my friends because I've had issues of friends just turning on me in the past.

I think I've never really healed from that but learned to deal with it.
My best friend ever is an xbox player, she's 21f and in all honesty has always been there for me as I like to think I've been for her.

I guess you could say she is involved in these issues but I kind of want another opinion as such because I'm not even sure why I feel this way. I recently reconnected with an old friend of a friend whom I games with a bit went to a few concerts with him etc.

It feels to me like he is closer to my vest friend than I am and right now I just feel so scared and insecure that because he's better at gaming that she will just drop me and play with him and his mates only.

I'm not that great at games anymore and don't really know why. I've briefly touched on some issues with her and she's reassured me that she won't ever drop me but I still feel scared because two times now in a row (yesterday and the day before) in the chat we talk and all but my friend seems to make an effort to answer the others and gives me half assed answers, and when we are just the two if us she just seems to show no interest in talking. 

Ive never been the sensitive one in the group, and never really felt so left out as such and wondered us this my mental health issues taking over and making me think there's negativity that doesn't exist... Or is there something more to it? Could I be right that she's losing interest in being friends with me because these other guys seem to make her laugh more than I do? 

There's nothing romantic between us and never will be, but irrespective of that I just want things to be the way they were where we could chat shit for ages but it seems as though they're only playing with me out of pity but I'm too scared to ask in case that is true.

Other than the friend issue I just have no motivation to play anymore haven't eaten in about 4 days (literally nothing at all) and haven't really slept could the lack of healthy diet and lack of sleep and also lack of tackling my mental health issues be the main reason I'm fabricating these scenarios in my head? Nothing to my knowledge has happened and I've not been shall we say dropped to the kerb or anything but I fear that more than I fear dying 

I apologies for how long thus is, I hope anyone reading may be able to relate and advise how/what I can do to change myself to stop being so worried about being abandoned by my closest friends, is me talking to them about potential suicide (which I don't want to do, but keep using as my go to whenever I feel down and alone and try to talk to them about my issues) 

All in all, I feel as though I've talked so much about killing myself that it's spelled a huge cloud of negativity over our social interactions (xbox) and that I should just get it out of the way.

Then they don't have to put up with my consistent negative bullshit and I, well I won't be about to worry",10Aug2020,1

friday night i started considering a social media break, so i must have known subconsciously that i wasn't okay. i sensed it properly on saturday when i suddenly dreaded going to a social event that I had been excited for for weeks. i went though, and it was fun. then it pulled me under yesterday and all i did was sleep (the hangover didn't help). then today i took a sick day from work to just sleep. 

it's one of those where the idea of taking rubbish to the bins is scary. idk why, incase i see someone? idk. ive got my favourite fruit in the fridge and im hungry and can reason that i don't want it to go off/to waste, but physically can't bring myself to get up and cut it and eat. a friend wants to take me for food but i don't have the energy.

- drinking water
- a shower and clean pyjamas
- skincare

I have been sorting through old files and images on my laptop and I came across a series of photos that I was involved in for a local art exhibition in the village and I thought that I would share my experience of one of the most liberating things that I have taken part in where I massively overcame personal anxiety issues.

I live within a fairly rural area in a small village in the UK with my husband and two daughters and work as a fundraising manager for a charity shop within the village. I am also a member of a local ramblers group and have made lifelong friends. A close friend from the group, Alan, is a very talented retired photographer and artist who organises and regularly takes part in the local village art exhibition which annually showcases local talent from within the village with displays in the community hall. We were chatting over a coffee one day and he mentioned that a model for his photography exhibition that year had cancelled and that he was fairly gutted - his exhibition was looking at the hidden 'viewpoint' of our minds which often seek out the sexuality of different media/items that we see, which required tasteful/respectful topless nudity - as well as a topless plaster cast being made (to backtrack slightly I had lost a close friend to Cancer a few years ago and had promised myself that I would step out of my comfort zone and enjoy life much more!). During our conversation I nervously stated that I maybe interested in taking the model's place, whilst also helping out a good friend in need.

I went home that evening and discussed the situation with my husband and daughters as it would involve a few topless photos of me being placed in the community hall during the annual art show, and, as we are a small community, I wanted to get their opinion on it. Quite to my surprise they were actually very supporting and told me to go for it - my husband knows Alan and knows that he is a gentleman who he can trust to undertake the project with respect. I also discussed the situation with my colleagues who were all very supportive - I even got Alan to agree that 100% of all profits from this project would be donated to the charity that I work and fund raise for.

Over a period of 3 weekends I met Alan at his workshop and at his house and we started to get the project underway. On the first afternoon of shooting I was extremely nervous (I had never done anything like this before!) I turned up at Alan's house on a sunny Saturday morning and was warmly greeted by Alan and his wife Jane. In the photography studio I very nervously removed my shirt and bra (it was such a surreal feeling exposing my rather large breasts in front of a close male friend!) whilst Alan got set up. We had a good chat for 5 minutes or so about the ramblers club whilst I stood topless which definitely put my nerves at ease and we completed the project over 3 weekends.

The plaster cast was slightly more nerve wracking as it involved stripping down to a pair of panties whilst Alan and his two assistants applied the plaster cast - I needn't have worried though as they were the most lovely, respectful people I have ever met. We spent the afternoon laughing and chatting and it really put my mind at ease (I've included a behind the scenes pic of the cast below taken by Alan - I look so proud!!!)

As Alan is now over 70 I have been volunteering to do his weekly food shop, so I regularly pop into see Alan and have a chat over a cup of tea and make sure that he is getting on ok! It was the most liberating experience that I have ever been involved with - I hope that I made my family proud and can encourage at least one other person to face their fears and step out of their comfort zone!

31,"I need to make plans for the future, but I have no idea where/how to begin. 

I was suicidal for quite a while, and so obviously didn’t make any long-term plans. I still hate thinking about the future, and I feel sad, foggy and spaced out most of the time, which makes planning for the future pretty hard. I have just graduated and need to find a job and possibly move out. However, I feel either *nothing* or like absolute crap most of the time - and so I don’t know what I *want* to do, long-term or short; I just want to sleep. 

Although I don’t know what I want to do job-wise, I’m scared to get a menial 9-5 office or retail job because I think I’d just get really bad again. I currently have a summer job (ending next week) and it *drains* me. Also, if I get a job, I don’t know if it should be local or far away. I don’t have the energy to think about moving, but I know that my home town isn’t the place for me, and probably makes things worse. 

I know, realistically, I need to get help. Therapy or meds. That way I may get well enough to find a job and actually somewhat enjoy it. But I also know that recovery is a slow process, and that I may feel this way for a while, and I can’t just live at home, in bed, for that time. (Also, meds scare me a *lot*, I have limited money, I am scared to go anywhere bc or corona, and teletherapy isn’t really an option for me, as I have no privacy at home), 

I don’t know what to do. 

Thanks for reading.",10Aug2020,1
32,"I just finished my first day at my new school, where I know no one, and everyone knew at least 1 other person from their previous school. I started out being so optimistic and energetic, but I just couldn't make myself start any conversations. Now I'm at home crying and I don't want to go back there tomorrow...

I've struggles with what I suspect is depression for the past 2 years, and I'm gonna speak with a doctor in 2 days... but still I can't just skip school tomorrow, so what do I do?",10Aug2020,1
33,"First of all, I have made up my mind to seek help. Professionally I'm on the positive curve but lately feeling loss of interest in everything.

34,"I am having an awful day. It's pretty small in comparison to others awful days but it's been digging up old trauma so I think that makes it pretty horrible.

I was at work today and had a co-worker touch me more than once. I almost had a panic attack and nearly passed out from the stress and fear. 

I also made plans with some friends only to have them tell me that they made new plans after the fact and So they had to cancel. I felt like I wasn't as important to them as they were to me. 

I've just been feeling really low and wishing I could disappear. I don't want to be here anymore, I just want it to all stop.",10Aug2020,1

36,"I really need respite. Like, a few days of being numb, empty, lifeless, etc. As of the next week, I have time to do so. How? I have been in constant motion for as long as I remember. I have difficulty sleeping because of it and my racing mind, but now I am exhausted. I think the depression is taking its precedence over the anxiety. I really have no motivation to get up off of the floor, so to speak and kind of literally. No ideations this time, just panic attacks and depressive episodes I’m trying to soothe.
How do you relax? Unplug? Recharge? Get some sleep when you have raving insomnia? Eat?",10Aug2020,1
37,"Hi all, I don't use Reddit often, but I didn't know where else to look for advice. (It's also kind of a mild rant)

I, (20F,) feel sad. And empty. A lot. I've just felt hopeless and broken and depressed for years now. I have trouble empathizing with my super emotional family, who I've been cooped up with for 150 days as of today. 

I'm just so sick of life being so unfair. (I know life's not gong to be fair, but hear me out) I've tried to be a hard worker my entire life, doing my best to get good grades (even though I was homeschooled and my mom refused to give me grades. Or tests. I taught myself everything online without her. She basically just kept me home and made no effort to teach me anything.) until I ""graduated"", working my ass off to try to move out, (until I lost my job in December, and I'm still unemployed.) and trying to get my own car, motorcycle, whatever, so I can at least have a little space. 

I've also tried to be the kindest person I could to everybody in my life, including an abusive stepfather, but all I've ever gotten is used up or screwed over. I try to be there and listen to people when they need it, respect boundaries and pronouns, give people space when they need it, support them in their hobbies and interests... but I can't remember the last time anybody did that for me. And I'm just so tired.

An entire life of being kind and working hard hasn't given me anything. I've been abandoned by two ""fathers,"" countless ""friends"" and one boyfriend. All of my hopes of having a career have been crushed, and my dreams of traveling have been ground into dust. My life has been nothing but efforts and trying and getting absolutely no reward. My family tells me every single day how mean I am, and every single day I make efforts to be nicer. To be better. But it's never enough for them, I guess. I don't even have a license or a car or anything so I can at least get away for a while.

I know you have to work hard to get what you want, and I have, but I was left with absolutely nothing! No job! No house! No means of getting around! Everything I worked for slipped right out of my fingers because of things I can't control, and it's just about broken me. I'm so angry and frustrated.

Most days I'm completely numb (Today's not one of those days, unfortunately.) and I haven't cried in a few months. I'm just so emotionally burnt out and I don't expect anything good to happen to me. I don't really want to be this way, but with the virus going around, I can't see any other way to be. Why hope for things that you can't have? And why hope for things that are never going to happen? Why hope for a happy, fulfilling life in a world that seems to be crumbling around me?

And on the days I don't feel totally empty inside, I'm just angry. Like, beyond raging. And when I ask my family to leave me be on those days they get insanely angry at me -- but I'm not trying to push them away or be unkind! I just don't want to snap and take out my anger on them. I've tried to tell them that, but they don't listen. Maybe they just forget. Or maybe they don't care. Idk.

I've been trying my best to find a way to move out and into my own home, as well as get a car, but I can't get any emails back about jobs. And I'm wary about working outside of the house because I have an immune-compromised little sister, and I really, really don't want to risk exposing her. (Though I will live in a tent in the backyard if I have to -- if I end up getting a job on the outside, I'm not putting my family at risk.)

I know the first step to fixing a shitty life is starting small. What's something I can do to try and fix things? Feel less numb? Maybe hate myself a little less? Deal with my emotions a little bit better? Are there any better ways to deal with my anger aside from being completely isolated until it goes away?

I just want to feel better. I want to have hope again. But I just don't see how I can try to have any hope anymore. I just don't know what else to do aside from come here. Advice is deeply appreciated. Thank you in advance to anybody who ends up reading this. (Sorry it's so long.) I hope you're having a better day than I am.",10Aug2020,1
