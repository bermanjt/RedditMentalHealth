0,"I don’t know if this is common however I feel like it is. I can never allow myself to justify my own feelings. Let me explain a bit more on that. 

I can’t allow myself to feel them and I will do anything to stop myself from feeling anything - good bad or anything in between. When I start to feel bad I just say to myself well other people have it worse than you or if I go to try to talk to someone about how I’ve felt I usually end up hearing about how they feel and get distracted by it so I never end up actually venting it which has lead me to not really knowing how to feel. 

I mean a part of me knows I feel shit but I don’t know what that means now. It was my birthday today (now yesterday) and I appreciated the gifts I got. I can get up and do things so I don’t think I’m depressed but recently I couldn’t motivate myself to do something that I set a deadline for (it’s a thing I do - I set myself a deadline to finish a project before I need it to be finished officially so I have relaxing time and I always thought of it as lazy self interest) which is really unlike me as I’ve done it for a few years now but I’m not sure if that was just because it was the run up to my birthday getting me to not want to do it and wanting me to just bask in the birthday blues that I was in the middle of it what was happening. 

Basically I just needed somewhere safe to vent and I thought here was the perfect location so I’m sorry you have to see this. Also I’ve rewritten this and changed what I was going to say at least 5 times so that was fun. However the worst part is I am debating on even sending this. I have an issue with asking for help. I’ve written two emails and left them as drafts recently asking for help. Basically I just like doing things alone and figuring them out myself as I don’t want to be a burden or I don’t want to annoy people. 

I think people don’t want to hear what I’m saying. Actually I know many people don’t as I have talked to people online and many people have said Ugh I’m not reading all that in response to my messages. I’m a scattered person who scatters their text about. 

Also I suppose since I’ve called it after the email for no real reasons I may as well attach the two I was going to send. 

Hi,
I don’t really know what to say here. I’ve found myself lacking the motivation to do any college work recently which is unlike me as I would usually be on top of everything but I just feel like things are getting on top of me instead and its just suffocating me. Honestly I am not sure to do - well I am its college work but every time I open it I can’t find the will to write anything down so I just sit doing nothing and by the end I just feel drained

Hi,
Just to preface I know there is nothing you can do in fact there is very little I want you to do - I don’t think I want you to do anything really - however I just needed somewhere to say something or write something.

I am sorry that this falls to your desk but I don’t want to always rely on the same people - a whole different issue too complicated and unnecessary to describe right now. I have absolutely no motivation to do any work - I have tried and I just can’t (which if you knew me is extremely unlike me as I set my own deadlines and finish up early all the time). I open my assignment and just sit until enough time has passed that I can justify closing it (I do research (sometimes that turns into online shopping) but never write a word).

I didn’t think this lockdown was affecting me until I realised I hadn’t stepped outside the door in the few days (I was getting up and getting dressed but I never left which is again unlike me as I would often just go out for no real reason i.e. I would go out for lunch with someone or I would go to work - who would have thought that I would miss work this much.

I thought by the end of this email I would feel better as I wrote down somewhere and that I wouldn’t need to go further than writing my thoughts down however I don’t feel better if anything I feel a bit worse. It is probably the thought of actually sending this. 
Thanks and sorry,

I removed who they were  so that I there are no names involved. Also you now know I’m a college student so thanks for reading this far.",02Nov2020,1

4,"Someone I am very close to has suffered from depression and anxiety most of their life. Things have been really hard over the past year, and I really think they need to go back to talking with a therapist. They have said numerous times that they don't want to talk after trying for so long(inconsistently) and doing through the process with a new person is a ton of hassle and work. And that's before the struggle of insurance and poor availability of people locally. They have been on medications for quite some time now, but no therapist for almost a year or so now. They only got therapy before for a few months due to a traumatic experience. There are a lot of moving parts as to why the depression and everything is spiraling, but I can't get them to agree to at least try therapy.... what can I do? How can I nudge them in that direction and get them to at least give it a shot when they ""don't care anymore""? I want to be supportive and help then through this, but I feel like it's just slipping away...",02Nov2020,1

6,"i built my first pc about a month ago, i was really proud of it but it's been feeling kind of empty and getting the motivation to do much with it is still a struggle. it's stupid but it's been worrying the hell out of me, all the small stuff i know aren't problems. my old laptop pretty much broke from a messed up processor, so naturally the processor on my new pc is constantly worrying me and stressing me out. it's to the point where i was almost constantly keeping tabs on its temperature and usage percent, till i realized the temperature was a little too high on average. this isn't really a big deal, get an extra fan to keep things cool, maybe replace the thermal paste to make sure the part itself is cool, but to me this was enough to freak out over constantly. so i ordered new thermal paste to replace it (a cooling liquid to transfer heat from the processor to the fan on top of it), and it's the little things that make you realize your life and mental state is held together by a very thin string. the order got delayed so i couldn't use my pc for an extra day, this got me to the point of near tears  and made me do pretty much nothing for that whole day. when it finally arrived i took everything apart, cleaned off the processor and the fan, and applied the new thermal paste, but there was too much. the temperatures were low as hell at first (went from average of 50c to about 35c) then it started spiking up to about 70c, then i started freaking out and hyperventilating. frantically typing to some friends screaming about how nothing is going right in life and just when i think i have something good i fuck it up by trying to fix what's not broken. i took it apart again and there was an overflow of the paste, i completely panicked, started crying, threw myself on my bed, hyperventilated, screaming at myself for fucking everything up, saying i couldn't do this shit and shouldn't of even tried. it was horrible. i went downstairs and my mom told me to calm down and figure it out. after i ate dinner i did, then i researched it all and realized thermal paste overflow isn't a problem with this type of paste and as long as nothing got on the cpu pins im fine, just have to clean it and reapply it. once everything was fixed the temperatures were back to normal, and i realized that there was barely a problem to begin with but i stressed myself out about it so much i pretty much made one up and almost broke one of the most expensive parts by trying to 'fix it', i fucking hate the way i think sometimes. it's so ridiculous, this small stuff caused me so much stress and worrying when there really wasn't anything to stress about in the first place, i'm just so tired of it all. i want this worrying to stop, i just want to be happy and content with my hobbies and actually let myself so the things i love, but instead i start bawling my eyes out over a small problem that didn't even exist in the first place.

how can i stop worrying about all this? i just want it to stop",02Nov2020,1
7,"ever since quarantine i’ve lost most of my good friends from school and i’ve been stuck inside, isolated with my parents. i don’t get along with them at all and always end up arguing with them. ever since school started i’ve realized how empty i feel. constant arguing and loneliness has taken a toll on my mental health and i’ve been asking to get checked for depression. ever since school started i’ve felt like i’m plunging deeper into a deeper depression. 

i have asked my parents multiple times to get some sort of a psych test to get help. they’ve been refusing me help every time. they are a big reason why i feel empty. i was the perfect little girl when i was younger. they loved me and had hope. now all i do is argue with them. i’m starting to give up on making highschool friends. they all seem like racist and homophobic jerks. most of them support trump too. it’s harder to get away from home life if i can’t even get along with anyone at my school. 

living just feels like suffering at this point. i want to feel happy and loved again.

11,"I’m not even really sure where to start but I need to get this out. I am just feeling stuck with 0 motivation. A few months back I switched from full time to part time to spend more days with my son especially since I want to be around more when he starts school, he is 4 atm. luckily I make 20 dollars an hour so I get by but it’s barely. The full time hours would of made it impossible for me to be involved with him after school. (2pm - 12am) so I switched. I also thought it’d give me a chance to feel a little better, I could paint again and finally just enjoy life. But I feel almost worse than I did before. No drive, tired constantly, just a complete hermit. I don’t feel like I even know who I am, it’s a complete lost and stuck feeling. I had contemplating going back to school next year to possibly get my cosmetology certificate. But then I’d have to quit my part time 20 dollar an hour paying job due to conflict of hours once again. I’m stuck on feeling if it’s worth it or not. Go to school and maybe get by on bills and just get a shitty job in the end and be in debt but at least enjoy what I’m doing or get a second more flexible job deal with being miserable but have guaranteed money? I feel so much negativity and confusion more than what I’ve ever felt in my life. I had gotten a second job at a gas station and I was super psyched about it when I first started the hiring process... it lasted 2 weeks. My mood just dropped, I don’t have the patience anymore. I’m just plain unhappy. It’s such a miserable feeling because I don’t know how to break out of this mentality, because I wake up like this most days.  I want to get out of this state of mind, but I don’t know how, I’m on a waitlist for a therapist. I just want to make sense of my feelings. I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what I like, I don’t know myself and I feel so unfulfilled. No matter what I decide with school or a 2nd job, I will not succeed with either one if I can’t break out of this. I don’t even know what to do. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense to anyone, my mind is all over the place.",02Nov2020,1
12,"this never affected me, but a couple months ago I started noticing that everyone has a lot of followers on social media, everyone except me, most people I know have about 600 followers on instagram, I barely make it to 200.

27,"I'm 19, and I can't really harm myself because I live with my family and we're together in a small space pretty much 24/7. I was also sleeping beside my mom once, and I could hear her screaming my name in her sleep. It made me rethink my decisions. I used to think that maybe it was okay for me to be a little selfish and end things, but when I heard her I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

I also have an 11 y/o brother whom I love very very much, and I don't want him to end up like me. I can tell he really looks up to me even if I honestly don't understand why haha. We love hanging out with each other, and I don't want him to go through pain for the rest of his life because of my actions (assuming that he'd care) (I hope he does).

The thing is, I can only do the bare minimum. I'm literally just alive. That's it. I've tried explaining my thoughts and how I feel and how my brain's ""logic"" is like, but my mom ends up feeling bad and thinks that she must have done something wrong (even if she's the kindest parent I know). That's why I'm posting on reddit instead of talking with a friend or family member; my thoughts seem to be too sad for everyone in my life, and I don't want them to get hurt.

Because of this I'm failing my classes, and nobody really knows how bad it is. I can easily look happy and watch youtube videos, but it really just keeps my mind out of the things that I have to do. My old/better self also signed up for responsibilities outside class, so everything is literally falling apart.

idk I just wish I could figure out how to want to live for me, because right now I just... really really hate myself.

The idea of living in a world where all my goals and accomplishments will inevitably be irrelevant after I die, thus making my entire existence meaningless, makes me more sad than thought if dying. Living makes me sadder than dying. I'm not even really sad about living, more bored of it. I hate the society and responsibilities that I'm confined to and I'm bored of it. So bored it hurts.

30,"I don’t even know what flair to use or if this even fits in this sub. I just want to get this out there. I doubt it will do any good, but I want to be able to write this out. 

I’m in my early twenties, and I feel empty. I feel like I’m not even a person. Just a shell doing the things I’m supposed to, then come home, lock myself away in my room and recharge. Any interaction outside of work is too taxing and relationships are difficult. I feel like I’m cool with everyone and close to no one. I have no real friends. I have a few people I talk to from my old job but we don’t really talk. I have their numbers and that’s as far as any friendship gets. I have the impression or worry people think I’m fake because I try to be nice to others. I don’t think I’m fake. I want to think I’m easy enough to get along with, but then again, when I have no strong feelings about most things, it’s hard to get on my bad side. If people don’t treat me with outright disrespect, I’m fine with them. 

The people I do have the most contact with are my writing partners. And this is embarrassing for me. I’m an avid role player and almost all of my free time since high school has gone into long form roleplays, and honestly, it’s the happiest I ever am, writing out a story with an excited partner. It’s nothing sexual or anything, and it’s a form of escapism I obsess over. To the point it’s the thing I look forward to all day, and I get hurt if a partner ghosts me. 

Sadly, it’s more about the roleplay than my partner. In that way, I feel like I’m using people. I try to make it enjoyable, and I doubt they’re all looking to be my friend in the first place, but to be honest, I don’t even know names. Even just gender sometimes. I know their age range and that’s about it because I only write with people around my age. 

I don’t know why I’m even going into depth about this, and it feels dumb, but it’s the only hobby that still brings me joy. I play video games, too, but it’s nowhere near as fulfilling. It’s not even that I just love writing. I can’t find the motivation to write something on my own. Even original based RPs are too taxing sometimes so I stick to fandom now. I used to draw and write and craft but that’s all gone. 

I used to play an app game as an escape too, but it was honestly the worst decision I’ve made. As crazy as it sounds, I spent around $16k I didn’t have on credit cards to feel important to people I didn’t know over the course of a year. It was an addiction, and since I’ve stopped playing, I’m down to about 9k in debt with no savings. I feel like a failure and pathetic for spending that way, and it’s my biggest shame. I’m so afraid someone in my life will find out or just ask about finances. 

That was my effort to connect, I guess. And we did get along, and I didn’t have to spend the money, but it made me feel important in that sense. Again, pathetic. I cut all ties with them once I quit the game and that was it. 

Since then, I really haven’t talked to anyone. I work and my new job is fine so far. Two weeks in and I’m praying I don’t get fired because it’s a better paying job than my last even if it’s not great, and I want to pay off that debt so I can have that weight off my chest. 

I wholeheartedly believe that the purpose of life is to enjoy yourself. If you’re not hurting others, I support you. I’m not religious or hold any beliefs of that nature, though I think I wanted to since middle school. To have something to believe in and have some hope. But I have nothing. 

I just want to be happy. I’ve felt empty or sad for as long as I can remember. Mostly, I feel absolutely nothing, but I’ll bawl my eyes out randomly if not distracted. I’m writing this because I woke up crying. I didn’t have a bad dream or anything. I used to have not great thoughts in high school and middle school especially.

In middle school I moved to a different state with my father. We had no money and I didn’t have clothes, and he was stingy with showers so I was constantly talked about behind my back. I had no friends and the people who did talk to me I think just felt bad for me. High school wasn’t as bad, and after high school I left the state. I think part of the reason I’m so easy going with people now is that I’m glad most (not all) adults treat each other with some baseline of respect. 

I can never remember friends being something I needed. I just needed people to not be outright mean, and I’m happy. Now, in my twenties with no friends and having never been in or wanted a relationship, I feel like something’s missing. Something I’m supposed to have and just don’t. If I do ever get to the point where I feel like I could maybe be friends with a person, I feel like I’m lying to them. I’m not sure about what. And maybe I really am fake. But I feel like they see me as something I’m not. I feel like I don’t have he capacity to have friends, and I don’t have the emotional range for it. 

Like everything is just muted. I don’t know if it’s depression or what. If it can be diagnosed. But every time I think it might be, I convince myself I’m overreacting. I should probably talk to someone, but I feel like I’m lying to them, too. I feel like I’m lying just writing this. Like just writing this out makes me seem like more of a person than I am. And there’s so much vulnerability in therapy that I can’t see myself having. I can’t stand when people even try to help when I’m sick. I can’t sit in front of another human being crying like this while I try to explain I’m empty and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know what’s wrong. I just want to be happy. I don’t know how, but I feel like I’m just missing that part that could be. 

I’ve tried writing in a journal but every time I do, I throw them away, like denying that I feel this way and have as long as I can remember will make it go away. 

The reason I keep bringing up relationships is because humans are supposedly social creatures. I’ve never been really close to anyone in my life, even family. I feel like an outsider looking into the world. It’s not that I have low self esteem. I’m alright. I don’t want to stop living, and generally my mood isn’t too too low, but I feel like I’m just not like what a person should be. 

To get back to romantic relationships (I’m sorry I’m jumping around. This is very stream of consciousness.), I feel gross when men approach me. I’m not sure if I don’t want to be with a man period,  but I don’t want to be vulnerable in that way. I feel I’ve seen as innocent/submissive because of how quiet. I get told I’m “shy” a lot because I don’t have much to say, but that’s not it. I just usually have nothing to say and see no reason to interject myself. But anyway, I feel like men approach me because they think I’d be easy to control in some way. The men who are drawn to me seem to be shy types. Shy, geeky, and don’t do well socially. Older than me usually as well. “Nice guy” types sometimes. I’ve had a few approach me who I did like in an almost-friend way, only for them to “confess” to me. I don’t tend to pick up on flirty cues, and even though when they ask I tell them I don’t do relationships, they push. They think they can change my mind and that they’re such cool people. And it’s sad because I do enjoy having guy friends(as close as I get). Maybe I’m gay, and that’s why I’m turned off by men. Maybe it’s just that I’m frustrated they can be interested without knowing the first thing about me. I don’t want a romantic relationship. It’s a level of vulnerability and a level of my own mental energy I’m not willing to give, but sometimes I feel like I should want that. But I don’t. 

Sometimes I do want friends though but I have nothing to offer in a friendship. I try to be easy going/lighthearted with friends. I like horror, video games, and role playing. That’s all there is to me as a person. My emotions are limited, I have no passions. Other people either don’t feel real to me or I just don’t feel real in this world. 

Again, not saying I don’t want to live. I just feel empty inside. There are so many pieces I feel like I just don’t have. I’m just put together enough to seem alright. I take care of myself, go to work, then isolate. And doing anything else with my free time seems exhausting. 

I’m sorry if you read all of this. I’m gonna post without rereading because if I do, it’ll feel like a lie, and I’ll delete it. But it’s not a lie. I’m not being dramatic. I just can’t convince myself of that. Please forgive typos. Thanks for reading if you did. You officially know more about me than anyone ever will. Lol",02Nov2020,1
31,"Hi, a while ago I had shared my wishes to die to the world and the fact that I received messages of encouragement from various parts helped me a lot.  So I will share something more of my heart.  In my case, I have been battling depression for several years.  It is as if a ghost is taking away your energy and your will to live.  I still don't fully understand why to stay here.  Therapy and medicine have helped me, but sometimes it is very difficult to control.

This feeling is as if you live life in grayscale and you don't care about a thing, you want to intensely experience the things that you end up hurting your loved ones and drowning in your own sea of ​​blood. In some way, I know the answer for search the light, but It's very hard to me and i don't know why T_T. The most difficult thing is to balance your emotions

 My story is a bit long to tell but I will try to make a summary.  I was a victim of bullying in my school, I was the guy with good grades and I was an egocentric person who did not understand his emotions very well, you know, my world was the good results to have respect, it was supposed 🙄  My childhood was actually good despite everything.  The bad thing was that many things happened in my life that deserved their importance and at the time I did not: The death of a boy with whom I used to play cause he was killed by the school bus;  a car accident that almost kill my mom and not having qualified for the college he wanted.  Everything was mixed together to give life to that damn ghost.

 It has been very difficult to deal with it, it has led me to look for the things that I think I need towards the extreme: Love, freedom, loyalty.  The recognition no longer mattered to me and I have been a friend of drugs, but I confess to having gone looking for prostitutes because I never understood the feeling of someone who loves you and supports you apart from your family, it goes beyond having a girlfriend.  At school I had a friend to whom I told everything and she told me, it was nice and in some way that helped me fight against bullying.  But there was no unconditional friendship, she was sometimes not there when I felt sad, that destroyed me.

 Years later, during my studies at the university, I ended up going to the psychiatrist because my hands were shaking a lot, and that affected me in my work and studies.  At the psychiatrist I understood that what I had was the beginning of bipolar depression and that was the beggining when I started to open my Pandora's box, then I understood the mistakes of my past and that helped me wonderfully to change many things in my personality, but I had already very hurt for my darkness inside me. Dayd passed and I began to feel contempt for life, I felt exhausted and even stressed that I wanted to have breakfast, to the point that I began to think that the best thing was to end my life.  I have tried to commit suicide more than 4 or 5 times with pills without success.  In the last one I tried to drink DMSO in the lab that I work and I ended up in the mental health hospital at my university.  I felt a void that was too strong that there was no way to fill it, I was searching inside myself but I did not feel guilty about anything, I had already confessed everything to the doctor, I have family and friends who appreciate me like never before, but that ghost continues to feed on  my darkness as if losing all feeling of concern, but also of happiness, just what difference did it make, maybe with death I can be calmer?

 Now I am studying my master's degree and working in phytochemistry research, I can be a stupid, but it has been a real torture that you are not passionate about what you do and not because I am in the wrong place but because it is not born to me and the fact of thinking that  , it disturbs me and I end up in bed sometimes for several days, it feels like I'm emotionally drained, my darkness is killing me.  The truth is I don't know if this has a solution, but I think there are people who believe in me and that keeps me standing, even if I see life in grayscale.

 If it helps, you can contact me and talk about what you feel and vent to each other.",02Nov2020,1
