15,"Hi there.   


TL:DR - Been severely depressed for 7 months, need constant distraction to not fall apart. I am so tired of needing to focus on being distracted at all times, and no idea how to deal with things. How can I calm down? My counselling is on pause due to lock down, and I only have a limited number of sessions left.

  
I've been depressed for the last 10 months, 7 of which, severely so. I am trying every pill under the sun, about to start number 13 or 14, so far nothing has helped and whilst I have bipolar disorder, I think it's more about my life situation now than bipolar depression. I am doing everything I can to change my situation, but unfortunately a lot of it is out of my hands and in the control of my abusive ex partner. Too complicated for me to explain.  


I keep needing to stay distracted every waking hour at the moment, otherwise I will fall apart and just sit sobbing, unable to really do anything. I am very suicidal at this point, but I am in control enough to not do it. I don't want to die really, I just want to have control over my life and not hurt so bad all the time.   
The need to stay mentally distracted is exhausting me, I'd love to be able to just relax and be in the moment. I am able to do a short bit of yoga in the evenings, which I find is slightly helpful.  
I'm constantly reading things, anything, to keep my mind occupied. I do play some games in the evening, and I chat to my long distance partner a lot too. I find it very hard to put whatever I am reading down in the evening, as the idea of trying to get to sleep is so distressing. I do sometimes find a bit of help in guided meditation when going to sleep. Then when I wake up I start thinking immediately, and want to just sleep forever to escape it.   
I can't get all my housework done, as I fall apart crying even from doing the dishes, as it's not distracting enough. Music is not helping. Might try an audiobook perhaps.  


What on earth can I do? I'm not sure how long I can hold on like this.",18May2020,1

19,"I'm proud of y'all.

I've gone through some pretty hellish things myself. I know it can be incredibly draining to live with mental illness. There's a lot of guilt associated with feelings and thoughts of suicide and depression. It's a constant battle against your own brain waking up every day. I totally understand. 

Even if you consider your circumstances ""not that bad"" and feel guilty about your bad feelings. Even if you know there are people going through worse.. your experiences are just as valid!! No problem is too small to be listened to. 

No problem is too big to deal with, either. You are not a burden for having intense thoughts on your mind. You aren't ""too much to deal with."" If you fear opening up because you think that it's going to push others away- well, forget that thought entirely! I'm one of the many willing to listen. You are not too much. You are worthy.

If you have lashed out on others, pushed people away, or isolated because of depression/thoughts... know that I understand that, too. 

It can be harder to accept people into your space if you are surrounded by toxic people yourself, don't have learned coping skills, or have guilt making you feel like pushing others away is the only option. 

If you have been rejected by family, have your feelings/illness ignored, are afraid to open up, or don't have the resources readily available.. I understand how hurt that can make a person feel. I know some people's approaches to mental health are not always the most helpful- and that not everything works for the same person. 

There are so many depressed people. From so many backgrounds. From so many circumstances. All with varying levels of support/reactions around them- as well as internal coping for themselves. 

Even if you DO get up every day, struggling with mental illness. It can be draining. It can feel hopeless. Even with help, sometimes it can be hard. Your struggle is not unnoticed. If you struggle to function and focus every day, and still pull through. I am proud. 

And if you relapse, break down, or feel unloved above all else.. Know that your feelings are valid.. And despite the ache.. I am proud of *you*  too. 

Some of us live in complicated situations. Some of us have done things we're not proud of. Some of us have gone through immense trauma. And some of us are just.. Tired of life. 

But everyone deserves to break through barriers. Celebrate small things. Be in touch with your feelings. See your aspirations and reach for them with all your strength. Even if you have none. Even if your identity and sense of purpose are out of whack. Hell.. You deserve to be here anyway. Even if you see nothing to live for. Even if you're in an environment that makes it hard to heal. You are so fucking stellar and I am PROUD of you. 

To give up.. and being afraid.. to break down and scramble for reasons to stay here..is all just- part of the battle. And you have absolutely nothing to be fucking ashamed of. 

Whether someone has hurt you, or you have hurt someone. Whether you struggle with a terminal illness or you're having a hard day. Or week, or month, or life. I'm telling you, your feelings are valid. I getchu. Anyone can be depressed. But what matters to me is that you are heard, or at least find some solace in the fact that you are worthy of a good life.

Even if it takes a while to get there, and even if it still is a struggle now and then once things get better. Self improvement is always possible, and I swear to god, you're loveable. 

Anyway, sending good vibes your way mdudes. You aren't alone. &lt;3",18May2020,1
20,"Hi, my name is Eric and this is my story:

When i was third grade, i was moved to a new class for some reason. In the first year, the class felt ok, some of the classmate is pretty annoying because they act like some kind of gangster, but at that time my young self think i won't have to deal with them anymore because the year is over. How foolish i am to think that. For some reason, the annoying group is in the same with me class until eighth grade. Over time, the kids is more and more annoying to deal because they act like gangster ALL THE TIME. And for some unknown reason, they act like i'm the gang boss when i'm just trying to be a normal person. That really piss me of and since i have an anger issue ( I have a short temper), i rage quite a lot when i was young. Now they can make me rage anymore, but i still want to hit them in the face REALY bad. Any way, when i was at fourth grade, i hosted a birthday party, i invited the whole class, i was very exited that week. And then, guess who finally show up, ONE PERSON, ONLY ONE. it was so awkward. Because he and i have no hobby in common, he just show up as a nice friend. If he didn't show up, i will be just a little depress. In the end of the day, i was heavily depress, awkward and want to die because of awkward. In the next day, they all say that they forgot, i didn't say anything, but the thing that hurt the most is that the one who i think was my best friend give me the invitation card back. If he just say sorry i'll be ok, but give the card back? That is just rubbing salt to the wound. In the end of that day, i know they aren't my friend, friend are the one who CARES about you, they DON'T. That is the moment when ten years old me get depression.

Thank a lot for reading this post of mine.",18May2020,1

23,"I'll try to keep things relevant and concise but I have a lot to get off my chest.

I graduated high school in 2010- 2 years after the recession. Things took a hit pretty bad hit where I lived and the worst of unemployment actually hit around '09-'10. Needless to say, I struggled to find a job. I eventually got a minimum wage job at a deli and enrolled in the local community college. While working there my mom started sleeping with my boss- who then started sexually harassing me. It ended in a full-on assault where I quit and struggled to find a new job. 

I had fun at school but had absolutely no idea what direction to take my education in. No one in my family has gone to college before. My mother actually dropped out of school in 9th grade and my younger sister graduated high school with special needs. 

I started focusing on the sciences and spent 4 years (yes very slow path) to get my associates in biology. My goal by this point was to transfer into a 4year university for chemical engineering. After achieving a 3.8 GPA and a wonderful recommendation letter from one of my professors I got in. I left for university but my first day of class never came. I moved in and out within the first two weeks. I was incredibly financially unprepared and didn't have a support system. The rent was only $400 but any unknown unplanned debt scares the shit out of me. It's destroyed my family growing up on multiple occasions. From loosing our house, furniture, cars. So I panicked when money started adding up and I left. 

By this time I was engaged and my wonderful fiance took a job out of state. Seeing as I had nothing left, I followed him. I've had a pretty good life here but not at the same time. I have a good group of friends I am very thankful for.
 I was no longer motivated for engineering and all the bad feelings came rushing back when I even considered or talked about trying again.  For better or worse I switched to Accounting after waiting over a year to get in-state tuition. This May 2020, I have officially graduated. Something I am not the least bit proud of. 

Now I cannot find a job... again. I was working in a restaurant when all this happened, so I do have unemployment. I keep applying for jobs but frankly I am not competitive. Just like the first time around. I only have a 3.5 GPA and because I worked so much I wasn't involved in on-campus school clubs. I should be using this time to study for the CPA but I am not motivated. I don't think anyone's going to hire me and I don't want to waste my time. And comparatively I am old. I am 28. Who wouldn't want a 21yr old with a clean past who stayed focused over someone like me? That's all I keep thinking and feeling when I see others LinkedIn profiles. There's so many weird timeframes on me no one's going to want to bother with me. 

 I am also in the tri-state area including New York so our shut down will last longer than most states I'm afraid.

I don't know what kind of support I need. I'm just unmotivated and everyone on the internet acts like they like a good underdog but that's not so in the real world. Hiring managers want young, impressionable, smart but naive, young people. They want someone with no gaps in education and leadership roles on campus. I don't fit and I am afraid I spent all my time getting a degree I'm not cut out for.",18May2020,1
24,"For the longest time, I’ve had this dream that I’ll be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. I’ve wrote songs before, I’ve played many instruments before, I’ve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.


Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music.


Even when sewing, I sing. 


Even when I’m outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because I’m so weak.

I’m weak because I couldn’t sing in front of others. I’m weak because I’m so shy. I’m weak because I couldn’t even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go.


I’m so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I don’t at the same time. Isn’t it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I can’t sing. I sound horrible when I’m standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I can’t even sing outside anymore, because I’m afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. I’m my worst enemy. 



Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why can’t I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. I’m going to art school to draw, which I’m still bad at. I’m not going for music. 


I want to let go of song. But I don’t at the same time. I’m stuck yet again. I don’t know why I’m here.

27,"Hi, I'm gSL2rAmntf (I'd like to remain anonymous, sorry), and I searched for platforms where people with more knowledge than me or with experience could aid me in helping a friend on a specific topic. I thought this one could be a useful one.  
I'll try to explain this friend of mine's background well but at the same time I'll try to not overextend on it without missing key parts.

\- I met this friend online about 2 and a half years ago through a videogame and a mutual friend.  
\- She's 26.  
\- I'm 24 (if that matters).  
\- We've met in real life only once about 6 months ago (we're both very introverted and we don't really like going out too much).  
\- She lives with her parents and her 2 sisters.  
\- She's been drawing for many years. She has a good enough level as an artist to get situational project comissions.  
\- She hasn't studied anything for 2 years. Prior to that she only had obligatory education and some years of art education (non - curricular), I think.  
\- She hasn't had any job (apart from very few art project comissions she did).  
\- She mainly stays at home and does some house work on the morning, then she plays games, she talks with her best friend, she talks with me for a bit, we play games after having dinner and she draws every now and then (depends a lot on her mood, I'll expand on this later).  
\- She told me about her depression about 3 months and a half ago. We talked it out and she went to a psychologist very soon after talking it (I'd say less than a week). The visits were good, she got some small tasks to start working on doing better, and the psychologist prescribed her antidepressants (I think this is the correct translation). The medication worked pretty nicely, she's never happy of the ""her taking happy pills"" (as she calls it) situation but she's aware of how well those have done in not letting her be constantly thinking about bad things.  
\- Her depression makes her be constantly very sad and regretful. With the medication it's much lighter, but still, every now and then she feels the same way.  
\- She has considerable troubles with her sleep schedule (she finds it hard to just go to sleep and he wakes up at random times in the morning, as she stops alarms without even realising it). As we usually played some games after having dinner, we agreed on specific times to 100% stop playing (and maybe talk for a bit afterwards, not just cutting it straight) to try to make it easier for her to go to sleep at a decent time as well as waking up also at a decent time. We followed this every time but she wouldn't always go to sleep after we hang our call (a Discord call), as she was just not sleepy and going to bed seemed worthess. We keep doing this.

Having explained this I'd like to talk about the problem, so here I go:

She loves drawing. She loves drawings. She loves to share drawings of her favourite artists with her closest friends (mainly me and her best friend). In fact, our passion for art and the joy of discussing about it (about drawings, games, movies, tv shows, how do we feel with them (I'm a game developer aspiring to be a game designer)) is what I think got us into being close friends (I'm very shy and I barely make friends nor have many of them).  
She's a pretty good artist at this point. She has a level high enough to work as an artist (I know this may sound subjective but i can ensure it's not). She did a few art project comissions and the clients were very pleased.  
Recently she started streaming me her screen while she draws every now and then, and I love it. We talked about what she'd like to achieve as an artist (because she wants to be an artist and work as one). The big problem here is that she doesn't find the strength to draw. She doesn't find the motivation to do so. And she gets very sad and frustrated because of it. She tells me that she wants to be an artist and that she wants to make a living out of it but that she doesn't draw (refering to the fact that she doesn't draw enough relative to all the time she could be doing so, as she stays home all day all week). I do not know it super precisely but she doesn't draw every day (but I think it's close) and when she does it's for an hour or two (more or less). She told me that she talked about this with her psychologist and that they both worked on little things to make the process of getting to draw and drawing more appealing and less negative (for example, she told me drawing could be a pain because she'd have very awful random thoughts while doing so), but that those things have been proven useless and now that she doesn't see her psychologist anymore, she feels broken on this regard.

To put it all in a conclusion, she feels like she's absolutely stuck. She wants to be an artist, she loves drawing, but she doesn't find the motivation and strength to do so, and that breaks her. She looks very happy and well when she has had a succesful drawing session that day or the day before.

I want to help her. And I don't want to do it wrong. I genuinely love her drawings, I love to see her drawing, I love to talk about it, we share other drawings with each other, I even tried to convince her that she should slowly but surely show some her drawings to the world (for example, a fanart of X character of a game to the subreddit for the people who play that character, as in those subreddit people always praise new drawings for their favourite character!), because hell, she's very good at it!, but even tho she's excited about doing so, I feel like she's never happy with what she does, and then again the loop starts again.

Hey good people!

I'm new here so I don't really know how I'm supposed to start... So a few days ago I had a suicidal episode, and during it I started writing down my thoughts. I went back to it the next day and wrote down my thoughts towards the end of the episode. As you can imagine it's all pretty vague and nasty. 

I guess my question is, should I let my therapist read it. I definitely trust her, and I like her a lot, but I'm conflicted. I think this would put me in a different light and I'm not sure I want her to see that, but at the same time how is she going to help me if I don't show her the ugly bits?

And whereas I understand my parents' frustration that I haven't been doing anything for almost a year now, I can't take their rants at me anymore. I have not chosen for my life to be like this at only 21 years old. 

Anyway, perhaps I *am* to stubborn and lazy? Because I got used to it? My parents tell me I can't keep living like this till my 80th, and they're also not going to let me stay in the house for that long. It's not like they would kick me out very soon though, as my older sister moved out at 25 years old. Anyway, whereas I haven't been feeling miserable and really depressed for some months now, I still feel unhappy and I do get frustrated because I don't find purpose in my life. I still can't find hobbies or passions that I truly enjoy. I don't really have dreams either. And because of the fact I don't have much that makes me enjoy life, I don't feel like looking for a job because I know that won't make me appreciate life more. It would probably do the opposite instead.

I do feel a little bad about it, because it's kind of ""obliged"" to work, at least at some point. Everyone needs to work. Otherwise you can't make money, and without money you die. But I guess guilt is the major reason for me to feel bad for it. But the other part of me still thinks I haven't chosen to have been born or become depressed, and therefore I feel like it isn't fair that I owe society something.

Side Notes: My current diagnoses are ADHD, GAD, GDD. Those were given by a psychiatrist's office. I think it's in my best interest to be evaluated by a psychologist.",18May2020,1
36,"I don’t know when I started to feel like this. I think it was always just a thought in the back of my head but now that I’m in quarantine, I’m left alone to my own thoughts :/. I’m starting to eat less and less, my sleep schedule is becoming messed up, I have a ton of negative thoughts I’m not okay with sharing just yet. I haven’t done online school in a while and when I think about doing it, I feel a pit in the bottom of my stomach. I just wanna know if there is anything I can incorporate into my life so I can stop acting like this, or at least stop my downwards momentum. Thank you if anyone read this.",18May2020,1
37,"I’m a 27 year old female that’s struggled w/mental illness such as depression and anxiety almost all my life. I’ve had so many experiences where life seems daunting and dreadful I’m not sure if it’s cause of my depression my trauma or I’m a glass half empty kinda person but my friends are always telling me that I’m
  “to negative” And “everyone has issues “ and to stop complaining to them about my life . I understand no one wants a friend that’s constantly spewing negativity, but I don’t think they get that you can’t just switch off your mind  w/ a click of a button. I also don’t think they understand   How  truly hard it is for me to feel happy or good about anything . Now I feel like I have no support system anymore let down my friends  and  I can’t shake the sadness .",18May2020,1

41,"Good Evening, 

  
I hope everyone is staying safe.  So, I'm looking for advice and it has to be with my best friend of 12 years who is just not doing well at all during this isolation.  So, before this morning when she sent a text saying ""She feel so bad"" and ""She's in a really dark place"" I hadn't heard from her in 3 or so weeks other than a message telling me she wasn't feeling herself and she was going to be that way for a while.

  
I talked to her this morning over the phone for about 30 or so minutes(I responded to her messages at 6:30 when it was 4:30 where she was) and talked to her, made her laugh and after laughing for a bit, she went to sleep.  She's struggled with her depression for awhile and of course goes through ups and down but this is the hardest it's hit her since I've known her and I'm wondering what I can do other than the standard checking up on her via phone or text and the like or is that all I am limited to?  


Thanks",18May2020,1

43,I have been home for almost one and half years without college. I got year dropped. And these days I have been feeling more low. I don't have any confidence to do anything. Like there is literally 0 confidence in me. I have been struggling with my anxiety. I'm antisocial. I don't like to interact with people. I feel so lonely that not even my family feels like family. I don't how to tell them what I'm experiencing. I spend my whole day in phone. I stay awake all night and sleep in the morning. This habits are now attached to me. I have becomed so much lazy that i can't tell. I try to act like normal but every second I'm feeling sad inside. At midnight without reason i cry lot. Day by day I'm losing interest in talking. I only ask my mother if what is in the dinner menu as i sleep in the morning so i woke up in the evening. There is huge life decision in front of me but I'm ignoring it like with 0 importance. I'm afraid of taking any decisions. Parents are getting frustrated. Sometimes i don't feel anything. I blame myself every single minute. I feel like there is nothing left of me anymore. I try to study but i can't concentrate. If i don't understand something i start remembering my past. I can't fix my goal/dream. I can't even decide what i love or what I'm interested in or what is my hobby. While writing this I'm feeling heavy.,18May2020,1
