0,"It's been a year since i had a this kinda relationship on this girl. Our relationship was easily broken because of how we treated each other. That toxic relationship turns out to have effect on my mental illness. Then months later i still want her to be mine again but i am trying to improve my self to suit's that personality that she want. But then it was like my conscience push me to just forget her and move on. It wasn't so easy so i message her on ig and tell her if we can just be friends so my conscience will not bother me anymore. But time goes by, it's like she hates me so much like i belong to the trash. I know i have a fault but why would she treat me that way even though i am trying to be a better person?",25Jun2020,1
1,"First, sorry if my english is bad it's not my primary language. 

I've been feeling pretty down this past time. I don't see the point in waking up and leaving the bed to see my online classes, the internet is being shit so why try? 

We're running out of money since my dad can't go out to work, and even though I try and try I can't get a job, my mom doesn't work so the only provider is my dad. I don't think we'll last past august, and all this is making me feel like I should just die so they can sell my stuff and get some money out of it, they can also use my savings I don't care.   
I really feel like I'm a wast of money and time for them, that I've always been. I'm and adult (F25) and can't get a job, my dad has to pay for my studies, and even though I try always and do my best I still end up failling or I think I'll always fail, I have no self esteem, and I don't trust in myself at all. 

My mother abused me verbally ever since I was 6 or maybe before that, telling me I was worth nothing and comparing me to other classmates, I've been a failure since highschool, I've seen the dissapointment in my dad's face when seeing me, but don't think he's never said mean things to me, he has and sometimes they hurt worse than my mom's, I know I'm not worth of anything. The two relationships I had were shit too (the first one was toxic and the guy only wanted to have sex, which I never gave to him, and the second was literally just for a bet, the guy didn't like me at all), there's a woman who says she likes me, but I just can't believe anyone who tells me that, I just don't have it in me. 

I really think I should die, to stop wasting money, and stop wasting other people's lives, I feel sorry for the friends I talk to about my problems, I'm the kind of person who feels ashamed for being depressed given the fact that I don't have it as bad as other people may have it. I feel like I don't have even the right of being down or depressed, that I shouldn't even exist, that I should've never been born. 

Every day I wake up I think I should just die, but I'm too much of a coward to do so myself and I'm just stuck living another day, in which I feel worthless and that I shouldn't exist, and should stop being a waste for my parents and evryone around me. 

Sorry for wasting your time reading this. But still thank you for reading it.",25Jun2020,1
2,"I'm 13 (yes ik) and I live with my mum dad and my younger 12 to brother. to sum my situation up in short I am insanely paranoid about my dad dieing. I stay up at night till 3 in the morning sometimes or until he goes to bed when he is angry to make sure if he had a heart attack I am awake. He has heart problems or something and also is on medication so he is not thinking straight at all.

Earlier today he tried to kill himself Infront of my mum by taking a hand full of pills. He refused to make himself sick and blames it 100% on me. Apparently he can't handle the fact that I play video games lot even tho my brother plays lots lots more than me. And when I am very angry or sad I swear alot. 

I was playing with my freind when my mum came told me he tried to swallow pills and we think he spat all of them out. He constantly repeats that this is mainly my fault and he can't handle me etc. My brother idk what he was thinking went and made him self an ice-cream. He refused to throw them up ( maybe because he spat all of them out anyway but we don't know). I was really worried because at that point my mum hadn't told me that she thinks he actually did throw all of them out. When I shout the only thing he gives a flying fuck about is that out neighbours can hear ( they probably cant, my closest ones live ages away anyway) he then says I'm damaging his arm (his nerves are damaged so lost his job as a pilot). It was just a cycle of him locking himself I rooms and me trying to knock down the door. My mum tried to keep em away from him because I think he just hates me and my mum when he is angry especially me. We get into lots of arguements but I still care for him deeply.

He keeps repeating that I want him dead which is obviously bull shit and acts just so the neighbours don't have to hear shouting. In the end my mum called my aunt who spoke to him and from what I heard it kinda improved. I am way to scared that anything will happen to him and I feel as if I'm like I have extreme anxiety but then again I feel as tho I have many reasons to be worried. 

Ofc I have other small issues in my life to like everyone ( 150 unread messages from school etc.) And I just feel it is all happening now but I fear it can get a lot worse.",25Jun2020,1
3,I'm tired of living. I dont want to kill myself but somedays I just want to die. I feel I've wasted my life and I'm scared I will continue to waste my life or dig an even bigger hole for myself if a make any changes. I barely graduated highschool because I goofed off way too much. I could still go to community college but I'm terrified I'll fail again and be stuck with debt and a degree I wont be able to use.  Wouldn't really matter because I'm in debt already because of medical bills. I'm stuck at a job that pays decently. But I hate it. I cant leave because of the benefits. I see my life going nowhere and I will be alone probably for the rest of my life. Only thing that keeps me from killing my self is my mother who loves me so much. I could never do that to her. That's why i wish i could just fall asleep and never wake up. And I know I could be entirely wrong considering I'm only 20 years old and have alot of life to live but I just dont see it happening.I just wish I had someone I could at least talk to about my problems because I feel all my relationships i have are pretty superficial and I cant really rely on them or open up to anyone.,25Jun2020,1
4,"I've always been bad about washing dishes because I HATE it. I don't have a dishwasher, so I'd have to do it all by hand. It's gotten worse since COVID-19 stuck me by myself in my apartment. I have dishes I haven't washed since March. There are things growing on them. I know, it's disgusting. 

Two weeks ago, on my birthday, my boyfriend told me (and my parents I was Skyping with) that he would clean my dishes for me. I was honestly so excited. And then he got distracted and didn't. Am I wrong for being upset? I feel more stuck than ever and no longer have any clean silverware or plates. I'm eating out of the packaging and snacking instead of eating meals. None of this is healthy. I'm considering mitigating some of the issues by getting disposable silverware, but that also makes me feel shitty.

How do I ask my boyfriend for the help he offered but didn't provide? I don't want to seem entitled, but it would really help my mental state. 

Do you have advice for getting past it? It's kind of a feeling that I can't get things clean so I might as well not try, but now there's also a disgust factor. If I didn't have to eat and wouldn't go hungry, I don't think I'd eat much. Food in general is just not my thing.",25Jun2020,1
5,"My best friend hates me now because I’m always depressed, stressed and have social anxiety, he told me if I managed to stop being like this, he’d be friends with me again, I’ve been feeling really terrible and beating myself up about it, I need advice, what do I do?

6,"My thoughts about many negative things, my fucked up sleeping schedule, my hate towards myself, my poor nutrition and pain in my back and neck (and also my headache my constantly thinking) block me from doing something productive.

7,"I don't know if this an ok thread to post on but I don't have many people to count on I felt I needed to share this. I am a 20 y/o f and have been struggling with depression for over a decade now. I have been put in therapy since year 6 and on and off meds since then (always got off of them because I was paranoid about them). Recently with the quarantine starting and nothing much else to do but being by myself I decided to focus on myself I got into online therapy and back on meds. Today I was listening to rslash on YouTube because I've kind of been obsessed with them these past couple weeks, anyway off topic. I started laughing hard. Like almost to the point to tears. Then I really did started crying because I realized that this has been the first time in months possible even years that I have actually laughed and felt happy. I don't know why I started crying but every time I think about it it makes me cry again because I'm actually happy. I know this is an advice page but I just really wanted to share. I never trusted being happy on pills because I always thought it was fake happy. Until my therapist gave me a different way of thinking about. ""Yes you might need to be on antiperspirants for a long time possibly even your entire life or you could just need them for a couple months either way you may need them like a diabetic needing insulin. It's not fake it's you.""

8,"I really hope it can just miraculous appear but I know people can’t get to know me if I don’t open up myself.

My parents are really supportive and I’m so lucky to have them. But they’re struggling with my condition too and I don’t feel safe to share many things with them because of reasons. And I’ve already pushed all my old friends away. Sometimes I’m so desperate I just want to date someone but I know it will be very unfair to my partners if I start a relationship like this. 

All I want is someone I can trust and rely on. But I’m just so insecure and have many self esteem issues I don’t know how to let people in. I keep thinking if I let them in and they will betray/abandon me then I won’t know what to do with myself.

I talked to my therapist about this but I didn’t find her helpful. I start to feel like this is just who I am and I can never change it. And I will get depressed again and again, feeling like I’m the only one that will care (which I know is not true but) and want to end it.

I don’t even know what my problem is I just can’t...socialize? Some people say I just need to take the first step and get to know people. Well that is difficult but I tried however I found that’s not enough. I’m just so depressed and afraid I will pretend to be good friend and hang out and pretend to enjoy myself. Eventually they feel that I don’t actually care? And we won’t contact anymore once I start shutting down myself.

12,"i’m a young female who was first diagnosed by my gp with anxiety, and given escitalopram 20mg. it didn’t really do anything so i built up the courage to tell my mum, who took me to another appointment. today i had a telehealth appointment with a psychiatrist, it was really hard answering all the questions but i was diagnosed with ADHD. apparently it presents differently in girls and could be the cause of the anxiety and depression i was experiencing. im really thankful for the psychiatrist acknowledging how nervous i was and making funny jokes to calm my nerves, and i’m also thankful for my gp (who i’ve known for years) for holding my hands when i was shaking and fidgeting with fear during the call, and telling me not to be ashamed and that i’m capable of anything. i’m now on fluoxetine and ritalin, hopefully everything gets better. it’s looking brighter now :)",25Jun2020,1

Everyone is a liar. Everyone is selfish. Love doesn't exist. Only suffering there is. I have no control over my life. I live day by day. I have no pleasure in doing things. I am only suffering. Nobody can help me. Therapy means waste your money before you die because you are worthless anyways so let us have the remaining money of yours. Eyes cannot lie. Life is random. Life is governed by a random god only gives me suffering. I am coward enough to not develop alcohol addiction. I am coward enough to not suicide. I am all worthless.

What’s really been worrying me is my partner recently got prescribed Adderall to help with their really bad adhd. I’m really happy for her, but on the inside I’m really freakin out. I know it takes a while for the medicine to adjust to your body and it can be strange for a while, but the change is really scaring me. I know it’s still early but she’s already being less affectionate than she used to be and she seems rather emotionless sometimes. This was already an issue earlier but now it’s worse. We already have to do long distance because of COVID, and I’m worried this is just going to draw us further apart. If you think this is selfish, then just wait for this. I’m also really jealous because she’s gotten the help she needs, and I can’t manage to get my own. She just keeps growing more and more which is amazing I love seeing her do well, but it feels like she’s leaving me for something better. I was already insecure bc sometimes it felt like she looked down on me but now that she’s less emotional she’s much more blunt with me about it. All this has led to me being really paralyzed from it the past several days. I tried talking to her a little about it the other day, but she quickly said she really likes who she’s becoming so I can either stay and support her or leave. She made it clear how much of a dick move it’d be for me to leave her bc if her changing from the medication she needs, but if she becomes someone I don’t like anymore I don’t see what else I’m supposed to do. I don’t want her to stop taking it bc of me if it helps her, and I don’t want to leave her because I love her. I can’t talk to her because she’ll get mad at me.

37,"Hi. 

I’ve suffered from many depressions myself and I’ve got tendencies in having some “depression crisis” when I’m feeling down. My boyfriend has always been on the more pessimistic side of life and I’ve never really thought anything about it until recently, because he was just like that, even in his good days. In the past few months, he’s had these days where he just feels... nothing. He tells me he suffers from derealization and I feel so completely helpless when he tells me that because I never know what to do to help him. But for the last 3 days, he’s only been sleeping, telling me he’s really into his derealization phase and I’ve got to force him to eat and shower because otherwise, he doesn’t do anything but sleep. I’m talking 20 hours a day sleeping. Usually, he has a lot of good days but yesterday, he told me he wanted to kill himself if he was to stay like that all the time and I’m panicking a lot inside. I really want to help him and I’ve tried to suggest that he talks with someone (like a psy or something) but he really doesn’t wanna do it. He says that nobody care about men’s feeling and he doesn’t want to be drugged with anti-depressant. I don’t know what to do, I really want him to know that I CARE about him and his feelings, that I’ll always be there for him no matter what.
