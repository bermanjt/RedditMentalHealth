1,"Hi, I’ve been feeling like shit for months and I feel like the people I want to be friends with I push away or I say something stupid (I grew up in a household with strict narcissistic parent who never let me socialize) I feel like I never properly learn how to socialize and despite the fact that people think I’m pretty (yea idk if this has anything to do with it) and talk to me, I’m either overly reserved or too talkative. Anyways my point is that I’m 27 now, I have no one to socialize with, I always felt I was a nuisance to people, I’ve tried to commit suicide twice and now I’m just waiting for a truck to hit me. I feel so lonely even tho I have various social apps but no one talks to me. I’m tired of feeling so alone",11Sep2020,1
2,"Warning: this is a completely transparent humblebrag. 

It’s been a while since I’ve really felt like myself but I had a moment last week that kinda reminded me of who I am. 

I lost my job last month and I was applying to jobs online - a fucking dreadful activity.  I’m lucky to have had some savings and severance, but I’m always stressed about money and I don’t have a very long financial runway. Which are all super beneficial circumstances for someone who struggles with anxiety and depression.

I’ll always take any interview/conversation I’m offered, even if it’s never going to be a fit. So last week I have a first interview with this guy who seems like he knows it’s a shitty company he works for, and they have no idea what their marketing team is doing. I told him my ideas and I politely acted like I was interested in what he had to say. 

So he asks me what range salary I’m looking for in this role, and I’d just fucking had it with that awkward conversation so I go “Why don’t you tell me what you value this role at?”

He says: “if you had to put a gun to my head I’d say... ($5k below my goal) to ($10k above my goal) depending on what we thought you could bring to the table after talking with the full team.”

And part of my brain is like “Oh sweet - tell him that sounds great!” Then my brain said “I don’t want to work for this fucking company. They’d have to pay me a shit ton of money to work here.” So I just kinda laughed and I said what I was honestly thinking. This is not BS:

“Listen, I don’t really care about your company or your product. I just want to prove to myself that I can be a next level (marketing role). Then I‘m going to hire a team, and then I’m going build a department, and then they’re going to make trade headlines because of their ingenuity. And I’m going to make a bunch of money for whatever company is smart enough to hire me first.  So you tell me if that’s what you really view this role at?”

And he was fucking silent. And it was the cockiest, awesomest thing I’ve ever said in an interview, and maybe life. And I’m actually kind of embarrassed but also really proud. 

They scheduled me for a third interview next week. If they offer me a job at some point, I’m going to have to figure out how to move mountains, but I’ll fucking do it. I meant what I said.  And that’s the person who I am.

I swear to god everyone needs a moment like that every now and then. I hope everyone here feels that at some point in their journey.",11Sep2020,1
3,"So, it's been a pretty long life so far. I'm 28, and I first started to notice that I was depressed when I was 8. At 8, I had friends... But I didn't want to hang out with them. I had a hard time relating to them. I just wanted to be alone. It seemed like every social interaction from school to home to church, no matter how positive the interaction, left me feeling drained and miserable. I did my best to put on my game face so I wouldn't be perceived as whiny, and because acting ""normal"" attracted less attention, but all I ever wanted was just to be left alone.

Around the age of 14, I was really starting to hit a wall. My grades were suffering, I was self-harming, I didn't really have any friends left but kept insisting to my parents that everything was A-OK just so they'd leave me alone. Then a classmate committed suicide, and I accidentally outed myself by giving a logical response to an emotional question when the guidance counselor was talking to everyone who knew him.

She asked me, ""If you wanted to commit suicide, would you tell someone?"" and I responded logically - ""No."" That response was less me saying I wanted to die, and more me saying that if I actually did want to die, I wouldn't tell anyone because I wouldn't want anyone to stop me.

Thus began my initial spiral into a nightmare of ""treatment"". First came a counselor who I could not open up to - I didn't trust her, partially because her smile always seemed so fake and her voice was so sticky-sweet and condescending, and also because I figured anything I said could be relayed to my parents. Plus, I didn't have the words to truly express my feelings, and I had no real negative experiences in my life to talk about to justify my feelings, so I just kind of rambled or fell silent and we never made any progress. All I know is that seeing her really led me to despise the phrase ""This is just a bump in the road!""

Then there were the doctors appointments - first, I was diagnosed with 70+ food allergies that I'm pretty sure I don't have and was prescribed an extremely expensive serum that served no purpose other than to make me so nauseous I couldn't eat anyway. After six months or so of that, I quit it, because I couldn't stand how it made me feel, and I felt like a burden constantly overhearing the arguments through the wall of how my parents were going to pay for next month's supply.

Then there was the Graves' Disease diagnosis - a hyperthyroid condition which does *not* have depression in its list of symptoms. Treatment for this slowed my thyroid down, and in turn, slowed me down - causing me to be even more lethargic and depressed. So much so that I completely quit fighting. I stopped talking about my feelings at all because I did not have the energy to do so. I just shut down. Around this point, a 4 year gap in my memory began. I don't recall when I stopped taking this, but the next time I felt really lucid at all I was living in a different province with a decent job and no social life at all.

This continued for a while. I didn't see any doctors for a long time aside from drop in clinic visits for my eczema. I tried out a couple therapists, none of them lasted long so I can't truly say I ever really ""saw"" these therapists as we never really got into the nitty gritty of it.

Lately, I've been really struggling. I was doing okay when I didn't see my family, didn't have any friends, and wasn't dating because it's much easier to be depressed when you don't have to exist as a human being. Just put on the game face for work, go home, and shut down. Easy.

But now my life has changed. I'm trying to get better. I'm staying in better touch with my family, spending some time with old friends, and I have a boyfriend of about 1.5 years. But it keeps getting harder. I'm so overwhelmed. Every day it gets harder to have a conversation, or even get out of bed. My boyfriend is very understanding, but he deserves better than this. I spent the entire labour day long weekend in bed and let him go to the lake by himself.

I don't recall the last time I felt truly happy. Might have been that one fair I went to when I was 7. Traveling, nights out, parties, family get-togethers... I have very few memories of these things, but they're on my camera roll so I guess I was there in body.

I've just admitted my depression and history of thyroid to my doctor. Bloodwork is on the 24th. But I was also up-front with him that last time I was treated for thyroid it made my depression worse. However... This was a 10-min phone appointment due to Covid, and I don't know how effectively I got my point across. Yes, I know I need to get my thyroid under control. The panic attacks, heart palpitations, and swelling are really starting to concern me. The insomnia has been intermittent - usually not bad, but a little worse these last few months. The heat intolerance had me stuck inside all summer.

I'm just terrified that this is going to be a rerun of my 14yo nightmare. That was half a lifetime ago, but it was crippling. Trying to get help last time only made me worse, so much worse, to the point where I physically could not explain that I was worse so I just started saying I was fine so they'd stop interrogating me and let me rest.

Any advice for advocating for myself to make sure that I actually get treated for my mental health rather than just my physical issues? Any advice for how to make sure I don't get into that fog again where I become so low functioning that I can't get out of the house?

My doctor is usually pretty good, but appointments are always 10 minute, one-issue-only ordeals, even when they're in person, and typically booking about 6-8 weeks out. And no, finding another doctor is not an option - anyone in my town looking for a new doctor right now is getting sent to cities 1.5-2hr away and I'm not doing that, especially since I'd be risking just winding up doctor-shopping through all the least-sought-after doctors as the really good ones usually aren't accepting new patients. 

Sorry if this seems like a rant, I'm just really scared. I want to get better but it all seems so bleak and frustrating. I feel like I'm trapped in my body, in my head, all I want to do is sleep but I know I need to learn to live, and I need help to do that.",11Sep2020,1
4,"I just can’t with life right now. My life has been a fucked up piece of shit ever since 1st grade. All because of a little piece of garbage who decided he wanted to ruin my life forever.

I’m stuck in a mental torment of should i end myself to show him the consequences of his actions. I constantly want to kill myself just to get rid of the nightmares and the thoughts.

National suicide prevention hotline.

Have you ever turned the light out in a room before you opened the door, and for a second was completely enveloped in impenetrable darkness? You're alone, scared to fumble for fear you'll break something but, you HAVE to get out. And NOW. 
This is how I felt, when I tried to take my own life many moons ago.
The darkness caressed my cheek, and enveloped me with the coldest hug that even the most frigid winter could not bring. I was trapped. ALONE. And in the dark depths of the prison that I had created in my mind. 
You see. When we're growing up we're told how we're meant to stand, walk, talk, and appear. We're told that being an adult is hard. But what we weren't told is how empty your womb will feel when you lose a child. Or how lonely it will be if your mother kills herself. Leaving behind questions, so many questions. 
They do tell you that life is beautiful, but never how to find that beauty if you lose your sight. 
No one tells you how much more beautiful it could be if you just stay. How much easier it could be if you called out for help when you flipped your light off. 

Thankfully, God saw it fit for me to live another day. When the light came back on it was a little too bright. My eyes had become weak from being shrouded in the dark for so long. It felt like forever. 
I was raw, and fresh..almost like a newborn. But, that light was so beautiful and the air tasted sweet. 
I am blessed. And honored that I lived even after I so carelessly attempted to blow out my candle. You see, we're all miracles. 

Life is still hard at times. For me, for us all. But there's still beauty to see, and miles to go before we sleep and I am SO HAPPY that my time in the darkness has brought me here. To live another day in the light. With my boys that I love dearly and my family that I cherish with every beat of my heart. 
I guess the moral of this is...
When you get locked in a dark room and you feel there is no way out, call for help. Someone will open the door and help you walk back into the light. There is always reason to fight harder, for another day. You never know what beauty lies just around the bend. I hope if you're faced with this, you stay. ALWAYS choose to stay. You are loved. I know now, that I am too. 💜
I've rarely shared my story. But today always holds a place in my heart. My heart aches for the families that are left with questions. And for the ones that lost their fight. This is just a small portion of my story. I hope maybe, this can help someone reach out. And I hope God gives me the confidence to share more, one day, if it could help save a life. 💜",11Sep2020,1
7,Hey guys I’m Busshie and for that past year I’ve been in a battle with really bad depression let me just cut to the chase I guess.

8,"I have very few reasons to live, the only ones being my family and my only friend would be devastated and would probably do it themselves. I have no motivation at all to do things, all i do is sit and watch youtube all day to escape reality and try to look fictional characters that i can relate to, motivational texts and videos don't work on me, i've tried, as i said i have no motivation to do the most basic things amd i feel like i'm always low on energy.

I want to live life to the fullest and create entertainment to others in the most creative ways (i'm a big fan of art things like animation, filmmaking and whatever feels fun and creative) but my depression and low motivation keeps me from being the better version of myself, i think that's why i try to relate or imitate fictional characters and people that i admire, i don't know why but i'm obsessed with tricksters and clowns archetypes, maybe i'm trying to become them...

I'm unsatisfied with my life for how boring and lonely it gets, as i said i only have one friend that i completely trust and i find very hard to start talking to new people, my family doesn't understand me, i've been lied to several times, suffered bully in childhood wich started my depression, i don't know what i'm going to do in the future and i'm scared of being left by myself, i am not responsable and independent to do daily things, i find difficult to start a routine, there are so many things that i have to do on the day and give people attention that i just end up doing nothing feeling worthless in the end, i'm even considering suicide by now, why do people need to do so much in one day ? All my days sre the same repating thing where i do nothing all day, watching the same repetitive things.

I don't like myself, i hate the way i speak and look, i'm fat and in overall not very atractive, i also find very hard to tolerate people that don't agree with me and i find very hard to continue talking to someone even if i just want to leave, all of this and the fact that i can't do anything (even basic exercises) leave me feeling like shit in the end, i don't think i can change, i go to therapy and i have made a lot of advancements, but now i'm static and feeling empty inside, all of this while time is passing, the clock is ticking and my life is going by every second while i'm in this pool of shit.

I'm sorry if this is long, i'm new to reddit and i needed to take all this negativity out and for someone to understand me, i want to change my life but there are so many problems and i hate to repeat myself but i really have no motivation at all, even to do one simple thing like walking or getting out of bed, i want someone to help me but all the motivational things i have seen so far doesn't work with me as i said, i'm someone who can't move, static, with all the problems in my head and watching youtube and porn to escape reality, i want someone to understand and help me, i want to be the best version of myself and not thtis sack of shit (also, sorry for the bad english, i'm not american or english or whatever). I just want my life to be more interesting and active instead of boring and stagnated .",11Sep2020,1

11,"My GF (F/20) and me (M/20) have been dating for about 2.5 years and one morning, a few days ago, she snapped me a pic with no context. Then I sent her a pic back, I was smiling. Then she says ""I guess you didn't check your voice mail"". Pretty passive aggressive I think, I go to check it and she left a voicemail at 4am of her sobbing and saying she needed me. She tells me she's been feeling suicidal. I don't know what to say, I'm not a therapist. She didn't text me. Sometimes my phone doesn't get calls, I live in the mountains and even then my phone is on silent at night since I have school and I want my rest. Later in the week I call her one night and she says she has been playing a game with me where she will not contact me and will wait until I contact her. She concluded from her game that I apparently didn't give a shit about her because I didn't text her all day. I am thinking ""If you wanted to talk why didn't you just say so!"". I told her this thought and she tells me she is always the one to call me or text me first. I didn't want to argue anymore so I told her she was right. I've looked back through our texts and calls and its more of a 50/50 ratio of who texts first. This seems like another silly game. Is it manipulation? Is this relationship toxic? She always tells me how depressed she is and I live 2 hours away and I honestly don't feel like driving over there every weekend. I have my own friends and life outside of her but I feel like I am 90% of her life. I feel so scared and trapped, I can't tell if I actually love her or if I am just pitying her. She doesn't have a license so she cant come and drive to me and I wouldn't want her to anyways. She is not a very experienced driver and the route is twisty and turny. 

I don't know what's stopping me from breaking up with her. We have almost broken up before and my heart hurt so bad, I definitely love her in a way. I just don't know if I can romantically. We aren't really that compatible either, she likes this I like that etc....

I think it's because we've said things like, ""I am yours forever"", ""I promise promise promise I will never ever leave you!"", ""We are married!"" (I wear a ring, not officially married.) I would feel like such a terrible person by breaking all these promises. I feel like this relationship has changed who I am, not for better or for worse, just changed. I'm not ""madly in love"" (lusting?) over her anymore. She is my first and only girlfriend. I would be abandoning her, she really doesn't have anyone else in her life.

12,"Hi all, this is my first reddit post so I hope I get this right. I (26/f) need advice. I’ve fallen into a depression since March and it has been bad. In the past depressive episodes were something I could muscle through but COVID has taken away most of my effective coping mechanisms. My apartment is disgusting (like a few steps down from TLC “Hoarders,” but still unlivable), my car registrations is months past due, I have other personal chores/obligations that I can’t seem to get to. Every time I try to start a simple task I get so overwhelmed with anxiety I stop or I get so exhausted I have to go lay down. In the past, I’d arrange for my mom to visit and she’d help with the apartment, stock my fridge, and put me back at square one and then I could pull myself out of my depressive episode. But with COVID, and my mom being high risk, I can’t have her visit. She’s the only thing I’m keeping myself alive for at the moment and if she got sick from traveling because of me, I couldn’t live with myself. If I lose her I can’t live at all. 

At this point, I’m desperate to get my apartment together but I really need help with some methods of a managing my anxiety to do it. (I took a full week off of work hoping that more days would give me more time and that would reduce the anxiety but no). My brain has always associated with a clean apartment with recovery so I’m very desperate to get there and need guidance. Thank you.",11Sep2020,1

It's weird for me since I was doing pretty well before and working out everyday. I've been thinking about suicide and plucking my hair out or scratching myself. I've slept 10-12 hrs a day and eat irregularly. I feel pretty hopeless. I don't really think I'll get into university or even get a job so what's the point in trying?

In July my boyfriend and I broke up because he had been going through his own things and for me that was just a plummet down another hole. I started getting anxiety attacks and throwing up from them, it made me feel weak and even worse about myself. I was able to pull myself out of those feelings but school has started and now I think I feel even worse. I was about to attempt but ended up cutting myself instead, I threw up afterwards and decided to lay down for a bit.

I moved out of my dad's place because I'm ftm and he not only hated me for being well me, but also started to abuse me more and more to the point of I was afraid to sleep at night. So I moved in with my partner and his parents, and I was happy, I also got a new job where I moved to and everything was going great, I also got top surgery and was finally feeling happy for once in my life. But then covid hit, both my partner and I where laid off and we had to use up all of our savings just to survive. I got into a super bad depression because of it, but couldn't really show it because I wanted to be strong for my partner. Anyway fast forward a couple months and going back to work but being overworked to the point of me losing my sanity and having to go back for reconstructive surgery which can't be done all at once because of my insurance, and having to take off so much because I have to get tested for covid and I haven't been making any money. All the money I have made has gone straight to some of my bills.

I’m doing the work and am in therapy, but sometimes it really gets me down that small mistakes have derailed me so much, or that I put so much energy into a goal, but don’t get it. It makes it hard to try, and each subsequent failure hurts more and makes me not want to try. I know people work a long time to get things, but the lack of certainty really crushes me. And yet I also can’t let go of my dreams and being happy doing something else, so I’m in this crush between not wanting to take action that is potentially useless, and not being able to settle for something else.

22,"Really struggling today and could use support. This year has been especially difficult for me personally. Prior to this year I never felt I struggled with my mental health too much. I have a lot of health problems that have worsened and have lead to many hospitalizations and mobility issues. Most of the time I need to use a wheelchair. While learning to accept that, I found out from the dentist some of my meds ruined my dental health. It's been a very emotional and expensive road to try to fix each tooth one by one. A premolar had to be extracted and replaced. That was the final straw for me mentally and I fell into a very deep depression. I started therapy and medications. 
At the end of this month I have to have another extraction. It's my farthest back molar. I absolutely do not have any funds for any kind of replacement this time. I have had so much anxiety about it, I think about it constantly. It sucks the joy out of everything and makes it harder to cope with my other physical problems. I don't think I will ever feel pretty or good about myself again.

Shortly after, I decided to get help and clean up my life and start working to get things back on track.

I even applied for positions much lower on the totem pole for companies with the hopes of getting my foot in the door...no luck....all of my leads have dried up and I can’t apply to any other known companies any more. Now I don’t even get calls for interviews anymore. Now all I do is feel sorry for myself and sometimes wish I was dead and cry to myself when I am alone. I am crying right now as I write this. I know I have no one to blame but myself for the situation I am in with my life....But it’s really disappointing because I really thought I deserved a second chance....I made mistakes in the past but I did everything right once I made the decision to turn my life around. I have not been happy in years as a result. My depression is only getting worse. I don’t enjoy anything anymore...It takes me effort to fake a smile, I used to love comedy, but now I don’t find anything funny anymore like I used to. People have been telling me “it will get better, it’s only temporary” but how many more years of this do I need to endure????

Also I would like to add that I have also made lifestyle changes with my overall health with good diet and exersize. I do martial arts, Brazilian jiu jitsu a few times a week. I also have a weekly therapist who seems to have no real answers for me—-and these things most certainly help....but even with all of the honest effort I have put into my well being over the years, my mental health is only getting worse because of my situation and I have been having suicidal ideations much more frequently.  I am just lost I came here because I don’t know what else to do.",11Sep2020,1
24,"I really shouldn’t be depressed and anxious. I’m 35m, white, privileged and probably don’t deserve help in the same way marginalized people do.

But I hate that I can’t be happy. Work makes me so goddamn anxious every single day. I work in healthcare, fortunately not on the front line of COVID (more like second mine), but a lot of my depression comes from how fucked up our system is. US healthcare is profit-obsessed and cares little for individual lives or doing the right thing financially. Medicare for All would go a long way to fixing these issues but conservatives would rather see a million poor people die before doing anything that might raise their taxes by a cent. And it might not even do that! They fight free birth control tooth and nail when it saves the system money by preventing unwanted pregnancies. 

At home I have 2 kids that stress me out a ton. They are becoming tablet-addicted, in part because if I can’t occupy their attention somehow they bug me and I can’t get anything done around the house or relax. It doesn’t help my wife works until 7 or 8 3-4 nights of the week meaning I have to watch them, cook dinner and start bedtime after working my full day. 

I love my wife but I swear she hates the idea of a traditional housewife so much that she wishes I would fulfill it. I think it should be 50/50 but even I admit I can’t keep up with her wishes. I hate cleaning, I can be kind of lazy when I’m not doing the aforementioned stuff. I think she just wishes she married a do-it-all person. And lately my antidepressant has been weighing on our love life. For the first time I kind of wish I could have sex with someone else... by the way she’s been my only partner in life. I’m not even religious, I just felt like it was the right thing to do and we had fallen in love. I don’t think I’d act on any impulses right now but I can either stay zombified on my antidepressant or lower the dose and be more normal... but also get way more hopeless about our crappy world.

And sorry to bring in politics but if Trump gets re-elected I may just have a breakdown. He’s such a huge asshole, you can tell from reading 5 minutes of tweets the only thing he cares about his himself. He’s such a triggered crybaby, I can’t believe rural people thing he’s some sort of alpha male. He’s the very definition of coastal elite, he just switched parties to the GOP in the 00s because they are easier to manipulate. He’s not a man of God, he’s a con man with several wives and has very likely been a rapist (not my words, Stu Feiner said it on a podcast and he likes Trump). Oh yeah, Biden is too blah blah blah because of a similar unsubstantiated claim. Well at least Biden won’t fan the flames of racism, let a pandemic get out of control and he’ll at least act like he cares about all people and income inequality. And he’ll be dead soon enough and a real progressive can take over.

TL,DR: Work sucks, life sucks, everything sucks. I’ll delete this when it inevitably gets brigades by the online MAGAZINE army. Fuck everything.",11Sep2020,1

30,The whole day I just spend in my bed trying to sleep to pass time. I feel such a crushing depression all the time and I don’t know what to do about it. I feel depressed and I’m not able to do my schoolwork because I can’t focus. In the past I’ve dropped my classes and have suffered academically from it. This time around I can’t drop any classes or I’ll get out on academic hold. I can’t study thought and I’m afraid I’ll fall behind on my classes. I feel so trapped and hopeless.,11Sep2020,1

I realize that if I quit, it will be extremely difficult for me to find another job—and then I really think I’ll fail at that, too. 

I know I have it a lot better than a lot of people and I should just “suck it up” and do my work, but I can get literally nothing done.

33,"Hi reddit. Help me. I don't have anh friends to talk to.

I have bipolar disorder II
I have 3 kids, a beautiful loving wife, a stable job at $100k
Have not been corona affected other than the society in general breaking down.
I own a pretty big house. I'm well off. 
I am home alone and I am drunk. 
I'm depressed as fuck. 

Background: 
I've been seeing a therapist for the last three years, sporadically though. I've been saying ""yeee, you know, life is up and down, but generally it's all good"", for three fucking years while contemplating suicide every week. Because I didn't think I had ot in me.

The past year it has been worsening, I know why, we had another baby. He is needy and crave 150% attention all the time. I've been home from March until August, I live in norway so we have insanely good welfare plans. Full salary throughout the whole period. 

It was shit the entire time. So much work, no relief.
My wife works.. Odd hours? Like night shift and shit, she's a nurse, I don't know. She works in psychiatry (is that even a word), ironically as it is.

I read a book last week, it's a fictional diary of a girl that planned a suicide attemp that failed.

It was an OK read, and I figured, I'm not so fucked up.
I was inspired to talk to my therapist/psychologist about things and how they are. I mean, usually the sessions are quite silent, I haven't said much, just nodding along answering some leading questions.

On my latest session I just went with it, ""so how's it been lately?""
""yeah, life is a fucking nightmare. I have suicidal tboughts all the time, I'm not acting on them and will probably not as it's been this way for 20 years.. Yadauada"" went on for 45 minutes. He was shocked like someone had shit up his whole office, I am pretty sure he called his own therapist. But he was understanding. He understood that, hey, many people have it this way, suicidal thoughts are often a coping strategy for many people, but maybe you should go to your GP and talk about trying some other medication or adjust the ones you are on.

I am on lamictal 500mg
Tried abilify, it was a nightmare, got side effects. Bad ones.
I am on zopiclone for sleep issues.
I am on valium/vival/xanax? for anxiety.

So I booked an appointment with my GP right away, I mean, yay I was actually improving my life, this is going to be better.

I told him about my therapist (who he knows) and about the thoughts and my therapists and my conclusion about medication change.
WELL, he went on to push me with leading questions about suicide. Like 'do you have a rope', I am soo. 40 years old, a houseowner and boat owner, of course I have TONS of rope. I have ropes in. My home, I have ropes in my garage, I have ropes outside the house. Fucken ropes everywhere. I don't use them for hanging myself though.

Turns out he was pushing for a forced stay at the psycho house (psychward? I don't english)

So he withdrew my zopiclone, halfed the amount I am getting too.

Now I am sitting here in the dark, at home, drinking beers, never felt so lost in my entire life. I feel betrayed. I feel like I was pushing for good life improvements and then got raped in the ass.

I just, I don't know, maybe that rope actually have other uses. I ont know I am drunk as fuck right now.

What the fuck are my optiobs? After this I can't see how it's ever going to be not worse.

Fuck. If hou read all tvis, I love you, thank you.",11Sep2020,1

36,"I'm in northern Colorado and suffering from unmedicated ADHD and clinical depression. Although I'm seeing a counselor I really need to find a psychiatrist that accepts United Healthcare in my area but no matter what I try I keep hitting dead ends. Several years ago I had the same problem and it took me the better part of a year to find someone. I had to pay everything out of pocket because they too wouldn't accept my insurance but by that time it was literally a matter of life and death. That psychiatrist was great but he retired and now I'm back here again. I've gone to United Healthcare's website find one but its a joke. None seem to have their own office but are instead affiliated in some bastardized structure that only the medical industry seems to understand. I literally spent 25 minutes on the phone trying to reach one doctor I found only to learn that he's only listed on the hospitals website because he accepts their insurance and yet they had no contact information for him. What's more screwed up is that I only called the hospital because the doctor was listed as taking my insurance on my health insurance's website. 

Listen, I've just not got the bandwidth right now to even deal with all this BS. There has got to be a way to find a good psychiatrist in my area that takes my insurance and doesn't require all this STUPID run around. I'm so frustrated, angry and just beaten down by all the hoops these people expect me to jump through just to get help. People act all surprised or upset when someone with depression tries to harm themselves and they'll say all kinds of stuff about how things are never that bad or whatever but they have never had to navigate the fucked up system they created. It's a wonder that people get any help at all given how hard they make it. Instead of getting help I only seem to find more frustration and as hard as I try to push past all of it the more hopeless I become.",11Sep2020,1
37,"I'm 17 and i cant point out a specific time in my life where I've felt happy or worth anything.

Every day i wake up just wishing that i didn't, i don't understand what I've done to deserve feeling like this but its the worst its ever been even though everything online tells me it gets better. It hasn't, i don't know how i'm supposed to carry on when any bit of hope that i had is just completely gone.I just want to be happy,

None of the advice I've ever been given has ever worked, every time someone tells me something positive about myself i know they're just lying.I hate every single thing about me. I'm not going  to end up happy. Everyone who i care about will eventually leave me. I cant take this anymore. It just hurts.

I just cant take it anymore, I've lost everyone I've let get close to me, and i'm doing the same thing again knowing whats going to happen, i just need an escape, the first lock-down almost completely broke me as it is, if there is a second one i don't think i am going to make it, i'm just so exhausted from all of this, i just cant anymore.

I don't want to self harm and have my family find out, but at this rate i'm going to crack.

Nothing fixes me, not medication, not therapy, not emdr, nothing. Everything haunts me from my past and i just want to die, at least then ill be able to feel some sort of peace. Im just so completely lost.",11Sep2020,1
38,"I attempted suicide several months ago and was saved by a co-worker, but I'm nearly at that point again. I apologise if this is not what this subreddit is intended for but I just need to get a lot of this off my chest. I don't exactly have many people I feel comfortable sharing any of this with.

I'll try to keep things vague, but I'm a Corpsman in the Navy. I've been in for nearly 6 years now and served most of my time as a ""combat medic"" with the Marines. During my time I was deployed to a location in Asia for humanitarian support and relief and spent most of my time picking corpses off the street. (*Graphic* just as a taste of the kind of shit that I dealt with, the first body I had to retrieve was a little girl in her PJs floating face down in the water. I had to pull a baby out of a tree and another from the water that basically disintegrated in my hands. Too many dead kids.). 

After we got back from that my closest friends started to kill themselves one after the other until I was the only one left. I then spent time as an EMT for the Navy and Marine Corps at my shore command. During which I cleaned up countless suicides. All the while I met a woman that I loved and got engaged. I was with her for a year and a half and finally had to call it of because she began to be very abusive (i.e. throwing pans at my head, getting drunk and punching me non stop). 

After attempting suicide several months ago, I started to get help and was diagnosed with a slew of things including PTSD, Chronic Depression, Insomnia, and physician burnout. 

Things were getting better. Several unsuccessful attempts at dating went by. I got into music again. But ultimately I'm back to were I was. Very isolated, tired of dating, sick of the military, nightmares every night, and a soul crushing ache in my chest accompanied by a heavy loneliness.

I'm just tired. I've done my share. I want to settle down somewhere quiet, raise a family, a die in peace but God does that feel so far from my grasp.",11Sep2020,1
39,"I've created a throwaway account for this because honestly, I'm scared that my friends (the couple I have left) would see this if I posted it with my main.


For a little background:
I'm 20 years old and I've been depressed for a number of years, but I only started medication around last August/September after a friend agreed to go to the doctor's with me.

A year later, my anxiety is still crippling to the point where I can't leave the house alone.
I'm running out of my medication as the doctor won't prescribe me any more until I've had a phone call with him to discuss the effect it's having, as I've been on the same dosage for a number of months.
I've actually been avoiding taking my medication as frequently so I could put off having to speak to them to get more, because phone calls are the subject of much anxiety for me.


Also, I'm still living at home with my parents, who are both aware of my struggles with mental illness, and how my anxiety prevents me from coping with the very thought of leaving the house unaccompanied. 

This was okay for the most part until recently they both started making comments about me not having a source of income, and both have also begun sending me information about job opportunities.
Again, they know I can't leave the house alone.
Unfortunately neither of them are particularly understanding or empathetic when it comes to mental health (For example, my mother often uses things I tell her in confidence against me when she's angry). 


So, I've only got one pill left, withdrawal symptoms are beginning to hit me from not taking my medication regularly and things are getting bleaker at home.

There's no sign that things are going to get better as I have no income, no hope; and a shit ton of anxiety.

I'm not quite back at the point of suicidal thoughts, but it's getting close.

I'm sorry if this isn't particularly clear, it's late and I'm not in my best mind.",11Sep2020,1
