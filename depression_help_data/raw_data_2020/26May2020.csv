0,"I've got nothing left. Life is grey and meaningless, I'm trapped inside my own body and mind while the walls close in on me while I slowly suffocate. But I don't die. I life in constant agony and I just want everything to be over so I can finally go to sleep and leave it all behind. No one would miss me. No one would care. Hours come and go at the blink of an eye as I live and then forget them seconds after. I cut myself just to feel something. But even that's gotten dulled and nothing seems to happen anymore. I can't remember what I feels like to be happy. I can't remember if I ever was properly happy. The kind of buzz and joy you can only get from enjoying yourself. Despite my desperate trying to convince my worse majority (it's much more than half) that people don't hate me, they don't message me, they don't do anything, they don't care. Why would they? I don't care. I don't care about my own life. I'm so tired. I just want it to end. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want a hug. I just want to have one person show they care. Have one person believe I shouldn't kill myself. Just want one person to check up on me. But the problem is I have one of those people. In fact I have three. But I can't talk to them. I'm unable to convey how I feel. I want to yell and cry and break down but I can't because I'm drowning. I'm already dead. I'm already gone. I'm just a husk. I don't have anything to live for. Because there's no life without hope. Because it's my fault. It's all my fault. I have three friends. That's enough to just text them saying this but I can't. I can't even beg for help. I don't have anything left. I can't get help. I can't do anything. There's no reason to live anymore.

1,"My whole experience has been tough as hell. I know I just have to keep pushing through but when the going gets tough, like it is at the moment, it’s so debilitating. I get so affected by my depression that I self-harm by hitting myself as hard as I can. I don’t think I would go so far as cutting myself, but who knows. Maybe it will come to that. 

I would be lying if I said I had hope, because right now I am in a dark place and I’m not seeing any light. Every day is essentially the same. Even if I have a ‘ok’ day, it’s only considered ok by my standards because of maybe a couple of tiny things that went right that day, because of luck and nothing more. But the depression is still always there and I cannot escape it. No video game, livestream, TV series, book, or anything else will help because I can’t focus on it and I just get frustrated and fall back into the cycle of self-harming and crying for hours. 

I think I honestly know what is causing my depression, it’s just that I am too anxious to talk about it to the people that say to me “If there’s anything wrong, let us know”. I literally do not feel comfortable sharing this burden I’ve carried alone for the past several years with anyone. I just can’t do it. I even fear getting a therapist because one way or another my family will find out, and for whatever reason, I fear that. I should mention that I do not feel comfortable even being around my family and cannot talk to them due to anxiety. If they talk to me then I reply with short and simple answers. I am starving myself because I can’t get myself food because that would mean exposing myself to them, which like I said, I’m anxious about doing. I wonder if many other people have a similar experience with their foster family.

The fact that I have always been so anxious to take any action is extremely depressing. It cannot be overstated enough. All my life I have been limited by anxiety. In my relationship with my family, in doing things out of my comfort zone (like hanging out with friends outside of school), in even leaving my own home, missing out on tons of opportunities—anxiety has struck me down in more ways that I could list, those are just a few examples. And that is why I’m depressed.

If you had any advice for me, words of support, that would be much appreciated and cherished by me.",26May2020,1

3,"For so many years i have been depressed, suicidal, anxious about everything, everyday, barely able to get out of bed. And the only reason i had to not kill myself was that, i was in love, but not so long ago (a couple months ago now), he left my side because he had enough of me and thought i could do it ""on my own"". But thing is, he was the only reason i was making so much effort, but now that he's gone i genuinely don't know why i should continue trying..

My family is in ruin, my friends are talking behind my back and giving up on me, i failed everything in school and it's even hard to have fun playing video games, like... for some time i talked with my mom that i should see a therapist and in theory i should be seing one in a couple of months, but even if i get in front of one, i really don't know why i should continue trying like.. i guess if i have a question for the people reading this it would be, everything i do brings me pain, and i have no reason left to bear that pain, so why should i even bother trying at all?

I (27 male in Atlanta area) have diagnoses of moderate-severe depression and anxiety.  After trying multiple antidepressants, I settled on one that works well enough without major negative side effects.  I was able to use it to my benefit until early last year when I lost my health insurance.  As a result, I haven't been able to get my prescription refilled.  What are my options?

I found out that I can get my med for, like, $4 from Wal-Mart, I just need the prescription.  I was hesitant to reach out to my old doctor because he referred me to a psychiatrist and I never went.  I know how doctors can be when you don't follow their instructions and didn't want to risk pissing him off.  

Similar issue with therapy; I was seeing a counselor for a while but I stopped after she stopped corresponding with me.  I've heard of sliding-scale mental health counseling but I don't know where to start with that so any help would be appreciated.

Should I try my old doctor anyway?  Can I get a prescription from community health clinics or something?  This is all so much more difficult to navigate without health insurance.  I'm doing my own research but I'm hoping Reddit can provide useful insight.",26May2020,1

9,"For some Background

When i was 3 years old my father passed away due to an accident, leaving my mother to raise 4 kids by herself. my father was the sole bread winner and a good person from what i heard. She didnt know english, she didnt know how to drive and she didnt work. Eventually she would start working to try to raise her kids.

From as early i could remember i was compared to my father and people would constantly tell me how much of a good person he was. A years passed i felt like i couldn't compare to who my father was. he was widely known as hardworking and caring. i felt as if people see me they would say ""oh, your his son? how disappointing"". i constantly felt that anytime anyone would say they knew my father. i felt as if i just wasn't the person they expected to see when they found out i was their son.

Skip forward a few years 

when i was 12 my mother was diagnosed with kidney failure and had to go under dialysis treatment and had to be put on a waiting list for a transplant. she went in and out of the hospital due to the complications of kidney failure along with diabetes. i had to start working small jobs or even under the table at small businesses since i wasn't of legal age to start working. working for almost $6 an hour, and thats as a 12 year old. sure every now and then i would get a small job that paid good but everything i earned went to my mothers medicine. all this while i was in junior high, which made it some what difficult but i kept going. 

i stopped working because most of the jobs i had were quiet dangerous, like handling cattle or steep roofing.  As i moved to high school my mother started to improve but not by very much.

My sophmore year i met this girl who had been going through a rough time with depression, her parents never supported her in anything and often degraded her. Before she moved to my school she was bullied for her name and her ethnicity. We bonded and often talked about our problems and coping with them. Some days i would often find cuts on her wrists and help her move on, or at least tried to. After a few months of talking i asked her out and she said yes. we often had late night talks and they would get tense because she was in a depressive state. i would have to try to de-escalate the situation which would result in the conversation ending at around 5 in the morning, which would later have to get ready for school. Eventually she would would go to a mental hospital twice in the span of 7 months. after that i spent every moment i could so she wouldn't harm herself and to comfort her. we bonded more and we pretty much did anything she wanted. i lost friends because of it but they sorta knew what was going on. one day she seemed really flustered and i asked her to vent to me so she could get it offer her chest. it would happen often and later she would start yelling at me about her problems. i tried my very best to make her not feel responsible and start to project her insecurities on to myself.  After a few months i did believe that i was the problem in her life. i felt like i wasn't enough to her. i did my very best to get over it but it just kept coming back in my head. 

After about a year after that, shortly after graduation i just broke down to her. telling her that i felt like i wasn't enough and knowing that i dealt with it the most unhealthy way possible. i felt horrible, constantly feeling like i was the problem. i was insecure because i was afraid she would leave me and that she would cheat on me. I did everything i could to make her happy. spending hundreds of dollars on dates to make up for the shitty person i thought i was being, to make her feel special. but it got to the point where i wold ask for reassurance from her that she cares about me, and i would frequently ask for it. i got her many birthday presents, a concert for our anniversary and plushies for Christmas. i never got any of that, no birthday gift, no anniversary present, absolutely nothing. and this was our third year of dating. she said she loved me and that she cared about me, but i would equality ask her to act like she cared and not just say it. i spent over a two thousand dollars in the span of a year but when the COVID quarantine came it just went down hill.

In march of 2020, my mother was diagnosed with liver failure and was given a short time on this earth, only a few months. after the diagnoses we went to the life insurance office to sign some paper work. and a few days after me and my sisters had to make arrangements at a funeral home, just to make sure there was a plan for when my mother passes. upon knowing that i was just a train wreck, i went into a deep depression reached out to my girlfriend. she often would see me breakdown, even before i knew about my mothers illness. the thought of planning a funeral for your mother and your not even 20 yet just makes me feel like ""why me?""

About a week and a half after the Diagnoses, i had a really bad break down and thats when my girlfriend of 3.5 years breaks up with me. at a time where i needed it the most she leaves me and found someone else. i really needed someone to comfort me and support me. she said she left because i was a different person from when we started dating and that we didn't have much things in common and also she was tired of the constant breakdowns that i was having.i felt like i want enough for her, no matter how much i changed. i was a different person because i did everything i could to change for her because she was so sensitive of her depression. she stopped loving me and found someone else. she found someone else while we were dating and didn't bother to tell me until a week after the break up. i felt absolutely devastated knowing that i did everything i could for the relationship and it still wasn't enough.

i feel like it was all my fault and i feel hopeless. im gonna be, basically an orphan at the age of 19 and im not ready for it. I just want the pain to stop. i want to be enough for someone, to feel appreciated and to be happy. 

i need advice, support or at least somone to talk to

Hello everyone.

Simply put, I’ve been depressed and suicidal for several years. During this time, I’ve never reached out for any kind of help. At this point, I’ve decided I want to, but I feel like just seeing a doctor and therapist whilst living at home will do nothing for me, as the home environment is a large contributor to how I feel.

Therefore, I want to go to a mental health facility. However, people with experience, what’s it like? The places that I’m looking at aren’t just wards in a general hospital, but rather dedicated facilities. Do they help? Can I get in without attempting to get prior help?

Thanks",26May2020,1
12,"I recently posted an article to my website about how certain beliefs underpin stress, depression and anxiety. One of the main beliefs I briefly introduced concerns helplessness. Helplessness is a major part of these illnesses so let’s look at how you can reduce the impact this flawed belief has.

Believing you are helpless in life is a truly terrible feeling and I write from personal experience here. For five years, a number of traumatic events led me to the point where I believed life held nothing but pain and anguish. I truly believed life would unfold in a way that would destroy me and there wasn’t a single thing I could do about it.

Perhaps you’ve felt this way too?

The underlying belief is the important factor here. It is a firm belief that life is something that happens to you and you have NO CONTROL over anything. In short, you are a powerless, passive recipient for whatever life decides to throw at you.

It is an awful state to be in. Furthermore, this belief simply isn’t true.

Let me give an example. Say you and your partner split up. Now, this can be one very traumatic experience, I’ve been through it, so have many others. You react in a highly negative and emotionally arousing way:

“I’m devastated. He/she was my whole world and now my world has fallen apart. Everything I do in life always goes wrong and this is another disaster. I’ll never be happy again.”

Wow. It’s a powerful reaction isn’t it? I’m sure you, like me, have either reacted this way to an event or you’ve heard someone react this way. It is a very damaging way to assign a meaning to an event you are confronted with.

The last two sentences reveal the belief in helplessness. The key words are: Everything always goes wrong and never be happy again. When you react in such a way, you are telling yourself that you are helpless because nothing has ever gone right for you and you’ll never be happy no matter what. You’re saying you cannot control anything and therefore, you truly believe you’re helpless.

How do you think you’ll feel when you react like this? Exactly. You’ll feel deeply unhappy, confused, frustrated and of course, helpless to [change your life.](https://mindprolab.com/how-to-reprogram-your-subconscious-mind/) Why would you feel anything else? Everything ALWAYS goes wrong and you’ll NEVER be happy again so what’s the point of doing anything to create change?

Do you see how helplessness works? But it simply isn’t true. Of course, there are many things in life that are entirely beyond your control. Other people and Mother Nature to name but two. There are things in life you have some control over – where you live and work for example. It is important to keep these facts about control firmly in mind.

Here’s the most important fact about helplessness: There is one thing you have full control over in your life and that is how you react and assign meanings to everything you are confronted with. In the example above, a better reaction would be:

“OK, my relationship hasn’t worked but other things in my life are going well and I’ll concentrate on them for a while as I come to terms with what’s happened. Just because this relationship hasn’t worked out, it doesn’t mean future relationships will fail and once I’ve got over this, I’ll get out there and find someone better.”

See the difference? You’re keeping control by assigning a less emotional meaning, a meaning more in keeping with reality. You’re acknowledging that you’re hurting, but that this is temporary and when you’re ready, you’ll try again. You know you have other things in your life that you can concentrate on and this reaction will prevent a feeling of helplessness arising.",26May2020,1

I have dealt with depression and anxiety for almost a decade now, but the last few months have been extremely tough. I haven't seen a doctor or therapist about it in 5 or so years and feel it is time to do so again. These two weeks would give me time to focus on going to doctors and being able to focus on my mental health rather than work.  Should I take request and take off asap or is it rude for me to ask off the same day I start my 2 weeks.?",26May2020,1
16,"I have grown up with depression before my teen years, and I am 20 now. I don't know how to choose a career for myself. I am scared if I go into something it will be unrealistic with my depression. I am afraid if I go into college, I will be too depressed to be consistent with my studying. I'm afraid I will be lazy and avoid doing my school work. I don't want to be in debt because I couldn't overcome my depression in healthy ways.

Its hard for me to pick a career with depression because I have incredibly low self esteem, and while I know im not as bad as my mind tells me I am, it's hard for me to do. I can't really pick out my hobbies and traits because I'm afraid If i say something now I will lose interest in it at a later point and be miserable. Another side however is that I hate that I have so many career options. I feel conflicted and just wish someone who knew me well could tell me what to do. I know that's wrong though, and I should make this choice.

I don't know, I want to go to school and learn so I can be on a career path and have a salary to depend on. I want to have skills for jobs in the future. Sometimes i think being a teacher would be nice, I'm good with kids and I like history so being able to teach would be nice. But I fear what if realistically If i am too intelligent and stunted and that I wouldn't be a good fit to hold the responsibility that it takes to be a teacher? What if my depression gets in the way and I fail others? I can identify jobs id like but then I come up with a million different reasons.

I think this is going on too long. I can answer more things, i just need some advice. I can't accept the reality of my depression stopping me from a job because I would hope genuine hard work pays off.. But I know how cruel life can be and it could just be a fact I'll always be confused and working jobs I'm not particularly happy in",26May2020,1
18,"Hi, all.
I'm (30/m) in a dark hole for years now. 

On and Off psychiatrists since 12 years old. Bullied in school and inside my own house (by my twin brother) to the point I feel that I don't belong anywhere. Been cheated by 3 girlfriend and can't trust people.
I receive support from close people but it doesn't feel real. Kind words do nothing to me cuz I don't feel like people really mean/think what they say. 

At this point I know with every inch of my being that it's all up to me. If I am to improve and get better, no one can do sh*t for me.

Here lies my problem. There is a HUGE will to improve but there is no action. Whenever I get those random and rare inspired days to write things down and schedule activities it feels fake cuz that's a pattern for years now. ""Tomorrow I'm going to do this"" but tomorrow comes and I still feel like I should wait till tomorrow to do things. It feels like there is more important things(video game, binge watch, binge eat, etc) to do right now. 
I don't know anymore if I'm used to feeling like things don't really matter or they actually don't matter anymore. To me life has no meaning and there is no EndGame that it's worth my time. No huge amounts of money, no succesfull business, no kids, no infinite love... nothing feels like it's worth the pain that I'm GOING TO experience through days to come. 

Still, I know that I'm not going to kill myself and I feel like my time can be better expend in things that have a potential to make me feel better. But I simply cannot start things, no matter what. 
If I start something today, tomorrow it feels not important and not worth it or I simply forget. 
I've tried to write things down(goals, dreams, etc), but there is no commitment to a piece of paper. 

How do I simply go and do things? How can I feel like doing things is REAL? How do I plan and stick to something for months to come if I don't even feel like tomorrow is worth it? Maybe even today. 

I love the ideia of meditating everyday, yoga 3 times a week, go to the gym, studie for my (now failing) classes and being someone that can be loved and deserves to be loved. But this things don't feel real at all. Nothing feels real anymore.

Hey guys

So I have a few problems in my life and I don't know how to get over these things.

1.. I don't know how to Express my feelings.

2. I can't tell my Mom that I love her and that I'm thankful for all the things she's done for me.

3. I hate the fact that I always have to act different when going to a family dinner or similar events.

4. I can't speak up for myself. If there is anything that's bothering me I'll always keep it to myself. ( scared of hurting other feelings )

5. I'm scared to talk to my boss at work. He's a really cool dude but still I don't know how to talk to him.

6. I always put other people over me. Everyone is always more important then me.

7. I don't want to buy things for myself. I bought my GF a iPhone and a Mac but when she bought me Tekken 7 and a headset I went to the shop to bring it back because it's to expensive.

8. I dont know what my passion is. I love doing a lot of things and my interest spreads on everything but I never really stick to something

9. I can't really talk to some people like my mom, strangers, my mother-in-law. My girlfriend always forces me to speak but I actually don't know how to.. This is one of my major problems that I have to change. When me and my GF are at my mom's house she's talking more then me and I don't think this is normal. My mom is definitely the best mom on earth but I actually never told her anything similar like this.. She deserves much more love from my side.

10. I can't talk with my girlfriend when we're fighting about things. My mind just turns off everything and turns on the ""noword"" mode. In these moments I just wanna give up on everything and die EVEN if it's a small fight about some stupid bullshit but everytime we fight it hurts me so much.

11. I don't really feel like going outside to my friends because I started to see the bad side of them and I'm happier sitting at home and playing computer with my younger brother.

12. I really don't have a problem with sitting at home doing nothing but my GF wants me to go outside and be social.

13. I can't have fun at parties or events! When I'm there I feel like everybody's watching me and judging me.

I have no problem with being alone at all. I actually love it because there is noone watching or talking to me. Just me and my mind.

I don't know how I got a girlfriend but I'm really happy with her. The problem is I really want to make her happy but I need to fix some things in my life..

I smoke weed and I think that's one of the factor of these problems.

When I was a kid and did some dumb shit my mom tried to speak with me but I never said something I think this behaviour lead to the things I do nowadays.

Hope you guys can give me some advice or recommend me a good book to help myself. If I could name the problem by myself It would be easier to get things done but the problem is I don't know what the problem is. Am I depressed, anxious or just introverted? idk...

I'm 22 btw and I'm sorry for my english grammar.",26May2020,1
20,"I’m not sure this is the place for this kind of rant and I’m sorry but I just desperately need some advice/understanding otherwise I’ll go mad.

I was recently just laying in bed about to sleep but once the voices come creeping in it just gets hard to do so. My go-to soothing playlist normally does the trick to keep me calm but since not even that worked I decided to start voice recording to let it all out—a thing I do when I’m too lazy to get up and grab my journal— but once I pressed the button it was as it all went back to normal. As if I wasn’t about to rip my skin out a minute ago.

I feel like I keep lying to myself. Deep deep down inside I know something’s not fine but 99% of the time I just cannot bring myself to believe it. Am I in denial? Am I too self conscious? Even as I’m writing this I still think I’m a liar. 

Nothing seems real, I feel like my brain is just making shit up to make up the fact that I’m not feeling anything anymore lately. I feel like I’m trapped in someone else’s skin and being forced to deal with problems that have no real consequences. Just floating carelessly until nights like these happen.

I’m sorry if this makes no sense whatsoever, believe me I don’t understand it either. I just know that by tomorrow I’ll re read this and not even know what the hell was going through my head. I’ll feel like it was not me who wrote this, and not do anything about it once more...",26May2020,1

I just can't cope with losing both cats I raised. They were my babies... I have been having more anxiety attacks and I just don't know how to cope. I am completely heartbroken. To the point where I don't want to get another cat in fear that in another year they will also just go missing.

25,"Hello. First of all, sorry for formatting as I’m on my phone. Also, long story but the backstory needs to be there. 

So, about four months ago I moved for my husbands career. I had my own career as well but it was reaching a dead end in the midwestern area we were in and my husbands career will forever be an area that is thriving, plus he is 10 years away from getting a pension and healthcare for our family for life (he’s military if you haven’t guessed yet). He’s my rock. He pulled me up when I was at my darkest moment and I’ve honestly been thriving with him cheering me on and giving me so much support. We felt him getting stationed on the coast would be a god send for us. I’m a water child by heart and being near the ocean is when he has always seen me at my calmest, also getting me away from my toxic family who only reached out when they needed something or to verbally abuse me was one of his goals too. We were moving to the gateway of the trading world of the Atlantic, there had to be more jobs than smack dab middle of the Midwest where 5 minutes out of our town was nothing but farms for an hour. So we moved and the first month was great. I was thriving and adapting to our beautiful new home we bought and the landscape. I live so close to historic areas I’ve studied and dreamed about visiting my entire life! Anyways, the pandemic hit about a month in and we were just thankful we managed to get moved and somewhat settled logistic wise. I had been struggling to find jobs out here as a lot is military contractors and they want you to come in with a security clearance rather than them helping get one. All I had was a public trust clearance, not enough. 

Anyways a pediatric home healthcare company interviewed me and hired me as a manager. It wasn’t research as I’m accustomed to, but I got to use my scheduling and analytical skills  or so I thought. They told me my work life balance would be great as I was admit on that being important to me in order to perform work to the best of my abilities. I was told I’d be working on scheduling and matching nurses our recruiter gave us on new cases, and most importantly I’d be helping kids, real motivation. First week there I find out, I’m ALSO the recruiter AND payroll AND secretary for the office. Whatever I can do this we (meaning just in my mind) need the money to come in. Then I watched nurses violate homes and HIPPA laws and my company wouldn’t let me fire them or open investigations, instead I had to reassign them to new families to keep hours up and watch things repeat within a week or two. I had nurses not responding to calls or texts, even having the company number BLOCKED and being forced to use my personal phone and burner numbers via apps just to call them about scheduling stuff. I had families calling upset and yelling that we kept giving them horrible nurses, and all I wanted to do was cry and apologize that the company wouldn’t let me do better but I was trying I swear to God I was. On top of that? On call always. In the last month I’ve had little sleep, calls all the time and by company policy I had to answer the phone by second ring. Even our higher ups would call at any hour to make sure we were doing so. Needless to say by week three I was struggling. Comming home, showering and crying, then sleep. Stopped eating, because there was no time. My depression hit me like a freight train. On the weekends when I wasn’t working I would sit in a room with no tv or noise and just dissociate staring out the window and I could do it literally all day and late into the night. I started medicating with benzodiazepines again, something I’ve had an addiction to in the past, but also something doctors will prescribe like candy, so back to addicting habits I went. I’ve become a shell of a person and I knew to save myself before it got bad I had to quit and my husband was begging me to at this point, and I did just that. However, I can’t even give myself time to heal because I have family and friends calling me a “baby” or “immature” for not sticking it out, and telling me I’m stupid for not sucking it up and quitting a job during a pandemic. I have savings to fall back on that I’ve busted my ass to build before we moved, and I am working with a staffing company to find a job in research, yet these negative words have me believing I am worthless and stupid (which wasn’t hard to convince). I’m dissociating, I’m not talking to anyone anymore, I’m crying nonstop, and I’m truly scared with how the depression is physically hurting me. Yesterday I scared my husband because I got in my car and just started driving, I didn’t realize I’d even really left the house or where I was going until he called me and was in his car looking for me and panicking. I just need someone out there to grab my hand and say I did the right thing, and my health comes first and I will be fine. This move has turned into the opposite of what it was supposed to be, maybe even worse. For the first time I feel the fight I’ve always had in me going away, I’m letting the waves take me down and I’m not doing much to fight them. Does anyone has suggestions or even reassurance for me? At this point anything positive could help build me up and give me a little more fight back to hold on...",26May2020,1
26,"I need to tell them, if I don’t I’ll end up dead in a few days, but I don’t want to hurt them, nor do I want them to blame themselves. I want this to be as “soft” as possible.

33,"I just had to get my feelings out somewhere and i figured this wasnt a bad place to do it. These past few months feel like years, i dont want to do much more than sleep, though ironically enough i think i might be an insomniac. I've been having family problems to the point i can't even stand being in the same room with them most the time. It seems like they have forgotten what happened for the most part, but i can't. Im so tired of having to fight to be happy, im supposed to be the annoyingly optimistic kid. Thats what ive always been, but now i can't even imagine one good outcome for me. I tried to make myself happier but doing things that I enjoy but i dont have the will to do anything i dont have to. I started this thing when before i go to bed i think about what made today a good day and when i wake up what will make today a good day. It doesnt work. I woke up this morning, feeling terrible of course, but i came up with a few things that could make today great and before i even got out of bed someone came into my room to yell at me. Its really hard to try to be optimistic when no one in your house can get along, ive been up for a few hours now and the only reason no one is yelling at each other now is because im the only one home. I just wish something in my life could be normal, even something as small as going places we went before but with the virus, its kinda impossible. 
I feel like I've been ranting for too long now, sorry to anyone who actually read that. I'll probably keep posting on here, i just needed someway to get the thoughts out of my head",26May2020,1
34,"So my father and  I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14.

At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey ""chummy"" with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her.

I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression.

But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency.

I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. 

I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. 

No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.",26May2020,1
35,"I’m faced with quite the challenge. I decided to take my GERD treatment seriously. But fuck me will it be hard. It’s bad enough to find the motivation to cook for myself 3 meals a day but now I have to break those meals in to 6 smaller ones. 

Eating has always been a chore for me. Well for as long as I had my depression (10 years). It’s just a means to an end so I can go back to playing video games. 

This lifestyle has taken its tole on me. GERD, weak muscles, failing eyesight, UTI, text neck and carpal tunnel. 

I intend to replace my habits with a healthy diet, exercise, productive hobbies, career, relationships. As a young man I must create strong pillars for the rest of my life to rest on.  

I guess I don’t need help just somewhere to vent. I don’t want my family or friends to know how low I’ve fallen. How useless I’ve become.",26May2020,1
36,"I had given up writing. In the course of seven years, there were a lot of emotions and then there was none. I kept moving but I was stuck in place. You’d think that you’re better off on the road to self-discovery, but I’m struggling with this prolonged rude awakening. No amount of personality tests or articles on self-worth could pacify thoughts of measuring up.

In the pursuit of meaning, I lost friends left and right, thinking I’d be better off without them. But who’s to tell what’s what and who’s who? At some point, I knew I put a lot of faith in people, but I could never manage to put enough in myself – and when my expectations were failing me, I’d fall deeper into ruin.

I used to be sure enough of what I’m feeling that I’d be able to put that into writing, but realism isn’t always a great addition to the product mix. This is the longest I’ve gone from staring at the caret, ultimately leading to abandoning the writing altogether. 

Progress? Yes, but I’m still here – still perpetually second-guessing myself and trying to convince me that I don’t like myself and this world enough to care. The hard part of being self-aware is that I know I need help. Maybe I’d even have a grasp of the kind of help I need. But, if we were to start consciously breathing, how shall I start systematically laying out the steps?",26May2020,1

Hey all!

I'm Margaret from [Osmind](https://www.osmind.org/). I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania, and I'm currently working with a team of Stanford graduate students on Osmind, a care platform (completely free to join!) for those interested in FDA-approved medicine for treatment-resistant depression.

Our platform comes with a [forum](https://members.osmind.org/) for members to interact/socialize. Especially during times like this, we want to do anything we can to help cultivate a supportive and open community. We've hosted 4 AMAs so far, and on Wednesday (5/27) 11am PT, we're so lucky to be hosting [another AMA with George Taktak and Mark Anscombe](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-on-wed-5-27-how-mental-founders-mental-health-advocacy-and-social-media-organization-osmind-featured-on-howmental-instagram-live-today-5-26-at-11am-pt/376), founders of How Mental, a well-known mental health advocacy group. George is also the founder of Feeliom, an app designed to care for your wellbeing by staying in touch with yourself and your loved ones. Mark is the founder of Perspective Project, a charity tackling mental health stigma through art and creativity.

We'd love for you to join the forum (completely free) and ask whatever questions you have. You can post your questions on the forum beforehand, and our special guests will be typing answers to those questions live during the time of the AMA! To be clear, the AMA will take place on [**Osmind's forum**](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-on-wed-5-27-how-mental-founders-mental-health-advocacy-and-social-media-organization-osmind-featured-on-howmental-instagram-live-today-5-26-at-11am-pt/376), not Reddit (so post your questions on there, not this post).

Some topics that they can speak to:

1. Lived experience of anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies and trauma.
2. Changing the narrative around mental health - starting our own movement. What you can do to contribute to the broader movement.
3. How to prioritize your mental wellbeing - proactive care and prevention.
4. Mental Health &amp; Technology.
5. Mental Health &amp; Art.

Let me know if you have any questions about Osmind and what we're doing, would love to talk more :)

Best,

Margaret",26May2020,1
40,"I wanted to ask y'all if this is a sign of depression from your own story. 

So recently when I've been alone, I've had the feeling that I need to cut myself. Paired with the feeling of utter helplessness the entire rest of the time.

I just needed to know if y'all thought if this was a sign as I don't want to assume that I am depressed, 

sorry if I came across as an asshole.",26May2020,1
41,"So my son (16) says he's depressed and I want to take it seriously. But the one thing that bugs me is that he spent the weekend with his grandparents and everything was cool.but here it is 5 pm and I just got home from work and he's still in bed. How can I approach this and still respect him, especially since he says depressed. I don't want to push him away or make him feel like he's being punished for being depressed.",26May2020,1
42,"So, I met a girl at the beginning of lockdown in the U.K., we met on an online dating app and hit it off quite quickly. I’ve been hurt by women quite a lot in the past emotionally and I see myself as emotionally weak, I’d also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2015 but take no medication out of choice. 

We hit it off quite quickly, talking pretty much everyday, we shared interests and viewpoints on many things, we were attracted to eachother an wanted to make a go of things when lockdown was over, we started talking properly in early April, things were going amazingly, we communicated a lot, cared for eachother and wanted to make a real effort to make it work. 

Slowly she started to become down, there would be days where she didn’t want to talk and that was fine these didn’t happen often, she was doing this (to my knowledge) everyone. Her hobbies weren’t helping her fight off her lowness, I tried to be as supportive as I could, one day she went cold, she was cutting people off due to her own mental health struggles and I was concerned about us, she said she wanted to stop talking and mentally she wasn’t in the right place to be talking to someone like this, and I was respectful but I feel the way I had been treated was quite unfair, I know what it’s like to want to cut people off like that, you feel there’s a black hole you can’t climb out of, but I just felt like this has hurt way more than if we had just talked about to and tried to get through it, she (I believe) deleted my number, but no other social media, she has recently come back onto snapchat but doesn’t speak to me but posts stories. 

I honestly don’t know what to feel, whether I should still have hope, or simply move on, it’s making me feel like absolute garbage, and I’m slipping back into who I was before which I can’t allow to happen.

So much had happened and now I’m suddenly back on  my own again and we don’t talk...when do I reach out, or do I simply see what she does. 

I’m really hating life rn.",26May2020,1
43,I don’t know how to tell them that I’ve been feeling suicidal for nearly two years now and that I’ve tried to kill myself twice this year and how i literally cry every night for the past year and my arm is full of cuts and I just feel alone all the time I have no one to talk to and I don’t eat I have no energy to do anything and I can’t even get out of bed anymore I physically can’t do anything and if I tell my parents they will say I’m overreacting or shout at me coz they’re foreign and they don’t understand mental health or even “believe In it” I need to see a doctor or seek professional help because if I don’t I’m gonna end up dead,26May2020,1
44,"When my depression strikes me (as it does now), I get this... feeling... that I deserve to be punished for all the horrible things I've done in my life.   


I'm not the type to do physical self-harm.  I think the worst I ever did was slap myself in the face once.  But I do have this recurring fantasy whereby I go to a police officer and confess to a crime just so that I'll be put away in prison for a long time and thereby be punished.  It doesn't have to be a real crime (I don't really want to commit a crime -- I'm not a violent person and the idea of really harming someone in any way \[other than myself\] is repulsive to me.)    


I've never actually done this, but every time my depression returns, these thoughts return to my head.",26May2020,1
