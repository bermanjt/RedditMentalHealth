0,"So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I don't mean that in the ""oh yeah I've been sad for a while"" I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997.

I like to joke that it's my longest lasting relationship.

So what brings me to write this post?

I've been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months (over my live I've been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves) steadily it's been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it.

I want to die, I don't want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, I've been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. 

Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. 

Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up.
I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep.

I've planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, (I have attempted suicide a few times in the past).

Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but I'm scared of actually being dead.

Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome.

Thanks.",08Feb2020,1

8,"I’ve been really on edge lately. I don’t cry when I’m alone. It’s weird but lately I haven’t been crying as much. I feel like I’m starting to bottle things up and my thoughts are getting scarier. 

Now more than ever, I’ve been thinking about killing myself— just desiring to no longer exist in this form. I don’t really talk to anyone about my feelings anymore. I finally have the means to see a therapist and it’s something I’m planning to do soon. I’d never actually kill myself because I know it’d destroy my family. I just want help so I can stop having that thought cross my mind every day. 

Anyways, this was my boyfriend of 1 year and I’s first fight and my stomachs been in knots for like 3 days:

The other day I nearly broke down in a grocery store basically because I felt like my boyfriend was annoyed with me. He just called me dramatic and we gave each other the silent treatment the rest of the way home. 

When I got home, I just started bawling. He thought it was literally just over me feeling annoying so he’s getting annoyed that I’m so emotional. But I wasn’t even crying because of that... I just have so much built up shit that little thing was what set me off. I don’t really open up to him about my depression (and never about my suicidal thoughts) because he doesn’t get it. But I finally put it all out there just to explain why that set me off. 

He thinks because I have a good life (loving parents, a loving boyfriend, my education paid for and a good paying job) that I have absolutely no reason to be depressed. I am so incredibly grateful every day for all of those things and that’s why I’m here. 

I really fucking hate the idea that you can’t be depressed if you have it good. I went into explaining that depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain. And he just goes, “so you’re self diagnosed. You’ve never had a doctor tell you you have depression.” Just like absolutely belittling something that has affected me so severely since I was 14. 

I am self diagnosed. I get it, I’ve never been to a psychiatrist. My parents wouldn’t listen to me about my depression when I was young and it hasn’t gotten scary until the last year or so. I also never had good health insurance til literally 5 days ago. So I’m fucking sorry I didn’t have the means to get help until now.

I am disgustingly in love with my boyfriend. We live together and I just fantasize about being with him forever. And he really does treat me amazing (despite this post making him seem like a huge jackass). So seeing this really ugly and ignorant side of him come out literally repulsed me. He just continued to invalidate my mental illness. He just sat there on his phone while I sobbed on the couch for over an hour. 

I’ve never once been mad at him. I just feel really uncomfortable around him now and it’s making me second guess everything. I don’t think I can be with someone forever who literally doesn’t give a fuck about my mental illness. This is making me second guess his love for me. I felt like he did not give a fuck about me when I poured my heart out. Like he couldn’t look up from his phone!!! 

I feel like a wreck and like I am so hard to love. This “fight” or whatever you want to call it has really sent me over the edge. Maybe I’m being dramatic but I literally don’t want to tell my friends because they’re so quick to judge and be like “leave him sis!!!” I want actual advice. Second guessing someone who I consider the love of my life is turning my world upside down. I want to die. Fuck.",08Feb2020,1
9,"My depression has been pretty well controlled until recently, when work stress and hormone bullshit combined to send my mental health down the toilet. I’m currently fighting off a lot of self-destructive urges: under/overeating, over-exercising with an injury, online shopping sprees, drinking, self-harm... I haven’t indulged in any of them yet, but it’s a near-constant fight. 

I think I’m mainly seeking some sort of way to release the tension/despair/stress etc., or at least a way to escape it for a while. There’s also a definite urge for physical punishment. The thing is, that puts me in a place where I can’t really do things moderately, so that kind of limits my options—making myself a treat like hot chocolate will likely lead to binging and derailing 6+ months of healthy weight loss, exercise will lead to overtraining and injuring myself worse, snapping a rubber band against my wrist will only make the urges worse, you get the idea. Anyone have ideas for healthier ways to deal so I don’t do something I’ll regret down the road?",08Feb2020,1
10,"I (m19) have had depression for about 4 years and have had many highs and many lows. Right now I’m at a low, one of the worst I’ve ever had. Everyday I think about different ways to kill myself or what would happen if I died, but I really don’t want to die, I just want my mind to stop. Being told everyday that you are worthless and that you should die isn’t something I can really deal with, but I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding like a crazy person. Last time I told someone they said that I wasn’t suicidal, but I’m not sure if they are right. My mind is me, my mind keeps telling me to kill myself even though I don’t want to, so doesn’t that make me suicidal? How can I describe this to someone without them thinking I’m just someone looking for attention, I just need help.",08Feb2020,1

15,"I'm in the UK so therapy is free but it's around a 10 month waiting list, therapy is 1 hour sessions every week or other week for 12 sessions, you're then not allowed to re-refer to the service again for another 6 months...then back onto the waiting list again. I've been through this system a few times, it's *never* helped at all, two therapists I completely didn't get on with (one I found to be patronising, the other was manipulative and on one occasion refused treatment) and the other two were okay but it was just small talk...

I see people online talking about therapy helping them deal with things, therapists helping them understand how they think/feel, teaching them new coping techniques, etc. My experience is that it's just small talk about my week, very rarely even mentioning my depression let alone really talking about it, and frankly 12 sessions isn't enough to build a relationship and do any real therapy work.

Antidepressants are an option but not ideal, I have severe executive functioning problems so can't always take medications regularly and that can be a problem re. side-effects coming off antidepressants. Previously I suffered some nasty side-effects, this last time around antidepressants were helping to at least reduce suicidal thoughts but I switched to a higher dose and it all went to hell. On a higher dose I suffered horrible headaches and brain fog so I had to stop them, but this knocked me into a bad phase that has meant I've been nocturnal and unable to do a damn thing since before Christmas. Now it's going to be hard to get back to the doctor's to try getting antidepressants again, never mind the idea of trying different brands. It's too much. 

I've tried exercise, meditation, we've a recovery college locally which runs wellness courses but that wasn't for me (hippy nonsense, frankly). Self-help books don't really work for me as I struggle to read, and I can't afford books anyway. 

I think the only way to help would be; 

A. Win the lotto. 

B. Invent time travel to give me at least the last ten years or so back (prior to my losing my job and being trapped in a shitty life, after having lost my best years and opportunities have a kids etc).

C. Have practical help. I'd like therapy similar to what people online seem to get, where a therapist seems to help you understand your thinking and give you tools to be able to get your brain out of harmful cycles. But most importantly I'd like help to get back into work, which simply does not exist and getting a job is too high risk. 

I just feel so stuck, I'm sick of feeling like this but worse is that this is going to be my life for the next few decades (if I don't kill myself). 

There MUST be something I could do to help myself, it feels like there absolutely should be an easy way of pulling my brain out of this. Help.",08Feb2020,1

I’ve never been too close to my family but that’s not a problem for me, it’s just the way it’s always been. So I don’t understand this thought. Something I should mention is that I’ve struggled with depression ever since I was 13, and I used to self-harm for a period of two years until I eventually stopped, but the thought of dying is something that I’ve carried with me ever since. I don’t what to do, I barely talk about my depression with my friends because I don’t want to feel like a burden to them. I could get help, I just don’t want to.

Then I'll put the hobby down and never touch it again, after which I'll descend into a slump, doing nothing but sitting around for another month or so. Recently I've been noticing I do this to people as well. My friends, family and acquaintances. I can only enjoy being around a certain person for a few months before I tire of their company and slowly break away from them. I feel like such a piece of shit because I just can't seem to form a meaningful and long lasting relationship with anyone. I feel like soon I'll exhaust everyone I can possibly interact with and then I'll be completely alone. I leech off other people for company knowing full well that I'll never be able to have a proper relationship. I feel like maybe I don't even deserve the people who still try and reach out. I lie to everyone in my life, people ask me if I'm okay or how I'm feeling and I always lie. I don't understand why I can't ask for help, and why I keep pushing everyone away. It hurts so much but I feel like I'm hurting everyone in my life more. I don't know what to do, it's just a matter if time before I ruin everything in my life through lack of care and just being an awful person and friend. I'm sorry I ramble so much.

Been noticing that my mood's progressively been getting worse despite exercise, meditation, diet, and the usual remedial stuff. I have difficulty opening up to people and with self-compassion though I have been working on both. Recently (over the past week), I've noticed that thoughts laced with self-loathing have started to return. Also, I'm unable to have a one-on-one conversation with any of my friends, at the moment, with the exception of one who is bipolar and currently recovering from a depressive episode. I doubt burdening him with my shit would be helpful to either of us, at least for now. Anyway, I'm just trying to avoid relapse and am pretty hopeful.

25,"[16M] Depressed for 2 years. Suicidal thoughts. Past history of self harm. Anger issues due to family problems. My therapist thinks it all comes down to my mum shouting at me and me surpressing the anger and it turns into depression.

I've stopped training (swimmer). I used to enjoy training and now I'm so tired, demotivated, exhausted, undisciplined and burnt out that I can bring myself around to training. I have to bag pack later today and I haven't trained since Monday and in too ashamed to go but my parents will make me anyways.

I've been in therapy for 4 or 5 weeks now. It started of fine, but these past 2 weeks have been horrible. My parents are forcing me to do some form of exercise but I have no energy to be able to do any, which makes them angry and then that makes me angry cuz they're just piling on what I'm already trying to deal with


I've opened up to a few of my mates as well but idk what to say. Therapist says to open up, which I have done but I don't know what to do after that. I've so much shit going on in my head that it's so excruciating to get anything out. When I open up, I can't immediately see then response whenever it comes as I don't have enough energy to be able to read it I guess.

Schools going fine because we have an easy year type thing though but I need to be mentally healthy by the start of school in September again.

The anger issues are just me feeling constantly angry with myself and the people around me, not really my mates though. They just make everything worse as they piss everyone else off, mostly my parents tho. No one else really. I don't know how to deal with them as everything depletes because of it. Diet, sleep, phone usage, how much I socialise, how much I train, how much energy I have. Or some of that's because of my depression.

Any advice??
How do I talk about the emotional stuff with my mates? I struggle to follow beyond opening up.

How do I deal with my inability to train and my depleted energy levels?

And how do I get rid of the anger and depression?

To clarify I haven't said about the anger issues and energy levels to my therapist as it has been with in the last 2 weeks and my mum was at the last session as to see how we will proceed.",08Feb2020,1

I’m a French boy and I turned 20 two months ago. I have been struggling with depression for nearly 10 years now, and even though I tried to recover by seeing psychiatrist and taking meds as antidepressants, nothing really worked out.

I had a girlfriend 10 years older than me, but we broke up 3 months ago because I started getting even deeper in my depression, she wasn’t able to carry me anymore. (which I understand).

Until today, the only thing that prevent me from killing myself is keeping a job I don’t even like, so as you can see, there is nothing I can cling on to.

I’ve been living in my car for 3 months now, because I can’t find the strength to take an apartment or anything else that could help me getting out of this situation.  I just stopped my medication 2 weeks ago and I feel like it can get out of control at any time.

So it’s kinda my bottle in the sea, my last hope before finding myself in a position where I will not be able to come back, if it is not the case already. I spend my time getting drunk and smoking a lot of hashish as soon as I wake up, but it cannot stay that way

28,"So recently a lot of shit has been going wrong in my life. I lost my job in November and haven't had any money since before Christmas. I am currently living with my boyfriend and we are constantly hungry, cold and just unlooked after in general.

Recently, one of my friends killed himself. We weren't very close recently but we were best friends less than 2 years ago and I feel so bad for not sticking around to be there for him.

My family are constantly trying to put me down, my only direct aunt saying I shouldn't be a part of the family anymore cause I decided to move in with my boyfriend, and that I should be able to afford bus fare to go see her because I ""always have money for weed"" (I don't smoke weed) and as previously mentioned, I don't even have money for food. 

My brother telling me to remove certain pictures I post on facebook of myself because I ""look like a dickhead"" although he never has anything to say to me unless it's negative. Literally any time he opens his mouth to me, its to have a go, insult me or generally just make me feel shitty. Yet when I voice that (after taking the pictures down) I would rather him not speak to me at all than only speak to me when it's negative, he flips out and throws ""pathetic"" in the mix of abuse and insults, which upsets me more than ugly, stupid, fat, etc. 

My mother however, always takes his side and whenever I throw an insult back or stick up for myself or even start crying, I get screamed at and called pathetic while he's worshipped. They are both always saying they don't like the person I turned into cause I wasn't raised this way and I can't help but feel like they just don't like me. They always say how I should change and stop being so weird and snap out of my ""phase"", which makes me feel like complete shit cause I love who I am and my aesthetic.

To top it all off, any time my boyfriend or anyone for that case mentions anything to do with me being sad or moody or depressed or angry, I burst into fits of manic and hysterical sadness, where I can't stop crying for hours. Thus happens every day now and I don't know what is wrong with me.

Am I in the right for thinking everyone is targeting me for being depressed and purposely making me worse or am I the problem? Am I just weird? Is there something wrong with me that I can't see?",08Feb2020,1

31," Here's the blunt truth.

I'm too smart even for my own good and yet I under-performed at almost everything I did in life. This probably happened because for me to be good, I need to care and I never care about anything.

I'm too logical, I'm too cold, I'm too assertive with everything. Everything has an obvious solution except the problems I face. I'm too though on myself but if wasn't I'd be worthless by now.

**I live in the world of ideas and possibilities.** I don't like the real world. The real world forces me to suffer in order to satisfy the system's whims of jobs, a future, stability, ... I don't really mind this that much except I have no idea what to do with my life and so the feeling gets boosted up to 1000 times.

The things I could do are an utter sacrifice and kill me inside.

The things I like and am fairly good at are extremely competitive fields and I stand no chance of taking out the ""big dogs"".

I'm extremely determined and when I set my mind to do something I do it, therefore the fact that I can't make up my mind on something obvious is killing me. I literally can't decide what to do with my life because it's like whatever my decision it's doomed from the get go. I feel like nothing matters because even what I thought I liked doing, I'm not strong-willed enough to make it happen. **All I think is more sacrifices that I have to push through to realize it was all for nothing. This sums up my college degree.** I did it but it was not a fun experience at all. I hated it and the thought of taking another one because I choose the wrong degree the first time is pure torture. I couldn't stand that I actually knew more of some subjects than most of my teachers and yet ended up not acing the class (at least acing it according to my own standards).

All I see is a fake world as if everything is made of cheap plastic. Like I'm here to work a job and make the world evolve while my life is a boring meaningless mess. That is beyond acceptable for me. **Why help further a society and a way of living I don't even approve of?** Why develop aspirations and pursue dreams only to get crushed at the first turn? Logically you are only working to sustain yourself and all I want is such work to be something that makes me wanna get out of bed every morning, something I'm good at, something that doesn't require me to become someone I'm not, something that numbs me up from all the psychological stuff haunting me every day.

36,"There are a couple of things that are fucked with me so here we go

1. thing and the worst thing

I just cant take just a ""no"" for a answer. if i ask somebody out with a message and they respond with just a no i start overthinking like crazy. i start to think he/she hates and i have said something that offended them. like yesterday i was talking with this girl on snap who i have never met in irl. I dont know what she thinks about me but i look at her as a close kinda special friend. we have talk about shit that we would not talk to annybody else about. we talk about this stuff together because we most likely never will meet irl but i really like her as friend and look at her as one of my best friends. so i decided to ask her if she want to play video games and she was not sure if she wanted to because of our weird relationship but she would see maybe in the weekend. so i waited until the weekend and asked her again and she replied with just a  no and i felt a ton of sadness and self hate roll over me and i started overthinking like crazy and maid up storys to myself about what she thinks and how she feels about me. I was so just down and sad but i thought to myself i can handle this, the sadness will go over and everything will be ok...i did not handle it. Time went so slow and i just had to know why she hated me, why i am a creep, why i suck and evertihng that is wrong with. So i told her how i feel and basically begged her to explain why should would not play with me and her answer was ""i am not home"" and i just died inside. I thought up all sorts of crazy shit based on absolutely and i apologized for everything and asked if she wanted to play some time later and this time it was a ""bro no"" so now i am just so  anxious and depressed that i fucked our entire friendship up and idk how to deal with it. i just sit here in my sorrow wanting the day to be over. but this is for the most part just via text and with people that live so far away i cant reach them.

&amp;#x200B;

2 thing 

everyday i sit in class i am exited to get home and everyday when i get home just sadness and loneliness roll over me. And if i get snap of a friend where they do something fun i just down into a darkness and all motivation is gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 . thingy

i am just sad sometimes. why? idk i just sit in class and feel horrible and i just want to get up and talk to somebody about something because that usually distract the sadness i feel but not always. And there is even more feelings that i get out of nowhere like self hate. i just randomly remind myself about something i have done or said and it those not even have to be that bad but i just beat myself  about it, and i just want disperse ore sometimes suicide is on my mine.  Dont worry tho i am not gonna comit. i have made a deal with my self that if i ever get to the point of me actually wanting to end my life i will first seek all the help i can get and spill everything and give life a second chance.  

&amp;#x200B;

even more things

38,"I’m battling a new chronic physically illness that I’m still learning how to manage but it’s ruining my life. My depression and anxiety is much worse than before. My family is worried about me, but I’m still trying to live a normal life even though it feels impossible. Today I’ve been feeling so bad physically that I freaked myself out and had a panic attack. I had to let my managers know I couldn’t come into work on time because I literally can’t get my symptoms or anxiety under control. Now I feel like a failure. Even though my job is just a minimum wage job I don’t like to have the reputation of a quitter or someone who never comes in because I wasn’t like this before. This isn’t me but it’s killing the old me. I don’t know how to cope with it anymore. I’m seeing a therapist twice a month and journaling every day but idk what else to do.",08Feb2020,1

40,"I was in therapy for not even two months and I have to stop.  I had a high premium state insurance which covered therapy 100%, in January I switched to a lower premium state insurance because I couldn't afford the high monthly cost. My therapy co-pay was $30...not horrible, I decided to go every other week instead of every week.  

Well I just got an invoice from my therapist saying since I haven't reached my deductible by copay is $89!  It was $30 for the first three visits and will be $89 until I reach my deductible. 

So frustrating that mental health isn't covered more by insurance.  I don't know when I will reach my deductible.  Though I'm in not in desperate need of therapy right now having to stop so abruptly isn't helpful.  Frustrating.",08Feb2020,1

45,"i’ve struggled with depression on and off for the last 5 years. the winter is always especially hard on me, so i’m really in the depths of my depression right now. i feel like i’m all out of passion for anything. all i want to do is lay in bed all day and sleep a lot, but even though it’s incredibly boring nothing else seems to spark any joy for me or be worth the effort. it’s too cold outside to go walk anywhere (live in snowy canada &amp; don’t have a car) so i’m contained to my house for now. i’ll maybe take up an interest in something for about a day or two, but then i lose interest. also, i’m finding it incredibly hard to get up and do basic self care on a day to day basis, and the mess in the house continues to build up. i need to find a way to get the spark back in my life to want to help myself and better my life, and also i’d like some suggestions for things to fill my day with (don’t want to get into detail but can’t have a job or go to school at the moment). i just feel like i have no desire to put in the effort to make my life better, and as a result i’m lonely and bored and unable to take care of myself and my home. any tips?",08Feb2020,1
