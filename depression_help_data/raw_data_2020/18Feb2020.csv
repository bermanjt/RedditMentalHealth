Brothers and Sisters, I want to start with this... I cant possibly feel the pain that your in, but I understand you on a level much deeper than you think. Life never gives us an explanation to why certain things happen in our lives, or why they are the way they are... This alot of the times makes us feel lonely... But I want you to know life is not happening from the outside; our experience happens from within! Dont let the outside factors determine who you are, your worth, happiness, morals or any of that. Thats all determined and manifested into the world from within!!! Things dont change overnight, of course... But you are here for a purpose and your purpose is a lifes work, not season... So bare through the change. Connect with yourself, f\*\*\* the world put it on pause for a second! Figure out what your purpose is here in this lifetime and embrace that, embody it, become comfortable with this feeling. That will help you find inner fulfillment on a level nothing else can.

Peace, love and light!

2,"I see many posts from people asking for help that get no comments. As much as I want to reach out and help I don't say anything. I don't have the energy to write a reply because I'm depressed or I don't want to say the wrong thing, and make them feel worse, so I don't write anything. I'm on the stopdrinking sub and a lot of people write IWNDWYT, which stands for I Will Not Drink With You Today, as a show of support. I thought it might be a good idea if we had something similar on this sub. Something we could write that required very little effort and energy but showed support. Does anybody else think this is a good idea? If so, what do you think we could write to help each other?",18Feb2020,1

4,"I am in counseling and I go to the doctor every two weeks and I have medication , but I’m always sad.

My parents don’t listen to me and it’s hard because they want to deal with my depression but they won’t change. I ask my parents to try to put less pressure on me but they just say that it’s a parent’s job to pressure their children. I don’t want to be punished because I’m talking back so I can’t tell them how I feel.

I tell them about my feelings but they always give answers like “it’s a parent’s job to pressure their children” and it’s hard because the councilor can’t do anything about it and I don’t feel comfortable talking about it around them. I have depression meds but I’m either sad or numb. I feel like I’m a walking bottle of emotions because I don’t trust all but one people I know. I can’t talk to that person because I’m scared of being rejected, and I don’t trust my parents.

My parents make me feel like I’m not enough even though I’m trying my best and I don’t know how to deal with it. When I don’t want to do something they enforce really bad consequences on me, like don’t want to go skiing with your mom? Well you can’t read or have your phone. Even if I explain to them the reason I don’t want to do things I still get punished. The worst part about it is that when I’m saying they’re forcing me they say no we’re not we’re just giving you consequences for not doing it, even if I’m not feeling well. I can’t keep living like this and I don’t know what to do. 

My doctor even had me file a 504 plan ( a plan that gives students with troubles accompaniments to their learning i.e. less questions on homework ). The school said I didn’t need anything and that’s hard because I’m failing most of my classes and because of that my parents are restricting me more. I cry myself to sleep a lot and I feel trapped because of all these punishments my parents give me. They say I can do better when I’m trying my best and when I tell them that they don’t understand. All these limitations are making it hard to learn because I’m so exhausted. 

Do any of you know how to deal with these situations?",18Feb2020,1
6,"not sure if this is the right r/ for the problem i’m having but figured i’d give it a shot. 

i have pretty high functioning/well managed depression and anxiety but lately i’ve been having a really hard time allowing myself to turn “off”. i feel like i support so many people and have to be happy all the time and strong, i feel guilty when i’m sad or having a day. i’m having a really hard time taking a break from feeling like i’m everyones support system, and i don’t want it to get worse. not too dramatic, but worse in like... an unhealthy coping sense? 

basically i’m asking for tips on how to ALLOW yourself to experience the negative and sad emotions, without the guilt? don’t worry, i’ll talk to my therapist about this at our next session. kind of just needed a space to vent and think it out?",18Feb2020,1
7,"Alright , so im 19 years old and I have been depressed since middle school. However I never understood why. I mean i have been bullied , dealt with some misfortunate events , and was basically the black sheep at my school. I had some problems at home too, but honestly I never felt like it was anything serious for me to be this depressed. I self harmed alot, had 2 suicide attempts, and was an emotional wreck. I also went to therapy a couple times and took a high dose prozac for about 7 years.. I weaned myself off in college, didnt feel any different without it. Fast forward senior year. I realized it was fuck everyone else , I hung with my few friends (even though I felt as if they didnt enjoy my company) and got senior year over with. Then came college, the best experience of my life. At first I was sad because I was in a new place and i missed having a sense of familiarity, but I met my best friend and some of the most amazing people and college became amazing. I had to drop out due to financial reasons and was depressed, I came back home , and life was bad . I was extremely depressed, I had a welfare check done on me , my life sucked ..  December 2019: i realized I no longer wanted to be depressed , life started to feel good. January 2020: i was stick to my resolutions(something that is hard for me) life was still going great, my job was going great, i finally figured out a life plan dropped most of my friends, started ghosting people( for the better) started giving others advice letting them know it would be okay. I was alone for the most part. My whole life I wanted someone,and I had finally accepted being alone and I was okay with it. But I was starting to hate myself , my appearance , my body , my voice , my acne February 2020: i had my first real breakdown 2 days ago. Im depressed again. I feel so ugly to the point where i get mad when people call me beautiful or pretty because it honestly makes me feel uncomfortable , i hate my voice , im so bored with life. Its like i want to die , but then what. I just dont know what to do anymore and I don’t understand why im so depressed. I just smoke, go see my friend and sleep. I cant even listen to the person I listened to when I was depressed because it just makes me sadder that he is gone. I don’t understand, im tired of this depression, im tired of hating myself im tired of looking in the mirror and just wondering why . I need some advice, i dont know what to do at this point . 
if you read all of this thanks",18Feb2020,1
8,"So, my girlfriend has depression...I do what I can to help her. But recently I've been a little afraid that I might get it.

Yes I am aware that depression isn't something you ""catch""

Basically my reasoning for this is, after I got into this relationship I lost a lot of friends, friends that I've known almost 10 years, not because they liked her or anything but because they thought that I wasn't making time for them. I could go into reasoning for that but I would prefer not to.

But with the loss of them that kinda puts me friendless...I only had those few friends. Sure I have my girlfriends friends but then I have the worry that my girlfriend will break up with me to try and ""protect me"" or something and then I wouldn't end up hanging with them because they're all girls and her friends who I don't know all that well.

I am quite introverted, hence why I only had few friends, so making long term friends like the friendships I used to have is not something I believe can be done, nor do I believe the old ones can be mended.

I'm just worried that if all goes south then I'll be left alone.

I don't know what kind of advice I'm really asking for but encouraging words would help I suppose",18Feb2020,1
10,"I F(15) have always been a super academic student athlete, getting high 80s and 90s throughout middle school and into about halfway through ninth grade, when the depression started to kick in. it wasn’t as bad as it is now, but my grades started to get significantly lower.

This school year (tenth grade) my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 2/3 terms (51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term) and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2. 

I have no motivation to bring myself to do anything anymore. I can barely leave my bed. I am a competitive dancer and have always been super passionate and serious about it, and now i just don’t care any anymore. 

My dad who has been apart of my whole life (but not really at the same time because he’s a drunk a*sh*le) is in critical condition and is dying. I don’t know if it’s because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i won’t even give a shit when he’s gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously don’t feel anything 

I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesn’t really believe i’m depressed and won’t take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like it’s too late to fix anything. now i can’t help but think i’m going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life 

someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and i’m terrified about my future with my poor academics right now

12,"Well it's been quite the start to the year. I was very close to taking my life and was admitted to hospital for few days. I am proud to say I am on the other side and am confronting my depression and understanding it... trying to be one with it. I have already set up appointments for counselling which literally start tomorrow. And I have learned some very helpful techniques I have been practicing to get out of my head and more into the present - to feel more like myself and get back to my passions for life. 

While I am on the other side and improving there is one particular thought that keeps coming up. It's a sort of utilitarian idea that occurs when I feel this loss of meaning in my life and the world around me. This is happening less and less but when it does happen I feel guilty and ashamed for my life. I feel as if I could end my life in such a way to pass my body on, my blood my organs for others who are in need. The thought came on quite strong the other evening. And I seemed to turn it around into something positive. I had been thinking about doing this before, last year but the following day decoded to act on it. Instead of thinking in such an extreme way I instead went and donated blood. It was so easy to do. And it made me feel much better. I have a universal donor type and so I hope to go more often - maybe whenever that thought occurs?

I wonder if there are other techniques .. even just through thinking to avoid that train of thought? Is this a particular type of suicidal thought ... I keep thinking ""utilitarian""? Looking for advice!",18Feb2020,1
13,"To start off, I’m 21 and male. I’ve been living with depression since I was roughly 18 years old. This is due to a couple of personal problems that has left damage to me mentally, and with addition to the stress of life in general- it can be hard to wake up in the morning, get out of bed and go about daily life. Especially in a positive manner. I also suffer with anxiety too.

I guess what I’m here for is to ask what the next step is to becoming healthier from a mental standpoint? As I’m a believer that accepting the situation is the first step in the right direction, but I dunno. 

I believe with such a big and supportive community like this one we can all help each other in any way, shape or form. So just even the smallest piece of advice or help would make the world of difference to me. Maybe I could even give some of you advice too, like I said- this is a community where we should all support each other as much as possible.",18Feb2020,1
14,"This is a throw away account, as my experience on the internet taught me so.

It all started after me and my ex girlfriend broke up with me (We dated for almost a year and a half). We split 3 months ago sometime during my birthday, she was my best friend and the closest person I ever let into my life. We lived together and both felt that we we're going to get married to each other one day. It was a really messy breakup, to sum everything up. We broke up because of her expectations on the relationship. I was not meeting them, she was also a lot older than me (She was 26, and I just turned 21).

When we started dating, I didn't have much friends. As a kid growing up I was always bullied for having a hearing disability and a speech impediment (both cyber and physical), and I didn't have the greatest childhood either. My parents were always fighting, I never really had a ""best friend"" I've always had people who just felt ""bad"" about my situation. They would just try to comfort me, when I try to make plans and so on.  It would never go through. However, when we were dating (me and my ex). I started getting close to her friend circle, made some what I thought was ""good friends"". But as soon as we split, they never bother to reply to my texts, and plans. It feels like they've also broken up with me also. My old high-school friends, I've tried contacting them and trying to reconnect with them. But they also avoid me when they can, they are not interested.

I'm 21, and I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. Everyone is growing up picking their careers and starting life. I feel lost in life, I can never settle on what I want to do with my life. I did attend college for general science program, I dropped out after 1 semester. I never liked one bit of it. 

I also have many health issues, I've been diagnosed with a genetic blood disease, and a fatty liver from stress eating. I really feel hopeless sometimes, I try to go to the gym and exercise but I just have no motivation. I am not obese at all, I just never cared about what I ate and now I am paying the price.  

I currently work many jobs to support myself financially, I am fine for now. But I always worry that, when it's time for me to move out and live on my own. I will not be able to survive, how can I afford rent, how can I afford bills etc etc.. life stuff.

I don't have anyone to talk to this about, so that's why I'm posting this. How can I make friends? How can I move on from her? How can I motivation to care about myself? And how can I find my passion and career?

I always have constant anxiety. I always end up just never leaving my room, sometimes I cave in and I start to message her. She did say that we can be ""friends"" but every-time I message her, she just leaves me on read. The thing that hurts me the most, is finding out that shes already seeing other people.

16," Short: was at the gym, having a fantastic work outs. Went to do some sit ups. Phone sliped out my pocket while someone was trying to show off behind me. Looked like he was trying to do squats or something with free weights  on a bar with weight plates. Phone slid out of a pocket, and then behind me a bit just as some weight plates slid right on off his bar. Turns out that is not how phones like to play...as the damn screen went Ke-Runch.

But bot did that somehow both somehow weirdly feel hillarius...and just infuriated at the phone for some idiot reason. Possibly because it's pissing me the fuck off I can't just go: meh oh well and simply up an-order some really  cool ones.. I can't find one with  keyboard that streams stuff, like music or podcasts, and is rugged and has kick ass reception. For what ever reason that just pisses me the eff-off, that phone companies rather make phones that are uterly, rediculously flustrating to use, and make them so--I don't poor quality, or think they can go indfeinatly treating this stuff as desposable, rather than make sexy, fun cool modular, such that they're use simple magnets to stay connected to the motherboard(like that in a box, if it drops, brokedn screen. undock that, swap it in for a fresh one for free, the broken one gets TLC(or something)

26,"Hi friends,

I went through somewhat of a psychotic break recently. I was out on FMLA for crippling anxiety and depression (couldn’t leave the house without vomiting, running to my car/hiding in the bathroom at work multiple times a day to manage panic attacks, etc). I became seriously suicidal, and in the process of doctors appointments/hospital visits I lost my job due to improper communication with my employer. I was there for many years and had “worked my way up” to a decent wage. Not enough to compensate for a toxic work environment, but I had healthcare and lived comfortably.

I’ve given myself some time to wallow, but I can’t hide in the house forever. I need to be working by the end of next month.

Any advice as to how I can get out of the house and start getting back in to a routine and attack the job search? How do I explain my work history to a prospective employer?

I’m in the “I’ll tackle it tomorrow!” loop and can’t seem to get started.",18Feb2020,1

I’m not someone who gets angry easily and especially not a small things like that. Then I realized that when my depression gets worse that I become very hostile and angry as a means of protection. It makes sense due to things going on in my life and the isolation I’m currently in with no friends or family.

I’m now so fearful of becoming the bigot I once was. How can I mitigate and prevent this anger? Because I’d rather fear the emotional turmoil, guilt, and shame associated with my episodes than project it outward onto someone else.",18Feb2020,1
29,"Hello friends, I started living alone after I graduated high school and it's been around 5-6 years since, and along with my depression, I've developed some really bad habits that I don't really know how to change and so I decided why not see what other people do.

Issues: Oversleeping, lack of motivation, unhealthy eating/sleeping habits

It's the classic stay in bed all day thing - I also have really bad chronic lumbar strain and it makes everyday sitting and standing really tough as well as getting out of bed (yes I've tried physio, chiro, got x-rays done, gone to a specialist, all to no avail). It's a nasty cycle of being unmotivated to do anything, and have my back reinforce why staying in bed is a good idea. I'm living with 8 other people, and we're sharing one kitchen, so I really dislike cooking at home, so a lot of my finances go towards really high food costs (When I do end up buying groceries, I get so lazy and sometimes let them rot cause it's been too long and I still haven't used them). I'm also on a one year probation period from my college partly due to a toxic relationship. So currently I've just been smoking weed, gaming, and going out to hang out w friends once every couple invites when I feel like it.

So let's say my back problem didn't exist, cause it's really unlikely that I'll get any good advice regarding back pain in this subreddit, what do some of you friends do to kind of.. pull yourself out of this negative lifestyle?

Thanks in advance and I hope all of you guys have a wonderful day/night!",18Feb2020,1
31,"I just want to post this for myself to show myself its ok to be vulnerable. Any input is appreciated, especially honest ones. I’ll try to make this short and sweet. Don’t judge until the end please.

So I was seeing this girl that I knew back in High school. I would sell ecstasy to her boyfriend, and knew her on a basic level. A few years later I moved out of my home town to the big city (just 2 hours away). After moving I invited a friend over and he invited her and her friend. We started dating right away. She was a hoodrat stoner type of girl, and it was abundantly obvious. I tried to dazzle her up by getting her nice things as I made more money. Nice clothes and purses, and encouraged her to remove all the face piercings so she could get a job and we could work together in this relationship we are working on. She did remove them, but never got a job &amp; continued to leech. I didn’t mind as she held the house together by making sure I ate properly, worked out, work harder at my job, and keeping the house clean. In 2016 I quit my job as a realtor and had to move to a smaller place. I couldn’t afford her any more, basically. So she went to her moms house. She promised to stay loyal until I figured it out. I would visit her on the weekends. 2017 (6 months later) I was accepted as a financial analyst for a large company. They wanted to base me out of Indiana for a year or two before working at corporate. She didn’t want to move, but decided to come with me. I promised I would buy her a car for moving to this hellish state with me. We move and she helped me stay sane. She even got a great job through a temp agency! Life was perfect. 2018 comes around and I was told to move home and work at the corporate office. I did so with great enjoyment. The day we land back from Indiana my girl was driving my volvo to meet me at our new house I was about to sign the lease for. On the way she gets Tboned by a Tesla that ran a stop sign. It broke her back basically. Right away she was given mass amounts of pain killers. I got her a lawyer to fight for her as she had no health insurance and now needed surgeries. And I was on the hook to support her. I didn’t mind as work was good. She stopped getting out of bed. 24/7 needed help to not be in pain. It took almost a year of this to get her into the major surgery room. She had one surgery, then two surgeries, then three surgeries. After all this she is still in pain constantly. Her law suit continues, and they are trying to get enough  money so she never has to work again. That is not what I want... I understand but that’s not how I imagined my life partner to be. Whatever, I work with it. Beginning of 2020 I quit my job to pursue a job in renewable energy sales. I already signed my first deal and was ready to move on. I talk to my girl and tell her that I just worked 4 years straight behind a desk so I am going on vacation. I have a relative in Thailand and a cousin that was going to a surf camp in Nicaragua. I planned on being gone the whole month. 

Now this is where it turns to shit.

I go to Thailand and decided to invite my best friend (since 1st grade who is now living in China). He accepts with a strange tone. When he arrives we have some drinks at my cousins bar. I give him some psychedelics and we are talking deep because haven’t seen each other in 10+ years. He suddenly breaks down and begins to cry. I ask him what’s wrong... and he admits to me that he fucked my girl when I was in between jobs. I crack. I give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and tell him thank you for telling the truth... but now I’m in Thailand with my best friend knowing that the love of my life fucked him because she was sad that I had to kick her out. Shoulder to cry on became a dick to ride on. Me, my cousin, and my best friend begin to have the time of our lives. Fucking every chick in town and getting shit tanked. 

I made a decision to come home for “Valentine’s Day” for a few days before my Nicaragua trip. I come home and begin to buy her life supplies. New clothes, make up, fixed the tires on her car I bought her, and anything I could think of. During this time I stirred up conversation of my friend. I knew they met back in the day at a snowboard resort thing my best friend worked at. I jokingly asked if they hooked up ever, and I got a hard no. As I already knew the truth I asked her again over the next two days. During this time I’m basically giving her the last good dick she will have for a while. Destroying it so bad and eating Viagra to continue non stop. It is now 2 days before Valentine’s Day and I do a huge line of ket and meditate. I talk to my spirit guides and they urged me to tell her the truth of what happened. So I got up and opened my photos and showed her pics of me and my best friend in Thailand fishing and riding quads/dirt bikes and go karts and everything. Her heart broke. I then told her about a 4some I had with 3 chicks. And that I did this because of what she did to me. She loses it and accuses my friend of rape by getting her drunk and giving her Xanax. This may be true as I know my friend had a history of this back when we used to party. Then she argues that we weren’t even together... I had enough. I told her to get her shit and leave. She does, but not before disclosing all the guys she fucked in that 6 month period and trying to tell me details to break my heart. I had to put my headphones in on max volume.

36,"Ugh my body being ridiculously out of shape, the insane phone costs, and my fathers rambling what the fuck is he going on about. All have me angry.

Yesterday was day 5 in a raw of cardio. I got to planet fitness. and got about 10 minutes on stationary bike.  But now I'm so grossly large I simply can't fit on some of the fucking benches.  And while doing situps on one of the benches that tilts down. My phone slid out of my pocket just as someone doing  I have no idea what with a weight bar, and some weight plates that fell off the bar and and onto my phone. That part was kind of funny because the phone barely worked anyway. pile of utter trash phone. Nexus 6.

Problems: I just feel disgustingly grossed out by my body,fucking hate how no matter how little I eat, and how much I fucking run, walk what ever, the god dam weight won't fucking come off.

Family has said: Sure we'll help with a new phone. Next problem. My father. Is utterly incompetent when it comes to staying on topic, and expressing himself. He's 80 something years old. I doubt he'll get better. If anything he's getting worse. That came up because he's a iPhone dude. But MIGHT go android. I had emailed him some pretty cool looking phones.  Trying to keep around 600 or less.

It's slim pickings at 500-600. The last time I got a phone was way back in 2016.  I'm trying to account for inflation some.   I just think it doesn't make sense to drop 800 bucks on a phone. But that's where there's a ton more that come up on searches. (google or bing).

Posted several times to reddit forums and a email list. 

I called them to see how they were doing. He probably has asthma, and a cold. Mum has hip and general age things going on. So I had basically called with a few things. See how they were doing.  Ask if they'd gotten around to reading some of the reviews of phones I'd found both my self and dad. And let them know the somewhat amusing accident with the phone while working out.

That's when things go completely off the rails for a conversation. He starts in on. Uhh well uuuh the EU has uuuu decided uuu that uuuu phones are uuuu to have one kind of uuuu port and uuuu apple has uuuuu lightning uiuuuu bolt uuu, why the fuck uuuu doesn't android uuu.   I got so lost to what the hell does that have to do with did he like what I'd found. He then asked why is Wireless charging a thing, who the eff cares about that, why not just use a ""real connector! "" . I tried to point out the problem with MY Nexus was exactly that. The USB port to charge the phone, did a teribad job of hold on to it. Using A Qi/Wireless chargers might work out as a nice option because frankly I don't know how many times I've found wired charged to have short, have a thick wall adapter etc. The conversation basically consisted of him neandering about, apple this, apple that, apples are so much better etc, all the time me asking: what on earth are you talking about?

And ugh! the fucking prices of phones, them or the software being half assed, and  trying to do anything to move around on touchscreen phones is a PITA. I just don't like the onscreen only keyboards that saturate the market now.  

And it pisses me off that my father goes on these neandering rambles about the fucking EU when it's any coversation.",18Feb2020,1

And I had depression before becoming a stay at home mom but I think its made it worse. I just feel so fucking alone all the time. All day long it's just me and my two kids. And don't get me wrong they are great. But I literally do not even get a minute of quiet or alone time to just have a thought. I am catering to them non stop 24/7. And then my husband comes home and I cater to him. I have no one to talk to. All my friends are working all day long. And to be honest the friends I have are pretty shitty friends anyways but I've know them since I was a kid so I just play along? I'm an only child to a workaholic mom who doesn't even have 5 minutes of the day to talk because her job is ""sooo important."" My husband is a great guy but he is in recovery for opiate abuse so when he is home the conversation is either about work or about other guys that hes friends with in recovery and helping them. I just feel like my loneliness is part of the root cause of my depression but I don't know how to get out of it or make it better. I have to stay home because we can't afford daycare.

Today I was left feeling even more depressed than usual because I was so unused to actually feeling good my normal life was suddenly unbearable again. I had been able to fight off my depression and anxiety by acclimatising to the struggle, I was used to the situation I was in, accustomed to the mediocrity, my failures and inadequacies.

Seeing something so amazing suddenly made my life and myself seem miserable and dull and pathetic all over again, like any progress or anything I felt good about was nothing.

45,"Hey all- 

I recently published [**a list**](https://gr8fultherapist.com/2020/02/12/8-books-that-you-must-read-about-mental-health/) of 8 of the best books to read about your mental health - in particular, they focus on depression, anxiety, and simply being your best self. 

I hope you will check out the list. I worked hard deciding which books I thought should make the cut! I'm a therapist, so I've read many, many books and you can't go wrong with ANY of these. 

Any suggestions for other book lists? I thought about doing best relationship books, best books for Borderline Personality D/O, etc.

46,"Throwaway account. Looking for advice or insight - my (26F) partner (27M) has low-functioning depression, while I have high-functioning depression. We just started seeing each other, and while we've had very intense moments of love and affection for each other, many experiences end with him questioning whether he deserves me. He thinks he's a burden to me, and that he's too empty for this to be successful. He initially called things off between us, but then felt like potential love was worth it, and so here we are. After incredible days together, he feels like he has to go back to real life, as if the happiness he felt wasn't normal or allowed.

What I don't think he realizes, is that being with someone who has depression like I do is the exact thing I need, I think. I'm sick of partners who don't get it, and all I want is to not feel alone in anything. He's worth so much to me, because he keeps me from feeling like I'm regularly in an endless pit. I'm more than willing to be there for him, because I care too much not to. There's been no downside on my end in being with him, compared to the downside of being totally alone.

Does anyone have experience with a partner questioning their worth in a relationship? How did you overcome the depressed feelings to foster something beautiful, or was there no success in that? Is there anything I can do or say to him to help?

Losing him would be a tragedy. I'm not going anywhere.

The doctor prescribed me seroquel and now after going to a psychiatrist im on mirtazapine. That worked for a week but the depressive episode continued all throughout the month and now im thinking i need to get out of this house. The days are so long and some nights the pills put me to sleep for a couple hours but some nights no. I dont have a job and depression has consumed my life entirely. I dont know what to do, ive reached out in the community but the wait is so long and ive now tried 5 different sleep meds.

49,"I've always struggled with depression, ever since I was officially diagnosed in 5th grade. Now I'm almost 4 years out of high school and I'm about to break.

I really have nothing in my life to complain about. I completed a college welding course and I now have a regular job with a steady paycheck. I'm living with a relative right now (who's away at the moment so I have the house to myself) so I don't have to worry about rent or bills. I grew up in a well off household, I'm not in any serious debts. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm worthless.

We're way behind orders at my welding job and so effective immediately there's mandatory 5 hours on Saturdays. Which wouldn't be a big deal... except Saturdays I have a karate class that I go to for exercise and socializing. The hours I would have to work would prevent me from going to class. I literally have no other time to exercise or people outside of that class to socialize with.

I'm trying to look for a new job but I'm feeling so burned out on this one that I dread going into work. And how am I supposed to take a weld test for a new job if I'm working 55 hours a week, 6 days a week? Who's going to come in on a Sunday just to watch some stupid woman try to prove herself? And I can't just start immediately because where I want to get a job is an hour from where I live now, plus I don't want to leave without a two weeks' notice.

And I've talked to my mom, and she says I just need to take it one day at a time, I've made it this far. Except I can't make it any farther. I'm at my limit. I'm breaking down more and more at work, and I'm sure I'm resented by many of my coworkers for having them. And what if something happens that I can't do my job anymore? I have literally zero other applicable skills. I can't do customer service again.

And I shouldn't need a psychologist. I don't have any actual troubles. I'm just a piece of shit who can't appreciate anything she has. I shouldn't take up their time when there are people with actual problems who need them more, people who can actually contribute something to society. And when could I even see one? I live in a small town. Everything medical is closed by 5 pm (coincidentally, when I usually get back from work) and I'm not raking up the huge cost it would take for an emergency psych stay.

I can't even commit suicide because I'm that much of a coward. I can't find anything to live for but I'm scared of failing and the pain that would result. My body and soul hurt so much and I have no idea what to do. I don't even know why I'm typing this out. I just want to disappear and nobody to notice I'm gone.",18Feb2020,1

53,"Warning: *mild reference to selfharm and suicide*
I honestly don't know why I have to post this. On the surface, my life looks acceptable. My family provides a home and financial stability, I have a job (minimum wage, but it's a start), and, for the first time in my life, I have real friends. I feel like my situation is the best it's ever been. Nonetheless, I cannot escape this death grip depression has over my life. Everyday, I wake up with two invisible hands clenching my chest. I go to work and wait to leave. I return home and wait to sleep. All my hobbies mean nothing to me. Throughout my day, my brain feels as though it has been wrung out. A constant weight presses on me. Every time I start to care about something, a tidal wave of anxiety and cynicism washes it away. 
In the past, I knew why I felt this way. At least, I thought I did. I had people screaming at me, chronic pain, no support for my education, friends leaving me left and right for better things. But all that has passed. Yet, I can't shake all the pain, all the senseless fear, all the numbness off from me. No matter what I do, it remains. I feel like I'm literally pinned against a wall. My concentration has tanked. All that helps me is music and that's starting to lose its potency. I tried my best to not get involved in anything self-destructive. The worst thing I ever did was cut myself back when I was trying to finish hs. 
Seriously, I have to white-knuckle through watching YouTube videos. 

Absolutely everything feels worthless and abysmal. Death constantly creeps into my mind. I can honestly say I don't want to kill myself. I just want to snap out of this trance. I don't even feel worthy of talking about this because I don't usually have to deal with emotional abuse or toxic work environments or worse things. I feel like a black hole that just swallows other people's kindness. 

One thing I can say is that I have been giving myself emotionally to a lot of friends and family. It seems like everyone decided to have an existential crisis at the same time. But I want to help them. It exhausts me, but it's the only thing that keeps me feeling like a slob. 
Then again, I've been in this state long before these developments. I feel like this is just my lot in life and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.
