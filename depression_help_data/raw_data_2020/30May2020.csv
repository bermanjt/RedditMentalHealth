I’m just staying high all the time now to numb everything but it still fucking hurts. There’s a chance I might be pregnant, and that means I’d have to get another abortion, even though I’m on birth control and have been since the last one my freshman year of high-school. I’m so tired. I’m just so tired and nothing I do helps make it better. Nothing makes me smile or laugh. Nothing is enjoyable and I’m so fucking done with crying over my stupid lowly emotions because I’m a weak fucker who cant get anything under control. I’m sorry if you read this, I’m sorry I wasted your time. I’m sorry. I cant do this. I’m so tired.",30May2020,1
1,"I hope that the title isn't too confusing- I can't seem to come up with a better way to put it. 

There have been times in my life that have been what I have considered to be depressive episodes, though I've never been diagnosed with depression. And recently, there have been more than usual. However, there's also a lot of stuff going on in the world right now (as well as in my personal life) that is overall pretty sucky, and I can't tell whether me feeling so down and out is from internal sources or external ones, if that makes sense. 

So, my question is, how can you tell?",30May2020,1
3,"Today is an awful day. Started with my work from home job task that I wasnt able to solve on my own (it was petty, I'm a software developer), me being stupid not reading about hidden fees on shipping of products i bought abroad of which I intend to start a business with, not being able talk to my boyfriend whom I havent seen for months due to Quarantine protocols in my country, and my pet who died just hours ago because of a mistake im partly responsible of 😢 i know a lot of people are going through something much much worse, but I just need to speak it out as I dont have someone to cry on right now. :(",30May2020,1
4,"I can’t even talk to my family or be around them even though I fucking live with them. If they say something to me I can hardly function because I’ve got such bad fucking anxiety talking to them. I don’t speak unless spoken to, and give short answers at that. Every little thing I do I feel gets analysed and judged by them. I’ve gotten fucking paranoia. 

This lockdown is making the whole situation even worse. I go starving and without water for ages just to not be around them. I always am suspicious that they are talking about me when I’m not close. I fucking hate myself. My actual biological father is a fucking lunatic who I couldn’t say anything serious to without him laughing at me. What a fucking shit life to not even have a family to talk to and be comfortable around. I have basically been all alone ever since my grandfather died... the only family member I could ever talk to. I swear, when I get out of this house and out of the foster system I’m going to be relieved but this shit will have undoubtedly had permanent effects on my brain... what a fucking traumatic experience.",30May2020,1
5,"I’m not sure how to mark this, as I can’t find the NSFW tag. If you need me to remove this, I will.

I was on the phone with my therapist today talking about my anti-anxiety medication. I mentioned that I was worried about taking them too frequently and how I wanted to slow down because I don’t want to become dependent on them. While I was talking to her, it dawned on me that I don’t want to run out of them in case I want to OD. 

That was a really sad realization and I didn’t want to tell my therapist, but I did, and she had me give the bottle of pills to my mom. I’m glad I told her but I can’t shake the thought that it’d feel so good to take them. I want to kill myself, but I don’t want to die. It’s weird. Thank you for reading.",30May2020,1

I am young. 15. idk if thats ok to say but idrc. anyways my life is a total living hell. My mom is a manipulating lying bitch. I know its not ok to call your mom names. but idc because shes called me worse. my mom calls me a worthless useless druggie. almost 3 times a week and it just feeds my depression more and more. let me clarify im not a ""druggie"" but i smoke weed occasionally to self medicate for the fact he my depression is only getting worse and worse by the day. I have a gf that ive known for for almost 2 years but we didnt start dating till recently for complicated reasons. but she is loving and caring however we live distances away 2 1/2 hours she cant drive her and idk how to drive. but i have one person in my life who cares about me is what i care about but sadly my home life counters the happiness she gives me. My mom is always accusing me of being high even when im sober and its funny cuz every time shes accused me of being high i was sober. but anyways last night i got in a physical fight w me old man. he swung first but both of them deny it which is total bullshit. and i cant go to the cops because my dad is popular in my town he knows the whole fucking PD and its stupid so even if i had a severed arm they wouldn't care because my dads a generally good guy. behind closed doors when he gets angry its like hes an angry drunk. hes sober and has been his whole life same with my mom. I have 3 sibling ones 15 months older and the other 2 are years younger. my sister is like a trouble maker outside of my house but my parents dont care until they have proof. but if my sister said to my mom oh he killed someone shed fucking believe it. but thats the thing i have anger issues yes but i swore to never hurt any of my family intentionally. but they always think im going to like end up killing someone. but i love people and cant even picture myself killing someone. and no i dont hurt animals either i had a dog for 12 years who i gave the most love to more than anyone in my family she used to always be there for me lick me when im sad she never not once bit any of us. even playing. She died 11/12/19. RIP twinkie. Anyways my parents are to selfish to get another pet and dont care about my well being. i have a therapist but he doesnt help. Why? ive had more than 10 therapist and none have helped me.  i cant change and idky but i hate hate hate who i am. I have only 1 real friend who lives an hour and doesnt drive. and my gf who i barely see. I guess im here asking for help from the internet because well theres no one here to help me anymore. my gf barely puts effort when she does. and yes i have been diagnosed with depression. i suck ass at writing long things so if this doesnt make sense i apologize for wasting your time. thanks if you read all this tho.",30May2020,1
7,"Quarantine has had insidious effects on my mental wellbeing. I haven’t been able to see my friends and engage in normal social interactions, this goes against my nature. Isolation has always had harrowing effects on the human psyche. I think that’s where my issue stems from. Whenever I’m not exercising or working, I am left alone with my thoughts, and I feel like I’m the only person on earth. I feel so sad when I’m not consumed within work or exercise. I’ve told no one, I’m afraid of vulnerability. My front of stoicism masks pain. I don’t know if I can hold it up much longer. I don’t think this is depression, if it is, it’s very conditional, I think I might just be starved of social interaction. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this. I don’t think this is depression, and I don’t want it to be, but it’s something.",30May2020,1
8,"I am 23 yo female and I have problem having connection with others. I never have close friend that I share my worries or stories to. Never been in relationship and don't know how to open up to anyone. Sometimes I thought that maybe I deserve to be alone and not worthy of anyone time. Even someone that I consider close to me never think the same about me. I feel like if I ever try to be vulnerable with someone it'd be burden to them because they don't actually care about me.
It feel like I've been like this all my life. It's very apparent to people around me how depressed I am, I don't think I have the energy to mask it and this is probably what make people rather not be close to me. 
In this pandemic time it's even more easier for me to feel lonely and thinking every possible worse scenario about the future. I'm helpless and don't know who to share my thought to.

12,"My depression and anxiety have flared up a lot this last week and it’s drained me off all motivation to listen to and record music. I have loved music my whole life and I’ve only recently started recording music at home as a hobby, but my depression has cut down on my desire to do either of those. When I listen to music I get sad thinking about how my music will never be this good and I get discouraged very easily when I’m trying to make music, especially since I am a perfectionist (trying to not be).

Honest to god I felt like I feel for a girl really hard and it seemed like things were going well but it seems like she lost interest but still leads me in acting like she wants something to happen but nothing ever does, I have to maintain every conversation and   It just weighs me down. I handle a shit ton of stuff(people will just laugh at me if I said what) and I love it but hate it. I wanna do nothing. I just wanna lay in bed with music blasting in my ears so I can forget the world exists.

I’m really close to giving up and feel like I’m to open with shit.

16,"Hi guys! This is my first post ever and I've been feeling a little down lately : (

So let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt how much fun they had in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive and I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and crying, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one even bothered inviting me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled.

Few months ago I got rejected by a girl. Now isolated by friends.2020, are you done?

Any similar experiences and advices for me?",30May2020,1

18,"Ever since I was professionally diagnosed with depression and been open about it I've realized how awful my friend group is. They have given me zero support and have spent zero time trying to understand me and my mental illness. If I exhibit behaviors or start to close off they just assume I don't want to be around them. I have reached out multiple times explaining to them that I need them to check in on me. I only said this to them because I thought that they were my closet friends and that I could trust them. I know that it's a lot to ask if someone but I feel like it shouldn't be a problem if you really care about someone. I have always been there to buy them food, or drive them places, or even listen to THEIR own mental health issues, why wouldn't I expect them to reciprocate? I texted one of them once that I was having a panic attack (clearly looking for comfort) and this person told me to ""go on a walk or something"" and that they didn't know what they expected from me. This person months earlier told me that one of our  other friends was disassociating and they called them and offered their  support to them. Why am I different? Since the quarantine I have rarely heard from any of them. One of them messaged me asked me how I was doing and I was honest and really poured my heart out about my family situation and my mental health and that I wasn't really doing well and all they said was ""yeah it's really hard right now"" and I'm just stewing thinking about it that like that all they fucking said to me.

Be proud of that, although it makes life more excruciatingly painful.

I'm trying really hard to find things to do that give life purpose and meaning but continuing to fight the same mental battles over and over every day has made it so I barely have the motivation to get out of bed.

33,"Even though I keep my life in pretty good order, I eat healthy, I sleep regular, I have a job, take classes, have goals, have hobbies... I'm cynical about life. 

I dont have a religion and so i know life only has the meaning you give to it, but I cant give it any meaning that makes me happy. If I try living in the moment, every, single, fucking, time, I WILL fall back on old habits. I will stop taking care of myself, I will eat poorly, experiment with drugs, break things out of anger. 

I cant indulge any hedonistic pleasure because it just puts me on the path of self destruction. In other people's eyes I'm doing great right now. Like I said, i have my shit together, and i can use my willpower (though it takes all of it) to just keep marching forward but nothing in my goals makes me happy. 

Music used to make me happy, i was even a music major for a while. I still practice but feel nothing, I listen to my old favorites and explore for new stuff and it just all starts to sound the same. 

Never had sex or a girlfriend but every girl I meet is a psycho and manipulative or so needy that shes not worth my time. Sex doesnt seem any more enticing than masturbation, which I also limit and RARELY do with the help of pornography - once again I will become addicted and have quit. 

It doesnt matter that I can take care of myself and be a ""healthy person"". Life has no meaning and I dont enjoy it. It's a bother to socialize with people and listen to their problems but i do it, and i offer help and follow through. People help me and it honestly only makes me feel guilt because I know they must deeply care about me but I just force myself to because I dont want to fall into a recluse state. 

The only times I feel happy are when I say fuck it and go drink a 15 pack of beer and chain smoke cigarettes. This will put me on a few week long downward spiral where I start to lose grip of things, then I have to reschedule my shit and resummon my willpower. And in the end was it worth it? Just to get fucked up and make a fool of myself. 

It feels like it is worth it though when I look at my potential future and cant visualize anything that would satisfy me. Not even if I could fly or shoot lazer beams from my fingertips would I feel happy. No girl could ever satisfy me, no friendship could distract me from our inevitable demise. Fixing the suffering of mankind would increase other's opinions of me, but not my own. 

I've slowly been improving myself to be ""healthy"" but I honestly miss the old me from 5 or 6 years ago, the drug addict who felt EVERYTHING and fought for causes because he believed in the end it all meant something. I tried to ignore nihilism for so long but I was becoming psychotic. It took giving up all hope in a higher power just so that I could stop the maddening thoughts that raced through my head and would lead me to illogical arguments and tirades. Now I'm so balanced but feel sterilized and like my life has been stolen. Theres no euphoria, no anticipation, I just march forward like I'm a puppet held up by strings.",30May2020,1
