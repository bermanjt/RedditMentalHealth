1,"I got a letter today saying I have an appointment with an endocrinologist, meaning I will hopefully start T by the end of the year. I was really happy earlier and now I just feel empty. For the past few days I've been starting to fall back into a depressive episode. I feel very numb and upset. I can't sleep. I can't bring myself to eat or wash my hair or brush my teeth. I don't know how I can go to school tomorrow. My whole life I've missed school chronically and my mom's very fed up with it. If anyone has any advice or tips for at least getting through tomorrow I'd really appreciate it. (I'm new to Reddit so sorry for any formatting issues or if I did something wrong)",09Sep2020,1

4,"I found the most beautiful woman for me, she's got an amazing personality and she's got an amazing figure. And I fear I'll lose her. I'm late to every date and have done other things to hurt her. I've never laid my hands on her in a non loving way. The thing is, every time I screw up, she wants to talk about it. Well, the issue is I'm so stupid that sometimes I don't know what I did and she'll say we need to talk. In all past relationships, anytime they said that we need to talk, they left me without telling me anything I did wrong. I told my current girlfriend that and she said it hurts her. But when we're in the car, she holds on for dear life (even though I drive like she does) and blames it on trauma from a minor car accident where she wasn't injured, but when I say it's from emotional trauma, I'm comparing her to other girls.

5,"I started practicing martial arts when I was 5 years old, I started in Tae Kwon Do and I wasn't bad. But some years ago I started practicing a Japanese martial art called Kempo, and I'm not just not good, I think I'm actually pretty bad, before the pandemic I used to go to the dojo and I never felt that I was bad, it was until the online classes started that I realized I was so bad at it. I can't do anything right, I feel like an idiot, I feel like I'm just making fun of myself, and there is this girl that is  like the best of the class that in the dojo used to make fun of me, obviously not in front of the sensei but with other classmates. Today I literally wanted to cry because I felt so useless, so helpless, so much like an idiot, I'm just sick about, I love Kempo, I love martial arts, but what's the point in practicing if I'm just doing so bad? I'm thinking about quitting, idk.",09Sep2020,1
6,"I’ve struggled with episodic depression and anxiety before, primarily in my late teens and early twenties, when life was in a constant state of flux. Never diagnosed, never sought medication. 

Now I have every external reason under the sun to be happy. 

But I can’t concentrate on anything right now — I’m falling behind at work and can’t focus on the hobbies I usually enjoy. I’m tired and I feel like I’m living in a fog. I’m not “sad”, per se, just out of it. 

Is this depression? Or am I just coping poorly with the pandemic and the stresses it brings?",09Sep2020,1
8,"2019-2020 has been a very horrible and eventful time for me. Before 2019, on my bad days I would usually try to hold my tears to ultimately pour them all out in a bathroom or at home in my room. But during this last year and a half (arguably the worst time of my life so far) I don’t recall crying even once. No matter how sad I am, no matter how messed up I think my life is, no matter how bad I want to die, or how crappy life is going, I am just not able to cry.

Now, every time something upsetting happens, I feel my stomach drop or a void. I feel frustration, and emptiness, but I can’t even bring myself to feel sad. Even if I discuss my emotions or feeling with someone else, I just say it like it’s nothing and I don’t really feel the same urge to cry as I used to do before. 

This is starting to really concern me since crying has helped me cope so much in my past, and I find it extremely weird that more than a year has gone by and I haven’t felt tears running through my face in a very long time. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I want to cry but I can’t. I’ve grown jealous of people who are able to cry. 

I guess my greatest question here is if it’s normal? And if it’s not, why is this happening to me? What can I do to feel sad and cry again?",09Sep2020,1

10,"Long post but here I go:

I met this girl online about a year ago and she’s been super loving and sweet to me.
The pandemic has done nothing but bring us closer to the point that we switched after 9 months from friends to boyfriend girlfriend
Now let’s fast forward to Saturday: My girlfriend went out with a friend the night before for the first time. She doesn’t have many friends and she was excited. She said she has an amazing time but what makes me uncomfortable is the guy she’s seeing is someone she slept with years ago. Although she was hanging with his girlfriend (who called her pretty multiple times) and him.. She asked if it was okay if they hung out and I said yes and my issue isn’t who she’s hanging out with but the fact I wanted to FaceTime my ex a month prior she blew up in my face about it. I feel there is a double standard there and there are MULTIPLE double standards in the relationship.
Ever since Saturday I’ve just been feeling completely down the drain. My GF has a couple of disorders (one of which is bipolar of the other four I can’t remember).  
On top of that my girlfriend has been seemingly distant with her text messages. While she apologizes that she hasn’t been giving me attention and she still says she’s committed to the relationship I still feel like I’m overthinking it and I keep thinking the end is eventually coming and this is the first stage towards it. I love her a lot and she says she loves me too but I worry a lot that she doesn’t. It’s gotten to the point I am starting to slack on my school work and I really need advice on what I should do. Should I talk about it to her and have a long conversation about it?


TL;DR my girlfriends been seemingly distant and ive also been feeling super depressed lately and I am starting to think these two are correlated",09Sep2020,1

12,"Hi. This is the first time I am posting something like this so publicly. I've been with my S/O for over 2 years and for the last year and a half we've been discussing my weight. (I had gained about 65lbs in the span of a year and a half.) At first, it wasn't too serious and I didn't try hard to lose it since I didn't think it was a big deal, but as time went on things became different for us. We stopped becoming intimate less and less. He than told me that it no longer felt the same since I gained weight. And since that moment we've constantly argued over it. He admitted that he would do things for himself because it was too much work to do it with me. It made me feel terrible and still does. Another thing that he said was that he didn't know if he could commit to someone who couldn't commit to a lifestyle and that hurt even more. Now I am going to the gym and participating in the keto diet and have lost 9 pounds within 2 months. And I still don't feel like I'm good enough for him anymore.

15,"...as I predicted at 8 yo. 

33yoF - I've tried so hard to make the most of life, and it seems not worth it. I've been relatively ""successful"" at life, but I don't have anyone to count on or hear my pain. Often times people have called me their best friend or mentor - a statement I'm always surprised at. I wish I had a best friend or mentor. 

I have no motivation to keep going. I thought about my mom dying today and what it would be like if she was dead. I'd be all alone - my dad already died and he was not much of a father (divorced narcissistic parents). I have a bf but he's also older and will die before me. I have no kids - a furbaby who will also die before me. I have no one...

I'm so sad. I feel like I always have to be striving for something but I'm so tired. I want to rest. I want my life to be simple. I wish I could be a bubblehead. I wish I could be on meds that make me numb or happy all the time. I wish I was a basic bit who could just be happy with whatever,  but I can't.  I don't know how to turn it off. 

I start things but never finish. I'm so afraid.  I want to be closer to God, Jesus, my mom, my friends, my family... how can I keep grinning and baring it? I think it may have to be that way. 

I had a friend who lost her partner to sujidied. He had an alc problem.  Everyone loved him and he was high functioning.  I think she tried to help him... I'm scared to tell her I feel the same way.

I want to smash my head with a hammer and cut up my face. I feel so ugly - in and out. Why can't I be nice and perfect?? Why can't this world be better?

The world keeps turning and turning and turning. And I'll have no one. How will I spend my last minutes? I want to watch that stupid Amy Schumer movie but I'm sure that will be a waste of time.

16,"Life gets hard sometimes. 

In online classes, there's three separate modes via which our attendance is taken. Even when I attend classes, I usually manage to complete 2/3 requirements. The third requirement is kind of a test that is meant to be submitted later in the day. 

I've forgotten the third requirement for the last class and I remembered at about 3 am when the submission time was 10pm the day before. Ashamed, I got out of bed quickly to do the test. They were all based on what was taught in class but I couldn't answer a single one for the life of me.

 I googled them but I still couldn't figure it out, my mind just simply stopped working. I was really upset and just chucked my phone away and at some point I fell asleep. 

All of this escaped my mind the next day. Now I've to write an email explaining why I didn't submit the test at all and I'm going to have points deducted from my marked assignment that counts toward my grade. 

I've been so disgustingly careless and I don't even know how to frame what I want to say. Saying ""sorry I won't do it again"" feels shallow and stupid but I don't want to spill my guts to him and tell him that I'm having a very hard time just trying to fucking get through the day.

17,"So, I'm a 18 year old person who is just about to go to college. I'm going to be studying engineering because my parents made me. I was okay with that because I had plans. I have always been into writing and reading since I was a child. These two were my only hobbies until last year. Last year I realized that I was also into other fields of art such as acting, directing, music. I've never had any art education. I went to a stupid school in a stupid country but I've always considered myself to be creative, I've been writing many poems, songs, short stories and screenplays since I was a child. But my biggest passion has been singing. I'm good with writing songs but when it comes to singing them I really suck. I'm so jealous of people who can sing well naturally and I feel like I'm never gonna get good at it since I lack the natural talent. So me realizing that was a huge crash. Realizing that I'm never gonna be good at what I wish to do most... then I moved on to acting, even though being an introvert and a shy person I tried working up by myself. Whenever my parents were gone, I just took online courses but I realized that I lack the talent again and people who are good at acting have been doing this since they were a child. No one's gonna be impressed from me. So I thought about writing, because I have been doing this since I was a child. Thought maybe I was good at it, and I sent some of my poems to people and they actually enjoyed but I don't imagine them being something big. Even though I'm maybe a little good at writing I'm not super good and actually passionate about it as much as I'm passionate about music and acting. I don't know what to do with my life if I cannot do what I'm so passionate about and I'd rather die than being an engineer, doing what I have zero interest in, and living a life that will bore me. I don't want to wake up cursing my life and myself. I just don't know what to do. I see that people who inspired me most were actually smart, talented people and realizing that I'm never going to be able to help other people out or inspire them upsets me a lot. I'm probably going to fail the class in college since I don't know anything about it and have zero interest in it while there are many people who have been into programming or idk that stuff for way too long.

So I turned to everything that does the moving; Music, nicotine, movies and series and each second felt more tastless than last. 


This intimate dance of devouring and revival, when does it end? I should be well adjusted by now unsurprisingly each time I'm more helpless than the last, almost like I never learnt anything, each time I'm awarded with an accolade of scars for being foolish enough to think I could prepare for it or even challenge it. 


I return to the withering church of darkness, my solace. I worship at the footsteps, asking for forgiveness for even trying, you and I destined to dance immortal, I breathe and you draw from my veins, scarlet and warm, my life solely yours and yours alone. 


Moonlight gleems my chryslasis unborn and cradled by the dark, I live in every shade of the light muddled with the dark, my divinity lies everywhere. I surrender today, I'll say my hallelujah as you maul out what's yours and stitch your new tapestry of a bloodbath.

Forgive yourself. Aknowledge your mistakes,your wrongdoings,the people you hurt,the things you said and all stuff like that accept em even if it brings you pain and once you finally stop crying over it like i myself did for hours straight,forgive yourself for them...after that if you can try to express your sadness for hurting each person if you have access be it an ex girlfriend/boyfriend be it a friend or be it someone you bullied in school.   


After you aknowledge you were a bad person or at least you were confused and lashed out just try every day to be a little better,wear a smile even if it is fake people around notice people smiling and it makes them happier too,be kind to others even if they are not to you, do not hold grudges cause they WILL RUIN YOU like me. I tried to hold a grudge on my ex for dumbing me and it killed me cause i loved her and i had an internal conflict for months till i decided to just stop holding a grudge and apologise myself for beeing as much of an ego driven bastard as she was in the end.  


  
In the end she didnt apologise herself and even tried to deliberatly hurt me more to essentially make me fuck off permanently by lying about something i already knew.( Which was calling me a mistake in her life even tho i know 110% she lied cause she loved me to death till she went pshyco mode at the end ) but i still just took it to the chin and said i loved you take care, do not try to hurt others that hurt you it will only make you the same as them and you wanna be a GOOD person not like \*THEM\* if you think about how you got mistreated just remember always... KARMA exists and KARMA gives and takes and once you really think about it you will realise yourself that it exists for some magic reason.  


Just be good and good things will come and i do not mean forcefully try to \*help\* others for a reward just be kind and be as forgiving as you can both to others and yourself cause as i mentioned grudges will only draw you deeper in that hellpit inside your head but that cuzzy feeling of love and making others happy will help you balance out your thoughts. And in the end the thing we need most in life as people with mental problems and illnesses is the a clear consience and somebody to listen/hug us..if you can't have a person at least have a clear head so you can feel more peacefull in the cold lonely nights.Nobody is perfect and you should never try to be,just be GOOD both for you and others.  


We all gonna make it out one step at the time but we also decide wether we fight it or let it consume us till we are hollow..much love to everyone struggling you are not alone and i hope you will have a peacefull night tonight.",09Sep2020,1

DID YOU EXPERIENCE The feeling of being blue, unloved or hopeless ?

***There is nothing wrong to feel that way from time to time***

In response to specific events in your life – such as a death in the family, a breakup, the loss of a job promotion or other bad incidents, we are tend to feel kind of depressed.  
These feelings often occur for ***absolutely no reason***. It can hit somebody when he is just living leading a normal life, doing nothing special and suddenly unable to function. Nothing seems to matter. The black hole in which they find themselves gets bigger and bigger every day and they can not do anything to stop it.

 **So, when does depression take full sense? Watch out these 10 symptoms that you might be ignoring.** 

 1. Persistent sadness, Anxiety, or “Empty” mood.

2. Feeling Hopeless/ Pessimist

28,"*This may be of interest to anyone who has had or is having cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).*

We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT.

We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing. 

Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like. 

Two things happened that we are pleased with:

1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions. 
2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy. 

Right now we’re really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We’d be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible.

33,"Should I feel guilty about wanting to separate from my parents?? Urgent Help please

Hey I’m 18M and will be moving to university in a few days. The thing is, once I get there, I plan on completely seperating myself from my parents who are abusive. Since I’m officially an adult now (from the UK) I can now be independent. However, I have just been feeling very confused and stressed out these past few days thinking about this. I feel like it’s a selfish decision because they’ve provided me with a lot of things to start university that I’m grateful for such as a brand new laptop and phone for uni, yet have been the biggest contributing factor in my depression and anxiety. 

Since I was 15, I would have meetings with school therapists that I would attend behind their back, cry myself to sleep a lot of nights, have panic attacks and anxiety and I’m just terrified of them now, especially my Dad. I realised at a very young age that I had no love for him, only fear/ hate. He’s a big man who is very aggressive and loud compared to me who’s very quiet and weak. My mum however, has been a mix of love and fear/hate too, especially these past few weeks. They are both also very strict. My Dad has walked out on us (me, my mum and siblings) many times these past years, especially due to abuse, yet my mum would always beg for him to come back which always confused me and angered me. A few weeks ago, he got arrested after a neighbour called the police because she could hear him beating my mum and my brother too. When this happened, I thought this would be a wake up call to my Mum to completely cut him off, me and my siblings spent countless days and nights crying and trying to convince her to separate him. And yet after all that, she still allowed him back in after he was released by the police. When she did this, I think that was when I lost the love for her. We all live under the same roof and things have been difficult for me. I try to avoid them as much as can and I can’t even look at them the same way. I’m just so tired of having to walk around egg shells 

Now my dilemma is whether I should cut them off completely or not?? I feel like I’m being selfish and ungrateful because I know they’ve done so much to raise me and provide for me, yet they’ve hurt me and fucked me over so many times and now that I’m an adult and going to university, I should take this opportunity to cut them off and finally be happy. This is one of the main reason I wanted to go to a university far away from home. 

We have this thing here in the UK called Student Finance where the government provides us with money to pay back later in life and they have given me 7k which should last me the year as I look for a part time job. My Dad even told me that once they send me my money, I should send all of it straight to him. This scares me because I know he’s already become controlling over my things again, even when he will be so far away. I really just want to be happy and have freedom and feel relaxed. I have no one else to to tell this to, any advice would be very kind thank you.",09Sep2020,1

36,"i’ve maxed out my dosage and i’m still struggling with severe depression symptoms..

so i’ve (18F) been struggling with depression since childhood and have experienced hallucinations and i struggle to remember close to half of what all even happened. but long story short i had a rough relationship with my father and a complicated relationship with my mother since birth, literally. when i turned 17 i was finally able to get prescribed an antidepressant, it was only 10mg escitalopram and it worked for me for about 5 months and then my grandmother (whom i was close to as mother and sister simultaneously) passed away from cancer. so my prescriptions increased, then the medication changed, and increased, then it changed again, and increased, by this time i was on effexor and seroquel, now i’ve maxed out the dosage (225mg effexor n 150mg seroquel) and i’m still pretty depressed and i have episodes. the place i live in has a high number of rapes and abuse against women so it isn’t really safe for me to go outside and walk to get fresh air. nowadays i really have to make myself leave the house even for my therapy appointments. but on the day to day basis i’ve been dealing with hallucinations and what my doctor says is anhedonia. regardless of my heavy medications, i’ve been making an effort to get all the help i can get from the therapy (i know i need it) but i’ve noticed i still deal with these symptoms... 


do i just kinda wait to make more progress in the therapy to reduce the hallucinations and anhedonia? 

any insight at all will definitely help, thank you
i also hope i’ve posted this on the right sub, i’m fairly new as to how everything on reddit works..",09Sep2020,1

38,"I understand my wife has a long work day. I truly feel terrible she is stressed about work. I know I need to step up more and do stuff around the house so she does not have to do them. 

Background: I am a married 28 Army Vet, going to school right now. We live with my mom whose health is not the greatest. I do my homework and I do help out my mom. But I guess I am failing as a husband by not folding our clothes, having dinner done regardless of if my mom was going to or not. Taking care of the cats more. 

I just dont know how to stop this sinking feeling that I am just a piece of sh*t.",09Sep2020,1
