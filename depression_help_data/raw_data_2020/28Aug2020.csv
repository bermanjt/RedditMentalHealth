I take care of a woman I dont love nor brings me happiness. 
With another Mistake I wanted to abort on the way.
I'm tired, I'm lost. 
I'm so angry inside I'm always screaming, I want to cry but I can't push anything out.
I dont want to be in this world anymore but I can't leave these people alone but me, I'm just soo so tired. 
Everytime I try to talk about it I get told I'm fine or roll their eyes at me.

4," I need to discuss certain serious issues with a therapist that I can't share with my spouse, my friends, and certainly my family. The only problem is that I am afraid I will be 5150'd if I open up and I am not willing to lose my rights, my  job which provides stability, and I definitely don't want my family to treat me different (because they will and it will make dealing with them more stressful than it is.) 
Is there some kind of licensed therapist you can see where you still have total anonymity and won't be taken away into custody if you suffer from suicide ideation?

5,Today I’m getting a reality check starting to realize just how alone I am and how much of a good actor I am even when I want people to see how I’m hurting my body won’t let me give up the act and I’m starting to realize just how alone I am that I have people to talk to about video games but not for help the only person I went to for help now wants nothing to do with me and I don’t blame him because he knows that I feel like i’m empty inside he knows I got all this built-up anger from when I was a child he also knows that something as simple as a line from a TV show will make me spiral and the only people who actually show me that they care I messed it up and make him leave because at the end of the day I help other people because I can’t help myself and I know this is all over the place and the worst thing for reading but this is how my brain is right now I got 1 million things going through my head so fast that to concentrate on this is really hard and that’s why this is all over the place there’s no periods no grammar I guess what I’m really asking for is someone to help me,28Aug2020,1
6,"I haven't been to a doctor since i was a child.
As an adult how do I talk to a new doctor about the years of feeling Anxious and Depressed without feeling overwhelmed and breakingdown and crying? (Like picture a crying 2 year old trying to explain what's wrong but it comes out sounding like gibberish)

Any tip to help keep calm and explain things in a calm manner? I want to get help, i just don't want to waste the doctor's time.

I'm so scared I'll just be written off or told I'm faking it. Like if i can't vocalize it would note form work, I've never been good at vocalizing problems.",28Aug2020,1
7,"As title states how do you keep the mask on? It’s the calm before the storm time for me. Can’t afford to get a place stuck living with ex and her husband for almost 3 years now. Have a decent job with chances of moving up have watch many other come and go while in same position now I am the bosses bitch as I say. Don’t make more than the lowest paid position yet I have been “training” to be a different position that isn’t happening now he saying he moving me up and then today another new hire drops off tools in the only open area. Have been in another person work area while they have been getting hip and knee surgery supposed to come back Tuesday and that leave me without a work area. Again the bosses bitch with no idea of my job standing. He was informed that I’ve been thinking of leaving he told that person that he didn’t want to lose me.   And here I am in limbo!  Patience and loyalty is what I was taught growing up. I am loyal almost to a fault maybe more. 
You could say I got more love than I should’ve prior to starting school. I am pretty anti social. I get burned out from socializing fairly quick and when I do people tend to not pay attention they start playing on phones or doing something else. To the point where I can stop talking mid sentence wait  a minute and they don’t notice.  I am hearing impaired to the point where I can’t understand my kids most of time and have to really focus I mean really focus to understand people. I know I mumble it bound to be with my hearing but FUCK people don’t understand what it’s like to struggle so hard just to have a conversation. It’s been getting to me so bad I wish I was a mute.  Have never thought of killing myself but the thought of dying seems so peaceful.  I’m not a picture person at all so I can’t plan or contemplate. I thank my kids for being a full block on doing such a thing. But damn it sounds so peaceful almost as much as not talking ever again to be able to stop the struggle of trying to carry a conversation with others.  I walk around work for the last 2 week in pain from joints hurting with no feelings no anger or real happiness just working on something to keep busy. That’s when I realize that it’s the calm before the storm again. The problem is I am scared of this storm. This is not any  calm I’ve experienced before the storm hits. I’ve been quick to get mad with my kids and that’s what hurts the most. Makes the going mute better. I rather not talk at all then be angry and yelling at them. 
One thing that has helped I think is running everyday. Then  I broke or badly bruise a joint in the toe next to the pinky that took a month before I stopped noticing the pain. Started running again about 6 months later and started to get planters fasciitis all when this COVID 19 started to blow up and gyms shut down. I’d run at lunch only time I could keep consistent. 

And here we are now approaching the storm with all my tools down. Can’t justify the $ to buy running shoes mine are at least 4-5 years old and ripping on the side.  Been preparing to sell everything off to help pay bills and maybe put some away to fix my car which looks like it’s a motor so it’s expensive about $9k if a dealer installed a brand new one yup not happening. Was trying to back up all my photos in iCloud so I try to sell my phone my keys got stuck again so I thought. I smacked the keyboard in anger(still mad at myself) and somehow managed to break my glasses not the lenses the ear thingys that keep them on your face.  I’m near sighted so fuck work gonna get harder with a lot. They help me a lot with glare. Anger isn’t helping anymore. The keyboard was destroyed soon after. Good thing was it only 10$ at Walmart but yeah I’m gonna need my glasses. Have  a wireless 1 but it disconnects a lot. Ima nerd only play Minecraft and no way am I playing with a keyboard that may cause a irrational anger and break atheism computer.  Honestly think it’s been at least 5 years since I’ve thrown a controller or keyboard. Not good very bad. 

And top it off my ex fired shots at my parenting after I told her I obviously fucked up as a parent cause my oldest is in honors taking college courses and her mom yelled at her cause her sister is missing classes. She was following the printed schedule and the school changed it. Here the kicker her mom don’t leave for work till around 2. But she takes off or goes into her room to do her college course. All while my daughter has to make sure her 2 sisters and her brother are doing their online classes. WTF!!!!
(still online school at the time being doing cheer tryouts which her mom told me she quit cause time wasn’t there only to find out she keeping her because they have to wear a face mask. She’s almost as stupid as her anti vax sister. )  

I know what I’m worth. I don’t think it’s much but what I can do is always valuable just not enough to pay or treat with the respect I try to give. 

So horrible rant in every direction all pointing to not being able to keep my mask on. It’s been getting harder everyday. I tend to overthink things and a lot of times I tell myself that I’m overthinking yet it’s all going where I kinda projected. Had some money that would fix my car but everyone told me it has to be something small so I went that route spent way too much too be in the same spot with no idea what wiring till I can try and pull the motor then find out I’m fucked with. 

Don’t expect anything from anyone here or in person.

9,"I’m a 17 year old teen and have been pretty depressed for about 2 and a half years. About a year ago I spoke up and started therapy and since then I’ve been to three therapists—with the third and current one finally listening to my requests of getting meds and prescribing me zoloft. Obviously, my mom had to approve since I’m a minor and all, and was uncomfortable at my excitement which was shared by the rest of my family. They say I shouldn’t be so hopeful for medication and that it isn’t a holy grail. I know logically it’s not, but I’m so hopeless and tired of feeling so terrible all the time, I’ve tried so many vitamins and supplements and exercise remedies and I just want something to make me feel better for longer than two weeks.

Is it bad to want antidepressants? Am I being close minded for wanting them? A part of me wants them to cure everything but I know I’ll have to step up and start exercising and eating right again, but I’m hoping medication can give me the push to get out of bed and to just want things in life again. Is that even how antidepressants work?",28Aug2020,1

11,"I feel so hopeless. Everything is starting to fall apart, and now, I can't afford not to care anymore.

Right now, I'm losing the few friends I have, I have no money, and I'm living on my girlfriend's couch.

I try so hard to do something or eat or get out of bed (couch?), but I just can't. There's this suffocating feeling of dread, nihilism, and existential problems that just destroy my will to do anything. And I can't find a way out.

And so everybody just sees me as this lazy disappointment. My mom has given up on me, and so have most of my friends. It doesn't help my already bad self-esteem.

So everything combined has just turned me into this hollow, empty body.

There are times where I try desperately to find something to do or get rid of these feelings but I can't because I'm always tired and lethargic. I can't sleep and just lay alone on the couch staring out the window.

I'm always feeling like shit and looking like shit and I feel so lonely. I've tried to read and work out, but it just won't work. I try getting drunk to lessen it but it still won't go away. I want to tell the people I know, but chances are they'll think it's my lazy excuse for being lazy, and everyone would think I'm going to make some joke out of it because I'm the comedian of my group. And I just can't find the light.

I've done what I can but now nothing appeals to me anymore. I don't know what to do. Therapy didn't help. Alcohol didn't help. I've contemplated suicide a few times, but it hurts me too much knowing that my selfish actions would hurt other people. So I'm just suffering through this hell and nobody knows.

17,"Hi I'm new with reddit. Sorry if my English is bad.

I get sad easily and cry over it even if it's just a small thing. I'm 16 and i lost my pen my mother bought for me after finding out it was my brothers who used the pen and lost it, i got mad and shouted at them. My parents got mad at me for shouting at them. My parents think I'm just a spoiled child and ""not normal."" I can hear them talk about it in their room at night. That night i just  sit infront of our door because me and my brothers share the same room. When i was younger i did experience being spoiled being noticed in simple things I've done. Until my brothers were born. I get the less attention because I'm older and showing my parents what i achieve is like nothing to them. They bought my brothers phone a computer while i have to wait 4 birthdays to get mine with my savings those years.
I am not mad at my brothers i know it's not their fault that they get all the attention because they're younger than me. I just don't get it why my parents would consider me ""not normal."" Since i was 12 years old it was hard for me to talk to my relatives because they're thinking of the things my parents told them about me being ""not normal."" My brother also lied to my relatives that i was abusive towards them even tho i don't eben interact with them. I just ahouted at them today. I just cursed them today. Just because of a pen my mother bought me. Thinking about that still makes me tear up idk why. I do have friends in real life but they're not really interested in helping me with my emotions because they think I'm just being ""dramatic."" It's hard being the eldest son. I still haven't slept in the right time because the guilt keeps me up until morning.


Until today they still treat me like a stranger to the family. It's hard to speak to relatives even if it's from my father's side. I don't hate them for doing this to me.
Tbh i hate myself for being not normal for them.
I'm sorry if this post sounds like a none normal person would do.

Today is weird. I feel weird. I want to do nothing. At all. I don't even want to be awake. It is worse than I usually feel like. The last few days have been off as well but today seems to be the worst so far.  
I slept 6 hours during the day yesterday and 12 hours last night. Ridiculously long. Feel weak, tired, dizzy. Scared. Eating is disgusting for me at the moment.

21,"I don't wanna seem like a person asking for attention because I tend to just tell someone a little bit then stop talking about it after a while. This is because of my previous relationship in which my ex was extremely depressed and it caused me to be very mentally unstable but I still doubt whether I really have it or not. 

The relationship ended because I said questionable things that made her hate me. I feel so much guilt about it and other than  that, school really stresses me out. My memories are unclear on what I've done because I was extremely homesick, having to move to a different continent. I'm not sure if it was my constant complaining that set her off, or because she just had her problems and couldn't take on mine.

But that isn't what I'm supposed to be talking about. I wanna ask if I'm really depressed because I'm afraid to tell my parents that I feel like it because I'm always laughing and smiling around them.

I'm an extremely ""happy"" person, atleast on the outside. Whenever I'm with people I'm always smiling, telling jokes and enjoy myself around them. But when I'm alone I feel so tired, I feel so empty, and I feel like the worst person in the world because of how I've affect someone who I really cared for. 

I still enjoy my hobies like playing video games, drawing, singing but I feel so empty still. After I've had a good time, I still feel constantly sad and fatigued. I'm never motivated to study, but I manage to push through. I don't like talking to people online, because I constantly think I'm too awkward to create a proper conversation but I don't know how to tell those people that I don't hate them.

Because I feel happy when I talk to my family, or talk to friends from home and still enjoy a few things, I feel like I'm just faking it because I'm not diagnosed of any mental illnesses though I never really go to doctors anyway. I hate myself but I still think I'm better than some people, I don't want to live but I don't wanna die either. 

I feel like I'm such a bad fake person. I'm not even sure if what I feel is real anymore. Am I really depressed? I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but is this what people feel like?",28Aug2020,1

28,"As a disclaimer, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in. I'm really new to this and I'm just looking for advice. I haven't been diagnosed with depression myself but I really want to help someone who has been, and when I try to look things up on Google I can't find the answers I need. 

My mom has been diagnosed with MDD and her psychiatrist says there is a bipolar aspect to it (I'm not really sure what that means though). I know that she is on medication and has to take sleeping pills because she struggles with insomnia as one of her symptoms. She recovered from a long depressive episode when I was little, and she was not in the house for a while, so I have trouble remembering what she was like. I want to talk to her and be there for her but it's been almost 6 months since her depressive episode started and I'm feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted, and so is my dad. I'm a sophomore and school is starting soon, and my dad has been working and shopping and doing most things around the house since my mom can't really do anything anymore. I only want the best for her and I want her to feel better soon, but I really have no idea how she feels because it's hard for her to have clear thoughts on things sometimes. I used to be so close to her but now she is a totally different person and I'm scared because I'm getting used to this. I don't want to be selfish at a time when my mom is struggling, but being with her every moment of every day and seeing how her depression has pretty much eaten up her life and personality is taking a serious toll on my mental health as well. I've been trying to just act like everything is normal but my mom hasn't had a good day in almost half a year and I'm so worried that I might not be doing enough. If anyone has any advice on how to take care of a loved one during a depressive episode while also taking care of yourself and others, it would be greatly appreciated.",28Aug2020,1

There's not much point leaving the house, because there's nothing here for me. I've literally tried just driving trying to find inspiration- nothing.

32,"I hate owning this personality, I hate being me. I HATE being ME. I'm tired of people always picking at my negative personality traits. I'm tired of being forgetful. I'm tired of not having any energy. I'm tired of being so awkward. I'm tired of being mocked. I'm tired of being scared. I'm tired of being unreliable. I'm tired of feeling like a target! I'm just tried of being me!

I can't do anything right. I always screw up... And there is always someone there to make fun of me for it. I'm always joining in with others when they make fun of my personality because I know it's all true, I know I'm pathetic. I know I'm dramatic. I know I forget a lot of things. I know I don't have a long attention span. I know I try too hard in the wrong ways. I know I have a dull personality. I know people think my sense of humor is too dry and random... I know I'm not funny! I know I'm too sensitive. I know all of this! Yet people just sit there and laugh about how pathetic I am. I hate it. I hate being me. 

Ever since I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2010, I've made it my life goal to get over my social anxiety so I can be a nurse! Some people don't even believe that I was once a selective mute! THAT'S how far I've come. I've been working so hard to reach that level with my social skills, but it's still not enough for others... I'm still scared. I'm still scared of speaking. So much so that I just can't remember things. The fear and worry fill up my mind, making it impossible to learn and retain new information. 

I even have a JOB. That's how determined I am to succeed. My therapist told me that if I thought I could take on a job, that I should do it. But that if I was still too scared, that it would be alright to work some things out before getting a job. I jumped straight into it! And it freaking worked! I can initiate in conversations, deal with with hate from strangers, and have relationships. But since all of the work was done in silence, no one ever knew about how much progress I had made on myself.

Well, today I told my coworker that I was working towards becoming a nurse when she asked me what I was going to go to school for. She laughed... Then she raised her eyebrows and said, ""Wow! Really!? OP? You? A nurse? Really?"" It was shocking to hear it from my coworker since I thought we were friends to a certain extent. She looked surprised with herself when she said it, like it just word-vomited out on accident. My face kinda dropped and I said, ""Well, yeah. I'm saving up for nursing school right now and will hopefully be there in a couple of years."" She just kinda turned away...

I know my coworkers talk behind my back. They talk behind everyone's back, well, only the people who they deem dumb... And there are some people who just flatout wish I would quit. 

My boss knows I'm a hard worker. She knows I'm doing my best and working hard to make my best even better. But my coworkers just like to bag on me right in front of me. And it's really hard. I already hate myself and have lost a lot of friends because they hate how scared I am all of the time... 

Why can't I just have normal social skills... Why can't I retain everything I learn instead of forgetting it like I scared kid on stage in the spotlight? I just hate me...",28Aug2020,1
33,"So I'm 27F and I'm extremely self aware. I watched my relationship crumble in front of me daily because of my depression but never did anything to stop it. I have severe PTSD after watching my sister die when I was 13 and my triggers and flare ups always happen around July 1st, when my sister died. This is the one time that I have not been able to shake out of it. 

I cry all the time. I had told my boyfriend numerous times that I needed help but despite him trying to help me, I never accepted it because I truly felt terrible that he felt it was his responsibility. I pushed him away without meaning to and now he is gone. I have tried talking to him and he keeps saying that he needs time to think about it logically, away from me. 

I dont know what to do. I have been pacing my house since he left two days ago. I havent slept. I havent eaten. Everytime I look out in my driveway and see our car, that he always had when he was here, I cry some more because he isnt driving it anymore. I cant listen to music because it reminds me of him. I cant go in my room because thats ""our"" space and it holds too many memories. I have been laying on the couch, watching disney movies because it's the only thing we didnt watch together. 

I cant tell if I am being illogical because I was so extremely depressed before he left but now it's easily 20x worse. To a point where my mom, who lives out of state, is driving 76 hours to my home because she called me and my voice worried her.
