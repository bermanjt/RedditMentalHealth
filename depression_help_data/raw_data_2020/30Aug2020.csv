2,So I'm 13 and I don't know how to tell my parent I have depression. I really do want help cause I don't want to waste my whole life dealing with it. I feel miserable every single day. Any advice? I love my parent very much and idk how to break the news to them.,30Aug2020,1
3,"I’m just another redditor in the seas of depressed. Writing something that little will see.
I don’t see any reason to keep doing this, my life has no genuine fun, no genuine love, no appreciation.
Everything I do makes me believe in myself less and less. My grades from middle to now junior of high school went from As to Bs to Cs to Ds. I study 3 hours a day and do all of my homework just to get graded on public speaking skills and busywork when I’m nearly sleepless in the morning despite getting 90th percentile on standardized tests.

All of my hobbies have just made my self-esteem worse. I want to learn languages but my memory is bad. I want to get really good at video games but my reaction times and problem solving is bad. I want to learn to code, but I’m dumb and can’t even decide where to start with ADD making me switch from language to language within days and dropping hobbies or picking it back up every few weeks. I’ve tried to play instruments, I have bad hand eye coordination and my lungs are weak, I also can’t read music well because I’m stupid.

I have no friends, no appreciative family besides my mom, who I see 20 minutes a day.
My dad doesn’t believe in mental health and says therapists just want me to get addicted to pills. My teachers misunderstand me when I ask for mental help.  Besides how do I know the help will do anything at this point. Even if I get prescribed some shit I’m still gonna be a failure with the illusion that my brain is happy, when my being isn’t. And besides I will get constantly judges by my peers and my family if I do so.

I want love in life, I want people who make things fun, I genuinely don’t think I would ever consider myself generally happy since around 3rd or 4th grade. Have not had any mutual and real friends since then or at least middle school. Why would anyone want to be around a sad sack of shit who has no notable qualities?
Another week goes by and I wonder how long I can take this. When does it become too much? Will things ever actually change for the better or is that something the schools and corporation say to avoid lawsuits of mental illness? I feel like a speck to the world, it passes by me, and there is no real reason I am here. What to do?",30Aug2020,1
4,"i’ve been seeing a therapist for ~8 months now. 
sometimes i feel like it’s helped but honestly, i think it’s made me come off as a more optimistic person than before. but deep down i still struggle so much with my thoughts. 
life in particularly has been much much harder the past 2 months and it has brought so much change. and my home life has been difficult for a little over half my life. 
it’s been really tough and i just feel so horrible and i want to run away and be alone or just quit life but i can’t do that. 
i’m 20 yrs old btw. i want to try to seek a psychiatrist because maybe it’ll be a better approach towards my thoughts and head. but how do i know that it’s right for me? therapy is alright but i don’t think it’s been helping me. how do i confront my therapist about that too? i feel bad leaving her. she does give good advice and i appreciate and like her.",30Aug2020,1
5,"**My best friend struggle**s with severe depression and has a history of mental illness in his family. He has lost relatives to suicide and right now he is planning on taking his life. He told me just recently and I don't know what to do. Apparently some of our other friends and his parents have known for months and they have been trying to help him but there isn't anything we have been able to do to convince him. I just don't know what to do. He said he's thought this out for months and he's completely calm and rational and he's okay with it. He just doesn't find a reason to find joy in life and I don't get his reasons and I think its bullshit. My friends have made peace with it. He has a day planned and he won't tell us when but he told me it would be after we had a going away college party for our friend so it's going to be 2 weeks maybe. I don't know what I can do at this time. His therapist and family know and there isn't anything we can do about it.

Would it be possible to get him committed to a mental hospital or something? Is there anything I can do to get him help even though he doesn't want it. He's always struggled with depression and has been suicidal before but I have never seen him so calm and collected when talking about it which worries me. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Anything I can do to help him because I am going insane knowing what he has planned and feeling powerless to stop it.",30Aug2020,1
7,"It’s been about 9 months since I’ve confessed to you about my problems and issues. BUT YOU’VE SOMEHOW MADE IT FUCKING WORSE, you should have realized by now that your method of being a parent is utter trash. 

It’s only now that you are trying to be the mother I needed when I want to be away from you. Because 8 hours of studying on weekends with no breaks in between is not hard working enough for you. You must be so stressed that your child isn’t doing well in school, you must be so stressed you won’t have a secure future.

Nothing is ever good enough is it? When will you learn? At least dad is rational and supportive while trying to discuss my future. But you on the other hand, “Are you doing well in math?” , “How is school coming along?” , “You don’t have to study abroad, you can just stay here and help us since you’re not doing well in school, that’ll at least secure your future”.

I’ve discussed with her that I want to do digital art and work with animations, my dad supported me and ordered me a Wacom for me as soon as he heard so. He even heard I was gay and told me that he’ll support me no matter what. 

But with my mom, it’s a lot of “Hey, go to the gym with your guy friends and try to start liking girls again.” There is a fucking reason why I didn’t want to tell you, IT’S BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY SOME BULLSHIT ABOUT THIS.

You really think I don’t know what I want? You really think you know more about me even though you shut me off for 3 years? You are not the person I want to call my mother, not if you act this way.",30Aug2020,1
8,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit, but it felt like a better place to go than generic question subreddits. 

My mom has depression and fibromyalgia, fibromyalgia being a chronic illness that causes about a million different things (pain, fatigue, *depression*, basically anything that is considered horribly debilitating). She has been depressed and sick for years now, the worst of it starting when I was 13, and getting progressively worse up until now (I’m now 18). 

She does have a counselor that she sees regularly. She has a husband who is an asshole. She has lost her job because she couldn’t work consistently. We have bills that we can’t even come close to paying. Meanwhile, we have things like taxes and bankruptcy and god knows what else piling up on our shoulders, things that she needs to get done but can’t even seem to come close to doing. 

She’s very suicidal. She’s said things to me about it. Wanting to die. Wanting to not exist. 

I am not the most loving person. I’ve gotten very frustrated with her because she has, in the last few years, been unable to be a mother. She’s too focused on herself and her pain and life to focus on me, and I get that. But I can’t live up to her expectations. She wants me to always be positive and never say anything that makes her upset, which is almost everything. She takes everything personally and everything as a criticism. 

I’m moving out very soon, a year earlier than I should be, so I don’t know why I even bother asking, but does anyone have any advice, or a way to look at things? I want to stop being angry at her for being depressed, because I know it’s not right. I know. I know. I know. I can’t puppeteer her into taking care of herself and her life. I can’t make her do anything. All I can seem to do is watch helplessly.",30Aug2020,1
9,"Hey all. I’ve been mulling on this for some time, and it feels more comfortable to do it online.

I’m 17 years old, and I’m getting to that stage in life where I’m expected to have a job, drive, have a girlfriend, etc.

However, over the past 2 or so weeks, I’ve been feeling depressed every night because I can’t stop thinking about how I’m getting older and I’m gonna start losing my grandparents soon. My father’s father passed away before I was born, so I never met him, but in my 17 years not one of my grandparents that are still alive have passed away. 

I’m someone who gets easily attached to people, and I love and care about my grandparents so much. I can’t stop worrying about them, and how much of a mess I’ll become when they’re gone. They’re such a staple in my life and the idea of not being able to interact with them has been killing me every night. 

On top of that, it ends up spreading to worrying for my parents. I know they’ve got some time but I still worry so much for my mental health and what could happen when they pass. 

I’m not gonna claim I’m depressed, I know I’m not, but my mental health can be shaky at times. I need some help with this problem because I’m worried I’ll fall apart at some point.

TW: Mention of Suicidal Thoughts; Mention of Substance Abuse

I've struggled on and off with my depression, a lot of it being generated from anxiety and existentialism, for a long time it fed off of hard dips in self-esteem. I would deal with a lot of highs and lows from 18-21 and during those later years it was less turbulent but when I was up I was UP and when I was down it would feel like I wouldn't be able to come back up at times but I've held on to not leaving my parents behind or my goals unfinished/unattempted. 

My 21st year was probably the longest year, I'd managed to more-or-less become the person I'd hoped I'd be when I was in high school but a lot of the happiness I forced into my life fizzled away and I just worked through it and focused on work and tried to remain unphased by more of the lows. It worked every now and then but I would find myself on edge a lot and if I wasn't on an emotional high it felt like sleepwalking at times. Just sorta present, not quite as stinging as a spiral but energy was just gone for days at a time even if I was doing my normal routines. Then I got out of a short term relationship that got toxic fast and my life spiraled for a few months. I spent the summer drinking and avoiding numbness by being drunk and if I wasn't drunk I was working with friends on personal projects. I started smoking too; I remained energetic and was able to keep a smile if I could do either one throught the day. I had applied to get my MFA and killed time basically killing my liver with other friends who graduated undergrad with me. When I finally decided to move and start grad school I stopped drinking for the sake of my body (but mostly my wallet) and that's when the internal noise came back. I was numb in a new city and I was alone. I would go to the movies by myself a lot to distract myself and get swept up in something other than me. But eventually, I started the worst spiral of depression I've ever experienced. I've had suicidal thoughts before but I've been able to reach out and take advantage of resources, this time I was so isolated and overwhelmed that it really drained me. I felt so physically tired and a lot of my resistance I had in previous years got worn down by the trauma of the last relationship I'd been in. I was up a creek without much of a paddle.

Fast forward a year later after some months of therapy, hard work building a new support system, regaining some good habits, and working on understanding myself I feel like I've grown and certainly made progress and had more of a stable state of mind. But I find myself lower on energy (not even in relation to the pandemic) and nostalgic for what happiness/joy feels like. I feel like I won't spiral because I have my tools and tougher skin to help keep me afloat when things are bad but a lot of my hope and optimism is gone. Like a battery that can't hold more than a 60% charge or something. I've stopped thinking anything good will happen to me. Intimate relationships feel foreign now, so they rarely happen for me beyond one or two close friends. People trusting me feels like part of a daydream at times so I just mimic trust but sharing anything about my past without apprehension. 

I feel like I'm moving without direction beyond career goals and as I'm moving I'm losing steam. I just feel like when I'm not actively doing something that requires my full attention that I'm just LOSING energy and peace of mind. How do I regain any of this? How do I regain genuine hope and joy? Is an absence of joy/excitement/genuine enthusiasm common after gaining stability common?",30Aug2020,1
14,"She comes to me a lot because she gets anxious because of stuff on the news and things like that. I try to help her as much as I can but I really don't know what to say. I tell her to try to distract herself from it and distance herself from the news so it doesn't upset her, but she comes to me a lot and I don't want to just repeat myself all the time because I don't know what to say. What other advice can I give her?",30Aug2020,1
15,"Really just venting here for the most part. Earlier today I felt it creeping in to my head. That feeling of numbness to everything around me. The feeling of I don’t care anymore. With the momentary flashes of sadness and anger here and there. I keep trying to fight it, because I’ve done it before. But fuck this shit is hard. Between family problems starting to really catch on fire, and the dread of never being able to live a normal life again due to covid, it’s just a fuck ton. There are so many things in my life I’m happy with, and so many things that I truly can’t deal with anymore. 
I’m a grown ass adult and my family has the strangest mentality when it comes to what they think I should be responsible for. Basically their problems aren’t mine, and accepting that has been insanely hard and overwhelming. I truly don’t feel I have a family outside of my mom and grandma. And even my mom is a little iffy at times.
I’m out of a job due to the pandemic and freaking out everyday about how I’m going to be able to pay my rent and keep a roof over my head, or keep the IRS from coming after me for the taxes that I owe but can’t afford to pay. 
I keep thinking that maybe it’ll be back to normal next year, and it’s really hitting me now that it’s not. This pandemic will likely be around for years and possibly the rest of my life. 
So many things I do when feeling this way are inaccessible. I can’t go to get food or coffee. I can’t go try on clothes at a store. I can’t hit up one of my friends and spend time with them just talking shit in my car. 
It’s not that I feel alone by any means, but rather like there’s nothing to look forward to. There’s no drive. 
I have classes coming up, so that helps to some degree, but then there’s the fear that I’ll be running out of money soon, and having to find a job to accommodate that same school schedule but also work full time in order to make ends meet. 
Anyway, I ordered a doll from Switzerland today that I spent more money than I should have on given my current financial situation, but hey, it’s a small amount of joy and something to look forward to. That’s gotta be worth more than the $200 I spent, right?
I’m gonna keep fighting, I know the life I want. I know what I want out of life in the next few years. I know some of the things I want to do. None of this necessarily in order to achieve happiness, but rather to feel content in the life I’ll make for myself. I’m just trying my best to look forward to the next happy moment I’ll experience. I don’t know what it is, but it will come",30Aug2020,1
16,"I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and the little free time I have is completely wasted. I spend the majority of it sleeping, watching YouTube, eating junk food and constantly refreshing the same four social media sites on my phone. As soon as the weekend hits, I don't shower or brush my teeth until Monday morning. I feel disgusting.

I make plans to go for a walk, get some chores done, do some artwork, and I never do any of it. I oversleep and then take naps on top of it. I can set 10 alarms to get up at a somewhat decent time and I turn all of them off. I tried persistent alarms that make you shake your phone or do a puzzle, and I end up completing the task and then going right back to sleep. It feels like I blink and the weekend is over. Then I spend the rest of the weekdays trying to fix my screwed up sleeping schedule. I'm usually too tired to do anything after work and end up falling asleep.

Chores have been slipping, my laundry piles up into a mountain. When I finally get it done if sits unfolded in the laundry basket for days while dirty laundry gets piled up into another mountain in a corner. I used to be an artist but I haven't been able to draw in over 5 years now. I've been seeing doctors and I constantly bring up my lack of motivation and energy. I've had my meds switched around numerous times and I've seen little to no difference. I try to go for a walk every evening but I've been too tired to go the last few weeks. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I'm just so tired.... of being tired. People just keep saying to me, ""Try exercise!"" ""Just force yourself to do things!"" But that's the issue in the first place, I can't get myself up to do anything. It's a constant battle which leaves me exhausted. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to consider abusing stimulants just give myself a bit of a boost. Please feel free to toss any advice my way.",30Aug2020,1
17,"So everyday I sit in my office and I see people with sever depression, of all ages. We talk and work together and I’ve seen amazing results. However, Idk why but I’m starting to realize I’ve been pushing my own depression to the side.

It runs in my family nearly everyone I’ve found out. When I was 18 I saw a therapist for the first time and I hated it so that stopped after 3 sessions. Now I’m feeling so so down and realizing what I’ve done to myself. 

I wake up with cigarettes and coffee, won’t eat or maybe will eat a shitty meal once in a day, I run on 3-4 hours of sleep on a good day, I can’t clean, or fix things that definitely need to be changed. But most importantly I’m losing my will to do anything positive outside of work. I’ve come to despise social events, being with people, family, or even hearing people’s voices. I’m as irritable as can be and what once have me some satisfaction for a bit is now dry and dull. I’m disgusting and I feel it. I see no brighter future with the person I’ve become and heading towards being years from now. Everything in this moment suddenly became worthless. 

Idk what to do or think anymore. I’m sorry for the rant, i know it’s not really bad but I do know this feeling is dark and has always been here. Thanks for reading if you did. There’s so much more I don’t want to go into detail about but that’s the gist",30Aug2020,1

19,"I've been severely depressed for over a year now, and it doesn't seem to end.

My family treats me like shit, when I was younger, they nicknamed me every name you can think of, ""stupid"" ""retard"" ""waste"", My dad used to abuse me physically (stopped when I was around 15) and still does purposefully find something to blame and SCREAM at me for, just anything. He just hates to see me not in distress or just feel like a normal 18 yr old. He blames me for everything that's happened to our family and he never takes any of the blame himself. He ran our family bankrupt (1mil USD in debt) and he says it's because he has to pay for my schooling, not any of my siblings, just me. My mum needs to be put in a psychiatric hospital, she's even more insane than my dad. I hate my family, but there's nothing I can do about that.

My brother bullied the shit out of me and used to slam me around the house and steal all my money. I can't do shit about it because... he's my brother, who will I report to that won't make him turn even more against me.

I can't escape from the hellhole that I'm in because we have no money so here I am, 18 yrs old, I haven't even gotten my A-level grades yet, because my dad can't pay for it, so no university, no future, no nothing. What can I even do? Whenever I earn money, I always have to pay the house bills. 

My parents won't ever get a job and they're too lazy to do jack about my future, I've been extremely close to suicide for so long now. My mum once walked in on me holding a knife that my dad once used to threaten me with ( when I was younger)  and she didn't even care, I mean, imagine seeing your kid holding a knife on his wrist with tears in his eyes and just walking away... They don't care about my future, and I can't have anything, I want to escape but everything doesn't want me to... I just want to die.

20,"Today - almost 3 months after my girlfriend (21F) left me I (21M) found out she cheated on me and is now with the guy she cheated on me with.

I thought she was the one, I had lived with her for 2 years before she left me and I had to leave our flat. We had planned a future then suddenly out of no where she left me and refused to talk to me at all now almost 3 months later I find out she's with another guy who she cheated on me with and I feel absolutely broken, I genuinly think I an the sadest person alive and I don't think I will ever recover.

 I've thought about her every day since she left and did everything I could to help her out, leaving a load of my stuff at the flat so she didn't have to buy stuff I.e pots and pans and stuff (which I needed because I'm a student and it was me who bought them) and she owes me £125 which she is refusing to give me and unfortunately I have no proof i lent it her but if it was the other way round i would have gave it her instantly and she knows that.

I've been so lonely and depressed since she left and finding this out has made me feel immeasurably worse and I can't even bring myself to get out of bed, this is honestly the worst thing that has ever happened to me and I don't think I will ever get over it, I know a lot of people especially older people think 'well your only 21 there's plenty more fish in the sea' or whatever but the fact I'm 21 means I was living with her for 10% of my entire life so if anything I think it's worse.

 I'm absolutely devastated and to make it worse I had a work placement as part of my degree in another country and I turned it down because she asked me to so we could carry on living together and not 1 month later she leaves for someone else. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to get experience that would have really helped my degree and future career as well as paid me a substantial wage for a student.

I'm sorry for my poor English, I'm Dyslexic also I wrote things down as they came to me so it's a bit fragmented, sorry, also just to add - before I was with her I felt depressed for 5 years but when I met her I got much much better and was happy and since she's left it's so much worse than it used to be

TLDR: So yeah, my whole life is ruined, I've lost the girl I love, who I had plans with and found out she cheated on me after I turned down a once in a lifetime opportunity for her and now I'm immensely lonely and depressed and can't bring myself to get out of bed",30Aug2020,1

I struggle a lot with feeling like I never fit in anywhere. It seems that everywhere I go everyone else has an easy time making friends and it’s very hard for me. I’m 22 and I never went off to college like everyone else because I stayed in my hometown. I stayed in my hometown because I thought my abusive boyfriend (ex boyfriend now) really loved me and I knew he would break up with me if I left for college. So I never got to have the college experience and a part of me feels like I would have learned to make friends if I left. 

My life is so sad that last year my family through me a surprise birthday party which was fun up until my sister said “yeah we were gonna invite your friends, but you really didn’t have any for us to invite” so I cut the party short and went home and cried the rest of the night. I mean she was right, I only have one friend and she was gone at college at the time. 

Everyone at my current job doesn’t like me solely based around the fact that I’m quiet and people take that as me “being miserable”. They also don’t like me because I refuse to work double shifts. I can’t work doubles because I will literally go insane. That place really amplifies my depression and I just need to be away from there sometimes. 

I’m also going thought a bit of a life crisis, I don’t know what I want to do with my life. It seems everyone has a calling except for me. I thought nursing was mine, but now I’m starting to think otherwise. I’m also starting to realize that to live is to work nearly everyday of your life until you die and I don’t want that.

29,"I'm a 34m This year has been hard. I know it has been for pei much everyone but mine feels especially bad. 

I almost died in January from a freak blood vessel bleeding out in my stomach. Still don't know why but doctors say I'm fine. 

I'm switching careers and it's difficult. I have to keep myself on track and focused. Between depression and add and the modern world, I just feel stuck. 

I'm the heaviest I've ever been at 300lbs. (I'm almost 6'5"" so I don't look huge) but I feel like fat. I used to be very healthy and and active and I miss that. 

I have been mentally preparing to try to take on a fairly intense workout challenge called 75 hard. 

I chose this one because it's fairly flexible on how you do things. It just stipulates that you hit every bullet point, every day, for 75 days. If you miss a day or miss a bullet point, you start over at day 1. I don't have access to a full gym atm, so most of it would be body weight workouts and bike rides. 

I asked my wife of she'd help me on the diet side. I have a diet a resort to when I need to buckle down. She does the grocery shopping, so I asked her to get stuff that I want for this diet and specifically asked her to forgo any sort of sugar or treats. She'll usually get me cookies or chocolate milk or something. Sugar is my biggest weakness without a doubt. 

She is completely unwilling to support our encourage me through this. She thinks I'm being careless with my health, mental and physical. 

Aside from my career change, I feel fully unchallenged in life, and it's killing me. I want to do something freaking hard. Not doing regular challenging things makes me unmotivated to work on my new career path. It just melts me into my depression. Then my wife's unwillingness to see me through it hurts even more and makes me want to quit before I've even started.

30,"Hi,  
after a shitty year, I hit a low point at the end of June (lasting more than a month), where I lost all interest in my work, hobbies and pretty much everything. This was later diagnosed as a depressive episode. Luckily my doctor handled the situation very good by giving me time off and advising me on what to do. After asking friends and family to meet up with me more and getting back into some sports, just taking it slow and eliminating my triggers, I made it through the worst of it. I am doing pretty good now, actually enjoying old hobbies, not dreading work (it also helps that I was able to quit and found a new job) and slowly getting back to the care free person I was before.

Even though the experience was the worst thing I have experienced in my life so far, I feel like I have learned a lot. A friend of mine suffered from chronic depression and I always felt a bit helpless myself when she was in the thick of it. I didn't know much about the condition and the internet was often times very unhelpful. I never really know what it felt like or what to do. I tried asking her but she couldn't explain how I could help or what she needed. I learned after a while it was most helpful to take a lot of decisions away from her. I always asked, what she needed. But I now realized, trying to decide on things during depression is exhausting, because yourself question everything. I questioned everything I did, even when trying to relax I questioned if I was relaxing in the best way. You know what the person likes, cook up something, order their favourite meal from a delivery service. Just bring them something to drink instead of asking what they want. 

The most important thing for me was to feel safe, I did this by rewatching the same show over and over, visiting my family and meeting up with friends. So make them feel safe, I guess this is different for everyone and probably takes a bit to figure out. I usually found it easier to figure out how to help, when she wasn't at a low point and could explain to me what she needed in those situations to feel safe. Asking her during a low point it is hard to explain what you need. I get that now, because I had no idea what I needed and what was wrong with me.

I am glad that I can finally understand what people with depression go through and maybe gained a better understanding of how to help someone going through it. Luckily, I was very fortunate with the support I got from my doctor, family and friends and got through this. Even though I am feeling better each day, I am still planning to see a therapist for the free counseling that my country offers, because I think it can't hurt and I might be able to learn more.

I wish you all of you who have to deal with this the very best. I think I at least understand it better now.",30Aug2020,1
31,"This year has been one freak storm after another and I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I have spurts of happiness but they don’t feel real when I have them. 

This year started bad with actually catching the virus and seriously running up some medical bills due to the fact that I had it before they started covering some of the bills for it. Then got forced to live with my entire toxic family. Quarantine made me notice some of the signs when one of my sisters pointed out I rarely leave my room. The love of my life then ended things over text with a text that said “forget I exist.” My depression then got worse as I really wasn’t leaving my room other than to work. Well then I got fired for reporting my management to hr. I didn’t get out of bed at this point for a few weeks. Finally i was able to get out of bed only for my dad to tell me how disappointed he was at me for being the first ever to get fired and how disappointed I was and that no one will hire me now. I stopped eating. I tried to get help but I don’t have insurance anymore and I don’t have the kind of money to pay for help. I don’t know what to do it’s getting worse. I cut myself again for the first time in years and I think I need help but I don’t know how or where to start given my financial state. I know I need help but I just don’t know how or when to start.",30Aug2020,1
32,"I just.....i don't know what to do anymore.

A shelf in my main closet has fallen recently, and I have no clue how to fix it. My dad is the maintenance guy for a vacation propery, and built my first home growing up on his own, so I know he has the knowledge. I asked him for help, and even agreed upon a specific date and he....just doesn't show up. I cleared my day too so there wouldn't be anything preventing me from helping him fix it.

Now I rent my home, so I can request maintenance to fix it, but 1. Maintenance has fixed it before and it broke, 2. Due to Coronavirus, the property owner is only doing high priority maintenance tasks, and 3. There is only 1 maintenance guy available to do it, and he is swamped with other tasks. 

I can understand the high priority task only issue, and it doesn't bother me. What bothers me constantly is that I feel like everyone in my life is unreliable, and it's a constant and suffocating drag. It feels like everyone I talk to, everyone in my life who matters, is no better at communicating or understanding me than my 6 month old. No one listens. No one cares. The best help I'll ever get in life, the only reliable help, is at the end of my arm.

I hate being alone.",30Aug2020,1
34,"I'm 14 and since quarantine has started , I've been extremely depressed because of my strict Asian mom. She makes me feel horrible for don't the slightest of mistakes. She doesn't allow me to play online with my friends because she thinks they are a bad influence. Any time I'm not learning a new skill or learning at all, she says I'm wasting time then yells at me. She always compares me to her friends child and asking me why I can't be like them. She always compares me to my siblings who are extremely athletic and she basically praises them. It makes me feel useless and that I have no purpose. Can anyone relate?",30Aug2020,1
35,"one of my incredible close friends used to self harm and i know they also tried to end it for themselves twice, i’ve known this for a while but now is the first time they’re really opening up about it, for them it’s been over a year since the last time, although i just need advice on how to help them and what to say",30Aug2020,1

38,"I recently turned 27 and I'm still a virgin. I've been rejected thousands of times, many of them in a devastating ways. Most of the girls I went to school with have blocked me, I've tried dating sites like Tinder but I never get matches. I've been wanting to have sex since I was 12 yet have never been given an inkling of a chance. Never even been on a date or kissed. I am absolutely repulsive to women no matter how much I take care of my looks. I have autism &amp; depression &amp; am too poor to travel. I don't deserve to live.",30Aug2020,1
