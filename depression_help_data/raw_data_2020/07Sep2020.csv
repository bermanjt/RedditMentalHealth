2,"How do people find motivation? 

I know I should do uni but I want to give it all up. One half of my bed is full of clean clothes, i clean it one week then it's back in a few days. 
I am addicted to getting uber eats when I can't sleep, which doesn't help with weight. 

I'm so behind on uni I feel like I can't go out and enjoy myself on a weekend because I am too far behind. Yet I end up getting on the beers with mates all weekend anyway. Putting me further behind and it contributes to using alcohol and as an escape for enjoyment. 

How have people over come this? I can't explain why i still  have this. I've already extended uni by a year... 

I want change but I have to finish my last year at uni before I can go work.

W// suicidal thoughts





I'd been having really bad days, feeling out of the comfort of my family. I feel like an alien, like I'm not even theirs. How can I be so different from all my family when I'm not adopted? I look for my friends and my BF today to feel better or something because I really feel lonely... None of them said anything nice... I feel I'm a fucking parasite.

4,"I will try to make sense of what I will write, sorry if it is not understood very well, I am using a translator. 

Since I was a kid I had a little fear of others, as if it were easy to intimidate me, and over the years I began to show symptoms of depression (which at that time was very naive and I thought it was just sadness), I locked myself away to cry during my baths and lost the desire to make new friends.
I am now 20 years old and a couple of years ago I realized the true impact of having depression, I see other adolescents from my age and they all have their problems but they don't have that dislike on themselves and they can talk without looking like weirdos or maintain a conversation not being boring or stupid, i feel like i'm stuck and getting worse and worse at talking or expressing myself. Maybe my main problems are the hatred I have for myself and the insecurity I have towards myself and others. I suffer from depressive attacks every few days a week where out of nowhere I remember all those negative things about myself and it is a feeling of hatred / repudiation / sadness that makes me feel pathetic and have repeated for many years. I have lost many opportunities due to my social anxiety and my fear of making decisions, I am not even able to trust the people I love and that scares me even more, I have dreams and things that I really like to do and people that I really appreciate, but these attacks appear more and more easily and remind me of many negative things that many people say that maybe we all think that way but that deep down we are not, and I wanted to accept it but that only brings more negativity and takes away more of the possibilities of doing Good decisions. I have not even tried to hurt myself because I am afraid of the repercussions that someone will see that I did it. I want to improve but I don't know how to stop hating myself.

5,"Sorry for typos or formatting, I am doing this on my phone.

I will try to be as brief as I can. I know a lot of people talk about losing themselves when they have children. Honestly, the same has happened to me since the virus started. 

I am an essential worker, I work in healthcare and treat/work with patients. I used to enjoy wearing make up, fixing my hair, etc. It made me feel confident and good about myself. That has long since stopped. No point in doing any of that when you wear several layers of protective gear and sweat through makeup in 15 minutes and spend the next 8 to 10 hours with it running in to your eyes and burning. Same for my hair, it is a sweaty, frizzy mess with in an hour of starting so what's the point of fixing it?

My face has broken out in horrible cystic acne because of the constant mask wearing at work. I have never had this bad of skin in my entire life, not even when I was a teenager. It is ugly and embarrassing and it hurts.

I am so exhausted after work that I rarely have the energy to cook anymore so I have been mostly living off of take-out. This has resulted in me gaining weight, which makes me feel even worse.

My work treats me like garbage, tells me constantly that I am replaceable and should be all but worshipping them with my gratitude because they are ""allowing me to have a job during a pandemic."" They have given us no hazard pay, and are not letting us use any time off. I haven't had any vacation time at all this year. 

I am so burned out. I don't even recognize myself anymore. I am annoyed, frustrated or angry all the time. Even minor things feel frustrating and overwhelming. My visceral reactions to things are so... angry for no real reason. I have such hateful thoughts about people, which has never been something I do. I am so depressed. I feel like crying all the time. I have no free time to get therapy or talk to anyone about this.

I think a lot about how it wouldn't be bad if I got hit by a car or something. I just don't even know what to do anymore.",07Sep2020,1
7,"I always feel like I‚Äôm not creative, funny, or witty.

Then there‚Äôs something with my speech, sometimes I can speak clearly but then most of the time I fumble my words and it just sounds weird. I swear I‚Äôve never had a speech impediment, I don‚Äôt get it, this is one of the number one things that ruins my jokes and my confidence into trying to add something to the conversation. It just puts me in an awful mindset and discourages me and even makes me sad. I‚Äôve never had this issue it‚Äôs like just now I guess I don‚Äôt know to be honest. 

I know depression has messed with my brain a lot, I haven‚Äôt laughed a lot until just recently it‚Äôs been 2 weeks I guess maybe a month since I started laughing again and laughing a lot usually in my Group FaceTime‚Äôs, I just don‚Äôt know what to do about it I wanna always feel happy and funny, I just wanna keep feeling the satisfaction of making people‚Äôs days with my jokes. 

Tonight I went outside for a walk of course it was dark and I was listening to 432 hertz music and while I was walking I constantly felt like I was being watched and followed. I swear I kept seeing figures, I was scared and my anxiety kicked in and now I have this weird head ache. 

I don‚Äôt wanna feel like this anymore I want to learn how to be witty again, I want to learn how be happy and crack jokes, I want to be more confident in myself but my stupid brain just doesn‚Äôt want to work, there‚Äôs something wrong with my brain I can‚Äôt think quickly and I just want to think quick of a joke or just doing stuff in general. I just want to be funny again I want to be myself and the person I picture me as the person I always want to be.

12,"Hi! I‚Äôm on mobile so apologies in advance for formatting.

I‚Äôve struggled with depression for years and last fall I made some steps to start getting professional/medical help. I feel like I‚Äôm finally beginning to get my life a bit more on track. However, I have run into this roadblock‚Äî finding a good dentist. I moved to a new city two years ago and haven‚Äôt tried any yet.

I know what it‚Äôs like to feel like you literally can‚Äôt make it through another day. I have had those days where it‚Äôs a fight to get out of bed; some weeks if I find the energy to make myself eat at least three or four times I count that as a victory. When I‚Äôm having a depressive episode like this, sometimes compromises need to be made if I am to get up and try to keep living my life. Most of the time, this compromise starts with brushing my teeth. I do keep apples and gum on hand so I can keep my teeth somewhat clean, but there are stretches of time where I either forget or don‚Äôt have the energy. 

I have never had a dentist who was understanding about this. At best, I receive shocked or exasperated  comments about how I should be making more of an effort. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where even thinking about going to a dentist creates this deep feeling of dread. 

If folks have any guidance or have experienced this before, please let me know. All the best to each of you in your battles with depression. :)",07Sep2020,1

14,"FYI, I am an emotional teenager girl so bare with me throughout this.

Lockdown has ruined my teenage years. I turn 17 next week but still don't have my licenses because booking a driving test is an absolute pain in the ass. I had one sooner, but I got pancreatitis and was in the hospital when it was scheduled. That was August 10th, now my next test is October 7th and I want to smash my head into a wall. And of course my twin sister can drive because she managed to get a driving test. So now I genuinely want to put sugar in the damn car. 

To go with that, I was looking into buying a car but I am now jobless and have no license so that isn't looking to good either.

I also got rejected by my only guy friend, and I'm not close enough friends with any girls to bitch about it, so now I'm just wallowing in my own sadness.

It just pisses me off seeing everyones life going decent. And I get the whole ""you don't know how people really feel on social media"" but when you see all the girls in your grade posing for photos and shit, then look back at how your too self conscious to take selfies, its pretty clear who has the deeper issues. 

Throughout quarantine I have hung out with nobody. I have tried, I really have. I am pretty anti social so every few weeks I invite someone to do something with minimal interaction, like playing a video game or watching a movie. But everyone always says no and I'm just defeated. I try really hard to get out of my comfort zone and meet people but it always end with nothing being made of it. 

I also was riding my bike and some guy got pissed at me and was screaming out his window. Then my bike chain broke. So that was somewhat traumatic.

Also were putting my cat down this week and its my birthday Friday. But you also know what is Friday 9/11...

22,"I‚Äôm 14 male and middle class. I have had a good life but around 3rd grade when I realized how pointless life was I started to feel useless and like everything was pointless. I started truly being depressed on and off, I would some times forget about the pointlessness of life and just enjoy but that was rare at times. I eventually tried talking to my parents and telling them how sad I felt in about 5th grade. They told me my life was good, I wasn‚Äôt depressed, and it felt like they made fun of me. I cannot talk to them about this.  had been playing hockey for the past few years and it helped cheer me up. A little before this I‚Äôd began seriously considering committing suicide cause things just couldn‚Äôt get worse. Hockey was going down hill for reasons out of my control and I couldn‚Äôt hate school more. I was extremely depressed from September 2017 to January 2018. I was a kid who was not cute a bit chubby but very fit and often annoying but in 6th grade I started to try to work on my image. This mage me feel very stressed out because of how hard I tried to be a good person and kid. I had almost the whole grade like me but just as the funny fat kid no more not best friends always an after thought. At a hockey tournament in January I was introduced to a game called Fortnite by my team. It was fun and I had a lot of extra time and an Xbox that I barely used. I‚Äôd play mostly with my hockey teammates but eventually kids at my school started playing it. I added a few of them and started becoming more than that fat kid. I spent a lot of time playing Fortnite and enjoyed it. I won‚Äôt get into it very much but it basically boosted my confidence and gave me a few steady friends that I could call my besties and a few good friends from and not from Fortnite. I would hangout with them sometimes and would spend a long time playing games with them. I also got very into rap and hip hop and it was something that helped to keep me happy along with Fortnite. Without them I honestly don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be today. I had a good best friend and and few others really close people through seventh grade. I would hangout with them sometimes but it was always me making the initial move to hangout. It was rarely them making the first move. I didn‚Äôt mind it that much and didn‚Äôt really notice. But sometimes when I did it would hurt me and remind of how sad I was. I kept straight A‚Äôs and worked hard in school. Humbly, I was one of the most popular kids in the grade people would make a big deal of things I did and I felt great in the moment but no one seemed to actually be my friend just would hype me up in class and then after I was trash. Even some of my best friends. I also had a few distinct friend groups, ex. The gamers and the athletes. Although I thought this was good and I accepted it. I played Xbox through most of the summer and did summer things like camps and a few sleepovers and hangouts. The next year two of my friend groups became the most important early in 8th grade including some new students. They might have been a bit controlling but at the same time I loved them so much and enjoyed spending the whole school day with them. First half of the year I worked hard to stay close with them but felt they only cared about me in school especially one named ‚ÄúD‚Äù the others would do stuff with me outside of school but this one who was basically my best friend wouldn‚Äôt and I didn‚Äôt and still don‚Äôt know why. I was always exhausted and sad whenever I would leave school and loved my days where I got to hangout with my group. Later in the year I stopped giving them my full attention especially the two females in the group( two guys two girls). They stayed close to me and I was even closer to other friend groups. This was in February and in late February I would hangout out with one friend group more than the group with ‚ÄúD‚Äù and went from eating with ‚ÄúD‚Äù to eating with the other groups, this made them not like me as much but I was gonna continue to eat with them I had just made an agreement with some of the other groups to hangout at lunch and talk to. This was a horrible time for it to happen(Late February to mid March when schools were closed). I kept in contact with most of my friend groups through Xbox, FaceTime, and game pigeon and things like that. Although when I reached out to the specific group they would ignore me. I had already started to feel more and more depressed cause if my 8th grade year being ruined but this really put me close to ending it all. I was at a very low point. I fought through it best I could. Music, Xbox, shows, and Youtube helped me through this time like the others before it. I kept good grades and straight A‚Äôs all year up to quarantine. I began meeting new people on Xbox and played very often. I had put on lots of weight from basically doing no exercise and was straight up fat. I was often bullied for my weight, ethnicity, and for my emotions by my Xbox friends who were basically my only friends(it was a lot of people, 15-20). I felt like it was fine and I didn‚Äôt complain. Through these times I would feel sad often and found happiness in the same things as before. I started hanging out with a few Xbox friends and visiting family. There were often fights in the Xbox party but stuff blew over quick. I had one Xbox friend in particular that I didn‚Äôt know irl and that would never be mean to me and was always super nice. There were not many like this. As the summer progressed I tried to arrange a group hangout but never could. I went out of town a few times and they hung out during those times. It hurt me so much I was done with everything and couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore but for some reason I didn‚Äôt do the deed. I was struggling and just couldn‚Äôt  take it. I tried to hangout with a few people from school but they couldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve met more friends from mutual friends on Xbox and am bullied more and more. I don‚Äôt mind it that much and have never showed that I don‚Äôt like it but it sometimes makes me cry while in the party I just can‚Äôt take it sometimes I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve thought about suicide over these times at least daily but probably more than that. Over the summer my parents would come to despise me and constantly be straight mean to me and yell at me for dumb stuff. I felt like everyone was against me. I continued to play Xbox and listen to music and be on my phone. This helped me a lot. I started school and was determined to be a great student and be a successful person in general. I have given it almost everything and barely give myself anytime. I have been failing anyways and get 70s in many classes. My dad absolutely hates me for this and another reason. He is mad because I have not been doing good in hockey. The previous year we had been paying attention to the high school team I would try out for and knew I could easily make the team. I was a great player and had a great chance to make one of he hs teams. I got fat and out of shape and didn‚Äôt play at all and was no match for the other players. I didn‚Äôt want to play hockey anymore and now don‚Äôt but whenever I bring up not playing they laugh at me and make jokes while I‚Äôm trying not to cry. I also am not making any friends in school no matter how hard I try. Also because of how much work I‚Äôm putting into school I‚Äôve lost connection with most of my friends. Some of them I still haven‚Äôt even seen in person ever. I‚Äôm the only one too, I feel left out, sad and like there is not point in life. I tried this last week to talk to them more and play with them more but just keep feeling more and more pointless and sad. I have thought about suicide hundreds of times a day which is a lot more than before. I‚Äôm a failure and I have no one. I need help but can‚Äôt get any. I can‚Äôt go to my parents, my friends, my teachers, or my extended family, I‚Äôve reached my whits end and am reaching out to anyone who can help. I NEED YOU!

as a kid i was always sad. i had a tutor once and he described me as *melancholy*. but i guess i didnt off myself in the off chance i manage to find a job i like. somehow, working for FANG or a large company was always my dream, being able to work on a product which is widely used, being around super smart people and learning from them in general, and ofc the cool office perks. its kinda the same feeling of telling people you're from xx college and they're like wow you must be so smart. i want that feeling from my job.

college is alright. sometimes school work is challenging. but staying on task is not too bad because if you plan ahead of time, you won't face much anxiety inducing situations. 

except for me being depressed about comparing myself to others for my performance in school, our 'resume', and 'number of friends'. yeah, i guess the constant theme is i always compare myself because i feel if i had those things that others have, i would finally feel happy*. i soooo dont feel happy right now..* 

but it f\*\*kin sucks to know that almost everyone i know either secured a job before covid became serious and their offers werent rescinded. *i feel like i got the bad draw of the hand when i know some people didn't even need to go through tech interviews and they can just learn on the first month of the job wtf... (well, obviously not FANG companies, but still pretty large companies with above average comp!)*

**i hate it when people ask how am i, like i was already depressed enough before and i sort of feel worse now just that i try not to think about it. i dont even bother checking my linkedin, instagram, or replying random people that message me nowadays. i literally only talk to one person daily and thats it. my typical coping mechanism for situations that make me upset / sad is just to avoid them, be it plan in advance or just downright avoid. yeah... what a thing to say if it comes up for a job interview, right?** 

between wallowing in self pity and wondering if i can just be a neet for life because i enjoy that (theres so many shows on netflix i havent watched, theres so many games i havent played!), i also know that if i want a job, i have to improve my skills. im grateful my family can support me for the time being but they keep rushing me to get a job soon or at least get a part time job or whatever.

im trying to get another job in tech and not straight up software eng because leetcode scares tf out of me and its SO stressful. again, objectively, in terms of hard skills, i guess i can use the tools. objectively, i did freelance work and got praised, so my stuff should be decent right? *but once i start comparing with other portfolios out there, i'm like... how am i gonna get employed? trust me, when i see other people's school projects, i feel mine looks like trash and i shouldn't be displaying those.* 

i have had internships, but honestly i don't think i did anything wow there. also, i've had school projects but like i said, it's more towards software eng and me / my team struggled with finishing use cases on the development end, so it always ends up looking non-aesthetic enough. or maybe i was just too overwhelmed / not hardworking enough... idek man. 

meanwhile i haven't applied for anything in 2 weeks, since i'm in the midst of revamping my portfolio and doing one mini side project just for the sake of just getting an interview. 

**tldr: i just have so much self doubt in myself as a person trying to mould myself into a certain role. i feel like im not good enough and i wonder if i'll ever be able to get my dream role and ever work for my dream companies.** its hard not to compare myself to others when i think to myself, hey isnt that what HR is doing to me? 

\*sigh\* back to designing my new portfolio site and side project i guess. hopefully i'll be able to start applying for something at the end of this week..  struggling to write something non-deprecating for my profile page :(

thanks for reading and have a nice day ahead!",07Sep2020,1
28,"My bf (27) has been suffering from depression for the last few months. We finally got him on some antidepressants but it‚Äôs still a waiting game to see how he responds. I‚Äôve been trying my best to support him and learn more about depression so I can encourage healthy coping skills for both of us. But lately his biggest symptom has been isolation. 

He usually enjoys playing video games with his friends and hasn‚Äôt been doing it at all. He‚Äôll say that he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot into it right now.‚Äù He‚Äôll forget to respond to texts from friends trying to check in and make sure he‚Äôs okay. He‚Äôll come up with reasons why he can‚Äôt confide in certain friends like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not the feelings type‚Äù or ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Besides myself, he‚Äôs really only confided in one other friend (that at least I‚Äôm aware of). I know having a strong social support circle is so important when going through Depression. So my question is..am I overstepping a boundary if I reach out to his friends to encourage them to check in more? 

I would obviously never divulge personal information or his struggles with them but maybe just ask that they reach out more and give them a heads up that he‚Äôs having a hard time.

I know he‚Äôll open up if his friends consistently reach out. But I understand that he may not want them to know his struggles. I just hate seeing him so detached.

TLDR: Should I reach out to my bfs friends and encourage them to connect with him as he is isolating himself due to depression?",07Sep2020,1

30,"So my Grandfather is well past 60 years old and as he‚Äôs gotten older he has gotten more sick with depression and some other mental disorders I‚Äôm not sure exactly what. I haven‚Äôt been around much. Because they live in Canada and I‚Äôm mostly based in Southern USA...and Around the globe...so I‚Äôve been visiting my grandparents for a week. And I know there is a lot I don‚Äôt see when I‚Äôm away, but my grandfather has been trying since I‚Äôve been here. He‚Äôs stayed awake, he‚Äôs tried communicating with me, he really has been putting his best foot forward...I also noticed he does that when his Son comes to visit also. 
This morning he got up early, he was napping on the couch, with TV on, made tea for my grandmother for when she woke up, and when she finally did he gave her the tea, told her GoodMorning dear, and she literally just condemned him...telling him that the only reason he made her tea was for a cigarette. And saying how often does that happen if no ones here??? That he‚Äôs only staying up and doing these things to make him look good. And just belittling him.

Like I feel like she should be happy he‚Äôs making an effort, not ripping him apart when he‚Äôs trying. 

My grandmother can be very mean and controlling in my opinion. She controls every aspect of his life, where he goes, when he smokes, what he does. And I can‚Äôt help but think she is the reason he is getting so depressed. 

I don‚Äôt even know what kind of advice I‚Äôm seeking, I just needed a space to vent, it just really hurts to see my grandfather being basically abused verbally when he‚Äôs already in such a fragile state.",07Sep2020,1

33,"( F 57) I don‚Äôt know quiet where to start but let‚Äôs start with I‚Äôve always suffered with depression and even back many many years ago tried to end my life...I eventually married which turned into a disaster he just beat me almost daily so I lived in constant fear, he was 14 years older than me and I discovered he was a drug addict and also it became more apparent that 9/10 he would hit me when he hadn‚Äôt got drugs. We had one child. Eventually the drugs killed my husband and have to say I didn‚Äôt miss being hit, myself and my son ( who was 13 when his father died) have always been close and he became quiet a hermit but eventually met someone in his early 20‚Äôs but didn‚Äôt want to leave home so she moved in I thought things were all going to be rosy, no it wasn‚Äôt she already had a daughter (aged 2.5) and we soon discovered she was not a nice person to her child or anyone else for that matter, she lost her child via the social services and as painful as that was I think it was the best thing for the child...my son thought he was in love with this women and the horrible saga went on, they had two children whom was only allowed to stay at home with my son being there I could see what was happening to my son the way she treated him was appalling, but he thought he loved her. 18 years they stayed together under my roof i was a wreck I lost my mom &amp; dad both in their 60‚Äôs and my niece whom I absolutely idolised killed her self at age 28 ( that‚Äôs another long story) everything and everyone I loved was dying, my sister aged 56 died last year. All this going on and all I keep getting is bad news after bad news about my health, emphysema, Copd, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism and more I just don‚Äôt feel well but I get the odd couple of days where I almost feel high and pack so much into those days because I know I‚Äôll sink back down again. 2 weeks before Xmas my sons partner left him so he hit depression big time, forward to March he meets another women and he‚Äôs now left home leaving me with my two grandchildren whom I absolutely love but struggle day to day to function but I do...
I know I need to see a doctor and I know I desperately need help with my depression but I‚Äôm afraid to because firstly they may think due to my heath I can‚Äôt look after them and secondly they will look back and see I‚Äôve attempted to take my own life albeit many years ago. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to lose them. I love them with every beat of my heart, I do look after them, I do keep a clean house and they want for nothing unless it‚Äôs a request that‚Äôs beyond reason money wise. They don‚Äôt see their parents as they don‚Äôt bother to come. I could type forever but worried if it‚Äôs to long it won‚Äôt get read...Just what do I do ?",07Sep2020,1
34,I am not sure about the flair but I do need advice. I'm doing online talk therapy with my psych and I feel concerned about her. She seems to be more down compared to when I first met with her.

35,"My mother said she'll go with me if I get help by myself. The process of finding and contacting a psychologist gives me terrible anxiety which is why I didn't go before. People on Reddit motivated me enough to actually try so I'm asking again for help.

Thanks a lot, Reddit",07Sep2020,1
36,I just seem to have an underlying level of sadness some days. But I can still be happy? Like it's just a baseline that I return to. And I'm not sure exactly how to put it. But is there anything I can do to mitigate it when it pops up?,07Sep2020,1
41,"Let me just start by saying I am in therapy with an amazing therapist, I am on anti-depressants, and I have a great support system. Maybe that's what makes this harder to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any specific thing to say. I am just tired of feeling this way.  I am exhausted with myself. I feel like such a burden on my friends and family. I am sick of me, they must be too. This year hasn't helped one bit, as I am sure we can all agree. I am doing everything I am supposed to be doing. I am fighting and fighting as hard as I can. And depression is still here. These past few weeks have been the hardest I have been hit in a long time. Nothing is really different. Just the same crap.  And I just keep beating myself up about not being ok.  Or about my stupid need for validation and acceptance. What is it going to take to be ok with being me and not giving a heck about what others think? I am caught between bitterness and sadness and I just don't know how much longer I can do this. And I really just don't want to open up about this to my family and friends.  I want to be happy and good for them. I can't bring them down here with me. Why am I still down here?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really want any advice. I have had about all of it that I can handle. I am just looking for kindness and support. Sorry for the raw emotion. I just needed to put it somewhere.",07Sep2020,1
42,"I was thinking probably therapy would be a good idea, but Im not sure what to talk about.

I'm not the kind of person that complains a lot, nor do I like to talk about me or my feelings a lot. 

But I'm also sure I can't be the only one who is like that but still would benefit from therapy .

So how does the first session look like? Is he asking specific questions, or is it like on TV ""why are you here"" or whatever?

I feel if I'm a bit prepared of what would happen I would actually do it and not just think about it.",07Sep2020,1

44,"I'm non-binary, AMAB. For the last two months I've been out of my home due to my family being transphobic and homophobic shits after 7 years of mental and physical abuse, while seeing enough to go outside and chant 1312. I sleep in an office, I have no job because the pandemic and due to the fact that I'm 20 and in the country I'm from I'm still considered a goddamn infant and supposed to live with my parents.

Anyway, I've been developing some really unhealthy coping mechanisms due to my extreme depression. I'm broke and still I spend the cash I have left on molly, getting high on weed every day or two, drinking and having unprotected sex. I know I'm not remotely supposed to behave this way and I realize I may end up regretting this shit, but I still cannot stop myself from getting high on either chems or dopamine and ethanol. I'm strong and everyone says it, but I'm not THAT strong to cope with it and stay calm. I'm fucking homeless.

Reddit, I don't want to hear ""it will get better"", I want to hear what you have gone through and if any of you have gone through something remotely similar, to hear what you did for yourselves. I'm tired of this, but the moment I realize I can't get high I get down to the ground level and get all the flashbacks. Thank you. I love all of you.",07Sep2020,1
45,"We had an okay weekend together. It was relaxing, but not very fun. With the pandemic and how bad it is here in the U.S., I was hoping I could have some fun with my boo but it was mostly us watching Netflix and playing video games. It was nice but I already do that all the time on my own. And now with summer ending, I feel like our opportunity to do fun things has passed. And he just left and I miss him, it's like coming down off of a little high.

I can sense the sun starting to set earlier too during the days, which makes me really uneasy because I struggle with my ment health the most during fall and winter. I wish it could be summer forever, or at least a few months longer.

So I've basically experienced periods of time where I feel numb, hollow and can do nothing but sit in my room all day. They last for between 2-8 weeks and recently these moods have been far more frequent. I'm 22 and it's been going on since I was probably about 18. 

I've never been open with my mental health around family so having this conversation isn't going to be easy, especially since they're a bit out of touch.
