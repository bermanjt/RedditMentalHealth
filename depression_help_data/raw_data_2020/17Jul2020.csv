1,"Sorry for the desperation. Will someone give me advice

Please help me (sorry for the desperation) but is there any way I can go through with a hysterectomy on my parents insurance without them knowing

Okay so I tried to get my own insurance and it said no plans available when I signed up on healthcare.gov 
And I want a hysterectomy and now have my letters in order for it. I do not have my own insurance I am 21 and live with my parents. I am not gonna get it through my current job and am considering quitting soon. I am struggling in math and my mother has threatened many times to take me out if I do not pass. They always use pulling me out of school as a threat to me. I have started on birth control to keep periods away but every single cycle I consider killing myself. I’m getting scared for myself at this point but I am afraid if they receive a bill for the hysterectomy which might be high they will take me out of college. I feel like I’m either gonna risk my future or my sanity/life. I know I could possibly wait until November but I’ve had NO LUCK trying to get my own health insurance.",17Jul2020,1
2,"I'm not generally someone that struggles alot with depression. I have alot of friends that do, and I've always struggled to relating to them or knowing what to say to help them.

These last few days have been an extreme struggle, something I've never felt before. I hate myself so much, I want nothing to do with me to the point I've convinced myself no one else does either.

Right now I'm in such a hole I haven't stopped crying for about an hour. although I could never do it, The thoughts of suicide hasn't left my mind.

I've learned why it is so hard for people to open up during these burdening times. I can't open up to my husband about it because I don't want to burden him or anyone. Thus I need to keep showing them my positive side. 
I want desperately to leave everyone in the dark so they only see the best in me, because I need to know I do matter and there is a irrational fear that I won't matter if I'm flawed.

I don't know how make that first step to talk about it.

Thanks to my friends that have opened up over the several years, I learned there is a huge importance in opening up and creating a support group early, and not to delay it.

Has anyone experienced it and how did you do it? Because this is f*ckin hard man.",17Jul2020,1
3,"I don’t know how to explain this without sounding like i’m asking for attention or pity. That’s usually the reason why I don’t like to open up to people. I feel like I am a burden to everyone around me.. I feel like they don’t care about me. Specially the people I am supposed to be really closed with they don’t even check up on me. 

I have no energy to do anything anymore. I don’t have energy to do anything... I can’t even eat, shower, sleep properly or maintain a conversation. I feel so alone and so unmotivated. I feel like i’ve no motivation to get better. I feel like every time I cry for help nobody listens. 

my mom just makes everything worse, she makes me feel like I am a whole disappointment. I truly feel like she doesn’t like me and she wishes I was someone else. She criticizes everything I do. The way i walk, the way I eat, the clothes i wear, the things i like. It’s so fucking hard to try to get better when someone is constantly putting you down. I told her and i opened up to her about my self harm and she just got mad at me and told me I tried to copy my friend when I wasn’t even aware she did it too.. she also said I tried to copy hannah baker just because I tried to commit suicide a few years back

If i end it, i don’t think she would be sad, she would just be mad at me..

I can’t stop self harming.. i hate myself i hate myself so much. I just wish someone cared. genuinely cared. I wish i was enough as a friend, lover and a child. It never seems to get better. Every day it just gets worse and worse and my grandmas in the hospital right now. I’m so scared.",17Jul2020,1
4,I've been falling asleep after breakfast and I feel like a failure since I wasted the day. My mom tries to talk to me about how I feel and somehow it feels worse that she's trying to help me. I have intrusive suicidal thoughts and I'm too scared to move because I'm afraid of acting on them. I feel numb and cold and can't stop crying and thinking about how much of a failure I am.

6,I’ve been feeling down for about 4 months now and I used to think it was just the stress of school and I would get over it. I’m not sure who I could talk to about this. I took a semester off of school to work far away from where I grew up. I wanted to get away from my parents and the stress of school and I’ve been wanting to talk to a therapist. The problem is that I’m still on my parents insurance and I’m not sure if they will see what doctors I’ve been to. They are very against therapy and I just don’t feel comfortable talking about this with my friends or family.,17Jul2020,1
7,"My wife and I had a fight today. She get that I’d betrayed her because I didn’t tell her about a conversation I’d had with a guy about an issue. 

She refuses to listen to me, she’s called me horrible things. “Sugar on shit”, weasel, liar, etc and says she’s never going to tell me anything again...

The discussion didn’t involve her or any personal issues. NONE. 

Now she’s calmed down and says she didn’t mean any of the things that she’d said. She was just angry and wanted me to hurt like she was. 

I love my wife. I’m devoted to her. But she has a tendency to get angry quickly after jumping to conclusions. I have spent the past 3 weeks literally doing everything for her because she’s recovering from surgery. And I mean everything, without complaint, because she’s my wife and I love to care for her. 

Most of the time, it all goes away...  but it’s been 20 years. 

I am feeling like the absolute worst husband in the world. I feel lost and worthless. The comments were retracted, but they were still said in the moment. 

I feel like giving up on everything...and I don’t see a way to change it all. 

If anyone has advice, I’d love something.

8,"I’ve never posted anything like this on reddit but tonight I’m feeling very down. Im a teen and had an abortion done when i was 16 without my parents finding out. I did it because when I found out the BD had already left me for another girl and wanted nothing to do with me, I was still a junior In highschool and felt like It was the best decision for me at the time. Months later and I’m feeling like complete shit. I’ve been so depressed since then and a day doesn’t go by where I domt think about it amd regret it and hate myself. I feel like a terrible person. This month was extremely hard as my due date went by. Everytime I drive a car my head tells me to drive off a bridge. I feel like everyone hates me and I can’t keep doing this anymore. I have a boyfriend and he just thinks I’m very irritable and a bitch but honestly I’m going through it. He doesn’t know anything and I don’t feel comfortable talking to him about it. But yeah I’ve visited a therapist before and never went back because I didn’t feel comfortable.

9,"My friend’s family who I consider my own has gone through an earth shattering crisis. I feel as strongly effected as anyone in their household, but I’m not someone who lives there. I’m someone who is there to help, and although its a bit of a struggle thinking up ways to do it I wouldn’t have it any other way. 
But the thing is, I haven’t been okay for so much longer than this has been going on. Sporadic waves of sadness has been harming me for years. It’s why I dropped out of college. It’s so intense and isolating that a majority of the time I feel it I just want to curl up and die. Whenever I actually have energy, I hide that I ever feel this and try to be as open and happy as anyone could ever tell. I’ve tried to find literally anyone that I can be weak or sad with, but everyone I’ve ever been comfortable with has always had so much going on themselves that I can’t just force myself to be their priority. 
And now I’m at this point, where I can’t shake this feeling of intense, unforgiving sadness amidst a crisis to which I am almost an outsider. My role of the helper has been set. I love that I have any ability to help them get through this at least as a distraction for a day. And the moment I get home I feel crushed with remorse. Like everything I just did for them has tolled on my own wellbeing. 
Today, when even the slightest hint of confrontation from my family came, I had the first emotional breakdown I’ve had since I was 14. All it took was my mom asking me if I was okay. But she hasn’t actually noticed anything. It was just a check up as she hasn’t seen me in days. I shed the tears but gained no solace from today. And that’s pretty much why I’d go to such lengths as to just write out the most general of descriptions of my wellbeing here.

Does this happen to other people? Is there a name for what’s happening here? And if it’s worth mentioning, both of my parents have been diagnosed with depression and my mother has mentioned she thinks hers may be related to bipolar disorder.

13,"Hey there. I don't really know who to ask or where so here it goes. I have been going in and out of therapy sessions for the past 3 years. I started therapy because I started having regular breakdowns. My coping skills weren't the best and I had plummeting self-esteem. 

The sessions have helped me understand myself a bit more and introduced me to self compassion. However I still face a lot of struggles and doubts. I definitely feel like I'm still stuck in this cycle of worrying, running away, and feeling empty. 

I constantly do self reflections and often make judgements about myself. I often doubt myself and my abilities. A lot of my accomplishments feel fake. And I have this sort of this need to pursue some sort of meaning or happiness in life. Sometimes that need really pushes me to learn things but sometimes I get stuck in a rut because of it. I've been trying to learn more about how I feel and if it's really a problem.

The thing is I don't know, I'm not sure. Sometimes it feels like I'm just making stuff up so I could feel bad about myself. There's a part of me that wants to take an assessment as a sort of... Validation? That what I'm going through is serious and requires attention.

I talked to this about my therapist. I asked her what she thought of an assessment. She told me she believes that the symptoms are more important than the diagnosis. She also said that from where I'm standing right now she doesn't see the need for me to take an assessment. Tests are to help cases that experience educational problems or problems that debilitate normal life. 

So here I am again thinking maybe I don't really have that much problems. That I function ""well enough"". That I don't meet the threshold for an assessment. Maybe I'm holding on to this false sense of hope that an assessment will tell me more about myself (from someone other than me).

But also a part of me wants to know...so I could tell myself what I do feel is serious. What I do feel needs attention. I don't know if I have a diagnosis.

My entire life I've been bullied by my class and school mates. They bullied me for my looks and my personality. So I decided to start hiding, something I was planning to stop again but...
My mother is also a bit psycho, she has quiet a temper, and becomes mad quiet easily. She offends you in the most horrible ways imaginable, and use everything you say in deep confidence to her, against you (but of course after it has been twisted out of proportion inside her head)

My mother's raising rage, and my classmates who acted like dicks until 8th grade (where I switched school's) just made me fail the ""switch back"" so I'm still hiding way too much, and I don't want to talk about things like feelings, thought etc. With anyone at all. I have one friend that I've been talking to lately but this still isn't much, and I still feel both empty and isolated. 

In the meantime I'm also afraid cause, what'll happen when I come back? I just graduated 9th grade, and I'm starting in high school in a month. But it's the same class, with the same people (I'm on a education in biotechnology that stretches from 8th grade to 3rd (and last) high school year) so how will I explain to them that they have to treat me the complete opposite of what they've been doing so far.

Instead of being a stone cold, anti social, it geek who refuses to talk to any one about anything. I'm all of a surden a super social, emotional guy, who wanna talk to everyone about everything and wanna make a lot of close friends. Btw hate windows, Mac and anything else related to computers.

So please, give advice on what to do. I wanna get out of this as fast as possible as it drains my energy, affect my family and friends mood (which hurts me, and ends up making me more depressed) and threatens to completely ruin my high school education. And what to do with friends, loved ones and just the one you know? How to tell them ""hey you know that guy I've been in 2 years now? Yeah I'm the complete opposite""?

23,"Hey all. Idk what I'm doing honestly. 

Long story short: A video game entertainer I never watched ended his life, and I haven't been the same since. Super depressed, dysthymia is getting unmanageable and my rationalizing skills scare me.


Short story long: A great man and gaming icon named Byron, or Reckful, left us a few weeks ago. I didn't know him personally. I was vaguely familiar with him at a time maybe 7 years ago, but have 0 connection with. When I read about him ending his suffering, I felt a huge pit I hadn't felt in years. My body tensed up, face scrunched, and started weeping. 

Byron had a history of illness from everything I read, watched, and heard since his passing. 

Idk if it's my selfishness. Idk if it's.... Idk why. But I keep thinking that this man who
Touched so many people
Had So many loved ones, close and far. 
Had what seemed to be an amazing support system. 
And still mental illness, the dirty fucking bitch it is, can just take you like that. One quick trip down rationalizing suicide later, and everything is over. 
I feel terrified. I am so fucking sad. If this brilliant mind of a human being.... Like if he couldn't do it I know I can't. It isn't even a question, It's just a countdown timer til the inevitable. 

I didn't know Byron until after he passed. Dude was a stranger. I've since tried learning from the lessons he had to learn thru his public mental health struggles. Perhaps to avoid taking the same path. Maybe to try and make sense of it myself. I honestly don't know.
I am 30 and have had dysthymia for 10 years. I currently work in the mental health field providing services to those in need, and connecting people to the appropriate resources for whatever their needs are. Here I am, not even knowing what the fuck to do for me. I've talked to therapists 3 times since his passing. Got my wrap shit and everything. Idk.

Comparing yourself with someone especially those that are much higher than you are ,lets say financially or morally which ever one it might be, can make you look down on yourself which can led to self-doubt and so many other emotional stress. I am not saying that you should not take anyone that has already achieved what you want too as a model but don't try too compare yourself, lets all learn too accept who we are and try our best to become the best versions of ourselves rather than putting ourselves under unnecessary pressures that we may not be able to handle.

Shortly after moving here I developed depression. I'm not 100% sure what it stems from, whether its missing home or just being in a new place (even though I had visited many times). I currently don't really have anyone I can consider a friend. My best friend at home passed away a few years ago from suicide so it has been especially difficult with not being able to talk to them. Right now I'm at the point that i feel that nothing I do matters. I know my current situations are whats making me even more depressed. My husband doesn't currently work but I do work full time. We live with his parents which on its own drives me insane. I haven't been able to have a proper married relationship with my husband because of this. We have debt but its getting hard being the only one working. My husband won't say anything as to why he is being picky about work when right now he can't be. I hate the state that I live in. There is literally nothing here. Now lately I'm having image issues which I never really felt before. I know I need to lose weight \[not for looks\] but at the same time my depression just kicks me down so hard. I have lost weight though around 35 pounds but i still have more to go. The thing that scares me is that every time I think about losing weight I see a vision where I go to the extreme. I feel that at 31 I should have something to show for but I have nothing.  I'm just so lost I don't know what to do anymore. All this looks like I'm rambling but I'm writing it as it comes so I'm sorry if it makes no sense in some spots.

28,"Hi everyone, this is a throwaway account because I'm afraid someone who know my main will see this.

So, this is my first workplace out of university and my boss is very verbally abusive.

He  keeps getting mad and yelling over every little thing and nothing I do  is good enough for him. He always has criticism and not in a good way.  All of his criticism is humiliating and that breaks me.

I'm  a software developer and I work at a little startup so let's first  start from the work conditions. We work at a dusty basement which they  clean 2-3 time **A YEAR**  and until I brought in my own chair I seat on one of those plastic  chairs. The place is small, cramped and honestly disgusting. The door to  the bathroom(which is in the area where EVERYONE sits at) is broken so  it doesn't shut all the way.

My  boss has no idea how to be a boss and it always seems like he resists  us. He gives very vague tasks and then gets mad and yells when we  doesn't get it exactly like he wanted it. When I ask him questions he  answers in a way that makes you feel stupid for not knowing it already.

We  have no real workflow in the company, not even code reviews and once in  a while my boss decides to look at code and criticize it in such an  awful and degrading way.

I have some childhood trauma that makes me shrivel up when people yell at me and say mean things.

It  had gotten me to a point that I am just plain afraid to talk to him.  That, in turn caused me to avoid him and that caused even more stress  than before. He causes me panic attacks(verified by my therapist) even  before he tells me he wants to talk.

That man is mean to everyone in his life, even his own wife and kids.

The  thing is that it always feels personal to me and I take it very hard. I  obsess over what he is going to say next and what next thing will set  him off and I just keep running scenarios through my head over and over  with no stop and no rest, all from the fear of him and his reactions.

He  doesn't give me my weekends either, every Friday and Saturday he sends  me messages and kind of demands that I work. He wants everything done  right here and now. Because it's his company he always gives us speeches  about responsibility and not going to sleep until all bugs are fixed.

It  has gotten to a point where I need to actively tell him I will not be  available this Friday in order for him to leave me alone.

I  have started looking for a new job after some time where I was  depressed and felt like there's no reason for me to get out of bed in the morning. I just need some support to help me get through this  because he causes me such immense amounts of stress and anxiety. I still feel depressed and sometimes have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning.

Thank you for reading all of this, it really means a lot.",17Jul2020,1
29,"I’ve been struggling with fairly severe depression and anxiety since I was very young (8 or 9?), but didn’t get a proper diagnosis until last year. One of the more significant contributing factors (of many, admittedly) is the fact that I’m fairly severely overweight. This hasn’t always been the case- I used to be fairly active, and won a lot of swimming competitions when I was a teenager. By the time I was 17 or so, I had went from a fairly athletic person to an obese one. I don’t really overeat as a coping mechanism anymore, so I’m not putting on more weight, but I’ve still got a significant amount to lose.

It seems fairly simple, and I have a non-depressed relative who managed to lose a lot of weight easily enough, but my depression always gets in the way. The most important part of weight loss, to my knowledge, is being disciplined. However, that doesn’t exactly help you get started. I struggle to get out of bed a lot of days, and hell, I’ve been sitting around unable to work up the will to do anything for more than an hour before making this post. I’m taking medication, but I’m on a very low dosage and I’ve not been able to get an appointment to get it put up to a level where it has a more noticeable effect. 

On top of that stuff, I’ve discovered that when I do manage to get myself to exercise, I find it almost mind-numbingly tedious. Doesn’t matter whether it’s something I find easy (like walking), or something more intense (such as using an exercise bike), part of the reason is struggle with it is because I don’t seem to be able to do anything else with my mind when I’m doing any kind of physical activity. I really struggle getting myself to do stuff I really enjoy or find stimulating (like painting, for example)- how on Earth am I supposed to get myself to do something that I hate?

I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice or tips. Being able to look the way I want, not be gasping for breath every time I walk up a flight of stairs, and just generally not feel like I’m constantly lugging around several stone worth of useless extra weight would mean a lot to me, but as it stands I struggle to make myself do *anything.*

Thank you for reading, and apologies if the above isn’t too legible.",17Jul2020,1
30,"I.. i dont know what im doing here. I've tried everything from getting professional help, meds, writing poetry and talking to friends. Its strange. Every time i cross a road i feel like im still in the middle of it, waiting for aomething to hit me. I go out for a smoke and look at rooftops and see myself just on the edge of one, flying a little paper airplane with a final message written on it just before i jump and everything goes black. I feel numb to both things ive just said, im ok with them. The feeling they give me is something close to a feeling i could descibe as absolute numbness and peace. And still i dont know what im doing here. I dont know if this was some kind of impule to maybe reach out to a stranger who might tell me something i dont know, or havent thought of. While at the same time i dont even know if i want help anymore. But if theres any out there, i guess im all ears.",17Jul2020,1
31,"Hi. This is sort of long, I guess.

I was molested by a family member when I was 10 and 11 (yeah, 2 years), this person was also a minor. I could not really understand it or what to do about it, I think I knew in my head it was wrong. Since then, this person has transformed, he and I are quite close now and he has apologised for what he did, and he has made amends in our relationship now. I have never talked about this to anyone because I had never processed it before, but I am being reminded of it repeatedly the past 5 or so months. Every time I recall that experience, I cry for hours on end.

Recently, I watched this horror TV series called The Exorcist (not the movie) where the demon is portrayed as an older man, who tries to possess the younger sister in a family and they have creatively shown this process of possession as stages in an abusive/toxic relationship. So he starts off by creating situations that drain her emotionally, and provides support, slowly gets her away from her support system like her family, makes her think he is the one who will always be there for her, and then the abuse/possession starts. I watched this series like 2 months ago, but I still think about this old man. I was majorly spooked by him, sure the horror was part of the reason, but majorly everything what he did, all the insecurities he banked on are something that I have. After watching this series, I became sure that I could really easily enter in a toxic relationship, because in the past I have not fought back when someone did try to harass me (first paragraph)

And since that realisation, I have struggles with feeling safe. When the pandemic got serious and the lockdown happened, I got paranoid about keeping every surface clean. At night, when I get up to use the bathroom, I am terrified someone will be there in the living room waiting to hit me or assault me. And if I go out, there will be someone there who wants to assault me. It sounds completely insane, I realise that but it's a very real fear that's manifested into my life and is sabotaging my health now. And I know people try to associate safety to a particular person, but I don't wanna do that, I want to feel safe by myself, in my own head. I have been learning a bit of self defense too, but it hasn't helped.",17Jul2020,1

35,"So I’m just going to say it. My mom is addicted to the sleep medication Ambien and the anti anxiety drug Ativan. She has been for years. Whenever she takes too much of either one she becomes a loopy, unstable b**** and often screams and throws things for no reason. I’ve been dealing with this since u was in middle school. I’ve had talks with her about it, about all the cruel things she says and does when she’s on the drugs. Once sober she says she cares and will try harder to be better but she never is. 

For those of you who might say: It’s not THAT bad, they are only sleeping pills - let me tell you some of the stuff she has done. 

1) she got mad I hadn’t brushed my hair yet that day and she wanted to do it herself (she always pulls out half my head when she does - not gentle at all) and when I refused she chased me literally around the outside of the house with a butter knife yelling she was going to call the cops on me and have me arrested. 

2) she woke up at 4 in the morning and I was sleeping. Obviously hung up on Ambien (even though she had lied and told me she didn’t have it) she stormed in the room and woke me up. She demanded that I call in to her work and lie about her being sick so she could get out of work the next day. When I told her I didn’t know the number she called me a “stupid little b****” and she pushed me back into the kitchen wall. I got angry and pushed her back (not nearly as hard as she pushed me) because of the pills she was so off balanced she fell and hit her shoulder. She then laid on the floor and started screaming that I had tried to kill her and that she wished I was dead. Then she suddenly reached up, opened our knife drawer and tried to grab a knife. Luckily my older sister stopped her before she could. Then she demanded my sister take her to the hospital all the time screaming that I had tried to kill her. When they got back from the hospital I learned she had told the nurses that I had woken her up at 4 that morning because I was watching tv too loud in the living room. She had come out to ask me to turn it down and I had gotten angry and pushed her down because of it. That was not true at all!!! She then spent the next night continually asking my sister over and over exactly what she said to the doctors, making sure my sister never mentioned she was in the Ambien. 

Aside from making my mom mega-b****, the pills also make her extremely clumsy. I always have to watch out for her because she is constantly falling and hurting herself. Well right now I am away from her attending my uncle’s memorial while she’s at home w the Ativan. Last night my sister called me and told me surprise surprise my mom fell and hurt her knee. Again. They went to the hospital (which she works at) and she ended up tearing a muscle in her knee and might need surgery. Now she’s going to be out of work for at least a month. And they prescribed her Oxycodone as a pain med. (which I’m super freaking out about because she’s already shown that she can get addicted to pills and I know that one is especially addicting). 

I’m also freaking out because we can not afford for her to be out of work for an entire month. We just can’t. I’m freaking out about how we are going to pay the bills. Plus, and a little selfishly, I’m upset because we were supposed to go on vacation for my birthday in two weeks. We had plans to go to the beach. Now we can’t. Even if she was able to walk on her leg it would be irresponsible for us to spend that money when we should put it towards bills. I wouldn’t be so upset if this was a one year thing but stuff like this ALWAYS happens on my birthday. The year before last my mom again was doped up on Ambien and got into a huge screaming match with my little sister. And I mean H U G E. Then last year, again doped up on pills, my mom spent my entire birthday on the couch like the living dead. I didn’t get a happy birthday, a cake, any presents. I just had to spend the day on the couch with my mother making sure she was ok and didn’t hurt herself. 

Am I being selfish for being so upset about all of this? I’m really just tired of it all. I’m tired of being put in this position where the pills constantly come before me and my feelings. I’m tired of feeling like I don’t matter. Like the world is on my shoulders. It’s like a huge weight crushing me. I don’t think I can handle much more of it. I honestly don’t.",17Jul2020,1
36,"so basically I kept telling her to go home, we're neighbors btw, and it was cause I wanted to talk to random people on discord. I regret it now. I wish I had been with her because now we are t even speaking. it's been over a month and I asked if she would like to come over and hang out, with my other friend. she simply said no. not even giving an excuse, or saying sorry I don't rlly want to. it was just a no and that broke my heart. I think I know what I did wrong but what should I do? should I confront her? because I don't know what the exact reason is so I don't want to start off by saying I don't know what I did but sorry. cause that just seems like I'm saying sorry cause I want to forgive and forget. maybe I'm overthinking. but she doesn't even text me anymore. I would like advise on what I should to pls and thank you :/",17Jul2020,1

Look at my page for more of a background on my situation. To give everyone a quick background, I found my wife sexting a coworker. She ended up telling me that she wanted to meet with him and have sex. I agreed and even tried to accept it. They met up a few weekends ago and then met up again this last weekend. I tried to like it, I tried to be happy for her, and I tried to make her happy. She just kept showing that she really didn’t care for me. First of all, she would not let me set boundaries for them. I told them that I wasn’t comfortable with things and that they needed to stop or at least put a few boundaries in. She refused saying that it wasn’t for me to say what they can or can’t do. 

This past weekend is what really did it in for me. She left Saturday morning without showing a care for me in the world. She made me take pictures of her to send to the guy before she left. She left without even giving me a kiss. At first she explained that she would be back that night. Nighttime cane and she was nowhere to be seen. The next morning she tells me that she decided to stay the night with him, without even asking or telling me first. That’s not even the worst part. That night he invited over one of his friends and she messed around with both of them. She didn’t even care to ask me about that first. When she arrived back at the house she told me all of this stuff. I started to get visibly upset. She laughed and said get over it and that it’s not manly. 

I couldn’t put up with it any more. She obviously no longer cared for me. No spouse would say anything like this to their partner if they actually cared for them. I was just shocked. At no point in our marriage until the other week did I notice any signs that she would be this way. She had always been the most loving, caring girl that I had ever met. It’s like a flip switched when she met that guy and she changed into a different person. I didn’t know one person could change someone that much and that quickly. I’m 99% sure that she is going to end up dating this guy. She has spent the past few weekends together with him and even talks about him around me. 

The other night I told her that if she doesn’t at least put in boundaries that I will leave. She said “ok” and laughed a lot. Without saying another word I packed up some bags and booked a room at the nearest hotel. I’ve told my brother about this situation and he has offered for me to come stay with him for a little while. I ended up going to his place for the night. She sent me some texts that night and the next day. She was acting upset and confused as to why I left and she was saying that she missed me.

The next day I knew we needed to go back to my house, so that there wouldn’t be as much of a chance that I would lose it. My brother went with me to help. When we got there my wife was trying to talk to me. I had nothing to say to her at the moment so I just ignored her and tried to get past her. She was grabbing me and trying to hold me. My brother helped get her off of me and told her that he would call the cops if she didn’t stop messing with me. She ended up leaving. I haven’t heard from her since. 

This situation has destroyed me. I tried to let her do this to make her happy. I didn’t want it in the first place, but I tried to make myself like it to please her. I never saw any signs or anything that she would be this manipulative and this bad of a person before we got married. I don’t know where any of this came from. She was the most amazing, thoughtful person ever.

Now that this has happened, my whole outlook on life and relationships is different. So what advice would you guys give me? Whether it’s next steps in dealing with my current wife or in the future when I’m back in the dating game.
How do I tell our families and friends? How do I speak to my wife about it?

I’m having a really tough time handling all of this. I don’t recall a point in my life where I have felt this low.",17Jul2020,1

39,"Hello. My name is X. I'm 21 years old. I was clinically diagnosed with PTSD 7 years ago. Eventually my anxiety worsened and now I have severe anxiety and schizophrenia. I've been taking meds for the last 6 years and officially stopped last year... all because I lied I was okay.

Weird experience honestly.

During the first 2 years (2014-2016) of my PSTD, I was much better. The constant wave of fear subsided. I could still normally go out without a problem (except the occassional panic attacks), nothing too extreme.

But on year 3 (2017) everything started going downhill. See, I was in college majoring international studies but I shifted to arts. I was much happier with my course now. I had no doubts or regrets shifting courses. 

However. My anxiety suddenly spiked. I wasn't taking meds everyday anymore (after a few trips to my psychiatrist he cut it down to 3-4 times a week). And I think I was becoming dependent on the meds. I wasn't feeling much better than year 1 and 2. I was getting worse. Much much more worse.

I can't go out the house without the heavy sense of dread. Just the idea of stepping outside to buy something across the street requires every once of courage I have. My anxiety attacks grew way worse to the point that I always almost faint unless someone helps me to stay grounded, and that doesn't happen a lot since I commute alone to my university. 

I don't want this anymore. Living in fear is not the kind of life I wanted. This is not how I envisioned my future to be. I'm graduating soon and I'm so worried about getting a job with my mental health. 

And what bothers me the most is my family. My mom and dad has been more than supportive, same goes with my two brothers. They're always to cautious around me. Making sure I was okay in which it made me do something bad... I fake my health around them. Telling them I'm okay. Reassuring them that I'm really just a big introvert that's why I don't go out much or I refuse to eat out with them.

I feel guilty. I feel like throwing up whenever I lie to them. But seeing their smiling faces whenever I'm cheery and playful is so much better than seeing them cry and feel like bad family members whenever they see that I'm sunken and depressed.

So, now I'm stuck.

I want to tell them how I feel. How much pain, emptiness, loneliness I have been feeling these past few years. I want to tell them the truth. But the truth will hurt... I want to avoid that as much as possible.

Ah, this is too complicated. I'm sorry to whoever is reading this. My life is too dramatic haha. 

Anyway, I need advice. I want to do therapy. Like with a psychologist not a psychiatrist. I want therapy without meds. I want to somehow manage my fear even if it takes forever. I'm willing to take every step of the way... I just... want to feel 'normal' again. Even just a little bit.

What should I do?",17Jul2020,1

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder at the age of 13 and was prescribed Zoloft. Since then, now 18, I decided to stop taking medication in the last year due to my majorly improved control over my depression/anxiety and to stop the weight gain. Since then (almost an exact year) I’ve lost 25+ lbs, been able to stop depressive episodes before they increase, and manage my anxiety...all until this last month. I’m a 2020 highschool graduate who it just hit that things wont be the same, my boyfriend of 6 months and I decided to end things so he could take care of his newly diagnosed bipolar disorder, and I had to last minute leave my community college (due to issues with my major) and move to a 4 year school for my first year which now is going to rack up 26K in debt per year with minimal help from my family, and lost my job of three years from COVID. I lost my one friend that I kept all throughout high school and the person who I thought was the love of my life suddenly is diagnosed bipolar and I have to allow him to take care of himself. My family doesn’t understand my anxiety and pushes me to resume medications calling me psycho without them but I’ve decided I’d like to either try and handle things myself or only take a medication as needed. I’m not sure if things just hit all at once and I’m reacting in a depression which I haven’t had since before I was on medication or if I’m just extremely anxious. I have no motivation whatsoever to get up in the morning and only feel like the days where I have scheduled appointments or plans are productive and then I come back home and stare at the wall in my room or cry myself to sleep with panic for everything around me and losing people around me. I’ve been trying to distract myself with social media or projects but I get bored easily and leave them behind. 
In my head I’m telling myself it’s not a big deal and I can get over it but I’m not sure what to do. I discussed with my family talking to a therapist (which is perfectly fine) and I think would help, but I leave in a month for school. I’m really not sure what to do or if a schedule might help me?

50,"Hi, I'm kind of new to reddit and have slowly been understanding the ways of it. I kind of just lurk around. 

I feel like here is a perfect place to ask this and have a conversation with some. 

My thing is, I don't know if I have depression. 80% of the day I feel fatigued/extremely sad and more now that I'm on summer vacation and can't really do much. 
I'm constantly thinking about my problems but I know they aren't problems that don't have a solution or are life threatening problems. 
As well, I know I have it way easier than a lot of people in the world. 
 Either way, I can't stop stressing over them and worrying. 
I also just feel like the only way in my life I'll ever have a moment of no stress  or finally feel happiness is if I were dead. I think about death quite a lot, like I would just like to evaporate. 
I also believe depression runs in my family, my late grandmother had depression and so does my mom. 

Are these flags of depression? 
(Btw as I write this I can't help but think about that meme that says: ""how are psych students depressed, just look at your notes."" But I just feel like what I feel isn't ""strong"" enough to be considered depression or isn't important enough.)
