0,"I am in a lot of IRS debt, under $45,000 in credit debt, lost my business of 6 years due to changes in regulation that were mostly political, lost my wife because I wasn't able to reach out for 9 months.

I'm now getting a divorce, and she's convinced I never cared - so she's just ready for me to be out and I stupidly signed paperwork that said I would by the 24th (I get $500 more dollars if I move out earlier, isn't that sweet...) but ultimately her father came and told me that everyone has depression and if I don't apply myself well he'll just come with a few buddies and move my things for me, to the street. It's his house he says, and he's right.

My family doesn't have room for me and has its own mental scars from the cult scientology. They are conspiracy theorist to a maximum, anti-vax, anti-mask, chemtrails, lizard people, it's little wonder I was born into a cult. My childhood upraising in scientology left me with what I only recently assume might be deep gouges of dissociative behavior where even now after breaking down in front of people I didn't even know I am sitting here calm as a cucumber typing this, tears staining my cheeks but not my fake ass smile.

My doom is divorce papers with a time-line to move out. I have about $1500 to my name in cash, but about $3500 in reasonable sellable assets, maybe $5000 if I wanted to deprive myself of everything I own that I can make money with (computer, camera).

I feel like I have nothing but material things, I still want to love myself and I am just starting to understand who I am but it's happening at such a hard point in my life. I have such a fear of medication because of scientology too, it's amazing how knowing all my problems doesn't actually make them easier to get past. Unreasonable anxieties that plague my brain, sitting here overthinking everything while at the same time being powerless to move against it. I am drained, I've been doing this for my entire adult life.

I feel like I literally 'woke up' from my cult mindset, but now I'm staring down the barrel of a 45.

I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be dissociative with ALL of my problems, I want to live a full life, with friends and perhaps someone who I start things right with, one day. Every time I try to look at websites and solutions my brain turns off and I just can't focus, I don't know what's wrong with me.",16Aug2020,1
1,"I always ovethink. Sometimes I'd tell my partner to leave me because  I'm not good enough for him. He's so understanding and patient while I kept on making small fights and I don't even know why. Sometimes it gets the best of me that I just felt tired and I dont want to do anything. 

I always get jelous when his attention is somewhere else like games or friends or maybe even his family members. And when he's with them and he still wants to chat with me virtually, i get annoyed because it's either all of his attention to me or nothing at all. I know he's trying to multitask and chat me when he has time but I easily get annoyed when he doesn't reply easily because it makes me think that he's busy and I'd only be a distraction. I want him to also enjoy with other people so everytime he's hanging out, I wont chat or reply to him. I really dont know why.

I get jealous when other people can make my boyfriend laugh or smile. It's funny and I don't know why I'm doing it but when he's with other people and it makes him smile more than when he's with me, I'll easily think that Im not good enough and that I cant make him happy the way they do. That I'm just nothing in his life and that I only brought problems in his carefree life. He has put up a lot since he spent three years now of being in a relationship with me. 

Before he's very understanding and would always give me advices when I have problems but when it became a cycle, he just got tired and just let me be. It's just the same problem all over again and he changed and it's also because of me. I blame myself for everything, I'm not trying to emotionally manipulate him but I think that's what I'm  doing. 

It sucks to just jump into conclusions because I haven't been diagnosed. I lived in a country where mental health is not prioritized and talking to a psychologist means you're a crazy person. I wanted to visit a psychologist for this but because of pandemic, I can't.",16Aug2020,1
2,"I was never depressed before, i dont even know if im really depressed right now.

Whole life playing in PC was so fun for me that no matter what happened i was very happy. I also had lots of fun watching movies, series, listening to music and more.

But now its different, i met a girl a year ago and she broke up with me a month ago, we watched every movie and series together, even played online games together and listened to music together.. our time together was so much fun that now everything feels so boring, playing in PC is boring,  movies/series alone or with other friends are boring, music too, everything I do is so boring.  
Even when i go out with friends im not having fun, i feel like its pointless to go to the gym or even take showers (feeling like there is no reason to).

I dont really know if im depressed(if i am) because of losing her or because I cant get used to being without her. I kind of miss her and sometimes during the day when i play/watch stuff i have anxiety chest pain cause it reminds me of being with her.

Any advice will help (breakup advices or general advices for someone that is having a hard time to have fun in his life)

Thanks in advance",16Aug2020,1
3,"Hello.

I'm a 19 year old guy. Have been depressed almost half my life, ever since my parents divorced. I took up binge eating as a coping mechanism. I knew it was wrong, but I was so addicted to sugar and weak in the mind that I couldn't stop. I'm 424 pounds currently. Now, this year, I have an undiagnosed bout of Nausea that has gone on for over one week. I feel bloated and the antacid the Urgent Care doctor prescribes me causes me pain. I'm also more drowsy than normal. I don't know what's going on and I've been searching for an answer, but there's nothing conclusive. I'm so scared, I'm crying. I don't want to die. I want to grow up, get through college, start a family, see my grandchildren. After so many years of nothing, I finally found my reasons to live and suddenly this happens near my 20th Birthday. I love this stupid world and the things that we humans make of it. I love my mom and my dad. I love my little brother and my little sister. I don't want it all to end just like that. I realize that I'm catastrophizing but I can't stop. Please talk to me.",16Aug2020,1
4,"I’m sorry if rant isn’t the correct term, I just wanted a place to voice my thoughts and I apologise If this isn’t the place.

Over a year ago, I was in an abusive relationship. She was physically, emotionally and sexually abusive towards me.

She raped me. She broke my glasses and covered my in bruises. She purposely messed around with other guys to hurt my head and my heart. My already declining mental health just plummeted. I began to self harm again, there were whole days where I used to just lay in bed and sob because I felt so empty. She would refuse to let me sleep unless I was on call to her, she messaged my female friends and told them to fuck off, she absorbed my time completely so I lost all my other friends. My life was generally something I didn’t want to experience.

About a year and a couple months ago, my parents forced me to break up with her (17M here). Please understand, they wouldn’t usually interfere, but they were sick of seeing “my TV losing it’s colour”. 

Fast foreword to several months later, and I find someone else. A beautiful person who I have an amazing connection with. They’re the light of my life and I love them with all I am. But the love doesn’t make what happened go away. It makes me happy. 

But what happened had a severe impact. Most days I still want to open a vein because it would hurt. I want to replace my inside hurt with my outside hurt so bad. But I refuse to, because there are healthier ways of dealing with things, but why oh why oh why won’t anything make me want to stop hurting myself? 

If it was all physical, all just my problem, it would be bearable, but it’s not just me. It’s ruining the only good romantic relationship with another human I’ve ever had because my brain keeps going back to the past.

It’s my partner’s 18th soon, so as a little surprise to them, I decided to shave my nether regions. It hurt like a bitch, I’ve never really done it before but they said they like it shaven, Although I was perfectly ok the way i was. It was just their preference. The second I washed the last of my disgusting hair away, I wasn’t in my bathroom anymore.
I stood opposite my Ex, and she was laughing at me for attempting to shave my ass. She just laughed and laughed at me and reminded me I was designating and how at least the hair hid my disgusting skin. 
I had a tic (I have a motor tic disorder- Tourette’s But with movement alone) And put a sharp gash across my stomach using my nails. I then flopped down in the shower and just sat there for the better part of an hour because I just didn’t feel able to move. 

I hate that I did it, but it was an accident and I never meant to. 

And then tonight, my partner and I had a stupid blow out argument over a joke they made. There was seriousness to it, and it hurt. They joked that they’d get an Only Fans as a last resort, and we got into a full blown fight over it. I just kept remembering my ex flaunting herself for other people and it hurt so bad. I just wanted somebody to myself, Is that wrong? I know Need outweighs Want. I know they love me. I know they don’t want to. I know, I know, I know.

But I fought them anyways. I tried my best to make amends after the argument as best I could but it looks like it didn’t make them feel any better, which is understandable.

It’s been a rough day. As stupid as it sounds, the anime I was watching with my little sister got taken off of the site we used. She’s heavily autistic, and I’m slightly autistic myself. We both struggle to connect and it was one of the only ways i felt I could make a connection with her, and it’s gone. 

No matter how hard I try, things seem to go wrong. I want to open a vein, or wrap a rope around my neck. But they won’t really help, Will they?

What I really want is a hug. No body can really give me one and I feel so hollow. I just want what happened to go away, I want this to stop. Please, just make the hurt go away, I can’t do this. I don’t want to be me, but I’m stuck here. I’m stuck as me, and I don’t feel good enough regardless of what people say to me. 

Thank you for listening, I’m sorry it was so long.",16Aug2020,1
5,"I \[26F\] tried to imagine what a future life with my girlfriend\[34F\] would be like. We haven't been together long, just a couple of months, and it was more idle fantasy after we had talked today about maybe someday we could live together somewhere nice. 

Neither of us are talking about moving in yet, this was just nice what-if thoughts. But I was bored so I looked up real estate in her area and while I own a home where I live, she lives in a significantly more expensive place. 

I quickly realized I would never be able to afford a home for us, her moving here is not an option, and as she's disabled, her finances are delicate at best. 

But then everything else started to come flooding in. How I'm way too ugly for her, and she'll eventually realize I'm too immature/dumb/neurotic, or any of the other massive flaws that make up my excuse for a personality. And even if she decided she still liked me anyway, I couldn't imagine meeting her family, who are all older and have professional careers and families and lives, and I'm just... a stalled out uneducated socially awkward mess. 

I can't imagine any viable future where I'm not a burden or detracting from her quality of life, or at best a dirty little secret never to be shown the light of day. 

I can't imagine myself having a future with anyone though. 

My biggest dream in life is to get married and have a nice place to live and be comfortable. But I can't imagine anyone wanting that with me, I bring nothing to the table, I'm an absolute burden, and disgustingly ugly. 

I just feel like I want to find a dark well and hide myself at the bottom of it. I know I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, my therapist has talked about getting me into see someone about maybe a bipolar disorder, but I lost all my financial ability to continue therapy, so I just feel lost and like there isn't a future for me anywhere.",16Aug2020,1
7,"Depressed after move

Last October (2019), my fiancé and I moved from Seattle to Minneapolis to allow her to pursue a new job. We met in Seattle in March 2018, shortly after my move from my hometown in IL to Seattle. I traveled a lot for work, so my time in Seattle was limited, but when I was home on weekends we did a lot of different things. At the time, I thought I wanted the American Dream of owning a house, a backyard, have a dog, and own a truck. I couldn’t wait to leave Seattle, and move to MSP (her hometown), where we could afford the American Dream. 10 months removed from the move, and all I want to do is move back to Seattle. 

I struggle with missing aspects of Seattle I didn’t know I would, scenery, weather, things being new for the both of us, and my old job. I took a new job in MSP and am no longer traveling for work (permanently, not because of COVID). My mind is constantly thinking about Seattle and how much I miss it. My fiancé has made it clear she is not going back, so I just feel alone and as if my life is over. Idk if I’m glorifying Seattle or am truly unhappy in my current situation. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I have no desire going anywhere or doing any of the hobbies I once loved. I feel like I’m so far in this hole and utterly hopeless. I had a very traumatic childhood and experienced a lot of loss and abuse and I don’t think I know any healthy coping mechanisms and don’t know where to begin with helping or loving myself. I feel worthless and disappointed in myself, which makes me want to isolate further from everyone. I’m just very sad and wish I could feel happiness, even for one day. I’m tired of waking up every morning and sometimes feel it’d be easier not waking up. I used to feel excitement about things and had motivation and I can’t even remember what either of those things feel like. I don’t know how to help myself.

11,"I married my high school sweetheart earlier in the fall, and all I can say is... we always had a toxic relationship. Hell, he was very emotionally manipulative and emotional. But we had history. We were best friends. I loved him so, so much, and on top of that, he was my first everything. So I was blind to the facts, indeed.

Within two weeks of getting married and moving in (no wedding btw) we were already bickering and fighting like crazy. He always started them, and admitted so. 90% of it was over his family. They hated me and severely verbally abused and harassed me over the course of our relationship. The fact he was a mommy’s boy who refused to defend me and also a chronic liar caused a LOT of fights. 

He would use our marriage as a threat. So it lost its meaning. Always threatening with divorce. He loved to make me cry in front of my family members. They ended up despising him and refused to have him over ever again. So both family ties were severed.

Then one fateful night, he pulled me down to the basement for a “talk”. He then put me under the worst psychological “test” I could possibly thing of. That triggered my depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Simply put, imagine you’re severely abused, feeling weak and worthless, trying to seek the good in a failing marriage, and you’re hauled down in a basement and told “I want a divorce. I don’t love you the same anymore.” Then be shoved, pushed, until you’re a sobbing mess, begging him, trying to hold onto him—who is as stiff and emotionless as stone. Then he tells you “it was a test to see if you still loved me”, goes about his night, then asks for sex. Pretends like nothing happened afterwards. 

The next morning I awoke feeling devastated. Several times he threatened to quit his job if I didn’t forgive him over a scream fest fight within 24 hours. Horrible things texted to me on the phone while I’m in a Uni lecture. So? I fell out of love with him. I didn’t even want to touch him anymore. I slept with him because he expected intimacy every night, and I just wanted 1 orgasm so I could call it a day... 

I stopped putting effort in our marriage. He would call me horrible names. Soon after he began hoarding weapons in the house. I essentially realized a married a homicidal maniac obsessed with violence, war, bloodshed, and believed in honour killings. 

I fantasized a lot about leaving him. It empowered me. I even wrote a lengthy note. I was gonna pack up my shit and leave with my parents. I was gonna file that divorce. But I didn’t get a chance to get rid of the weapons, so, once he found out I wanted to leave, he held me at gun point. 

Lots of trauma and the SWAT team raiding the house later... Here I am. 21 and divorced. I SHOULD feel empowered but those feelings are GONE. I feel NOTHING towards him but I’m severely depressed. I have to keep doing *something* to get through the day. So far that’s been going shopping for 3-4 hours, blowing money, gaming, and going to sleep. Crying myself to sleep because I never knew what it was like to have a loving marriage. 

I feel so pathetic and low. I have no close friends I can talk to because I lost them all due to him. Because of COVID-19 and lack of transportation means, I can’t get the mental help I need. I desperately wish I had a partner and was in love. I feel like that’s MISSING and I’m just absolutely MISERABLE with myself. I hate him and I’m glad he’s going to jail, but my mind often thinks of the “what ifs” and paints different scenarios. 

All I wanted was a peaceful and happy marriage. Now I’m unintentionally basing my worth off a romantic partner. Every night I fucking cry myself to sleep and have terrible nightmares of what he did to me. He stained every part of my life and because we were together for so long and I was used to having a romantic and sexual partner no matter how much he mistreated me, I feel like shit and can’t adapt to being alone.

14,"First of all, I’m 13 so don’t take me that seriously, and my parents are divorced (will come up later). Anyway, as I went into 7th grade almost everything stopped. I had a lot of people that made me laugh and made me feel welcomed. Now I have 2. I had my stepbrother, but he branched off. My dad makes me happy, but my stepmom makes it not worth it. I love my moms house but I don’t wanna hurt my dad. I’m not gonna say my dad doesn’t love me or anything, but some days I won’t eat and he won’t say a word. My mom is so much more caring for me it feels like. Now, it feels like my stepmom made my dad less concerned about me. For example, 3 years ago when I would stay up all night, he would ask me what was wrong (it had a reason but that’s irrelevant right now), now it’s just “stop staying up so late” my mom is what my dad was. My stepdad is the other type of dad I never had. My 2 friends are great but they’re gone more and more with other friends. I don’t wanna change things, but if I don’t nothing will get better. I have no motivation anymore. Even though I have no motivation,the little things my mom does makes me happy. My mom knows im bored a lot so she bought me a plant, she knows I want to eat at my computer so she taught me how to vacuum (I grew up spoiled so I never learned). She doesn’t know how to fix things but she tries, and that makes me happy. I don’t know what to do about my parents. I don’t know how to make new friends. I moved schools recently and my 2 friends are from there, but it’s hard maintaining a friendship. I don’t know how to make new friends. My new school is impossible to make friends for multiple reasons that would take up a whole other post, so that’s out of the picture. Making friends online is difficult, and it’s hard to find someone with the same personality without knowing them in person.

My dad and mom would always fight and argue all the time and I always protected and watched over my sisters but no one was there for me. One night my dad pulled a knife out and gave it to my mom and told her to stab him. Like your kid is standing right there watching..it kinda fucked me up. After many years dealing with my abusive dad my mom finnaly left him and took us and stayed with my grama. I just wasnt at a healthy state I was eating junk food, I didnt go out, I didnt give a damn about personal hygiene. But my dad tried to kill himself after us leaving and of course I cried then same with my mom. I was just so stressed being a kid and by 6th grade I started to have grey hairs. Over time more and more grey hairs would come in and I was self conscious about it and it's hard to forget about it when all the over kids would point it out and ask if I was depressed. Obviously I never told anyone I was let alone my family. Skip a couple years later I'm with my mom again with her new bf but...Everything is the same like it was when I was a kid.

19,"Hi all, I (M41) have suffered with depression since my early twenties, anxiety (although you wouldn't know if you saw me in public, I'm usually the life and soul and appear to be one of the most confident people in the room) and fatigue since my teens (CFS diagnosed mid twenties).  As always it's hard to know whether the depression causes the fatigue, the fatigue causes the depression or both.  Anxiety must be part of the fatigue as that is exhausting but none of the usual relaxation techniques etc have ever worked for me.  If anything they make me more anxious and I have a very low attention span these days which doesn't help.

So I thought it might help if I lost a bit of weight, exercised etc.  In the past exercise has never made me feel better or made me more energetic as it seemed to for the people I was with but I'm willing to give it another go.  The trouble is I generally don't enjoy exercise.  It's a chore.  I like games such as squash but, like everything in life, I struggle to maintain consistency.  If I start running for instance, I can't keep it up with any consistency.  I got an exercise bike thinking it would help to exercise in front of the TV as a distraction but hated that.  I think a treadmill would be great but I live in a top floor flat and the noise and vibrations would be a problem.

Meal planning is hard as I have a bit of a complex about that, it makes me anxious and stressed and so I try to keep it as simple as possible, thus my diet isn't great.  And again, the attention span (such as for looking for healthy recipes etc) and consistency strikes again.  Whenever I start looking at this sort of stuff, very quickly I'll feel 'Urgh' and can't continue.

Any tips on how I could keep up exercise and a healthy diet despite the barriers described above?  I basically struggle mentally to get through my day as it is.  The normal everyday things that most people probably do without thinking are a struggle for me mentally, which again leads to mental fatigue.  Therefore I haven't got the energy or tenacity to make even small changes in lifestyle with any consistency.  Most of my mental strength is taken up just getting through the day.

Went through a breakup at the start of the year and still dealing with the practical aspects of that which doesn't help.

I'm not hopeful that I can do this but any advice would be appreciated.",16Aug2020,1
20,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 20 years old but I am NOT dangerously depressed just lonely, sort of like a void, an emptyless pit where I'm constantly sad for a long time. I've often been very caring and considerate to many people but often times I've been bullied to the point where I had suicidal tendencies but overcame albeit where when I was young was very sympathetic to many people but as I grew up I came more bitter, hateful, vindictive and prone to angry outbursts. I was all alone when I grew up never got to know what it means to grow by a loving family but as I matured I got to know this kind of lifestyle is unhealthy so I no longer latch onto anger anymore. 

I simply wish to forgive and forget as anger does not help anyone. However, as I was bullied so often I was never able to love anyone the way most people do, as most who were interested in me just used me for their own goals, they never comforted, never helped me when I was at my lowest, I was for all intents and purposes utterly and completely alone. So now I'm constantly put down emotionally as I've got noone to help me through but I also want to live my life to the fullest, this constant sadness sort of makes me feel like I'm sort of defected and wish someone could operate on my brain and pull out the worst bits of personality, a weird hope ik.

 I just want to know is there something I can do to help me with this sadness? I've always wanted to be with people who were always so full of life and happiness who could brighten anyone's days but I've never got to know such altruistic people, to me life always dealt me with more shitty people that sometimes I think there are no more selfless people just self-absorbed narcissistic assholes who like to use people for their own goals!",16Aug2020,1
21,"I’m gonna be honest, my situation is very generic and I feel like I don’t deserve to be sad, however, I really want help. Here we go.

So recently I’ve found out that I may be anemic. (Not 100% but I have pretty much all of the symptoms.) It’s also completely my fault, I can’t motivate myself to do **anything** and sometimes I can barely get out of bed, but that’s not what I’m asking help for, it’s just for context. 

So I’ve always struggled with my weight, I’ve always been picked on for being “the fat kid”, I’m not special I know. I want to lose weight mire than words can describe, but I just can’t get myself to do it. I’ve always used food as a coping mechanism, so I know it’s my fault that I am the way that I am, but here’s the main issue: I eat when I’m sad, but when I eat I get sad, so then I eat again because I’m sad about eating. I’m stuck in this endless cycle of hell and I just can’t fucking stop. I have clinical depression, but I know for a fact that if I lost weight, I’d be 1,000,000x more happy. I’m not even like morbidly obese, my parents wouldn’t let me get that bad, but I just can’t stand looking in the mirror and seeing my chubby cheeks and my stupid fucking double chin. All my friends and family are a perfect weight except my dad and I. I just can’t stand it anymore. From a front angle, I’m ugly, but it’s not that bad. From a side angle though? I look like a fucking fat Skrillex. I look in the mirror and I start fucking bawling because of how atrocious I look. I know looks aren’t everything, in fact, I don’t give a flying fuck what other people look like! It’s just me! I constantly think of ending it all because I feel like I’m gonna be stuck looking like this forever. (I am safe. I have people who live with me, and they have made sure that I don’t have access to anything dangerous, don’t worry.)

I know it's not my fault, but I blame myself for this thing that happened. Some people deliberately spread lies about me which caused other people I looked up to to change their view on me. I had no opportunity to defend myself and I feel hurt and confused why they treated me so poorly. I'm looking for answers I guess I'll never get.

I was off anti-depressants for a few weeks but went back on them last week due to what's been happening lately. I went to my GP to discuss everything in detail, but he has no help for my anxiety and wants me to wait until my old medication kicks back in (My old medication apparently acts as an anti-anxiety medication too). I started to take CBD oil earlier this week for my severe anxiety. It works, but only when my anxiety is extremely bad.

I rarely overthink, but it's been happening all the time lately. I'm also feeling very weak from not eating, ill, and just physically cold. Can't stand up for longer than a minute or I feel dizzy. I'm honestly even afraid to sleep. Everything gives me anxiety. For the last while I've only showered once a week I've been feeling so down.

My mood is swinging massively. One moment I'm happy, a minute later I'm extremely anxious/sad. I've even been having panic attacks once every couple hours. It's been well over a year since I've last experienced them, but they're swarming me.

I'm going back to college again soon, and I guess I'm worried my anxiety will mess it all up. I'm having counselling but I'm considering stopping it. It's over the phone because of the virus and I don't feel like it's working well for me at all.

It's starting to make me pretty depressed, and I've honestly been crying a lot because of it. I'm thinking of getting hospitalised, but because of Covid I can't have visitors. This alone makes me pretty hesitant to go to a hospital, but I'm still considering it.

Not sure why I'm really writing this post. I feel overwhelmed a bit, this time last month I was feeling incredible, but it's all changed on such short notice. I guess I just feel a bit lost/alone (maybe I want to vent a bit?) and I'm looking for support in any way. I'm not sure what to do to get out of this situation. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. Thank you for reading.",16Aug2020,1

**REPOST BECAUSE I POSTED ON THE WRONG ACCOUNT BEFORE, SO SORRY!!**


I’m 14, female, and I’m gonna be honest, my situation is very generic and I feel like I don’t deserve to be sad, however, I really want help. Here we go.

So recently I’ve found out that I may be anemic. (Not 100% but I have pretty much all of the symptoms.) It’s also completely my fault, I can’t motivate myself to do **anything** and sometimes I can barely get out of bed, but that’s not what I’m asking help for, it’s just for context. 

So I’ve always struggled with my weight, I’ve always been picked on for being “the fat kid”, I’m not special I know. I want to lose weight mire than words can describe, but I just can’t get myself to do it. I’ve always used food as a coping mechanism, so I know it’s my fault that I am the way that I am, but here’s the main issue: I eat when I’m sad, but when I eat I get sad, so then I eat again because I’m sad about eating. I’m stuck in this endless cycle of hell and I just can’t fucking stop. I have clinical depression, but I know for a fact that if I lost weight, I’d be 1,000,000x more happy. I’m not even like morbidly obese, my parents wouldn’t let me get that bad, but I just can’t stand looking in the mirror and seeing my chubby cheeks and my stupid fucking double chin. All my friends and family are a perfect weight except my dad and I. I just can’t stand it anymore. From a front angle, I’m ugly, but it’s not that bad. From a side angle though? I look like a fucking fat Skrillex. I look in the mirror and I start fucking bawling because of how atrocious I look. I know looks aren’t everything, in fact, I don’t give a flying fuck what other people look like! It’s just me! I constantly think of ending it all because I feel like I’m gonna be stuck looking like this forever. (I am safe. I have people who live with me, and they have made sure that I don’t have access to anything dangerous, don’t worry.) 

TL;DR: I eat cause I’m sad, I’m sad cause I eat, and then I eat cause I’m sad that I ate. Please help.",16Aug2020,1
27,"So I’m 15,male and I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I want to make it very clear that I’m not saying I have depression but that it is a possibility. 
I just want to get some stuff off my chest because idk what to do with myself. 
Since I was about 12/13 I’ve started to have these big mood swings where I’d go from a happy person with a small secure friend group who would talk about pretty much anything, to someone who exists on the outside of the group who doesn’t speak and tries to hide as much as possible. People started to notice and asked what’s wrong but of course I just said I was fine and not to worry. It’s my problem not theirs. Why should they care? 
I did eventually end up speaking to some friends about it and giving them like updates on what was going on and they would listen and support which I really appreciated. 
This continued for a few years during which the sadness got longer and worse. To the point where I would have days where I convinced myself that I didn’t deserve food and wouldn’t eat for the day. Some days I wouldn’t get out of bed for hours until I was forced to or I just struggled to do basic things and it almost felt like I lost control of my body. I would tell myself to get up and I couldn’t. There was no point. So I think about 2 years in I went to speak to my school nurse. I found it so hard to talk about my mental health and I wouldn’t be able to get the words out and just tear up. I was told that it was just hormones and it would stop soon, which I believed. So I just dealt with it for another year by doing things I really regret doing. 
Then I was told by someone I was close with that me telling them about my mental state was effecting them too. I felt awful. I never meant for that to happen and I’m so sorry to this day for it. I stopped talking to them and moved on slowly. Now we’re in 2020 and covid cut my school year short (I was in year 11 and was going to do my GCSE’s). I’ve been on school for months now and honestly I’ve been a lot better. I’ve had some times where I’d slip back to a dark place and feel hopeless but most the time it was fine. 
Then I was talking to a friend online and they said something I don’t want to say but it wasn’t anything massive. This just made me ‘relapse’ (idk what else to call it) and since then I’ve just been thinking awful things about myself and I think it’s time that I spoke out. 
This is my first reddit post so sorry if I did anything wrong.
I know this is also probably a very generic case.",16Aug2020,1
28,"I just want to believe I'm not awful and I'm worthy of love and attention but - something about that is completely at odds with what I feel to be true. :(

Platitudes and reassurances welcome.",16Aug2020,1
29,"First off my friends are incredibly supportive and loving. Genuinely great people. I do legitimately mean they did nothing wrong and there isn't any gaslighting or secretly toxic BS going on. I just have the wonderful experience of my depression triggers being inconsistent.

Sometimes I'll feel left out of a conversation even when it's not the case and I'll start to spiral. Sometimes a teasing joke that would have been fine and made me laugh any other day has me spiraling.

But the big reason I'm asking this is: my best friend and I have been single for several years. We've been commiserating together a bunch. Recently she's started dating a new mutual friend of ours. I'm absolutely ecstatic for her! Her last relationship was absolute shit and our new friend is a great dude and I'm so happy for her. But I'm also a bit jealous. She was the only other friend of mine that was single and now I'm the odd one out. Sometimes it hurts to listen to her tell me that she's got a date or how happy he's making her. But I also don't want her to stop telling me these things. She's my best friend and I've wanted her to find someone who makes her this happy and I wanna hear about it. But it also makes me sad sometimes.

If I end up spiraling she'll ask if she did anything and even if the answer is technically yes, I tell her no because she did nothing wrong. She just told me something good and I'm the jealous prick getting upset over a situation that isn't even about me.

Is there anything you guys do to help yourself stop spiralling when there's nothing wrong going on?",16Aug2020,1
30,"Hii...I'm new here so I thought a little introduction would be a good start. Um..My name is Adda, I'm 18 years old and I've been dealing with depression since I was 14. It got only worse day by day but I'm still trying to be as positive as I can. I have lot of trust issues, also anxiety and panic attacks..
I joined this group hoping that I could find some motivation and also maybe make some friends..👉👈",16Aug2020,1
31,"I don’t know if this is where this goes. If someone does please direct me to the right place to post this. 

I’m currently going through a lot and don’t know what to do. I didn’t have the best life growing up nor did I have the best parents or parents that made the best decisions. Unfortunately I’m still trying to pick up the pieces to what they did/didn’t do and get myself up from the bottom.

I am 26 yrs old and will be 27 in a few months. Going to school and working full time is very hard and I can’t split the time between the two. I never had a support system at all. My job I have now has me super stressed out and I have lost hair due to this job and the stress that it creates. 

I’m tired of getting nickel and dime for a paycheck and not having anything to live off of just about. It really saddens me and puts me into depression that most of my twenties have been wasted and this pandemic is not making it any better. I had everything all planned out for this year and unfortunately nothing is going as planned.

I’ve had thoughts of becoming a stripper just so I wouldn’t have to skimp for money and be able to provide for myself and not be stressed out. Unfortunately one of my aunts husband made sexual advancements at me when I was a child and that has left me scarred for life. I also have negative thoughts about stripping, “morals, and worries. The worries are basically me being worried if a man wouldn’t want to marry me, because of that... the morals are just some of the things that I grew up off of (morals get in the way of a lot of things and I sometimes hate that I have them).

I don’t want to think that, but I know life would possibly be hard for me and I don’t want to say that or think that, but I sometimes think suicide would be easier than this because this would be all gone and I don’t have to worry about it... but I don’t want to die. 

My life is a fucking mess. I don’t have a family unit and no one cares about me and to top it all off I can’t make friends for the life of me. I’m the sweetest person. Who wants to be lonely sitting by themselves all of their life. It might be good for a moment/little while to get yourself together, but it’s not meant for you to be by yourself. But ppl are consumed by greedy these days though we all feel the same emotions.

The advice up here is not the best and counselor’s, therapist, and psychologist do not work or give the best advice. I don’t know I’m all out... I don’t know what to do.",16Aug2020,1

40,"Hi all, 

  
I'm new here. I just wanted to reach out for some advice in regards to the last few months - but first, I need to give a little context to what has been happening before I ask the question: 

  
As we are all aware, the global pandemic (Miss Rona), has come through with a bang. As a result, I'm finding myself considerably more isolated. As someone who is a combination of extrovert and introvert (more leaning to extrovert), this whole separation from family and friends has hit me incredibly hard.   
In addition to this, I started a new job on the 16th March, after finally escaping a customer service job I had for 5+ years, and the next day was working from home, where I have been ever since. I've found that the imposter syndrome that is standard for new jobs has stayed but now has mixed into this sort of depression and anxiety about my place in the world and in my new job.   
I haven't left the house, I haven't met up with friends (even though apparently everyone else is doing it) and I haven't seen my grandparents in 5 months. If that wasn't enough, the BLM protests and the upsetting nature of the news spurred me to seek therapy, which I'm still doing every week over zoom....and then the news came that a friend died at the beginning of this month.   


**Now, I'm writing this all to say - does anybody have any tips or strategies for cleaning one's depression cave? (That's what I'm calling mine)....Because it has been this way now for 5 months and I don't seem to bring myself to tidy it up. The mess has now spread to the living room and the kitchen.**  


Any advice, inspiration and motivation will be greatly appreciated because I feel like I'm drowning these days...",16Aug2020,1
41,"hey!
so, i’ll just start off by saying, i’m not actually sure if i genuinely have depression. i show a lot of symptoms, but at the same time i feel like i’m overreacting?? i thought this would be a good place to get advice. 

i won’t go into details about what happened, but around 7 months ago i said something really fuckin dumb, which caused me to lose my best friend, whom meant the world to me. 

honestly, everything was perfect up until that point. the past 7 months have been awful, she’s constantly in the back of my mind and i feel so hopeless. i am positive all of my friends hate me and everyone just thinks i’m an annoyance so i decided to not talk about it to them anymore. and that’s why i’m here requesting advice on reddit :’)

i don’t really have the motivation to do anything anymore. whenever i’m talking to my family i have to put on my best “im happy and everything is totally perfect!” act. i get really bad anxiety and i feel really unsafe a lot of the time, everytime i feel like i may be getting better i just end up digging myself deeper into this hell hole. 

i’m constantly apologizing for ANYTHING, feeling sad, confused, hopeless, unmotivated, worthless, anxious, unsafe, and like an annoyance.  i lash out at people i care about then cry right after because i feel bad. they have no idea that anything is even wrong. and there’s no way i’m telling them because we’re not really the type of family to have serious discussions, but rather figure them out on our own. but at the same time if i’m desperate to say something because i’ll never get help if they don’t know what’s wrong. 

so, i’d really appreciate any advice you could give me on getting out of this hell hole i’m currently trapped in. thank you 😭 also i’m really sorry if this is confusing or badly worded, it’s because it is.",16Aug2020,1
45,"I guess I'm high functioning. I keep doing my thing. It's not like I don't like it, but I'm tired because of the permanent glass ceiling that disability has imposed on me.

I cannot be seen as an equal. I cannot feel manly. I cannot really feel beautiful/ sexy. My nudes won't turn most people on. I cannot have relationship attempts – if I succeed with someone, that's it – gotta be fuckin grateful that someone loves the inexperienced bisexual wheelchair non-muscular dude that I am. I'm obliged to hope for that it seems... Oh, and keep doing what I'm doing, cause it's something I don't suck at.

Just great.

Can I please have a life? It's not my fault that I was born in a poor Eastern European country that would not bat an eye at me dying due to lack of disability care.

And it seems nothing can be done. I'll give it my all while I can so I die eventually and be forgotten. All my past traumas (dad being a violent drunk, friends leaving/ ghosting me, not going to trips/ parties bc I cause practical troubles etc.) will never be healed because my circumstances CANNOT get better.

All those ""I'm fine""s and ""hanging in there""s feel so lost. Everything that provided happiness and passion to me, like music, now feels just numb and hurting.

49,"My parents, before I was born, moved to Canada in hopes for a happier future for themselves and even a better education. A few years later I was born. I lived there until I was 4. My parents decided to move back to their home country and we moved. It's societally very different, very poor and I was very unhappy. 

The sudden culture change really got confusing for me (so says my mother). I could read, write and speak two languages when I was in Canada and apparently when we moved I got quiet. I forgot how to write and read. We never moved back. 

When school started it all made things much worse. I was never liked by my teachers and classmates. I was very lonely and felt very isolated. Its been like that ever since kindergarten, never changed a bit. 

This year I went on an exchange to Switzerland to learn a new language. I thought if I can't fit in here I probably am the problem and wouldn't fit in anywhere. But I had the best year of my life. I made so many friends and I loved every second of being there. I never felt lonely and everyday felt new. 

Due to the coronavirus I had to finish my exchange year 4 months early though.

I'm 17 now, 2 years left until I'm done with high-school. I lived most of my life here and I feel so stuck. I feel so upset. I keep comparing my past life, my current life to my exchange. I keep thinking how happy I was there and how happy i could've been if I could've stayed. 

I feel so lonely. I look at my friends who live there and see how happily they get to spend their time and have fun, live their lives. 

I've never opened up this deeply to any online platform before. I feel very spoiled by the way I sound, as if my problems are the worst but I genuinely don't know how to deal with my thoughts and feel happier anymore. It's been 5 months since my arrival. 

I'd appreciate just anyone talking this out with me. And thank you to anyone who read this far. Is there anyone out there like me? Thank you everyone.",16Aug2020,1
52,"I've been with depression and anxiety for 7 years now (since I was 12, I'm 19 now).
One of my coping mechanisms was my cat, Nina. I felt like she never judged me for why I thought, or did. She always slept with me when I was having a bad moment, making sure I was OK. She licked my tears away, and made sure I was happy.

One month ago, she went missing. Since then, I can't sleep. I always dream I find her, and I'm able to hug and feel her fur. I feel emotially drained, without being able to even cry. I don't want to, cause I know I will be crying all day long, and I need to keep moving.

My family and friends haven't support me a lot, and even my psychiatrist just told me to ""get over it"". But I just can't.

The big problem here is that there's nothing I can't hold to: I don't know if she's alive, or if she's dead. I don't have a corpse to bury, or an alive cat at home.

In less than a month, I'll have to leave my hometown to travel to where I do my university degree. I will leave my house without even knowing if my cat is alive.

I just need to know how to cope with this, cause I'm starting to have the same suicidal tendències I had when I was 14. I'm struggling with no selfharming myself, as I know it won't solve anything. It's just that I need to feel something.",16Aug2020,1

She went to the doctor to get checked and her doctor told her to raise her dosage intake every other week and she recently started doing that.

School starts tomorrow and I’m not organized I don’t even know how I’m supposed to start and how this online school thing will work out I’m constantly overthinking it and making myself nervous and this feeling I can’t describe I feel anxious and worried about everything.

I’ve been depressed for a long time and I just don’t know what to do I’m honestly clueless at this point what makes matters worse is apparently I had a summer reading assignment I had no idea about cause no one told me and it’s due in 2 weeks and I haven’t even gotten the book which just brings me more stress for that stuff I have to prepare for school today and for the first day of school tomorrow.

I feel so bad all this is stressing me out, and now there’s this different feeling sum feeling all of a sudden I was embarrassed a few days ago and I’m a sensitive person (I don’t wanna be sensitive I wanna learn how to be stronger and happier) and I feel that embarrassment screwed with my head to the point I don’t feel like myself I don’t feel like the funny, witty guy I was I feel so blank and dull, I don’t know why I feel this I just want it to end I wanna learn how to bring back my self-esteem, confidence, and happiness. 

then there’s this girl I’ve been trying to restore my friendship with everything is going well for sure but it’s just that, I don’t know I feel like the only way I can talk to her now is through the friend Group FaceTime’s. Now I’d be comfortable joining if toned my anxiety and thoughts down and if my parents weren’t always around to hear me cause I swear and say certain things on ft cause I’m a teenager. I wanna talk to her but idk if she wants to I haven’t even asked and yeah, I’m overthinking it but I just can’t stop I rather ft her alone and then there’s the thoughts of what if I’m not creative and funny enough cause of what I’m feeling currently I know I should take a step back for awhile.

I’m clueless I don’t know what to do with myself I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom  I don’t wanna feel anxious. I have a lot on my plate and I just wanna have fun and focus on myself but I can’t cause of all that’s going on and what I’m feeling how do I overcome this feeling, please anything helps.",16Aug2020,1
