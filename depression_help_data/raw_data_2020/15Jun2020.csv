0,"To give some background I'm 19m in California and have always been shy and introverted growing up. I never had many friends and never dated which led me to a suicidal depression from age 14-19.

Around February this year I decided I wanted to finally be happy, I started going to the gym and got my resume ready. And was ready to take more college classes in order to meet and make friends. As we all know around that time the lockdown began worldwide. 

I have tried my best to be positive and do my best during these forced stay at home orders. Stuff like home workouts and online class but I'm fucking sick of this. 

I want to go outside to the gym again with more equipment, I want to apply for a job, I want to go to class and learn in person. Online classes fucking blow donkey shit, I want to meet people and make friends, I want to start dating, I want to pursue more hobbies,  but this lockdown has literally stopped all of that. 

And for those saying to make friends and date online, my entire social interaction has been online my entire life I'm sick of it. I want to live my life especially when its during a time of self improvement and my youth. 

Is it selfish to want to open things up for my own benefit? Absolutely it is but you know what else is selfish? Forcing millions to stay home with 30 million unemployed unable to pay bills, forcing millions with a forced garbage online education, causing suicide, mental illness, abuse, divorce, rates to skyrocket all because of some virus which was blown out of proportion in terms of deadlines.

Both choices have massive costs but imo staying in lockdown is going to do allot more harm than good. I feel like bashing my head against a fucking wall every day this gets prolonged. I just want my life to resume so I can finally move towards being happy.

How are you all holding up? Thoughts and opinions are welcomed and appreciated.",15Jun2020,1

I’ve been depressed for a long time and I think as it would with anyone it has taken a real toll on me. I very rarely feel happy, nobody cares about me and nobody loves me. I’m ugly and I don’t have anything going for me other than being nice so girls really aren’t interested either. Being depressed has taken several different forms in my life but for close to a year I’ve just been apathetic towards everything. 

I used to care so much about fixing it, like working towards things like losing weight, saving money, being more social, anything to fix how I felt. None of it worked. None of those things helped me get a girlfriend, find people who care about me, or make me happy with myself. I feel just 100% defeated and it just seems like I’ve given up. I Don’t care about finishing my degree, I don’t care about losing weight anymore so I just maintain where I am, I don’t care about talking to people, I genuinely have nothing that I am passionate about or that I feel is worth investing myself in to.

I’ve talked about this to my therapists and in a few different posts to some extent, but I’ve never heard anything that changed how I feel. When I was talking to my therapist about this she told me about how nothing is going to change unless I really put myself out there and just talked about how I have the ability to make my life better, but when she said these things to me I just didn’t buy it. I keep an open mind always and try my best to not let bias sway me, but when she said these things to me I felt nothing. People have said similar things to me on reddit about how my life will always suck unless I take the initiative to fix it, I understand this clearly. However, I have never seen any evidence throughout my life that my work has ever equated to anything substantial. So to me it seems like a damned if you do damned if you don’t situation. My life is going to be shit forever regardless of how hard I try, so why bother putting energy I don’t have in to lost causes anymore? 

I just don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like I’m just waiting until I’m gone. I feel like I have no reason to keep going and I’m so tired of trying to convince myself that I do. I just wish that I didn’t have to deal with this stuff anymore. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.",15Jun2020,2

4,"tw: mention of suicidal thoughts. sorry it's a bit long

I'm 22 M and I have been dealing with depression since I was a kid with my earliest memories being a constant overwhelming blanket of fog and sadness in my head. I usually describe it as being like a 3.5/10 on the happiness/content scale.
 My dad was diagnosed with chronic depression years ago and I have talked with doctors who say that my depression is probably hereditary though no doctor has been willing to give me a diagnosis.
 Not to go into too many details but over my whole life i've been very conscious of the prevalent thoughts of suicide and I've tried to get help many many many times from random walk-ins to emergency visits and visits to the mental health experts in my city to psychs and other mental health professionals. 
The problem is is I've always just been sent home with contact info for other psychs to help me, medication that doesn't work/has really horrible symptoms/etc. 
I don't have any money for therapy and I think with the amount of times over the years of seeing therapists that I don't think I really can gain anything from therapy because I'm very much aware that it is my brain and not necessarily my own thoughts and lies my brain tells me that is causing the depression. 
To further help, I had a bad childhood/teen years and I have severe combined adhd and I have lots of symptoms exacerbated by those as well.

I'm taking 150 mg of sertraline (zoloft) and it's the only anti-depressants I've taken that haven't had very many negative symptoms but if I'm honest all it's done is raise me from a 3.5/10 to a 4.5/10 and when I'm alone it drops to a -10/10. and missing a dose is like Depression: Extreme Makeover Edition which is not fun when I've got a disability that makes it easy to forget.

I don't know whether to seek a new doctor and start another different medication all over again (and experience the transitional period that comes along w it) or seek out yet another therapist that doesn't help me or something else. I have pages of affirmations on my walls and surround myself on social media with positive mental health things but it doesn't stop the feeling of wet sand slowly churning in my chest or my own brain folding into itself when I'm alone. 


tldr: I need advice and somewhere to turn please help.",15Jun2020,1
5,"Currently 32 years old, Highschool graduate. Lost in life, I am married with a 6yr daughter from my wife's first marriage. I feel very unfulfilled, I have a problem expressing any emotion due to walls I have built to avoid getting hurt from past experiences in my life. I know this hurts me more and prevents me from living a healthy life and prevents me feeling the good things in life too. I know I need to see a therapist, I know I need to learn how to express myself verbally and not keep everything bottled up. I can work with all of that i therapy and I have in the past but then stopped going when I felt ""better"" turns out after a while I went back to how I was before therapy. I have no hobbies, I'm horrible when it comes to learning anything new if it doesn't come naturally I give up before I give it a real chance. I don't know what I asking or seeking i guess I needed to get this off my chest tonight and maybe a strangers pov will help shed some insight... on what, i have no idea. Due to my numbness I tend to be short fused and feel mad at the world but can't explain why I feel angry and spiteful. I feel ashamed of myself and feel like I am wasting my life, I work full time but my job brings me so feeling of self pride or accomplishments its just a job to make money and not much at that. My parents are loving and fantastic people but anytime they say they're proud of me I instantly cringe and ask myself how in the fuck could they be proud of me, I am not shit and I'm doing nothing with my life. I gotta see a therapist again, I guess that's my bottom line. This shit isn't healthy and I fear eventually ill just push everything thats good in my life away and that'll be the end of that.

21,"I didn't expect this post to be as long as it is,so I'm sorry ahead. Also I don't really understand the NSFW rules regarding the minor mentions I made, so I'm sorry if I screwed it up lol

TL;DR my life is fucked and I haven't been able to help myself for years.


In the next few month's, it'll be half my life I've dealt with depression. Soon after I turned 11, I lost my mother, my father remarried fairly quickly, and the rest of my childhood/ teens were marginally awful due to that marriage.

 I lost most of my social skills during this time, keeping few close friends but I was able to keep nice enough to stay under the radar to 90% of people. I'm not sure who I am honestly.

 Now that I'm almost 22, I have no actual friends. I have maybe one or two people I'll speak to, usually for a Snapchat streak or cat pictures. The only times anyone initiate conversation with me is if the underage family on my wife's side need nicotine or alcohol. 

I don't even know what actually interests me at this point. I play Xbox because i can do it alone, the last person I would play online with was my brother, who passed almost two years ago. I probably spend most of my time listening to podcasts and political commentary now. 

My dad is the only for sure reason I haven't taken my life successfully. I tried twice as a kid, grew away from actual attempts, but it still manifests as a heavy ideation almost daily. I feel so disconnected from my emotions. My feelings will come up, but I essentially shut down. For lack of better words, and no offense intended, I feel emotionally retarded.

I've tried therapy about 6-8 seperate times (weekly visits for no less than 3 months straight) and I never feel like anything changes. I would think most of my issues stem directly through the loss of my mother and brother, both through suicide.

I've been stuck in this cycle for so long, it just feels like I may never get out, or that I may never allow myself out. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance and if you made it this far, you are the realest. Good luck to all ✌",15Jun2020,1
23,"Hi, 

thank you to read this first, i'm stuck in my situation for a few years now and, all the helps will be really appreciated.

So i'm a 36 year olds man, i'm from france, from a beautifull location with sea, sun and peacefull life. I grew up there from a wealthy family so i had chance to chose my  professional goals, studies and everything. After graduation in art school, in 2006, i was struggling with professional life and i only found jobs in advertising, which i did not like so i tried to work as an independant, which i was for 4 years. But it was not good, i wanted to do comics and illustartions, only did catalogs and crappy logos... i never did real money and lived alone working long hours at home, it was not the life i wanted. At the same time, i was a musician in a band for 3 years, and a sailing teacher on the weekend. I cherished that part of my life really much (not enough apparently) but it ended someday for several reasons.

Little by little i felt into depression being alone  and i remember feeling loneliness, abandon,  really heavily.  
I have to say that i still have my two parents, and ..I can't really complain because they really provided everything we needed since i was a child, but they really are mostly about money, i've never been able to get  real advices or guidance from them, and today when i try to speak with them about my issues, i mostly get rejection like : ""you're almost 40, we can't do anything, you're a grown up..."".

  
So i decided to get out of the comfort zone at 26 and go to canada to try to find a new life with goals, independance , new people ( as my friends in france where doing what people seem to do between 25 and 30 : slowly going into building a family and selfishly focusing only on the name of their children and their houses...and all that kind of things.)

So arriving to Montreal in 2011, i'm looking for work, and find some into advertising again. I took the job for a few months just to get some money and then, i slowly get some hints about the gaming industry here. As i have a strong interest into the activity since childhood, i'm thinking ""there it is, i'm gonna be a game-artist"". And i'm working hard to get some jobs in companies here, it costs money and time, but it's allright i like hard-training, it defined me for years. So i'm finally getting that done and firts, i'm doing some 2D art and finally become a concept artist in small companies.

 But today i can only say that that was really not rewarding. These jobs are really not satisfying for me: i'm only feeling like i'm a tool on big gross conspirationss that are just here to get some money from people. I'm feeling like i give my efforts to a strong bad capitalist machine that doesn't do good for people.   
Today i'm unemployed since a year,after working in gaming studios for 6 years, and i don't know what to do with my life, i'm totally in panic, i don't sleep well, i don't know what to do, i'm always thinking about the past and how i screwed up my fundamental life-choices. I barely draw anything at all because i put so much efforts in it in the past for nothing, it's like i've lost the flame, the passion that used to drive me before. I tried to get back into the industry but each time a studio contacts me, i have 1st and 2nd interview and then they disappear, i'm clearly not good enough for them.  
 I'm even thinking seriously going to work in cooking because...I don't know, thre is jobs and maybe it will be something more human than what i experienced in the entertainment industry. I don't like where I live, but i tried to go back to my country few years ago and i wasn't able to make a living there, i ended in a crappy sushi restaurant where i wasn't doing anything good either, so i came back in canada.

I'm really felling lost, i have a girlfriend since 8 years and she supports me strongly in this situation,   but weoften are in a bad mood because we don't know what we are doing for our lives, and i'm feeling   
 this is my fault because i'm not able to go anywhere in life.   
If you have any advice to see anything in this, don't hesitate to speak, i'm desperate and i would be glad to discuss about it with anyone.

- 0 motivation
- slight suicidal thoughts, I want to be out my head
- thoughts of car crashes and fast deaths 
- dreams of death

(i love to sing. music is a big part of my life.) fortunately i was always a good student so i got into a good college. i just picked a course i knew i’d be good at. college was the obvious next step at the time and i didn’t really have much of a choice. (also, i feel like i’m really naive when it comes to the way the world works) i never really pictured myself getting a job in the same field. but college was nothing like i’d imagined. my professors were terrible, they had very little knowledge about their own subjects. most of the work fell to the students, they were very toxic. so i’d spend my time learning everything by myself. i never had any good friends. by year 3, everyone had started working on their resume. i never did. in my mind i wasn’t ready to be an adult. i had a lot on my plate. my living situation wasn’t the best (i live with my grandpa and mom; we had to move in with him when i was 12. my mom is his caretaker). i also had a few health upsets here and there. but i didn’t let anything affect my grades. i always did my best. anyway i graduated after 4 years. but i never got a job. i’ve done nothing this past year (since june 2019). i’ve tried to look into other options but i haven’t found anything i like. i tried to explore singing but its not really an option in my country. and all my attempts were unsuccessful. i’ve tried therapy but it didn’t work. i guess i just never found a good therapist. now everyone wants to know what i’m doing with my life and i don’t have an answer. my mom has tried to help me, even though she’s the only one who’s seen me through it all i’ve come to realize she’s not someone i can vent to. she invalidates my feelings and goes into a huge speech every time. she’s tried to be patient but i know deep down she wants me to find a quick solution. i want to too but i really have no idea what to do. i can’t do it by myself. i don’t like my dad. i’m grateful for everything he’s done for me but he doesn’t understand me. we’re just too different. he doesn’t even live in the same country as me. he calls me once in a while but always asks me about “my plan for the future”. its a massive trigger for me. it really hurts because i truly don’t know. we don’t communicate well. his intentions might be good but he has no idea how much it hurts. i’m struggling enough, as it is. its like salt to the wound. i’ve been wanting to get help elsewhere (career counselling and therapy). but with the pandemic i can’t do that i can’t go out. my mental health is in the dumpster right now. i want to die but i’d never do it. i’m too scared of the pain and i can’t do that to my parents. i have no one else to turn to and i feel all alone. i’m sobbing as i write this. i really don’t know what to do. i’m lost and lonely. thank you for reading.",15Jun2020,1

He doesn’t like to open up about it and I don’t try to force him. However he ends up confiding in me anyway despite him saying he hates being vulnerable and feels it’s pointless to talk about it. As of late he’s been sleeping A LOT. This guy doesn’t take naps and yet today he came home and took a nap. He’s still sleep, it’s been over 3 hours. I’m more worried this time because his depression seems to be taking a much heavier toll compared to his other depressive episodes. He’s usually able to pull himself out within a few days through writing or watching movies (he wants to be a director). This time I don’t think that’s gonna do the trick.
Things I usually do: 
Make sure he eats (tempting him with things I know he can’t resist) 
Be a listening ear
I try to be more affectionate (though sometimes he looks so angry I get a little intimidated because I don’t want to irritate him or anything)
I suggest things to do but he’s either nonchalant about it or is not interested
Does anyone have other suggestions??",15Jun2020,1

39,"Hello everyone! I have wanted to post something like this for a long time. I have struggled with really severe anxiety since I was a kid. I did’t really realize that I had it until my first year of college. I am now a senior in college, (21F). Just a little bit of background, the past couple of years was really rough for me. Highschool was incredibly stressful for me because I worked about 30 hours a week while in school, not to mention my bad family situation. when I moved out I was incredibly releived but it wasn’t long before I realized that I had developed a lot of bad habits by learning from my parents over the years. My grades drastically dropped and my boyfriend and I were on the fritz after dating for like 6 years. Overall, I was a hot mess. I had severe depression as well which is a similar story to a lot of you here and I would sleep for like 5 hours a day because staying awake was too hard. I decided that it was time to feel better and I started my long road to recovery. I am here today to say that I am drastically better: I still struggle from time to time with spouts of anxiety but they are never fully consuming like they used to be and I can always “snap myself” out of them. I am also a Psych major in college with a neuro minor so my educational background has helped me to figure out the best solution for my own health. PLEASE be patient with yourself because getting better will NOT happen over night. However, with patience and love for yourself THERE IS HOPE. I PROMISE!!! Things can be so dark but it does get better with appropriate treatment. Here are the steps I took to get better:                              

1. I saw a psychologist. counselors mainly specialize in kind of talking out feelings which is fine, however a psychologist or psychiatrist will use cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. If your only option is a free counselor, SEE THEM because any help is better than no help. Just try to specify that you want CBT as your course or treatment, as it is one of the most clinically researched and the most proven to be effective. I was in therapy for about a year and it really helped me to break down, understand and manipulate my negative thought patterns. I can now do this myself with the help of my psychologist.                           

2. I started taking Lexapro, which is an SSRI medication that helps with anxiety and depression. This may not be for everyone, so speak to your doctor about it first. It has helped my depression very much and that looming panic feeling deep in my gut is gone. By increasing my seretonin in my neurons’ synapses, this medication has helped me to have more control over my thoughts and feelings. The side effects can be a wile ride to get used to but after about 2 months they went away for me and I started to feel like myself again. Those who want to stop the anxiety feeling in your chest without taking SSRIs try taking Happy Healthy Hippy Joy Filled. This really helped with my physical symptoms of anxiety, but not so much the mental. It still definitely provides some relief. So do the Bach Rescue Pastilles. Both of these can be found on amazon.                                                            

3. Have a good support system! When you feel bad have a good friend, partner or parents or someone you trust to confide in. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this, writing in a journal can be just as effective. Just don’t leave the thoughts in your head! Getting them out in the open where you can handle them is so much healthier (and again clincially proven to help)  

4. This step I use very often still to help myself. Deep breathing is very very helpful for me and many others to control anxiety. I was having a rough time today, but I did this and it helped to calm me down and to stop feeling on overdrive mode. I included a link to the video I used on youtube. She explains it wonderfully. Just BE PATIENT with yourself because your body is so used to being in overdrive right now that it is difficult to calm down. It may not work immediately, but if you work at it for an hour or so without judging yourself in a private room it always helps to calm me down. It originally didn’t work for me, but you have to really believe. It may feel like your body is rejecting the deep breathing at first, because it is, that is caused by the anxiety. Just hang in there and you will be ok shortly.

5. Sleep hygiene!!!! Is so so important. Sleep 7-9 hours a night and go to bed and wake up the same time every day. Sleep is incredibly linked to depression so having a screwy sleep schedule can make depression exponentially worse. 

I hope this helps!! I am here for ANYONE who has any questions or needs help. I am not yet a professional but I do work in mental health as well as have had a rough time with my own mental health. HANG IN THERE friend!! Just remember that any treatment is better than no treatment at all.

***It is incredibly important to note that your primary needs need to be taken care of in order to feel your best as well. This includes proper sleep hygiene (google it for some tips), drinking plenty of water and eating enough of healthy foods. There was a point where my sleep and eating were reallly f***ed up so this made my anxiety and depression much worse. If you cannot afford food find a food shelter near you. College campuses often provide them for students so do not be afraid to take advantage of them. You may be thinking “someone else needs it more than me” but if you are hungry you need it just as badly! It is hard to stop anxiety if you are worried about your next meal.",15Jun2020,1

42,"Hello fellow redditors!

I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question (for a variety of reasons). 

I have read what therapy is supposed to give you (no cure, but a more endurable existence?) but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things? 

I have never confided in anyone so it just seems more than obscure to just walk in and tell a stranger that I want to kill myself because there is no purpose to it all anyways...

I appreciate any feedback!",15Jun2020,1

44,"Since everything with COVID, my anxiety and depression have both sky rocketed. I had my anxiety completely under control for the past year or two, the depression was steadily improving. Now I am struggling with both again. To add to it, I am extremely introverted, and absolutely need my alone time. Before quarantine I was alone about 4/7 days a week. Now I am alone about 20 minutes a week. All of this combined has made me snap at anyone that says more than a word to me. I have had irritability before as a symptoms of my depression, but it is soooo bad right now I don't know how to deal with it! There is no where I can go to have alone time, and I can't just ask my family to leave the house for a day since they have no where to go either. Has anyone else been experiencing this and how can I relieve some of this stress when I can't be alone?",15Jun2020,1
45,"I really don't know if I have depression. I took 20 online tests for it and it says severe depression. I don't think I have it. I have a good childhood. Only thing that is not good, I guess is me being a lesbian. I love being gay but I think that made my grandmother moved... to a different country. Anyways, each quiz I took made me feel more confident that am depressed but at the same time not.

Each test said; are you sad, losing weight, self harm, sleeping less or more, eating less, lost focus, and lost interest in stuff.
What happened if am not sad but happy. Yes I am losing weight by 2 pounds per three weeks. I do not do self harm but does wanting to get bullied, work. I do sleep more than usual but less at the same time, I have football practice 7-9:30. Yes I do eat less than usual, I used to eat 8 pieces of pizza, now I eat two. I do lost focus a lot. I used to read 2-3 books per day, now I don't read at all.

I'm just a teenager(14) girl. At 4'10 .You can tell me that I do not have it and I will believe you. If I do have it than I believe you. But I just think I am just teenager girl being dramatic.",15Jun2020,1
46,"It took me a while to finally get help for my depression and anxiety. But last year I started therapy and I have a psychiatrist and I’m medicated. 

And now, because my brain hates me, my Prozac no longer helps. (I’m on the highest dosage) and therapy has been a joke since it’s all telemed. I did all the right steps. Looked for all the help. And here I am. A year later. Have panic attacks at 3am and still wanting to die. 

I finally have my life in order. And now my brain is ready to kick the depression into high gear and just have me self sabotage everything.",15Jun2020,1
47,"For 7 years of being depressed and anxious, (plus after 1 year of abusive relationship)  it's hard for me to move on an grow.
For a long time I've always felt like I'm not good enough because of who I am as a disabled person.

 I know what to do to be better, I went through all of my years learning for so long, but I struggle so much in my beginning years as an adult after highschool and had to learn things with special programs. 

After my abusive relationship, it was twice as harder for me to move on. It gotten bad to a point where I'm back to where I started. 

I make a cycle. And it's stupid. 

Apparently for being a depressed lil shit that I am, I still make the ppl in my life stressed out. I never wanted to do that. I thought that, me doing my own thing would be good, but it doesn't work like that.

I wanna talk what I'm feeling an wanted to be understood, but they already knew what position I'm in. 

I push people away, I'm too scared to embrace positive change in my life, I cannot trust myself, I lie to myself an others. Heck after learning about abuse, apparently I am too easily angered off and an emotional turmoil over things! 

I do want help, but I feel like- I'm still that same scared kid that just wants someone who I can trust an help guide me again... I know I can do it, but I feel like I'm too stupid and too stubborn to do anything right. 

I know I can- just do it. I know I can.

Even when I’m not present and just texting people it feels like they can’t stand me. So I’ve been just staying in bed at home cutting off communication. I an coming here for help because everywhere else I ask for it I feel as though I’m being “dramatic” or that they will think that i am being “dramatic”. Theres also this weird thing I feel where if I open up to someone else its like passing my burdens to someone else instead of just taking care of it myself. All of this is just paralyzing.

I haven’t eaten, gone to the bathroom, anything. Every time I tell myself I need to get up an overwhelming feeling of tiredness comes over me and I just stay instead.

49,"Hi. So I’m (F22) trying to figure out if I need to go to a treatment center for a day or a few. I’ve never gone before but I’ve been in therapy for years. Lately any small thing makes me completely shut down, lash out, and stay in bed all day long. Also when things go wrong my brain automatically has bad ideas. It’s not that I’ve made a plan to end things, but I have urges to hurt myself, which I usually don’t have. 
My therapist is going to call me today to discuss this. I have no idea what my next step is to help myself. Also I live at home still so my parents would be very concerned or freak out probably if I had to go. I would probably have to have my therapist call them and tell them. 
If I do go, what do I expect? Please help.",15Jun2020,1
