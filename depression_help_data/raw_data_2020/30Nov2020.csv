0,"I am an extrovert. I am alone or feel like it. When I have a problem I cry. I don't know why. Most days I come home from school and i think of what I could of done better that day. I think everything I do is a disappointment. 
One day I was tired of not having a answer, so i came up with one a few months ago.
My answer was I get embarrassed easy and when I get embarrassed I cry. And i was afraid of a lot of things. Especially being judged of what I do. So I decided to stay quiet and by doing that I was being judged and I didn't realize that until about 2 or so mounts ago. I want help because so don't want to feel like everything I do is a disappointment, but what will people this of me if I ask for help. I don't want to be judged it just scares me.
Telling my parents wouldn't be a option because my parents scare me. Especially my dad. He gives me and my siblings lectures saying we can do better and we are spoiled and work for nothing. I know he means us well and tries to teach us, but what he says is the truth and it hurts being told the truth mostly because I already all the things he tells us.
I used to cut myself, but I stopped because it really didn't make me feel better and I was always terrified of getting caught. Suicide has been one of my last options, and it feels like I have no other options, but I am scared of dying, but I don't want to feel bad and have to deal with life. I want to ask for help and not feel bad about my self but I am scared. One of those voices in my head tell me that there's nothing wrong with me and there are tons of other people with actual problems unlike me. I don't know what to do I'm stuck.
This is the first time I am telling anyone this and I don't have to keep it in. But something tells me maybe it would be best not to tell anyone about this.",30Nov2020,1

3,"Hello,

Can anyone point me in the direction of any resources for learning how to be organised?

With depression, I always feel like everything is always all over the place. I start a list, then I forget about it. Or I have multiple physical lists plus a digital one, I don't know how to prioritise, constantly feeling overwhelmed and like I have no control over my life.

Trying to search strategies for organisation I just find stuff about how to declutter your home or the generic 'make a list' and 'do it now'....yeah no shit.

Are there any in depth strategies out there? Even something that's mental health specific?

Don't know if I'm making any sense, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",30Nov2020,1
4,I think my friend is depressed. They have been very distant from me. I reach out and get little or no response. They make dark humor jokes and I try to respond in a joking manner but I’m really worried about the jokes they are making.

5,"I'm taking venlafaxine and today was my first day. Lesson learned, don't take it with caffeine beverages but in any case I've felt drowsy, intermittent nauseous, my head feels weird like fuzzy and I lost my appetite, maybe because of the nausea but I dunno. When I eat I feel better, but still I just felt *weird* all day. Will the side effects get better in time? If I have to I'll check with my psychiatrist, I just don't want to be the patient that calls from day one about side effects if it's normal.

Has someone taken this medication? Any advice on antidepressants in general? Should I keep a journal maybe to track side effects and anything that comes up while taking them?",30Nov2020,1
6,"I have gone up and down with depression of the last ten years, and mostly I've accepted my imbalance. However, I still persistently struggle with caring enough about my surroundings to keep things neat and clean. It's kind of a vicious cycle, where I feel worse the dirtier it gets, but also can't motivate myself to take care of it. Having said that...

Does anyone have suggestions for household products/techniques/electronics/anything that could ease this problem any? For instance, I've been thinking about getting something like a roomba to keep the floors clean (I have cats). Anything else?",30Nov2020,1
7,So I'm pretty fucked. I'm homeless staying at a motel and I probably can't afford next week. I just started a new job on the books so my unemployment is going to be gone and they're going to hold a week on me and I just don't have the money or anyone to lend me the money so I'm probably going to be homeless homeless. If that happens I won't be able to get to work or anything and I'll be in an even worse position. I applied for loans but got denied for them all because my credit is destroyed from trying to keep me and my ex afloat. I don't have family or friends so I don't have any support structure to help me so here I am. I'm very suicidal right now and just spent the last two hours researching how to implement a blood choke on myself because my other suicide attempts were attempted overdoses but they're honestly not reliable enough and I have no idea how to get heroin or that would be my go to. I already go to therapy but it's a fucking joke and they always seem to doubt that I'm actually depressed even though I have three prior suicide attempts on my record. I'm really just here in a last ditch effort to see if there is anything I can do or to see if anyone can knock some sense into me. I really have no reason or desire to live so I'm sorry if it's difficult to get through to me. I just don't want to give up without saying I made the best effort I could to live even if it's through hell....,30Nov2020,1

This year came along and covid cancelled school. My school closed down during lockdown in the spring. Now it just recently closed again. Which bothers me a lot since it's my senior year and I'm not able to see many of my friends from school. I had already been depressed before it got cancelled for the second time. I lost my job and haven't had any luck being hired anywhere else (some places won't hire since I'm a student). Many people walked in and out of my life this year. Haven't been able to see my family this year, or travel like we were suppose to. I used to be super close with god, and now I feel so disconnected (and I hate it). Lots of terrible things happened this year to me. And I just can't seem to be happy (not suicidal), just extremely unhappy. Nothing has gone right and I just dread waking up everyday.

16,"This story itself is (kinda) supposed to be funny. I thought it would be something for you to enjoy. Or relate too. Take your pick. Also keep in my mind, my memory is foggy, and I don't have an exact recount of the events. If you have any confusions or questions, please ask them. I'm not really giving my whole perspective or her's and I need to work on my storytelling ability.

So a couple of weeks ago. I was talking to someone, who was basically my best/only friend (Let's call her E). E was the only person that ever texted me to check in on how I was doing. She was pretty much my cling to life. (This isn't funny at all). Another thing about E was that she would always hang out with her friends. I'm not blaming her, but this made me bad because my one friend couldn't even invite me anywhere.

Anyways, I always talked about how I was truly feeling with E and she tried her best. E has anxiety which would complicated things. Whenever she didn't feel alright, she didn't feel comfortable telling me. This also made me feel bad because I didn't want to have a one-sided friendship. I wanted to be there for her like she was for me, but she wouldn't let me. 

One day, in like this October I want to say, E is in Downtown of the city, as per usual, and it's around 6pm. I am, as per usual, playing video games in my room. I'm ridiculous, and I am home alone, so I play music and start dancing by myself. Having fun. I send her a snap video of me doing this.

She sent me a snap back saying ""You having fun there? I couldn't have fun like that."" Now that's a lot of damage. So I snap her back saying 

""Yeah, I'm sorry I don't have friends that want to hangout with me. So I have to have fun by myself."" Looking back, I know how bitchy that sounds, but it was mostly sarcasm. It did ruin my mood though. She's out having fun and I have to make it up from nothing.

She snaps back and says ""No I didn't mean it like that. I'm glad you can have fun by yourself.""

My mood has officially been killed so I say ""Oh yeah, keep reminding me I'm alone."" I was actually mad at her, and I didn't know why.

About 4 hours later she apologizes for what she said. I try to explain to her what she said hurt me, and she got mad at me. I never lied or cared about keeping up something. If something bothered me, I said it. E goes off on me that I'm ruining her life and making her feel bad. This brings me down to my lowest point. I was causing pain to my best friend. I apologized again for all the mistakes I've done (Trust me, I made a lot. None major, but a lot). The next day we talk a little bit, ignoring the elephant in between us. Eventually, we talk about it. She tells me she needs to step away from our friendship for two days to reset her mental health. 

Two weeks later I get a text from her during online school from E. In the text she says that we can't be friends anymore. We are too toxic to each other. It says that we need to stop talking and focus on something else. She sends about 5 paragraphs about this, telling me to see a therapist and a lot about God and that stuff.

Pre-Covid, I was pretty devout. Now, even though I still believe in Catholicism, it's gotten completely strained and weakened. 

After reading what she wrote, (Ok, fine. I skimmed what she wrote. I'm not reading an essay), I cried. I turned my zoom camera off and cried. Everything felt worthless again. I needed her more than ever and I couldn't talk to her. I was the problem.

That's when the questions fly at me. Why should I live? What have I done to help this life? What have I done for others? All I had were negative answers. I just tossed away my best friend. I fucked up so many times. I keep doing it too. I can't change. I don't know how. And I don't have anyone to teach me. 

I have thought about E ever since that day, the past week and a half. I don't deserve her. The suicidal thoughts have come back. Out of spite maybe? Life without her is boring. She helped me so much and I fucked it all up. That's all I'll ever be good at. Fucking up opportunities. I miss her and I don't know what to do.

My depression cause my only friend to leave, which made my depression worse. What tf is wrong with me? I need advice on anything. What do you guys think? I need help on what to do here. It's okay to criticize my actions, I fucked up a lot. I completely accept that. I just want my life to feel okay again.",30Nov2020,1

My work schedule consist of Monday-Friday, 9-5, Thursday-Friday, 5:30-9:30 and then Sundays 9-4.

The past month or so, it's gotten so bad to the point I'm missing 1-2 days a week. I started a new job  about a month ago and I've already missed well over a week. I try to make up for it by going in on Saturdays, but that's my only day off those weeks so I'm constantly playing catch up.

I'm going to bed at decent times, but waking up is a nightmare. Most mornings I spend 45 minutes trying to convince myself to get up. I start going over what tasks I can cancel immediately and how much I don't want to work to begin with.

I've been with her for almost 2 years now. When COVID hit, I persuaded her to quit her job in dog grooming, due to poor working conditions in a dangerous time on top of it causing unnecessary stress after an accident with a dog. Since I am working from home, I can support the both of us for the time. She was stressing on what to do while she was home, and she was feeling guilty. So I suggested that she look into continuing her education. We looked into potential degrees, and she chose to do an Associates in Baking. She enjoyed baking and found it to be a good stress reliever. Since then, it has proved to be anything but that. 

Now that she is finally in a Kitchen in her courses, she is realizing how stressful the position is. She has class for around 3 hours, and comes home exhausted. She's starting to hate herself for how dead tired she is after courses, on top of several cases when she feels scattered brain and makes mistakes. I'm starting to understand that my strategies for coping with stress do not work for her. Today, I felt like I had to force her to go after thanksgiving break. She kept saying how much she wants to quit and give up. I'm starting to wonder if I am a hypocrite for taking her out of one stressful position into a worse position. I don't want her to quit the degree, because I fear that if she does that her self-confidence will not recover. I wanted her to have something she can be proud of. 

I'm going to talk to her about potentially changing her degree, to either something less stressful, or to a Diploma instead of an Associates. Does anyone have any strategies to help with coping with the stress on her body?

41,"Hello all, 

I have battled depression for about 3-4 years “officially” but realistically I’ve battled it for a lot longer. About 6 months ago I transitioned off my meds which were about 4 pills a day in total. They were all very high dosing medication too. I worked with my dr and we tapered and did it the right way. Anyway, everything has been going great. Up until recently, I was convinced that I had “overcome” my depression. Last Friday my boss calls me up and says he needs to meet with me. Not only him, but 6 other guys/leaders in our organization would be attending the meeting. The meeting was classified as “professional development” but it was basically all of them telling how I can improve and do better. I know that all jobs have these types of meetings but it was very intimidating when it was all of them versus me. Anyway, what they had to say in the meeting isn’t what is effecting me the most. What bothered me is the anxiety and depression that the anticipation of the meeting caused. When my boss called me on that Friday it basically sounded like my job was at risk. Like I could be terminated if this meeting was to go bad or whatever. So I didn’t sleep at all from Friday to Sunday(which is when we had the meeting). The only other time my mind has raced and I’ve experienced manic symptoms is when I almost took my life 3 years ago and it caused me to get on all the meds in the first place. So I guess I’m here to ask, how can I shake these feelings that were caused by the anticipation of the meeting? It’s like they are hanging with me. I’m gonna start working out today. Hopefully that helps, but I’m just wondering if you guys have any advice on coping with the depression that lack of sleep and anticipation for this meeting has caused? 

Thanks",30Nov2020,1
42,"Will try my best to speak to the point and keep everything short &amp; simple, but when I start to talk I get really confused.
I have a job, pays alright I wanna move out from my family's house ( cause there's alot of problems not anything serious but I'm not taken seriously, if I say no to something I'm bad, and I'm dealing with my own shit already, struggling from depression anxiety after my mom passed away in 2015, now I've been diagnosed for Major Depression. Sometimes I feel like really shitty, even standing or walking is a challenge but I get through the night, i work at nights, 4nights 3 day weekend, today I was talking abt moving out(i think i sat down with them after alot of days) but I was told i wont be able to save money to buy a house, after that it was like I'm obviously not going anywhere then when I said no to something I was bad again. My mind doesnt work I dont know how I get thru the night) Plus if I do get my own place some day by staying home I'm sure I'm gonna be told that they played the main part in it and I had very little to do with it. I dont have the patience for those things I'm also very sensitive type.
And I was thinking if I move out whatever I do atleast I would be free and independent
I live in Ontario 
If there's anything I left plz comment",30Nov2020,1
43,"So I'll try to explain my condition with my kink I feel like it's easier to get my point across

 I've discovered that I've got a milf fetish, that's not strange I know however because I kind of have a cuckold thing going on for myself, I always thought it would be fine like if a dude pounded my stepmom I'm really attracted to idea more and more over the years (I'm don't have a thing for my stepmom though)

I have a strong feeling for guys that of course joke around it with me, but that also respect that and take it in a friendly approach like ""I feel it's kind of wrong, but I wouldn't mind if she's into it and of you'd like to watch""

I feel like only bisexual guys care about your well being even in situations like these a straight guy wouldn't care about myself he would just shag my mom, even though I personally don't have any sexual thoughts about guys I know, I feel the most safe even when expressing feelings like these

So yeah I wouldn't call myself a bi person (I'm pro lgbt stuff), but holy shit they seem to be more respectful about my kink not because they are into me as well but because they find it alright

This will probably get downvoted I feel as it's a weird confession to make but I'd like to talk about it with you it's a taboo thing for many, also pm me of interested about the idea or my stepmom

Sometimes I fix my depression when people reach out and doing some things you wouldn't do normally that is what reddit is for, weird things fixes depression

If all goes good, I might set you two up, do it for my depression or because you care

Interests, gaming sports and movies

Anyway I've been depressed since I was 8 (now 14), one month ago I went to the kitchen to get a knife, then I sliced the top of my hand to see if it was sharp enough to slit my wrists. While I'm still depressed I've been a bit better and if I was able to get back up after that, you can too. whatever it is you are experiencing know that you are loved and that it will get better",30Nov2020,1

47,"Hi, I am new to this but I do not really know if I'm depressed or not.  I really do not know how I want to write this.  

I was depressed in Freshman/Sophmore year of highschool, although I told my parents they said it was a phase or that it doesn't exist and ignored it.  I was never happy with what I did, and I did terrible things to myself but I don't think anyone in my family ever wondered anything.  The only thing that happened was my mom bringing me to therapy once as well as my doctor to question me if I was depressed and such, but me being scared of what would happen I wrote that I wasn't and with that I was off the hook

Come junior/senior year of high school I feel much better and I'm not sure why honestly.  I haven't done anything to ""cure"" it(?), and I've never been happier honestly.  Now its freshman year of college, and I'm just really anxious about a lot of small things.  I have so many worries and the only thing that I really rely on are just video games but even then I feel guilty playing because of what else I could be doing.

I'm sorry if this is a confusing read, but I just want to know if anyone can help me find out whether or not I'm depressed.  thanks",30Nov2020,1
48,"Hi! I’m 15, and I’m in the middle of my recovery right now. I’ve noticed that when I was in my worst I didn’t have many people my age to talk to, since everyone in my therapy group was much older than me, and I thought about how there are a lot of teens that might be in that situation.
So I decided to do this! if you need someone to talk to about something you enjoy or just to vent that is closer to your age group, feel free to dm me!! Us teens need to support each other",30Nov2020,1
49,"I don't usually make posts like this, but I'm going to cut straight to the point. My life recently has been very depressing. Especially ever since Covid hit, I've been filled with anxious, sad, and paranoid thoughts. With everything going on in my life, I've found it very hard to focus this year in school. I am so behind that I think I am going to fail. I failed once a few years back and if I fail again, I'll be graduating when I'm 20. My parents are upset with me, not helping my case, and nobody believes in me anymore. I've been depressed for years, just been trying my best. I just want to give up and be gone sometimes but that reality is impossible. I'm not sure if I have ADD or ADHD, but I get so easily distracted too. I spend all day worrying and stressing about the work I should be doing, and when I actually do the work I just feel depressed and only have really bad thoughts with an upset stomach making it so hard for me to focus. I do my work online because of how anxious I am about covid. None of my friends are there to help me and none of my teachers even bother to talk to me or message me. I haven't been able to cry for a really long time, which I don't know is healthy or not. As in a long time, I mean probably the entire year. I've cried once in February, in July I had a panic attack that lasted almost 4 hours. Those are the only 2 times. I don't know what I expect out of these responses. I haven't really been able to talk to anyone about this and it feels pretty good to get off my chest. I just feel sad. I don't feel like doing anything and I feel so unmotivated from everything. I have been straying away from hobbies I used to literally love doing so much. I just don't know what to do. I just want the feeling of craving to want to do something again. Have I just turned lazy? Can anybody help give me any tips? I just can't do this anymore. I know I cannot. I need to change but I just don't know how to make myself change.",30Nov2020,1

51,"Hi. I’m a 19 year old female and I’m honestly really lost right now. Here’s a little backstory.

I’ve always been an overachiever since childhood. I grew up with hella high expectations enforced on me (I was raised in a very traditional household by my grandparents). As a result of these expectations, I always sought to do my best in school and I always maintained great grades, despite being severely depressed throughout my childhood and undergoing sexual, physical, and mental abuse regularly at home by another family member. 

Anyways, this last year my little brother died. The anniversary of his death is coming up and is around the corner, so as you can imagine, my depression is worsening as the date approaches. He was my best friend, and I miss him sincerely. 

As a result of my depression, I started to fall behind in school. I lost the motivation to do my work, and I feel intense- absolutely incredibly  intense- anxiety about it. At first I was a little behind, but now I’m failing all of my classes and I hate myself for it. I feel like a fucking failure, and I’m scared that if I drop out my grandparents will be disappointed in me and resent me. 

After I fell behind in school, I decided to just focus on my job as a delivery driver. I was making absolute bank delivering food during this pandemic, and it was a really good thing. But... unfortunately, life decided to swing at me again. My grandpa who raised me got diagnosed with ALS. He’s deteriorating rapidly. He’s expected to die soon. All I could think about during my deliveries was about him. Every delivery my mind would race about how he’s going to die. It got so severe that I quit my job. 

After quitting my job, I had a lot of time to spend at home. My depression worsened. My anxiety about school worsened because now, being that I was at home all the time, I had no excuse to not work on my online classes. But I didn’t work on them anyway, because anytime I opened my computer up I feel like vomiting and crying at the overwhelming amount of work that I have missing. I think about how much I’ve disappointed my professors by being a bad student and I think about how much I’ll disappoint my family if I tell them I’m failing. 

Now, I’m falling behind on bills because I have no job. I’m scared. I’m incredibly depressed about life and anxious about all of the shitty decisions I’ve made. I hate myself for the situation I’ve put myself in. 

I just need a kind voice to tell me what to do. What steps do I take to get myself out of this situation? Baby steps? Please.",30Nov2020,1

53,"I say I don't know how to ask for help but to be honest I don't really want to ask. I think I WANT help, but I'd feel way too guilty if I ever did get help anyway like. If someone DID try to help me I just know I would say ""it's ok it's ok I'm fine!"" or I would try be honest &amp; then just feel like shit about it afterwards &amp; then I would just go back to crying alone in my room &amp; keeping everything away from everyone lol

But really. I say ""I'm dead inside"" &amp; all I get is a ""haha that's a mood"" so I don't know what I can even do. I do not have support from anyone, nobody asks me how I'm really doing, everyone's just like ""how r u?"" (or I have to say how u doin first) &amp; it's too much of a casual conversation for me to like break down crying sayin can u just hug me for a sec or smth? which is what I really wish I could say to them I guess. 

I'm very capable of helping myself &amp; I do it all the time, I am the guy who picks myself up &amp; feeds me &amp; clothes me &amp; I'm glad I'm at a point where I can trust this guy &amp; know he's safe you know? I am just so responsible for everything in my whole life &amp; I just WISH I could rely on someone every once in a while.

54,"It was an accident. I trusted her to use the safe word if she was uncomfortable, and we had an established pattern that I was playing out. She changed the pattern a little, but I didn't catch it. I didn't notice. My hand slipped a bit while she was struggling, and wasn't on the right part of her neck.

It was only a bruise. But that bruise has shattered me.

She's forgiven me. ""It's not okay, but I forgive you.""

Somehow I just can't forgive myself. I've told her we're going to have to be vanilla for a little while, or that she's welcome to switch with me. She's been amazing, like she always is both in and out of the bedroom. 

I just can't get over this idea that I've ruined everything. That I'm abusive, just like my father. That I don't deserve her. That not if, but *when* she leaves me, it'll be for her own good. That I'm the kind of person who leaves bruises on people who don't want them.

56,"Another lonely night with me and my depressing thoughts it gets worse everyday. It feels like I'm stuck in a box and I cannot get out no matter how hard I try to. I show people I'm good and I even try smile and pretend when I'm not talking I'm not thinking about killing myself or wondering why I was put on this earth. Where I\`m from I don’t get treated like a human being not even my family members do. Ive been going to my cousins every day to eat food because I can't provide for myself but it just wasn\`t all about the food it was also the fact I feel happy and loved in that household.  

I think my cousin doesn\`t want me there because I consistently keep going there and I guess annoy them but my family not being in my own house it\`s just depressing and I just sit in my room in the dark doing this... writing bout how depressed I am or planning a painless way to kill myself.  

I feel like the universe wants me dead or I was put here for some type of experiment which is not make it anywhere in life. It\`s sad a teenager is going through this type of shit its really fucked. The way I show myself is that I'm just another black boy on the streets but no all I really want is to be happy, be loved and have my family around even if I'm in my own room and not talking to anyone. I miss how I used to hear my little brothers running up and down the corridor and my mum telling them off while cooking the most magical food. 

I haven't got that much time left in earth because I will soon have the courage to end my life. Right now, I'm just too of a coward and too of a pussy to do it. Whatever happens after human being dies it has to be better than the real world. I don’t like it here; I hate it here. People care about reputations and who should be who. Under my big black hoodie and my black tracksuit and under my thug looking self. You haven't got a gangster you just have a little boy that wants a hug from someone and hug them for at least 20 minutes and embrace them for as long as they can. 

But I know I'm not going to get that because it\`s classified “weird” hugging someone for too long. If I die by committing suicide and somehow this message gets out there Ive got 3 questions. 

The people I knew.  Who loved me like a family member? 

Why didn’t you like me? 

What was so weird about me that you kept saying? 

Honestly the only thing I'm excited about is when I finally kill myself and leave this earth and 1 less dirty soul in this earth. I don’t know why I was born like this. Why did God make me with no intention of me achieving myself? I guess I'll never know. 

I promise you they’ll be a point where I wake up and just have the courage to end it there and then and also if I could find any painless death maybe I would\`ve done it sooner. Who knows? 

But I know how I can heal this pain of mine. It\`s to be in a tall apartment watching the sundown. Its to live the American dream which is driving down the mountains of California. Feeling the breeze hitting my face and listening to chill music. Maybe that'll heal me. I'm going to continue smiling and pretend I'm fine, but I know as soon I'm alone in my dark bedroom I'm going to write about how depressed I am.",30Nov2020,1
