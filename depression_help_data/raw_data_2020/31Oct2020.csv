0,"Background (can be skipped) I feel I have always struggled with depression but after my father was killed by a drunk driver, it became severe. Within a few months of his passing I got a divorce from my abusive partner and was living alone with no one visiting or talking very much to me at all.

I remember feeling like I was dying from the inside out emotionally and feeling like a zombie day in and day out while everything tasted bland too. I was unsure where to focus my thoughts on to escape the memories of the night I received that call. In fact I was unsure about everything, myself, my life, my future, my desires, or if I would ever feel what it felt to be ""happy"" again even for a moment.

One night I was on the floor, fatigued, just browsing the internet searching depression and hoping some website would have something ""more"" for me, not just the definition of depression. I was desperately looking for something that would ease my thoughts even for a fleeting moment, I was just so worn out and wanted to feel something else.

(backstory complete)

Well during those very low moments where I searched the internet for help I came up empty. What I found was pages of depression definitions and suicide hotline ads but what I was looking little things to help me along this difficult journey through depression, anything! I was depressed and desperate. Yes, I knew I needed therapy but was still struggling on accepting his death, it was so sudden that it didn't feel like he was gone so I couldn't speak about it but ended up going later on down the line. 

Once my heart started I went on a search to look for things that can help me with all my individual struggles that came from depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I found that pet therapy helped me significantly, more than I could explain in a few sentences
* Youtube meditation videos did not help me but oddly enough those deep sleep hypnosis videos put me to sleep like a baby FINALLY despite me not even having an interest or belief in hypnotherapy. Those videos made me focus myself in random beautiful places and it worked with my anxiety, depression, and grief.
* I would struggled with insomnia, had a hard time going to sleep, and woke up throughout the night. I found that a natural tea helped me fall sleep on my bad days then the youtube deep sleep video helped me go back to bed everytime I woke up
* Podcasts help me while I was working to keep my focused when my mind wanted to sink or if I was about to cry
* Taking advise I thought was stupid ended up working like waking up and going to a mirror (yes I felt silly) and telling myself ""I love you and It's okay"" I realized even I struggled to tell myself that but that's all I wanted to hear from someone. It was a healing process to hear it from myself
* Buying myself a nice outfit made me feel good for a moment and helped me talk a look at other things I wanted to jazz up like my hair or bathroom

Things like these! That is what I was looking for, small things to help along the way. It's a lot of work to get through depression but I truly appreciate having these tricks to rely on or cycle through

&amp;#x200B;

As I am farther along in my journey I have become inspired to create a website where it's just full of these tips, resources, books, or whatever misc things have brought sunshine in other peoples world. It took a while find small things that worked for me.

I hope to have enough options on the website for that one person browsing the internet searching for that ""one thing"" that will ease their mind and heart for just one moment 

&amp;#x200B;

1,"Since September last year it has felt like my world is completely collapsing in on itself, Dad diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, dropped out of university to be closer, multiple health concerns, had to start seeking help again for PTSD, waited months to be referred and I've been referred to CBT for depression as I am too depressed to work through PTSD.

My depression has been getting worse and worse, often thinking about hurting myself and how pointless my life is now my Dad is going to die sooner than expected, living is painful and Ive been struggling to keep my mood regulated and its taking a toll on the people around me. I've found myself snapping about every little detail and being incredibly rude and short with my partner. It makes me feel horrible and more depressed. 

What can I do to help being overwhelmed and losing my patience with people I'm close to? What can I do in the meantime while I wait for some CBT? What can I do to not be such an asshole to the people I love? I feel like I have no love for myself and I am turning into a monster",31Oct2020,1

14,"Hello everyone,


I (24F) have been suffering from depression since I was 12. I‚Äôve had a good hold on it since I was about 16 but ever since last year I‚Äôve been having more trouble. I went to the doctor and got back on medication, although it was a different one than the last round since I couldn‚Äôt remember what I was taking before. A few months ago I went back to the doctor because I‚Äôve gotten worse, I have been having a difficult time getting up to go to work. She put me on a new medication to take with my old one, this resulted in me being so exhausted I would sleep for 12+ hours and still be exhausted, I was confused, dizzy and having trouble forming words and thoughts. Before this I took a part time position at my work instead of being a casual employee. They knew about my Mental health problems before putting me into the part time position. Needless to say I was having some trouble coming in and I followed the directions on my management and opened a file with our workplace health dept. for advise and help. I got medical forms for my doctor to fill out (this costs $85, which since I‚Äôve been having trouble going to work I don‚Äôt have the extra money for this expense, it also took them over a month to send me said forms) and then it took them MONTHS to get back to me after I had them filled out only for them to tell me they are closing my file because I‚Äôm in treatment already (medication and therapy) before I even got a response to my medical forms being filled out my manager terminated me from my part time position (after not following the proper procedure, the union also failed me here so I am filing a grievance and considering contacting the human rights tribunal) This ended up leaving me MORE stressed and MORE depressed as I am still having the same issues and now my manager is wanting me to get doctors notes for missing work (since my case with workplace health is closed, she has emailed me to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù even though she hasn‚Äôt contacted me once since this all started) even though I JUST had this form filled out that says I suffer from panic attacks and Major Depressive Disorder. I literally do not know what to do. I‚Äôve spoken to my doctor and she just wants to try another different medication but I literally cannot go to work right now. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to go to work, it‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm debating going to the hospital but I‚Äôm afraid they will just turn me away because it‚Äôs mental health. I feel so lost and hopeless. It might be better if I just disappear. I have no money (I don‚Äôt even have my half of rent, $750 and I‚Äôve already asked everyone I could to borrow) I have no food. I worked so hard to get my career and now I‚Äôm throwing it all away because of my stupid brain.

20,"Heya Guys, thought alot about to post my problems here, but my English isn't the best at all. so sorry for that

My situation is kinda hard to explain, so if someone is willing chat with me (Discord, Reddit, WhatsApp)
I'm down for it.

long story short explanation:

My family is broken af, got a mom which is a alcoholic since my birth, don't know my dad and my mom never wants to talk about him besides telling me he's a bad guy, got 3 siblings, 2 sisters (43 and 41 years old) 1 brother (38) and me, 25. In my whole childhood and teenager life, my mom always told me I'm nothing, never helped me out even on simple stuff, telling me I just care for myself (said that since I'm 5 years old, I couldn't even reflect that), had a hard time, got too much weight as a teen, always stuck on pc because it was a nice way to get appericiation which I never got irl. after I moved to my first own flat (with 21) my life went okay, my siblings never cared about my life, but I'm fine with that. 2 years later I meet my first girlfriend, which got borderline problems (but I didn't knew that until we broke up 2 years later). I never saw a problem with her and I always tried to make the best for her. but it nearly ruined my life, she bought stuff without letting me know that (I'm owing 5000‚Ç¨ to several stuff), ruined my flat in a lot of ways, and at April this year I decided to broke up with her. I lost my work 1 year ago and since then I'm getting money via social payment (I'm not sure how to call it in English) because I can't work atm (hardly depression and eating disorder) since may this year I'm with a therapist but it's kinda slow, 1 meeting each month and my problems just getting more. My Mom doesn't care, even after calling her and crying because I don't know how to handle this stuff. instead of that, she starts to lie about me, and my younger siblings don't even talk to me (she did the same with my 43 years old sister). I can barely pay my flat and the money I owe, can't buy new clothes, lost over 50kg in 1 1/2 years because of my eating disorder (135kg - 83.2kg now) So my chance are low atm, I'm trying to find work but since the second Corona wave in Germany it's kinda hard to find anything, my therapist told me I could go in a closed psychology clinic (dunno if it's the right name) but I couldn't even afford to travel there. I'm stuck atm I can't even sleep more than 3 hours (got medication, anti depression stuff since 1 years) but it doesn't even helps me out with the sleeping part anymore.

atm I don't even talk with my friends about it, because it's always the same problem and I don't want to annoy them anymore, because it's annoying for me too, I realize it's a weird loop and I can't get out of it.

if anyone can share some thoughts about it, I'm kinda clueless, it's not like I'm suicidal because I'm not, but sometimes suicide feels like the ""last escape"" like ""wow after that I don't have any problems anymore, what a life"" and I know it's a weird mindset which I never had and it's alerting me",31Oct2020,1

27,"To start I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm doing better in a lot of ways than I was a year ago but in a few ways I‚Äôm doing worse. This isn‚Äôt the lowest I‚Äôve been, I‚Äôve made a lot of progress, but even though I‚Äôve improved it‚Äôs frustrating being depressed.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 8 years ago. During that time there were periods where I was doing pretty ok but then it seemed like whenever I started to get back into a good rhythm with life something big would happen that would either knock me down or exhaust me so much that everything seemed difficult. 

I hate how I didn‚Äôt do my best at school or at work because I wasn‚Äôt 100%. I‚Äôm still not 100% and it makes it so hard to show up on time or even at all. And I know I can do great. I‚Äôve performed well before it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm so exhausted by everything. It makes it hard to deal with people and hard to get my work done.

I also hate how I‚Äôve lost friends over being depressed. Some of my former friends would ask me to hang out and I just didn‚Äôt have the energy so eventually a lot of them stopped asking and eventually we stopped talking.

Not only that but depression makes me feel like a lot of things are worse than they are. Then I‚Äôll have a moment of clarity where I feel like my old self and see ‚ÄúOK some of these things that happened in my life are horrible but I‚Äôve gotta move past them, but these other things that caused me so much distress should have been easy to deal with or move past. What‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù

Another way my view of the world gets twisted is I‚Äôll be feeling really lonely and feel like I can‚Äôt get my shit together enough to make new friends or acquaintances and haven‚Äôt for years then I‚Äôll realize, ‚ÄúWait, I have hung out with some new people during that time. I‚Äôve also made new friends. And if I really think about it in college and at work and at other places where I tried to put myself out there, there were people who tried to be friendly or invite me out and I was too depressed or too overwhelmed with school or work or whatever at the time to take most of them up on those offers. Or to hang out with them more than once or twice, even if I really enjoyed their company.‚Äù

So on the one hand that makes me feel more optimistic realizing that ‚ÄúOK maybe I‚Äôm not as outwardly a mess as I am internally and I did have *opportunities* to get close to some of the people around me.‚Äù

But on the other hand that almost makes it worse. That these people wanted to go out for drinks or coffee or to do this or that activity and I‚Äôm the one who turned it down. And that one of the biggest reasons I don‚Äôt have a healthy social life right now is because I spent years not putting in the effort other people put in when if I had put in more effort maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be as depressed and would have a healthier life in general. I hate that I squandered that time when I could‚Äôve been happier then which probably would‚Äôve made me happier now.

I‚Äôve cut off some toxic friends over the past few years and my life has improved sooo much because of it. I‚Äôve also ended relationships that were unhealthy and have learned both how to be better in relationships myself and how to spot red flags in other people better. But I also haven‚Äôt replaced those friends with new ones, especially close friends, and though I‚Äôve made some new friends, overall my social circle has shrunk way more than it‚Äôs grown for years. 

One other major thing I hate is that since I was depressed and let myself fall into bad habits like not sleeping enough and not eating before school or later work, sometimes people would try to be friendly or help me but I was too wrapped up in my own head to see their intentions or to fully appreciate them or convey my appreciation of them at the time.

I‚Äôm working on myself in a lot of ways and have made so much progress. Honestly myself from two years ago would‚Äôve hoped to be doing better than I am in general but at the same time I wouldn‚Äôt believe how far I‚Äôve come. It just sucks that even though I‚Äôm doing way better than I was I still have a long way to go and that I‚Äôm still dealing with the fallout of my actions and inactions when I was more depressed. 

I used to be the glass half full guy. Now I have a hard time seeing there‚Äôs much in the glass at all. Even when it‚Äôs over flowing with good things. I wanna be the glass half full guy again.",31Oct2020,1
28,"6 months ago I was able to come off antidepressants, it was a two year journey to where I am today. For the last few months everything has been going great, I thought myself out of the dark Valley but here I am again.

Work has been the same a usual, and I have actually been enjoying it more lately, but when I'm home I'm just down, and angry, but things at home have been better than usual, with my son back in school and my wife having finished her training and started working again.

The only thing that seems to bring me level is my daughter, but that is probably oxytocin from her love of cuddles and hugs.

-Can‚Äôt remember the last time I showered, I smell like death
-I‚Äôm up 250 pounds
-My face is riddled in acne and even more acne scars
-I don‚Äôt remember drinking water at all this year, my hands mindlessly grab soda or juice boxes
-The healthiest thing I‚Äôve eaten this week was a strawberry smoothie, which was followed by two burritos, a burger, and pepsi 

Please anyone just help me find motivation to take care of myself. I don‚Äôt have the energy to do anything. My mind tells me that this body isn‚Äôt worth taking care of, and that bottle of water should go to someone more worthy. 

I want to set a better example to my little sister. I want her to be healthy and take care of her body. I want her to be happy; the opposite of me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do or where to start. Again, if someone can help me find motivation, I‚Äôll be so appreciative. 

Thanks all.",31Oct2020,1
