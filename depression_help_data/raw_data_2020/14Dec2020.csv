0,"hi, i’m looking for tips regarding coping with depression. i’m in a long distance relationship and my SO is really struggling right now. how can i brighten his day and give him reassurance? i know he won’t ask for help or vent to me because that’s just the kind of person he is, so i want to be there for him and support him, but i’m scared that he will cut me off completely. i’m diagnosed with bpd and i tend to overthink and exaggerate thing quickly, so i’m not gonna lie, i’m super stressed about this whole situation. advice, please?",14Dec2020,1

You cannot be happy alone and you cannot be happy together. Mourning mourns the loss of a possible future, the not-yet that now will never be. Everything ends, including you. Love is not eternal, it is not even hardy. Accepting this takes a form and amount of courage that nobody but you will see or appreciate. You can’t change any of this; you have to live with it. Is that funny or sad? You know that it is both, and neither, Once again-and as always-that is the point…Get up. Begin. Make your way from the bed to the shower.

6,I’ve found that listening to music before bed helps me crowd out negative thoughts and provides a feeling of relaxation that often carries through to the next morning too. It helps me function better all around. What music puts your mind at ease and helps you get through your day?,14Dec2020,1
7,"I cant take it anymore. There are many things that can make a person depressed but not being able to find a purpose just kills any bit of will to live inside you. 

Im a 19yr old student stressed with college work and parents expectations like many others but my problem isnt as simple as it looks.I was rushed into some random course at college but i had my say in it so i cant blame my parents. I dont like going to college it doesnt feel right for me but i need to because my parents want me to become SOMETHING. At the same time i dont even want to quit college because i cant find anything else i could do , i cant find my interest in anything. I dont have hobbies , i dont have any talents.I dont have many friends that talk to me. Infact i dont even think i have friends at this point.I just feel lonely all the time even when im with my ""friends"".

All of this has really stressed me out for over a year now. I dont see a purpose to keep going. I dont see a purpose to keep trying to do something that doesnt make me happy. The only thing that keeps me going is my love for my parents. i dont want to be the reason for them being sad. I dont want to disappoint them because they are probably the most hardworking people I've ever known. They dedicated their whole life for me and my brother. 

I dont know what to do. I dont know how to get through this. I dont think i have a purpose in this world. Sometimes i do think about ending it but im really not sure.

8,"I started taking antedepressants for the first time in my life a little over a month ago with a prescription. I think I've been sad for most of the last 5 - 7 years. I can't remember but I've lived through most of it just fine. I recently also started therapy but it seems so perfunctory. I can't bring myself to talk about my trauma. When I do, it doesn't feel real. I'm beginning to feel like it won't help. I've also lately had trouble seeing the point in anything, in getting up and doing the work. I have nothing to work towards. In the bigger picture, I don't matter. This year I've lost all my friends. I am very lonely which is just as well because I don't really enjoy the company of other people anymore. 

I don't know if I have a question. I don't want to listen to stories. Just tell me what could help.",14Dec2020,1
9,"Wow I got a lot done today even though as usual I feel exhausted no matter how much sleep I get, no matter what I eat, no matter if I take my meds on time or not. Iv had a hard week since i got my period following an excruciating week of pms killing most of the self esteem and excitement for life I built over the last month. I was in bad pain despite miscounting and exceeding the maximum daily dose of otc pain killers by 700 mg the first day and taking the max the rest of the days. Also throwing up and shitting and dying, no one talks about these symptoms, just the cramps. So after being stuck in bed for a few days not getting anything done I’m finally making progress towards my goals. My future is bright and things have never looked better for me. *queue feelings of dread and hopelessness and anxiety making my stomach drop like a roller coaster* 

Also Something that’s been on the back of my mind: iv been able to start getting my life on track and recovering from trauma since my doctor finally listened and stopped prescribing ssris/snris and I started Wellbutrin and lamictal. It turned me from someone who slept 12+ every day and was constantly getting high wen they were awake into someone able to hold a consistent job. It’s been a few years tho and I can tell it’s not helping my energy as much any more and I’m thinking about how I’m going to get through the rest of my life if it becomes less and less effective. I’m always going to have adhd and without this medication I’m very much physically disabled and bedridden but will never be recognized as such (because everyone is tired, ur depressed that’s common, u still smoke weed occasionally) (also it doesn’t matter if ur disabled you’re still not given support , no one gives a fuck about how you’re going to survive in the United States.) this isn’t something I’m thinking about right now tho and I’m not letting it defeat me it just worries me sometimes. I’m still in my early 20s and have my whole life ahead of me. my feelings of dread and hopelessness rn are really random and not related to this thought and iv had a good productive day, talked to my friends over FaceTime, ate some good food and got some sunshine. You can be doing everything right and you can still feel horrible, your brain can still get caught up in negative thoughts, disfunction is still programmed into your nervous system. 

But I’m going to eat something right now and hit my daily calorie goal, I’m going to do some light exercise, I’m going to light a candle and meditate and say my affirmations and I’m going to stay up long enough to fall asleep around the same time I always do even tho I just want to black out and not think or feel right in this moment. You just have to keep going",14Dec2020,1

It started on Tinder and we matched and she gave me assurances, and having felt that important to someone really stick to me. After a month of continuous chatting she just left and now I do not know what to do. She ghosted me, not even saying anything, no unfriend, no block, nothing. Its been more than a week now and still nothing and I finally said my goodbye before unfriending her. Now I am trying to go back to working on myself, working out and such, but I still can't move on from her, i feel like i do not have the energy to do anything. Having felt being important after years of feeling like i was unloved, unworthy feels good and now it is all crashing down.

11,"Lately I haven’t been enjoying my life at all. I graduated from high school this year and I just finished my first semester in college (yay). I am home for the holidays and have been at home since the 22nd of November.I am a female studying engineering and I’ve enjoyed the information i have learned so far. I decided to go 6 hours away for college because I have emotionally and mentally abusive parents. My mother is a raging alcoholic, she comes home from work and immediately will get 2 shots of monster and jager. About an hour later she’s making a margarita with triple sec and svedka. My dad is miserable and also an alcoholic. He waits about an hour to drink. 

For context, I grew up taking care of my younger brother. He’s 4 years younger than me but I have had to be his parent since I was 10-11. So the way he is now probably is because I had to raise him as a child and children can’t raise other children. I had to get him on and off the bus. Feed both of us and make sure we got all our school work done because my parents worked from 6 am to around 7-8 pm. So I feel responsible for him being a bad person. He doesn’t know how to clean or take care of himself. He won’t read for school, he puts it all in google translate and he is probably one of the most irresponsible and obnoxious children I have met. Idk if that’s because he’s my sibling or because he’s a constant reminder that I failed to raise him right. It’s been 8 years since the start of raising him, but throughout those years my grandma died when I was 12, and her husband became a more aggressive alcoholic than he already was. He drank himself into cirrhosis of the liver, and caused himself to get put in the hospital. After that he was bed ridden for 2 years and when I got home from school, I had to go over to his house which was right next door, help feed him, change him, take care of his waste bins (number 1 and 2) and I had to help him bathe. Mind you he is 6’2” and 250 lbs at that time. So my whole childhood that I remember was basically being everyone’s caregiver and that’s now my love language because idk how else to make others feel cared for. Now I’m an “adult” my parents are making me pay for college all by myself and I am a first generation college kid. I worked my ass off to help pay for school and it wasn’t enough so I had to get loans, but they had to help sign because I didn’t have any credit. They hold that over my head all the time and tell me that I’m a burden and I make their lives miserable. My parents are that way regardless of what I do. My dad isn’t romantically attracted to my mother because she’s overweight and bipolar. She’s an manipulative alcoholic who will cry just to get her way but he would lose so much financially to divorce her that he just stays. My mom is just miserable because she lost both her parents and can’t handle their deaths. She plays the victim and it drives my dad crazy. She never stops complaining. My dad tells me all the time when we are just us two that if he could leave he would. And that he only stays because my mom would either be homeless without him, despite her working 2 jobs, she can’t budget at all, or she would loll herself, as she threatens it a lot when they have divorce conversations. Usually those are in front of me lately. Since I am home for the holidays, they have me clean the whole house everyday, I’m talking moping and sweeping, cleaning bathrooms, etc. my parents used to not pay me but I’ve been “maid” since I was 11, but the older I got the more I had to do. My brother just gets to play video games all day and does nothing while I spend most of my day cleaning and making dinner because my dad doesn’t like coming home unless there is a hot home cooked meal waiting for him. They just started paying me $30 a week to clean the house everyday, even though i have a job that is super important as it is an engineering job and I need to do well so I can advance in my degree and career. My dad constantly has me re-clean the house for him if it isn’t exactly the way he wants it and it slowly breaks my heart more and more. His parents live down the road and tell me all the time I need to move out but I can’t afford to live on my own and pay my own bills when I go to work and school full time. They used to be my support system but anytime I complain about my parents they rat me out and tell them that I hate my life and wish I could never see them again. My grandpa who I had to take care of when he was bed ridden is still a support system but he still drinks and smokes and I’m allergic to cigarettes. He smokes in the house so it’s hard to spend time with him because I end up getting sick. The one support system I do have is my boyfriend. We have been together for 3 years and he’s the most helpful and amazing person I’ve met. We both helped each other get over very manipulative relationships (I was assaulted and sexually abused, he was with a crazy girl who would gas light him and if he didn’t buy her gifts or spend all his time with her she would block him and not talk to him for days). When we started talking I was severely depressed, I constantly thought about suicide and wanting to end it all but he made those thoughts go away. He’s been the light in my life and I honestly don’t think I would of stuck around in this life if it wasn’t for him. We are doing long distance which makes it hard to have him as a support system since he isn’t there all the time due to him being 2 1/2 hours away but also being in the Same major as me. When I got to college, I was crying everyday and miserable because I didn’t bring any friends along with me from my home town( didn’t have any friends anyways) but he brought his childhood best friend with him. My roommate was a drug addict. She would spend all weekend( Friday afternoon to Sunday night) sleeping with all these guys for drugs or alcohol and partying during this pandemic. She would never come home and when she did she was normally drunk high and tripping on acid she got. She wouldn’t talk to me really and I tried to bond with her but she didn’t want to. A few months pass and I’m too busy with work and school to make friends. I Try going to events my school held but it was hard to meet people still. I tried to befriend those in my major and at work but with little luck. I found one girl and we talk sometimes but she plays a sport and is usually always busy. Besides her, and I didn’t really talk to her about my problems, I suffered daily panic attacks and almost never slept. I begged my boyfriend to visit but we couldn’t make time as we always were swamped with schoolwork. I eventually asked my school for therapy so I could maybe get some relief and that’s helped some. In October, I came home for 2 days so I could grab fasfa documents for the next school year, and while I was down I got in an accident, giving me a concussion. I didn’t file is police report and drove myself 6 hours back to college, in a lot of pain and throwing up from feeling so awful. The next morning I drove myself to the ER where they told me I had a mild concussion and it would be gone in 1-4 months( I still have major issues sometimes) my teachers were not compensating me so I had to do 40 hours of school a week on a concussion that didn’t get to properly heal and I’m facing consequences now from it. We don’t have any insurance and the Guy who hit me cannot afford to pay for my medical bill for me going to the ER. So I’m having to come up with that money, as well as my parents are trying to get me to pay my car note and phone bill, but if I get my own plan it’s $300 a month just for liability car insurance so I can’t afford either way. Since I got a concussion, I was able to move into my own room( I had to leave, my roommate got to stay in our original room, I had to pack and unpack everything while I was recovering) and I have a note from my therapist that won’t let me have roommates for the rest of this year and my sophomore year of college. Now that I am home, I have no access to therapy since my school doesn’t do online ones anymore ( I ran out of online sessions) and my parents argue more than they did before I left. They drink more, scream at me more, get more aggressive and favorite my brother more than me. I am a perfect child in a sense since I don’t go to parties ever. I don’t drink or do drugs, I get good grades. I am working my ass off to try and be independent since my parents told me they don’t want me living here anymore really and it’s been hard to find a positive light in all this. My boyfriend is home for the holidays too and we are from the same hometown, so I’ve seen him 2 or 3 times since we’ve been home, which isn’t a lot since it’s almost been a month since we left college. And it makes me sad we can’t see each other more when he’s more than capable of driving to see me and I am allowed to work as much or little as I want since I work remotely and on my desktop. I build pipe systems. I have 2 dogs that keep me company but I feel so unwanted lately.


 I am such a hard worker. My therapist tells me I have a great work ethic and she thinks I’m wise because I give good advice and logically solve most of my emotional issues. But she thinks this hard life will benefit me someday and be worth all the pain but I don’t want to wait for peace anymore. I mostly sleep the pain away because it’s the closest I get to escape the nightmare I see And feel when I open my eyes and ears.College was lonely and unwelcoming, my home-life isn’t the best, I don’t get to see my boyfriend, and he’s my only support system, very often, I can’t go to therapy so I have no outlet. I have anxiety attacks everyday and I take cbd gummies to help, but they only do so much. I cry a lot and have become kinda numb to everything. I’m falling back into my ED habits ( was anorexic for two years when I was 15) and I’m just spiraling down hill and idk how to fix this anymore.  I am so good at helping everyone else but I don’t know how to help myself. I’ve always tried to help myself Since I can’t find anyone to help me really and I can’t burden my boyfriend with my feelings because I don’t want to push him away and lose him so I bottle up my feelings or I write them in a journal. But when you get no phone calls ever, no socializing with anyone except your boyfriend over text and in college you get to talk to someone once a week for an hour and you just want to have a friend, it tears you apart a little. Now that I’m home my parents don’t really talk to me so I still get no socializing and I feel hopeless. Idk what to do anymore so I just have been pretending but I haven’t been happy in a long time (probably the past 5 years). thank you to anyone who reads my rant. I know I’ll eventually get better but I always tell myself that and it’s not getting better anymore. I am out of ideas and I am losing myself again. I’d appreciate advice or a virtual hug. 

Thank you, and I love you all for being alive and pushing through when you don’t want to.",14Dec2020,1

13,"tldr

for context, i suffer(ed) from chronic ocd, severe depression, and general anxiety since i was 13 and i am 21 now. about 4 months ago i felt i had reached a point in my life where i didnt need to be on anti depressants anymore (i was on lexapro &amp; luvox but remain on lamictal- a mood stabilizer). i was clouded with brain fog and emotional numbness that i felt was associated with my srri’s; which was most likely the culprit seeing as a month after i got off them the fog went away and i was able to feel again. i am (typically) incredibly energetic, happy, funny, and talkative. i was elated after i got off my anti depressants and began seeing things in a new light. i decided to try psychedelics and it improved my life by a million. i had finished my associates degree in may and was planning on going to a university to continue my education for a bachelors this fall but due to covid i have deferred my enrollment to next fall. however, the past couple months have felt like a rapid decline in both my memory &amp; humor. i suffer from really bad anxiety once again. the past few weeks ive felt like im falling into a depression once again also. i cry when im overwhelmed (which happens very easily), tired, when im overstimulated, and for other reasons. i feel stupid and feel as if i am unable to retain information. i am incredibly scatter brained, forgetful and have a low self esteem. im tired most days but cant drink caffeine (i drink a small amount of black tea) because it only causes anxiety and doesnt actually wake me up. my short term memory feels like its terrible. i dont feel as if im the funny person i used to be and i find myself being reclusive or unable to hold conversations with ease like i used to. i get nervous when people talk to me because i dont know what to say or how to respond. i feel like im stupid. i know anxiety and depression can cause these problems. i work a very mundane job in fast food full time that doesnt promote any critical thought- ive been there for 2 years now and the past few months ive grown to hate it so ive been looking for a new job. ive been in therapy for about 8 years now and am a psych major so i am very aware of my feelings/thoughts &amp; when things are off in my body and mind. i know i am not myself. im seeking advice from others bc im wondering if i should go back on one or both of my anti depressants. im willing to deal with the brain fog and emotional numbness if it means feeling and being intelligent and humorous again. i miss my old self a lot, but im worried if i go back on them ill remain having poor memory, not having my humor, and difficulty speaking with people. i appreciate your time and hope to hear from you♥️",14Dec2020,1

Okay, so I am Autistic and a few months ago (maybe 8 I can't remember) I was annoyed with my personality and not really having any friends in school. So to stop embarrassing myself I would start suppressing my emotions so I wouldn't feel like crap, but now it's difficult to feel overly excited for something because I will force myself to stop smiling out of embarrassment and It's difficult to even cry when I feel like i'm supposed to. Now I just don't know what to do I just want to feel something, but I can't.  
Sorry for dumping this here, but any advice would be really helpful as I have no close friends",14Dec2020,1
29,"I always find every few years ill sink into a major slump of depression..... years ago a friend asked me if I had read or watched the secret. I said no I never heard of. He said shit man you seem like you know it already. And he explained some of it and I was lije shit yeah it just makes sense to think like that. But yeah there's the hard times but we can't allow that to fuck us up. So I watched a few years later. And it really put alot into perspective for me and my life got alit better.

  Now fast forward to 2020................................ uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............
   So this fucking year. This fucking has been the definition of hell for me. I lost all way vision for my future started drinking and doing way more coke than I've ever done and was probably somewhat trying to kill myself. I went fully depressed and completely self destructive. I damaged every relationship in my life.

   All I know is today I'm watching the secret again last time I brushed up on its teachings was 4 years ago and man have I lost my path......... I only hope that I can fix what I have done and the people I have hurt. Because I feel horrible but its the way I project myself and my thoughts that creates what is around me.",14Dec2020,1
30,"Its almost 2 years my dad is not here and I miss him a lotttt.Its putting me in depression especially thru the holidays

31,"Been depressed for a long time but this time was a breakup with someone 7months ago. I used to like everything we do and we share the same interest. 

After the break up I found out I hated everything he likes and what he does remind me of him. Is this normal? I used to like watching shows like animes but now I hated them so much deep down to my heart I wish I never know they existed. Is this normal to hate everything all of the sudden?",14Dec2020,1

34,"He appears to be too tired to text, he is almost never home because he is with one friend all the time (he can’t be alone). He is severely depressed and very tired. I got him a christmas package and I made him a book with positive quotes but idk how to give it to him. Should i call or would it freak him out? How do i deal with this?

Thanks",14Dec2020,1

38,"Over the past year I’ve known that I’m not ok but I feel now as though all those emotions have hit me at once and that my depression is too deep for me to be saved. I thought at first It was just to do with me feeling stressed about school ,I started staying off harmlessly now I go about twice a week and even then it’s the biggest challenge ever to actually get there and I end up leaving early due to just crying over nothing or I just feel like I have no one there. I wake up everyday and I feel like what’s the point in doing anything one second it’s 10am next it’s 9pm and I’m just staring at the ceiling it’s as if I feel numb I don’t even have enough energy / strength to cry I just feel so empty and now I’m full of nerves I feel like my bf is going to leave me and he’s like the only that can make me happy at the moment so I feel as though if he leaves again I’m going to be pushed over the edge, I’m trying to just get out how I’m feeling, I’ve told my mum but she didn’t really take it well I think she’s in denial since my sister was in the same situation years ago with attempts / thoughts etc. I’ve not tried to do anything to myself but I’m scared my thoughts are going to overpower and I might hurt myself soon, I just feel like I have no one, no one actually cares, my bf knows I feel suicidal and where is he? With his friends texting me twice a day and my mum is trying to act like nothing is happening. I’m so scared I feel as though I’m going to go nowhere this will just keep getting worse , the scariest part is I have no drive , I know I’m not going to get better so what’s the point in trying. I’m too embarrassed to try talk to anyone else since the way my bf and mum reacted / tried to help, they made me feel stupid for even opening up &amp; I don’t want people to treat me like I’m fragile. I’m just so lost , I have no friends whatsoever to turn to and console with, I feel like even if I do get help how will some random doctor or therapist make my head get out of this state I feel like I’m to deep into my depression for it to be fixed like I’m a lost cause, what do I have to live for. I just need any kind of advice to maybe try to motivate myself because i feel like if I don’t try something soon I’m going to be stuck in my bed forever, I’ve not moved from here since Saturday night it’s as if all the hours are mushing into one I can’t eat properly and I’m just sleeping so I can escape my thoughts.",14Dec2020,1
39,"It would be nice to say that ""this learning environment was not suitable for me"" or ""it was difficult to focus and stay on task"" but that all feels like padding. the fact of the matter is that i did the bare minimum of work for the past three months and i have had every opportunity to get my grades up but i havent. i have jumped back and forth between suicidal thoughts and it is hard to simply wake up sometimes. any time i have started the day with energy or innitiative it has been snuffed out by noon. its been difficult eating healthy or excersizing and i dont want to get help, i always feel like i can solve things on my on but now i cant. i dread bringing up anything about how i feel to my parents; i dont want to make our lives too complicated. i dont want to have to go out and talk to a shrink all the time. i thought i would be strong enough to fight my own battles. but now its finals week and im lucky if i pass 1/2 of my classes. i could have passed all of them. i had every opportunity. im just tired guys.",14Dec2020,1

41,Hey y’all. I’m 12 turning 13 in January. I’ve been thinking a lot about self harm but I can’t do it since there’s no way of hiding it for me. I’ve always felt down but ever since I moved away from my friends it’s been super hard for me. I wish for my death every morning when I wake up. I know it’s super dumb how I’m 12 but I don’t think like I’m 12. I’m really struggling and have no one to talk to. Help would be appreciated.,14Dec2020,1

44,"Hi there. So I don’t even know where to start. I have had anxiety since I was a kid. So, my doctor put me on Zoloft. We started at 25 mg. Then about four months ago, she bumped it up to 50 mg because I was still pretty anxious. I was feeling good then. I was glad I was getting help. I had an awesome therapist who I enjoyed. I mean, I felt like I couldn’t really talked to her so much because she only wanted know and help me out with the situation about my dad (which I will go into details about later.) 

I guess everything started when I was about 13... my dad never payed much attention to me. He treated me like a little kid (which I was at the time) but he wouldn’t give me the attention that a 13 year old female needed. I just wanted to be close to him. I only wanted to have a relationship with my dad again and go back to the good days. No matter what I did, he didn’t see it. So, the beginning of summer, 2018, he took me to a party with my cousin. I’m pretty sure it was a graduation party for our neighbor, and we wanted to congratulate them, and they invited us. Well, when we got there, it was just a bunch of teenagers partying and drinking. A few were smoking, and there was other stuff going on. My dad got a drink called jungle juice I think? Which is alcoholic. And my cousin went outside to take bong hits. Well, I took the drink out of his hands and drank it. And you know what was so sad about the whole thing? Is that he let me do it. He let his 13 year old daughter drink alcohol. From that day on, every time I was with him (him and my mom were not together anymore so I did a week on week off situation) he would allow us to take shots and smoke. And you know what? I did it. Because I wanted a relationship with my dad so bad. That I would have done ANYTHING to be with him and be treated like my cousin. She was always included in things and I wasn’t. Well, a year later, my father texts my mom and pretty much outed me. I was freaking out and calling my cousin and crying. Well my mom texts me, and asks me if it’s true. Long story short, she comes and gets me, I run out of the house because at this point my dad was holding me hostage and not letting me go, and I escaped. I remember getting into the car with my mom and just balling my eyes out. My mom was trying to comfort me and calm me down, but I was so scared and guilt ridden. 

I know that I am not allowed to discuss illegal things on here, which I technically did, but just so everyone reading this knows, my mom and I filed a police report and everything was investigated. But my dad was not arrested... which is really upsetting because he did something illegal. My mom had gotten me a therapist, and I got on medication (the Zoloft). 

Now, my therapist was there to talk to me about what happened, and that’s as it. She didn’t really care about anything else. Well, to spare any more boring details I guess, my therapist said that I didn’t need her anymore because I was doing better supposedly, and she stopped seeing me. Just like that... bebe contacted me again.. so now I’m stuck with all these feelings. I am now 16, and my dad and I had been having a rocky relationship. Finally, back in July in 2020, all hell broke loose. Before that, he would say to me “oh I’m gonna stop drinking.” Or “I’m sober.” Which he is a liar. And an alcoholic if you hadn’t caught on yet. In July, I went up to see him for my brothers birthday. He had invited me to go up to Oregon with my brothers, him, and his girlfriend. I wanted to see my brothers because I hadn’t seen them in so long, so I agreed. I was scared.... but I did it because I wanted to see my brothers. I didn’t know that he was gonna be driving too. He didn’t have a license, and I thought were were all gonna pack into his girlfriends car. But no. My dad insisted he drive. Well, he had been drinking, swerving all over the road, and he stole his girlfriends alcohol that she brought for herself while we were at the fun center. My mom had to come rescues me (again) and there I was. In the same situation. He was grabbing onto me, cussing at me, threatening to beat mine and my moms shit up. It was terrible. 

This incident was reported as well, but yet again, the cops didn’t do anything because it was serious. Or he had to be caught in the act.. I guess. This whole justice system is fucked. So nothing was done. Like why the fuck do they have you report shit but then don’t do anything about it? 

Anyways, next story....

My boyfriend and I met here on reddit, (I know, don’t fucking come at me please. I didn’t intend to fall in love with the fucker!) we were just friends. I wasn’t attracted to him, and all we did was play Minecraft and call. But... like every other fucking fairy tale, I fell in love with him. We both were head over heals. Well, three months later, he starts ignoring me. Just stopped texting. So guess what I did. I messaged the bitch on Snapchat! He left me onread for weeks. Finally he answered. He told me that he “couldn’t maintain this.” And “there are still so much things you don’t know about me.” So here I am.... fucked again. I loved him so much. I really did. So then like a week and a half ago, he texted me and said “we can talk. In two weeks okay? I want to talk to you too.” And so naturally I was like “yeah.” But then I started thinking. I texted him back the next day and basically explained that if he was gonna make me wait two weeks for him to just break up with me then he should just do it, because I have been waiting two months for him... he said “I’m not done with you. I’m sorry I asked you to wait even longer. We will talk soon.” And I left it at that. 

Oh, and on thanksgiving, my dad texted my mom asking to see me since it was “the holidays” of course I said no! I don’t ever wanna see his dumb fuck face again. 

So here I am, waiting for him to text me, and just sulking. This semester has been shit, and I am failing my classes. I need to take a college class next semester, but I don’t see that happening due to my grades. I hate myself. I literally fucking hate myself and want my boyfriend to text me already. I want him and only him. I am depressed I think, and I have so much anxiety, and I wanna just sleep and not be messed with. And in all of this, I don’t know how to tell my moms that I’m depressed and the medicine isn’t working. I tried to tell her it wasn’t working before, but she said “it is honey, I have seen a huge improvement.” My grandma also says she sees an improvement, but then again, she ignored me for a week because I decided I wanted to start taking medicine. So she’s just saying shit. To top everything, my moms is back in school, and she is so mean and frustrated all the time. Everytime I try to say good morning, she is already on her computer, and she tells me to go away. She doesn’t cook breakfast for me anymore, which I’m 16, and I know how to cook my own shit, but she would ALWAYS cook me something. I tell her I love her, but she doesn’t respond really. I try to be nice, but she just yells and calls me lazy. Which I guess I am lazy, but it’s because I’m so dead inside. I have no motivation, no interest in doing things I love anymore. So, yeah... please excuse me if I don’t want to scoop the fucking cat box. At this point, I don’t know what to do. I have no one on both sides of my family I can talk to anymore. My grandma and I used to be super close, but ever since my other older cousin got married, she has been breathing down her neck and always with her. My sister is always in her room and never wants to play video games with me anymore. I’m scared of all men, so when my stepdad invites me to do things, I always say no because I’m scared he’s gonna hurt me. Even though he wouldn’t do anything like that, I just always have this fear. 

My friends dad passed away, so we can’t relate about daddy issues anymore because everytime I bring up my dad I feel bad... 

I don’t know why I’m on here... I guess I just need help. I need help sorting through my feelings. I need advice. I need support. I need love. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to do good in school... but I don’t know how. I suck at geometry and I’m flailing just everything. I don’t know how to approach my mom about this depression... and I don’t know how to get anyone to take me seriously. 

Can someone just please help me? Or tell me what to do.... I don’t know if it’s the medicine making me depressed, or if I just need a new therapist. Please just someone....because I’m quite frankly out of options here... thank you if you read everything. I appreciate it.",14Dec2020,1
45,"My friend is an outstanding, independent girl. She's lately struggling with some issue that makes her so down. She zones out, isolates herself,thinks a lot and it affects her physically. She doesn't easily share so she doesn't talk about what bothers her, she says she's good on her own and she can get over this by herself. I try to give her space, I don't ask her to talk about what's happening, yet I try to support her all other ways I can. I send her music she loves, memes she'd like, I could hardly see her just to give her chocolate and a nice note. I try my best to have a walk or coffee with her just to make her feel better but she postpones all requests "" till she feels better"". She says no one has to bear the negative vibes and I always assure her I don't mind, company will help, yet she still rejects.

I want to help her get through this, without being pushy and giving her the space she needs, yet still in a way that would be suitable with her character. I really need every advice as I can't see her struggling the way she does and feel helpless.",14Dec2020,1
46,"Sorry you guys have to read this. There's a good chance I won't post this, it is what it is I guess. I feel slightly guilty and dumb for being here to be honest, apologies anyone has to spend time reading this incoherent mess. Maybe writing this somewhere might help me. I don't know. 

(note, this does contain a bit of life story, my apologies)

I think this is more of a note to what has happened this year in terms of my mental health. I hate to admit it

**The past.**


I've.. never had the best mental health. I don't know why, but I've struggled with self confidence issues, social awkwardness, and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've always struggled with this stuff.


This year, I wanted to work to better myself. In the earlier months, I was going, well, sort of okay actually. I tried speaking to people, thinking less about how others think of me. To be honest, it didn't get very far, but it got *somewhere*.


Then, covid hit. Lockdown came. I withdrew from, well, life. Talked to no one, started obsessing over what other people thought of me, pretended to ignore my deteriorating mental state. I think depression started to set in slightly at that point. I was struggling then.. struggling to stay afloat.

Eventually, somehow, I got myself out of the sea of sorrow, and onto shore. I still didn't know how I did it, not then, not really now. 

I was.. okay for the next couple months. not amazing or anything, but I was stable. I can't even begin to express how good it is just to be *stable*. just to feel okay.

Coming closer to around June, and I think, slowly, that my mental health starts to suffer again. At this time, I don't notice it.

Second lockdown has come. I'm really struggling now. 


i still don't have any way to deal with this. See, my method of fixing mental health problems.. is to just ignore it. Pretend I'm okay. And I have to tell myself that everything's fine.. when it's really not. all in an effort to not get pulled underwater.. it still takes me down.
 I'm tired of this.. I can't do it this way any longer. I feel so fragile sometimes.. that i could collapse with it all at any moment. Sometimes, the weight of my problems gets too much for my to cope in this way. 
Sorry, I'm getting off topic.


Depression has become more noticeable than ever. It's still relatively new to me, I don't really understand it much.. if at all. I don't get enjoyment or excitement the same way I used to. Nothing feels the same, I'm tired all the time, have no energy, no will to do things. I never feel happy now. Oh I wish I could though. I wish I could be okay.

I don't really have any coping mechanisms or know what to do with this. can you guys give any tips?

Thanks. I know this reads like a life story/ramble/vent, but it did actually help a little. at least writing this has allowed me to acknowledge my problems somewhat. something that I've learned though is that, for me personally, I never really beat my demons/problems. I just learn to live with them. to know that they'll always be there, but to adapt around them, i think.",14Dec2020,1
47,"So lately I've been feeling really sad and really down, I'd say it's a mix of losing touch with someone I loved and that made me feel special, starting uni and just the whole covid situation not allowing me to be around friends for a while.
Every so often, almost daily, I get really sad at night, I start thinking about all I lost and about all I can't have right now, regarding friends, I lose motivation for anything, don't wanna get up but also don't wanna stay in bed doing nothing, I just can't do anything and I have to force myself to go to uni and sketch a smile on my face so I don't worry the friends I made there.
It's getting to the point where I'd say it's unliveble to have this feeling everyday, but I feel like I can't do anything about it, doesn't feel like my choice to be sad or happy anymore. If there's anything you guys would suggest to try and brighten up my mood I'd love some help. Thanks in advance.",14Dec2020,1
48,"I wish things weren’t so hard for me to do, but I brushed my teeth and drank some water today, so I’m proud of myself. I am trying to stop calling myself a failure, and instead celebrate my successes more. I know that getting up and brushing my teeth isn’t much, especially since I got right back in bed and its basically the only thing I’ve done today, but I am happy that I took care of myself a little. It was hard for me to do it, so I am proud of myself for pulling it off :)",14Dec2020,1
49,"So it's been a hell of a day for me..

And a hell of a year too...

Not only is 2020 slowly depleting my sanity.. but this year has also taken away everything that actually bought me happiness in life.

NOT ONLY HAS THIS FUCKING SHIT SHOW OF A YEAR TAKEN AWAY MY PRIDE AND MY LIFE BUT I AM TO THE POINT OF WHERE I JUST MIGHT DO SOMETHING DRASTIC

But anyway today has been a REAL shit day..and let me explain why..

This morning I had waken up to my ipad (given from the school to me to do school work) to see it have a crack in the side. Now I don't know how or why but the school said if the ipad gets damaged in anyway possible, the owner of said tablet has to pay a HUGE fine to replace the thing. THANK FUCK that it still works though it just has a crack in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. But still in all seriousness 
My family isn't doing well financially and we are trying to move to a better place. Somewhere in south Carolina right next to north Carolina (where my close childhood friend has moved too)

Next thing I know is that as I'm checking into my account for school  that all of my grades are low for some reason. All of the grades that were once actually passing grades are now all failing. (I have a VERY hard time trying to keep up with my teacher and the other kids in my class. And whenever I  ask for help I'm always scared because I constantly get axiety attacks for the littlest things. I don't know how or why but I just do apparently.

OH AND THE LAST THING oh ohohoho ho here is the kicker! My older brother (FUCKING BLESS YOU JIMMIE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!) decided to try try and make me feel better by taking me and our great dance Gypsy for a walk. Everything was fine until Gypsy started acting..weird.. once we got home she basically collapsed right in front of me and Jimmie and stopped moving.

Now I know great Danes are prone to heart failure but when we got her from the house to take a walk with us she was fine, happy, running around like the puppy she is.....or...was.

Me and Jimmie just sat there,


 Holding her,

as she slowly died in our arms.

And worst of all is after all this happened I started to become VERY suicidal again. 

I've tried alot of things to keep me happy but nothing has worked so far.


The worst part is this: I've been trying to get in contact with the Suicide Prevention life-line and every time I try calling them I'm told by my phone that this number cannot be reached due to my phone being unable to work anymore. The phone company that I use to power my phone is being a major problem and won't let me call text or even use the data on my phone to call or text. 

So I'm not even sure if life is worth it anymore

Maybe hurting myself will finally make the pain stop......


Or that's just what I'm telling myself now...",14Dec2020,1
