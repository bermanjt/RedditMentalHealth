3,"My sister has worked at a cafe for the past few years and she really enjoys her job, or at least she did until the past year when the owners son started working there. 
Recently my sister has been really depressed after the death of someone very close. She has got diagnosed with depression and is taking medication as well as talking to professionals. 
My sister gives a lift to and from work to him as he lives in the same village as we do (unlike his parents who live where the cafe is). For the past few months he has been talking about his depression to my sister and saying he is going to kill himself and that he does not know what he would do without her. This has become a real trigger for my sister and is not in the mental state really to support him. She has helped him sort his finances out and took him to the doctors about his depression but she really can’t take him talking about his depression anymore to her. 
She dreads driving him to and from work everyday but does not know what to do to a point where she cries pretty much every night before hand. 
She fears if she tells him that she can’t listen to him talk about it anymore that he will do something like hurt himself and she will feel guilty. 
They are not even very close in her opinion but for some reason he has chosen her to confide in about all of his suicidal thoughts. She has told his mother (her boss) that she doesn’t know what to do and how rubbish it is making her feel but she does nothing to help. 
She sees the only solution to be her quitting her job eventhough she really enjoys working there and are not many jobs as we live practically in the middle of nowhere. 
Any advice other than her quitting her job?",03Jan2020,1

6,"Basically all of 2019 I've spent in deep thought thinking about life and how fucked up everything is and how horrible my life is but I think even after everything I learned from all the thinking, I'm just tired of it I've been thinking so much that I've had people say I literally look like I'm crazy. Maybe it really ties in with my loneliness, makes sense to stay deep in thought if you never have anyone to talk to but wouldn't that instantly make me crazy to begin with? I have social anxiety now that at this point I really just feel like my life is over. I've spent such a long amount of time thinking about death and suicide and how to kill myself and the afterlife so much over and over and over that I really do think I'm just completely mad now, like a mad scientist but of thinking about thoughts. My view of reality has completely shifted from back in 2017/18 compared to now, I overthink so much that I've lost my own view of myself. I don't know how to not act awkward all the time because I'm constantly being blared negative feelings or that someone is judging me which due to my appearance they probably are... It's truly heartbreaking I just wish I had a little bit of a way to cope with this hole feeling in my heart. I can tell I'm losing my mind to loneliness and the work/sleep/work/sleep life I just wanna lie down and sleep forever.",03Jan2020,1

8," So I've been in therapy for a bit because of anxiety and depression and I've also had a troubled relationship with eating. I can't eat without guilt and fear of gaining weight so I tend to eat very little and I can't eat any ""bad"" foods like meat, dairy, sugar, bread, etc. I passed out on the toilet a couple weeks ago and originally I just believed that I wasn't eating enough so I told my therapist about it. She said that because I'm a minor, she has to talk to my parents about it, but when I warned my mom (who thinks I'm faking it and just doing it for attention) about the upcoming phone call, she said that she was going to tell my therapist that I had taken dulcolax the night before and that the food part didn't impact it at all. Idk, maybe the laxative had something to do with it, but fainting from laxatives isn't common so I didn't think about bringing it up in therapy. I just don't want my mom to make my therapist not believe me anymore or think that I'm lying because I really really need help.",03Jan2020,1
9,"I'll be straight forward, I'm not diagnosed yet. I haven't really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I don't qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere I'm randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice it's happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. 

Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. 

Fast forward to now and I've started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said that's it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often they've stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just can't get what I want out of life and I don't want to live a long unfulfilled life. Don't get me wrong, I'd much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. I'm not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? 

Thanks, anon",03Jan2020,1
10,"I’m not trying to make anyone sorry for me, I’m only looking for advice or help or just having some people hear what I have. Thank you to all my readers.

In the beginning of this school year, I was doing alright. I broke up with a girl that moved many miles away and the fact that we were both young made it even harder to keep that going for us, so I started off this school year single, but I was still happy.

Three days into the school year I was moved next to this really funny and beautiful freshman (she’s a female, I am straight (not that it matters, it’s just more detail)). We started getting feelings for each other and unfortunately after a quick two weeks we both wanted to date and she became my girlfriend, as well as homecoming companion. 

We both had our first ever kiss on homecoming and every time we said goodbye to each other after homecoming we kissed.

*Fast forward a month*

She wants me to go over to her house if I was alright with sneaking out. I decided I was going to do it. It was a 45 min bike ride one way and then a 40 min bike ride back home (hills) but the first time sneaking out I only made it 8 minutes in until I had to call it off. 

Two nights later I try again and make it to her house. That night we spent an hour making out (not exaggerating) and the rest was cuddling, exploring around the room and telling quiet stories.

*Fast forward two weeks*

I’m sneaking out almost every other day and we get more and more close with what we do, if you catch my drift.

And then finally, I did one of my largest regrets ever. She took off her shirt and shorts and I put my hand between her legs. I felt it being wet and she said to me to do what I wanted with her, so I eventually put two fingers inside of her (this becomes more important later on).

We continued doing it (we didn’t have sex luckily, but my tongue has done something multiple times) for a little while until around Thanksgiving she got distant. I asked her about it and the first many times she asked me not to worry about it, but I knew she wasnt happy, so I continued asking and said she can tell me anything and I won’t be sad. 

Super close to Thanksgiving and we break up over text when I told her if she wanted to break up it would be alright and then she said “yeah can we be friends? I mean you’re a great guy and I really want to be friends, but I am not sure I even like guys.” I said of course but I deep down knew I wouldn’t want to be friends because it would do the same thing it’s doing to me now. (I later find out this is because she has a crush on her best friend (another female)).

My best friend (also a female) starts helping me through many issues I started having, including my dad getting older and a lot more irritable (he’s 62 and Iranian, already making him a different father than normal), and the fact that from then and to now whenever I see her (the ex) I get shocked with memories of stuff I did with her and it tears me apart seeing her happy and dandy as if nothing ever happened. I started drinking sips of old beer that was in the back of my fridge that was never removed from way back when my mom was drinking long before I was born. It tastes terrible but helps sometimes when I’m most lost.

*Fast forward to a week later*

My ex tells me about her crush on her best friend and that it was from while we were dating mid way in. She then tells me I am a terrible kisser which shouldn’t have made me think about it more than I did, but it was enough to break my confidence, even though she thought I was a great kisser while we were dating and wanted more and more until a little passed a mid way in.

*Fast forward to Christmas Day*

I go to Savannah, Georgia with my family to stay at a close family friends house. There is an aunt, uncle and cousin, however they aren’t blood related, they are close enough to be considered that. During the night, the aunt was downstairs and I didn’t want to kiss another girl until I knew I was a good kisser, so I made the worst mistake of my life, and I asked the aunt if she could test to see if I was a good kisser. She luckily said no but I said she wasnt my real aunt and she said that it would be disrespectful to my dad and her husband. I asked her to keep it between the two of us and she said of course. 

Now a little bit after this my best friend wants to no longer talk to me. I’m still not sure why, but she was very serious about it and blocked me after writing bye.

Well.. *fast forward to New Years Day*

My dad is more angry and way more irritable. I was shaving in the hall bathroom (there are two bathrooms, one in the hall and one in my dads room) and my brother told me to get put so he could use the bathroom. I went to my dads bathroom and there my dad came in and said for me to go so he can use that bathroom. I chuckled and he said whats that laugh for!? I said it was because I was moved from both bathrooms and he said in a very stern tone of voice “you have a weird sense of humor, you got that!?” And i said “maybe its just our age difference..” that set him off. 

When he came out of the bathroom he said (this is roughly translated because most the time he speaks Iranian or Farsi) “you’re a son of bitch, jackass! You’re weird in the worst form of the word!” He started growling and grumbling and it was very hard to understand what he was saying, then later after my brother comes out of the hall bathroom (he takes a while) my dad said “YOURE A JACKASS!! Have I ever called you jackass? (The question was to my brother)” my brother responds with “a few times” and my dad said “really? Oh, well you’re not, but THIS ONE IS!!”

After more growling he grabbed me by the sweatshirt and brought me to my brothers room and said “REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID WITH AMMEH (ammeh means aunt)!? YEAHHH, YOU KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT NOWWW DONT YOU!!” At this point the regret that already was in my mind from the moment i stepped away from asking the aunt that question just quadrupled. He started rumbling and rambling and yelling and he smacked my head once to I think smack sense into me but that made no sense.

Later on he asks me a lot of questions about porn and thats when I realized.. *he thinks im a perv.. he thinks i wanted to have pleasure by kissing the aunt* and thats when I just got disgusted and later on in the day I told him that but he said “DONT BULLSHIT ME!” (In English, thats when you know he ran out of things to say in Farsi.. i missed a lot of names he called me in Farsi, they are so weird even I dont understand lots of them like one of them is that you’re snake venom, so yeah). My dad has been aggravated at me and has been distant and he never was the supportive type of dad, but I didnt need a supportive type of dad until I couldn’t take anymore of the atmosphere he had created around me. 

Now you may be asking “well what about your mom?” The answer to that kind reader is that my mom is in a funeral home, and has been divorced with my dad for 12 years and married to another guy for 10 years. I used to live with my mom, but when I was seven she had a stroke and her entire left side of her body has become paralyzed. As time went on her mental health got worse and worse. She now has dementia and is I think developing alztimers (i dont know how to spell it).

I am not the only child of my dad that has an issue with him.. my sister does too, a major one in fact. My dad was very physical with her and they had many arguments that ruined so many potentially awesome trips like Paris. She moved out as fast as she could and called the police on my dad three or four times and had a restraining order on him once. She now lives in her own apartment and I’m stuck with an even more irritable father. 

This is my life, and as of recently I’ve been stuck to crying myself to sleep and getting useless help from school counselors. I want to be a greater father to my children than my dad could ever be, but the key is to making it there first.  I’m not sure how much more of this I can take before I collapse and break completely.. if anyone is reading this, please comment, anything will do, even a hi.

12,"Hi. I'm not too familiar with this subreddit but honestly I really need someone to talk to right now.

I've been diagnosed with medical depression/ anxiety for a couple years now, taking medication and am now generally doing pretty well. I started college in the fall and the semester was amazing. However, since winter break started I've been having awful feelings about just living. 

I wouldn't say I have major suicidal tendencies but heck I've thought about it. I want to pain to go away so badly. Its gotten to the point where I feel physically sick. I can't stop crying. I feel awful.

I'm lonely here and things aren't the way they used to be. That automatically fills me with anxiety. I haven't felt this way in so long and I thought I never would again. 

I don't know what I need but maybe someone here could help. I'm scared to fall asleep because of the nightmares I've been having. Maybe someone could talk. Idk.",03Jan2020,3
13,"hello everyone my name is Jake and this is my first reddit post. I'm 21 and have been struggling with depression for a majority of my life. my story starts out when i was 12, my parents got divorced. my mom moved out and my dad ended up having to sell the house I grew up in. through all that i was Just starting middle school and had been moved away from all my childhood friends and rezoned for school. desperate to be accepted and make friends i started to act out and became a part of the schools problem children. In 7th grade i began smoking weed and drinking. i had racked up 31 detentions and 2 ISS's. my parents were obviously furious with me and blamed the people i hung out with. the same kind of behavior continued through 8th grade, and then i got to high school. i had been caught with weed before and each time would be grounded for at least a month where i wasn't allowed to do anything. while being grounded i would start to become extremely depressed. everyone even your family treated you like you were a criminal. by the time i turned 15 i was arrested for the first time for simple possession of weed. while on house arrest i quickly began to realize that the people i was hanging out with wernt real friends as most of them stopped talking to me because we couldn't smoke together. this only made me hate life more, and so i began cutting myself. i had never done bad in school but i didn't really study and didn't really care all together. another year passes and i fall deeper into drugs, by the age of 16 I had tried about everything besides meth or crack and had became a heavy drinker. constantly getting into trouble i slowly push my family away. me and my friends began to brainstorm on how to make money and we decided robbing peoples drugs was a good way. we first attempted it on the weed man. we game him a bunch of fake bills rubber banded together with a real one on the outside. and sped off. he took it and could never find us. we tried it again on a different guy and he ended up jumping on top of my car as we sped away tapping a gun on the window so i stopped and through the weed out and he jumped off. i had just turned 17 and i got arrested again. this time was a bit more serious, and we got a news story about us. some people were at the basket ball court messing with us so we got in my car and shot all them with the bb gun i had in the trunk. they ended up calling the cops and i got 8 felonies for it. by now my family has almost lost complete faith in me and i hate myself too. i began to dig deeper into my depression as threats of being sent away began to be thrown around. i met a girl that i really liked and we started to become a thing. all was good until our friend group started doing pills. she ended up fucking my best friend and lied to me about it. this was the worst i had ever felt in my whole life, i genuinely loved her. i began to cut myself more and more and thoughts of suicide began to rise. all i could think is how i've lost all my friends,how my family hates me, and what a terrible example/ influence i had become on my 2 younger brothers. later that year i got arrested again for graffiti and got felony vandalism. it was only a month before i turned 18 so luckily all my charges were expunged because i did them all as a minor. feeling like all i've done is fuck up my whole childhood, i decided to apply for college and attempt to makes my parents proud. dropping all of my old friends, i tried to start a new life. the first 2 weeks of school i had gotten arrested for underage drinking. i really started to lose hope, but i decided to keep pushing myself. i have been working very hard the past few years and am now a 4th year engineering student. every now and then i would fail, but i would just keep pushing and trying harder. however the smarter and more mature i become the more i begin to realize how cruel and pointless life is. we spend the majority of everyday doing stuff we don't enjoy. surrounded by toxic social media and propaganda that just breeds depression and hate. i'm not religious so i see no real point in anything, no deeper meaning to life. i'm now finding myself in a place to where i hate waking up every morning, and my past mistakes have turned me into someone i hate. i've been majorly depressed lately and the only way i know how to deal with it is cutting my self. i keep telling myself to stop but i just get really drunk and end up doing it anyway. i now have giant scars all over my upper arms that i will try and hide from my family for the rest of my life. one night was particularly worse than the others, and i decided i was going to kill myself. i put my pistol to my head and sat in my room crying and drunk. i was in there for an hour or so and realized i couldn't do it. i didn't have enough resolve, not enough reason. everyday i wake up so depressed i cant even eat sometimes. i feel like i'm just waiting for something significant enough to happen to were i finally get pushed over the edge and i can finally end it all. school is so depressing and difficult but i know i need to finish it, i just wanna make my family proud. not really sure why i decided to make an account and post this, but id appreciate any advice.",03Jan2020,2

16,"My partner has got to the point of begging me to try the medication route for tackling my depression and anxiety as he's saying he's losing me to myself and my own misery. Over the last 3 years I've tried NHS provided Steps 2 Change CBT phone calls and group therapy which were both awful. I have had 6/7 private one-to-one therapy sessions which are helpful at the time but then I'm back to my miserable self as soon as I'm home. And I have tried so many self help apps, watched so many different self help videos and read articles from bloggers, psychiatrists, therapists, etc and I definitely feel like I'm running out of ideas, but I am terrified of going onto medication. 

My partner is always saying how I shouldn't worry as his mum has been on Citalopram as long as he can remember and it has really helped her, but then I have the experience of seeing my dad on many sorts of medication for depression for as long as I can remember and he has actually weaned himself off it all over the last year because he hates what it turned him into, saying it made him foggy, more irritable, more forgetful, and more anxious. 

So I'm looking for some genuine feedback and thoughts from people who have taken medication, to help me see what it is really like from more than just 2 people at different ends of the scale.

20,"I hate to be one of those kids thats life was ruined by my parents divorce but after trying to deny for years , theres no more denying the trauma i endured during that time continues to affect my daily in my adult life. I am major depressive with general anxiety. 
I come from a family of mixed cultural backgrounds. My mother is white and my dad in an immigrant from afghanistan. It was a messy divorce that was clearly lined with a ton of emotion manipulation to hate each parent. There was a weird time when i was in fourth/ fifth grade where i was handed off to my aunt and had no idea what happened to my parents or my brother. I was bullied by my aunt , cousins , and by the children at school. That was the first time i really ever felt worthless and unwanted and wanted to truly die. That feeling has haunted me for the rest of my life. My father , who at the time was struggling immensely financially and later on in life was revealed to me that my brother had went to work to help support him eventually took me back and continued to emotionally manipulate me to hate my mother since she never called or came to see me. I love my dad however My dad was extremely controlling and even though i had changed schools and made a few friends i was still isolated and unable to really connect with others. In an attempt to find freedom mid 7th grade, i had moved in with my mother who now at this time decided to pay some attention to my life since she had had some time to heal from her own trauma regarding the terrible marriage. I was really starting to show symptoms of major depression at this time. I had met a girl who was bisexual and she had become my first girlfriend. At this time i had tried to come out to my mom as gay but instead of acceptance she threatened to kick me out and to out me to my father so he could ""beat it out of me"". This lead me to never open up again to family and live my secretly. I now abuse weed to cope with existence. I had wanted so badly to just be loved for who i was as a child. Now that i am older i have a decent relationship with my parents but recently i had an abortion with my now husband and had a horrible panic attack when i realized if my parents ( or most people) had any idea of who i truly was inside , would never love me.

23,"Hi, i am almost at my mid twenties. living the fabulous Hikikomori lifestyle. An extrovert turned introvert. My early years i lived in a bubble, pretending everything was awesome. Pretended to have a happy family. Truth is my dad has been cheating since i was young. my dad and my mom lived in different cities because of their jobs. my school life was with my mom and my dad's parents in the same house.   
when i came to live with my dad for my junior collage and uni, i saw what life my dad has been hiding. My dad had convinced my mom to let a lady live in the same house with the excuse that she would clean and cook for us. she worked at his work place. my mom is so naive. I tried to tell my relatives but no one believed me. That made me distant from my family. it also affected my relationship at the time and when she also was cheating on my when i was telling how dishonest my dad was.  
Everything has been going down hill from there. This was the birth of my monster. The monster showed me that i have no voice and no one will believe me. It affected my studies, i remember my hands shaking during exams and i was unable to focus to write the answer on the paper even tho i knew the answer. My monster taught me that i cant have control of my anger and emotions. My friends saw me and gossiped about me and my problems instead of helping me through it. I had to leave the city looking for a fresh start and a change of place.   
My monster followed me there too, tormenting me. I started missing my lectures. i made some new friends but later the same old shit, rumors and gossip. even tho i debunked the rumors the damage had already been done. I am tired of explaining my self, being misunderstood. my monster taught me friends are fake and untrustworthy.      
I started working. Did everything i could to help the company make profits. my bosses where terrible and toxic ...  yelling, pointing out mistakes, ripping of the clients, half the office left while i was there. That is how my monster grew big enough to break my confidence.   
I use to think i have 3 close friends but when you haven't spoken to them in more than a year you know they want nothing to do with me. That is how my monster showed me i cant have a social life. long time back i had someone told me that i am one of those people who can talk to anyone. now i feel weird and anxious talking to new people. I withdraw my self for people because i feel insecure around them. I will disappear some times for months or year. I hate the fact that i cant put forward my best self in front of people.   
   I do this social experiment on online streaming channels and try to make friends, play computer games with them. I try to connect with people, relate to people but i have failed every time. My monster taught me that i am irrelevant. nothing i do will matter. There are like 8 billion people and one sole truly ask me how i am.   
My monster has grown stronger than me now. its trying to push me off the ledge and i dont have the strength to fight it. My monster is scary now and i am sacred.",03Jan2020,1
24,"I’m 22 &amp; have had depression &amp; anxiety for over a decade- so this negative mindset that shows itself at times has always been present
Anytime i talk about something, see something awful on my parents favorite channel-the news-, or hear a conversation with points that i disagree with (lot of morals), i get told by my mom:
 “why are you looking at this so negatively?”
“why are you letting yourself get so worked up about this?”
“it’s not even affecting you directly, so why do you have such a strong opinion on this?”
“don’t get so worked up about this, just let it go”
“you only point out the negative things so i’m trying to show you the opposing view”

I understand that it is a good thing to show the opposing viewpoint so you can fully make your own opinion, but i have always been one to contemplate &amp; think of all point of views-i’m pretty open minded in that sense- but me being a sensitive person (well an HSP), i seem to first always lean towards the emotional reasoning &amp; the rational part after, or secondary, of lesser importance. Probably because i know what it’s like to feel emotionally invalid/not cared about/misunderstood, so the sympathy for others is very present. but that also makes me question why I DO get so easily affected by being told basically (well i feel it at least) that i’m wrong or my thinking is wrong. I feel no one in my family really understands either where i’m coming from or how my mind works- not that i expect them too, but i do expect a little acceptance so i don’t continue to spiral down , continuously doubting myself &amp; beliefs because i’ve been told it’s wrong my whole life.

I have this feeling that when I turn 19 society will shift its focus on me and focus on the other teenagers, and I'm just going to be another number in the workforce, I can't even go to college. 
It's this feeling of entitledness and seflishness I have, how can others move on, how can people younger than me grow up, when I haven't even gotten the chance to celebrate my own 18 years?",03Jan2020,2
26,"For two years ive been having problems enjoying things. It first started in 2017 when I was having problems enjoying movies anymore. Now it's moved to video games, music,tv, everything. Even hanging with friends. It got better a few months ago and I was beginning to enjoy things. But then this voice in my head tells me to stop enjoying things. Like for instance when I'm watching movies or tv and enjoying it the voice will be like ""this isn't real you shouldn't enjoy this"" and such. And it'll ruin my enjoyment somehow even though deep down I know it doesn't matter if it's real or not. It's the same for music in a way. I don't know I just want to stop feeling like this. Some days it'll get really bad too and I'll just have this had feeling and not be able to enjoy anything. Could I get any help? I'm 18 by the way and I'm wondering if it's just a teenager thing maybe and I'll grow out of it? I don't know I'm just tired of feeling like nothing alot.",03Jan2020,1

A little back story that may help to understand the venting I’m about to do....or maybe I’m spitting out too much info, idk, but ima say it anyways~

Context~~~
Felix/best friend ~ He/Him 17 Y/O transgender 
Me~ He/Him 16 Y/O pansexual 

Prologue~~~Me and Felix have had a “crush” on each other since June-ish, and in June, he got in a relationship...complicated allready, right?? It gets more complicated on my end!! So up in October he confessed that he still had feelings for me....and he was still in a relationship with the person from the beginning...of course, being the clingy son of a bitch I am, I still had feelings for him too....and it’s January 3rd at the time of me making this....and I still have those same feelings for him!! I’ve tried getting rid of those feelings, but I can’t!!! I just can’t!!!! And it’s hurting me I think....cause I care too much about him than what I should as a best friend....like, he is THE REASON i wake up in the morning and don’t blow my brains out.....I care for him so much that it pains me to see him hurting....and so it hurts me to see him in the slump he’s in right now....

Part 1~~~So recently my best friend (Felix) has been in a really bad slump lately....to the point where he is heavily suicidal...and it’s tearing me up inside because I care for him so much!! I love him with all my heart man! It hurts to think that one of these days I may get a message saying that he’s killed himself!!!! If I’m going to be 100% honest here....we used to have a crush on each other...we still do TBH, but he is in a relationship with someone else....but that’s besides the pint right now. I can’t help to think that I may never see his face again.....to think I’ll never play overwatch with him again...to think....that the only reason I’m still on this earth, could be gone....

Part 2~~~when I first met Felix and his friend group, he was the one that saved my goddamn life!!!! I would of ended my existence if it wasn’t for him....and now seeing him in the slump of his own....I don’t know if I can help or not....cause his girlfriend doesn’t pay attention to him that often, she leaves him on read for hours on hand, when they call she calls in a room full of people, and Felix can’t do that because he has too much anxiety and can’t focus on 5 different people talking at the same time; so he hangs up the call, when they do talk it’s allways fighting, venting, or roleplay.....so their relationship is causing him to have this crippling loneliness that he can’t get rid of cause they can’t spend IRL time together ( because it’s a long distance relationship) his guardians don’t give a fuck about him, they take advantage of him....and to put the cherry on top....he has a guilty conscience that follows him everywhere, saying that everything that goes wrong is his fault....

Conclusion~~~So I don’t know what to do.....I want to help him so goddamn bad!! I want to reassure him that I care about him! That there is someone that cares about his well being, his mental state, his problems, his thoughts, his ideas, HIS LIFE!! But I feel like the only way I can reassure him, is by telling him the way I feel about him.....but I don’t want him to get the wrong idea for it...I’m afraid he’s going to look at me like I’m a clingy, stalking, fuck boy, when I just legitimately care for him!!!! I’m just lost....and I don’t know how to solve it...so I’m asking for your guys help...I’ve come to this subreddit before, you guys have helped me twice before, I ask you guys to help me again!!!! Please!!!",03Jan2020,2
33,"She basically doesn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

She's like ""i've just accepted that everything's bad and it's gonna say that way""

and im like "" no things can get better, nothing's set in stone. but no one's gonna change it for you. You need to do it yourself.""

and she's like ""i dont care enough about it to change it.""

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it. No matter how shit things are she doesnt care enough to try and improve them. idk how to help.",03Jan2020,4
34,"Ive been depressed for 5 years, but my depression its at its worst because i feel empty after finishing college doing a degree i really dislike (Sorry if my english is a little off, i speak Spanish mostly), i also have another medical condition. I feel fomo for people doing great things with their lives like traveling or doing a masters but i only have a 3.3 GPA and i didnt even like my major :( psychology focused on HR. Should i help my depression before start studying something else or what should i do? I think its not right to enroll in a master’s program if i dont like the carreer. I hope someone sees this",03Jan2020,2
35,"I think I used to be close to people and I don’t feel that way anymore. I have friends but I know I put up a lot of walls and I don’t know how to stop. I’m scared when hanging out with people because I feel like I could mess up at any second. I invite people out and go to things I’m invited to but I think my interactions are wrong. My friends have started to point out that I’m not as present, and it’s hurting their feelings. Some have completely stopped reaching out. I want to be a good friend but I don’t know what or how to change. Has anyone made their relationships better while depressed? How do you keep your energy up and have positive interactions?",03Jan2020,2
36,"I'm a boy (17M). There's this girl (17F) in my grade. From September to Christmas, we were in the school Madrigal choir, but it ended right before Winter break. I started doing acts of courtesy every day (holding doors open, complimenting her, etc). She was very friendly and always initiated conversations with me (I'm very shy and an outcast, so this was so exciting for me). We have common interests and I really love everything about her. She even gave me a Christmas present and told me how happy she is that we met. Everything was going great until I got her number. I asked if she wanted to hang out some time and she said ""yeah maybe"". We haven't talked since. School has started again and she doesn't talk to me anymore. I spent the whole Winter break in my room depressed, overthinking everything, and wondering what's so bad about me/why nobody likes me. I have had a very hard life, struggling with my sexuality, crippling depression, suicidal thoughts, and severe anxiety. I thought that this girl was someone I could be great friends with, but my text obviously really scared her off. I found out that she thinks I like her. She doesn't like me in that way. I love her as a person, but I have no sexual attraction to women. I am getting so tired of spending every day just waiting for the next day, in hope that it might be a better day. This girl is all that's been on my mind lately. I have been losing sleep over this for weeks, I over-analyze every encounter we have. Seeing her at school was always the highlight of my day. Now she doesn't seem to acknowledge me anymore. I don't know if it's because she's going through a hard time or if she's just uncomfortable around me, but I care about her so much and don't want our friendship to end. If she knew what I go through/how I really feel, I think she would definitely become my friend. I always want to talk to her, but I get so scared and whenever she talks to me, I'm painfully awkward. There are many things I would like to say to her, but I get so scared of creeping her out that I just stay silent, but I think my silence also creeps her out. Should I move on? She made me feel wonderful (when she actually talked to me). I want her to know how important she is to me, but also explain that I don't want any form of relationship. I'm lonely, depressed, unpopular, unconfident, and longing for a close friendship. 
I need help.",03Jan2020,1
37,"I'm going no contact now after being in touch with my ex for 7 weeks. He's depressed and always down, which he told me after we broke up ( i was going through family stuff at the time so didn't know the extent)

I just feel terrible for going no contact with my ex, i told him if he wants to talk I'm always just a message away and he can get in touch. However since he has been in touch nearly everyday since we have broken up i feel like I'm not in a good place either

I'm getting in touch with my own doctor now as I've had anxiety for a long time and general low mood. Have i been too harsh on him? He said he is down all the time and has no one to talk to. I haven't completely shut the door on him but we haven't had a period of no contact at all - i guess it's needed for the healing. This was a long term relationship, 5+ years.

I'm stuck between wanting to help him yet still being in love but also wanting to be there for myself. This sucks",03Jan2020,1
38,"I just feel like I'm at such a loss of hope. It's been years since I've graduated high school. I've tried college twice, can't do it. I've had a job, quit cause I didn't like it. Sometimes I just feel like dropping dead.",03Jan2020,3
39,"Hi everyone. 
I’m a 20 year old art student who lives in Belgium. Two years ago I started taking anti depresive medication. It helped me a lot. I was in a really bad place and with help from my parents, some big changes in my life and medication, things got waaaay better. 
The passed year I’ve been enjoying life like I never did before, I was truly happy. Right now I’m spiraling down again. I don’t want to bother my friends or family with it (I did that so many times the first time I was really down) so no one really knows about it. I try to do my best, I have a job, I study, I go out a lot.. but lately I felt really really lonely and sad. I have everything and everyone to be happy but the thing I do the most through the day is fighting my tears and hating myself for it. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. 
If anyone has trips or tricks please let me kbow. 

Love
Inne",03Jan2020,7
