1,"Hello. I'm an autistic 16 year old who's been very anxious and sad about their future since this summer.

Ever since I was a pre-teen, I've wished that I would never reach the point of my life where I'll be an adult. Because after that point it would garuntee that my life will be worse, especially because I have autism. 

I've recently started in high school (which is common to do in Sweden when you're 15-16) and I don't like that I'm soon gonna reach adulthood.

I'm afraid that after I'll become an adult, these things are garunteed to happen.

- My grandparents death
- My parents death
- My younger brother growing distant from me
- I won't manage to take care of myself and possibly die at a very young age, from suicide, bad health or other causes.
- Even if I don't die early, global warming will probably kill me instead because it's gonna get bad from this point.

I'm ashamed that I can't take care of myself as well as the other neurotypical (non-autistic) teens I've seen. 

I don't want to become an adult, because I'm very sure that I can't get a job, take care of myself or move out all by myself. I don't want to get married either, because if I can't take care of myself then I shouldn't have children. 
If I still lived with my mom after this age and further on, it would be emberassing and bad for my future. Where would I go if my mom had to retire? :( 

All this is why I want to stay as a minor, so I can keep living in a good enviroment where I can feel safe. I want my life to stay the same it usually does. I go to a school, work, come home and do whatever I want. Then I'll greet my mom and my brother when they come home and then we do fun activities together. 

I can't relax when I know that all that's good in my life is gonna change, because of time itself. I'm not ready. I'll never be ready. And I'll die if I'll be forced to be an adult.

I've been waiting to get help from a psycologist, but I'm gonna have to visit him multiple times so he'll get all of the information he needs to know how to help me. I can only visit him once every week though, so this is gonna take a while.

But each day is like torture to me. I can't eat well. I'm too afraid to play videogames, draw, etc. because I don't feel safe spending time on such things when the future feels too unsafe. I can't sleep well because my anxiety keeps waking me up. I get frequently overwhelmed by stress so I'll have make myself calm down. If I can't calm down I get a meltdown instead.

I've sometimes considered suicide, because I've been torturing myself like this for months now. But there are people in my life who cares about me and want me to get better. I keep trying to survive because of them, but I'm starting to feel like it's not worth it. I've been unable to enjoy living so why should I?

(Ps. Sorry if my grammar is weird)
(You can also probably tell that I'm desperate for help, so I probably worded a few things wrong)",25Sep2020,1
2,"25/F. Lot of shit happening. I’m overwhelmed and can’t handle any of it. confirmed Anxiety, depression and C-PTSD, as well as just being diagnosed with ADHD last year.

My dad and my little sister (sister is confirmed autistic, dad is suspected) are both being unbearable right now. Having fights about things with me but basically summed up as both of them thinking that I’m sulking and useless and pathetic and can’t do anything right so they have to do it all (dad is currently injured with a broken leg, so that means my sister “has to do it all”).

Accidentally broke a plate, snapped and slammed and locked my bedroom door. Now dad is screaming at me to be out of the house by tomorrow for throwing tantrums. 

I can’t handle anything right now. It’s all too much, everything hurts. I don’t know what to do, I’m seriously considering going to the hospital because I can’t quiet my racing mind or heart.",25Sep2020,1
3,"I don't want positive words of encouragement or people offering to dm me or shit. I've already done that. People always dm me and be all friendly and nice and talk to me. But then they gradually just stop and ghost me. I'm not looking for help or something like that.

Is there a group chat or discord server for lonely, depressed people who are failures in life? I just want to talk to people who are as miserable as me and who have failed at becoming an adult just like me. If you know one, pls tell me. I just want friends who will accept me for the pathetic failure of an adult I am.

I am a 22yo guy. I've got a good job and a degree. But other than that I am a total failure at life, relationships and being an adult. I cant make friends, I dont know how to get people to like me and I feel everyone is hostile towards me. I just hate all these people in my life, my boss, my co-workers, my friends. I'm so miserable and unhappy on the inside. I hate going to work everyday. I dont even have the energy to pretend to be nice to my coworkers. 

Anyways pls tell me if there's a group I can join.",25Sep2020,1

5,"Ketamine Infusion Round 2:

So before I report on Round 2, need to discuss the inbeteeen day. I got up not feeling shitty, which is HUGE! That is so rare for me over 40+ years that it feels downright weird and noticeable.  I stuck to my diet, worked out went to a meeting and was feeling like part of the world for maybe the first time. ever

But then I sat at my computer to work, my ADD kicked in and I couldn’t stay on task. Then I had to write a career inventory of all of my jobs, which reads like a list of fuckups, treating people badly and one squandered opportunity after another. Back to being depressed I went out and acted on one of lesser habits. That left me angry and disappointed, worried/assuming I will squander this ketamine opportunity too.

Today I have the schedule packed with good stuff to keep me occupied. I worked out, went to a meeting, then KETAMINE infusion, then I set up a 90min float tank session midday, appt with a psychologist and going to a comedy show tonight with some people I know. 

I’ll check in today post infusion. 

Okay, so I’m checking in no having just come out of treatment. Still pretty dingy as the ketamine hasn’t worn totally off.  I noticed that I was a little more mentally involved in this trip then the first, which I don’t think is a good thing.  The first time I relaxed and let it take me, this time I spent a lot of time, it seemed, trying to control the process.  My best efforts got me here, so I can’t imagine me controlling my journey will get me where I need to go.  

I will check in this weekend to let you know how things go.",25Sep2020,1
6,"Hi, 

My depression makes me have strong anedonia and dissociation. So I basically feel almost no pleasure or envy anymore. I tried antidepressants but it didn't worked so I stopped (It made me sick).

The only thing helping is cannabis (which is a magical cure for my insomnia). I started it way after the beginning of my depression but not having trouble to sleep made me feel better for awhile..

So now, I don't really know what to do. Everytime I'm alone a strong feeling of anxiety appear and gets harder with time. 

I don't have any hobbies since I don't feel pleasure. I spend a big amount of time juste waiting for the next day to come.

So rn I'm just trying to fight and at least wait for my grandparents to be gone before ending this boring life.

If you have advices or any idea of what can bring me joy, please let me know.

Thanks.

7,"Hi everyone. Let me put everything straight forward: market-promoted books on depression, self-steem and things like that don't satisfy me. I'm not saying that I'm deeper than other people or know more about human's thought because of reading some Freud and Lecan and such guys, and spending lots of time thinking about the compelxity of human process of thought, I'm just not satisfied. What these books say, they just seem so stupid to me. I'm not an arrogant person, this is a real problem for me, I can't find any appropriate help, book, anything. I can't talk even to my dearest ones, because once they start talking I feel deeply mentaly harassed because I realize they don't have a faint idea of what I'm suffering from, despite all that explanations I gave to them before.
I can't emphasize enough on this: I don't think I'm special, I don't think that Freud himself should come down to earth from his elevated position in paradise and treat me, but regular treatments don't work for me. I'm an undergrad student in one of the most prestigious universities in my country among lots of talented and skilled students, while I'm not able to approach lots of my homework problems. I feel stupid. It's not because of I constantly compare myself to other people, I don't. It's because the only joyful expriences of mine, were those that make me feel the moment when you percieve something not really easy, when you figure out how to approach an abstract problem, and being unable to reach such joy for not a short time, impose such a heavy bear on my mind, that sometimes make me even suicidal. The deteriorating economical situation of my country makes it very hard to have a joyful break and go to a journey to get fresh, or see a therapist -if we take it as a presupposition that there is any sophisticated therapist- regularly. Also my family is a traditional one, they don't believe in therapy and such things at all. 
I'm under a wild pressure. I don't think that I will be able to find a job. I used to be a good student in high school but now I can't solve problems, I usually can't prove things (I'm studing mathematics), and I feel like I'm dumb, biologically. I see my parents everyday, they are stupid, intransigent, and don't underestand even the most obvious lies that the dictatorship governing my country always regurgitate. And this, make me feel that I'm geneticly incapable of being a mathematician and consequently, having joyful mind-related expriences. I feel that I'm inextricably linked with my background, with my parents, and I will never be able to run away from my roots. 
I want help. I feel I'm done. I feel buried, and future seems a bleak lie from here. Please give me the name of a book. Or a way I can systematically think in. Or a new perspective from which I can see a future for myself. I'm not bad in fields like philosophy and even I have seen some strands of talent in art in myself, but mathematics is the only thing that make me feel stunned, and always leave me in a slight tongue-tied happiness.
Sorry for any mistake in my words, sentence, or language structures. I read a lot in English but it was my first time that I wrote something.",25Sep2020,1
8,"Hi, I am 22 y/o, female (not native english speaker), and to give some context to my story I have been diagnosed with monopolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder (formerly known as social phobia). I have been on meds since I was 16 years old (when I was first diagnosed) and have been to 4 different psychiatrists throughout the years because of various reasons (change of city, no availability, etc.). I have been on fluvoxamine, escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine. My SOS medication was clotiazepam. I thought I was doing good in March but after quarantine everything has worsened for me. I am attending med school and I have barely passed my classes. For the last couple of months I have lost motivation and interest on anything or anyone. Even the things that I normally like don't appeal to me anymore like drawing, painting or even watching shows on tv. I barely ever study and only do so in order to pass my classes with the bare minimum grades. Just over a month ago I had to end my relationship with my significant other because of various reasons and I am starting to think that anhedonia played a part in that too because I genuinly didn't enjoy speaking to anyone at the moment, even them, and I feel that that was so unfair for them. Anxiety hasn't been that bad now compared to my teenage years, but now I just bundle up in my room all day looking at my phone or listening to music, and leaving my bed is getting more and more difficult each day. There are, however, days that are better than the others when I try to do anything productive at all (like cooking for the rest of my family). I feel that everything I do I do for others though, I am seriously addicted to praise and validation, and all my life I have daydreamed of acceptance and beauty. I was a very nervous and timid kid in school and I had a horrible time in high school (I always have nightmares where I have to go back to school all over again and I wake up sweating). Last year I wasn't doing so well in uni either so my psychiatrist gave me some ADHD meds (she told my I most probably had an inattentive form of ADD but did not evaluate or diagnose me properly) and I found them really useful. However, this year I started to take those meds again in order to study (methylphenidate) and still couldn't get myself to be productive. I feel like I hate studying now and doing anything productive is a bothersome task. I feel like none of the physicians that I have spoken to really listened to my concerns and I am tired of not feeling heard. The only person I felt I could talk to was my therapist but she passed away last year due to cancer (yes I'm serious). I know I am being harsh on my previous psichiatrists but in med school I have had 4 semesters of psychiatry and have identified lots of things that my doctors did that were not advisable at ALL (one of them prescribed me daily clotiazepam for almost 2 years, for example). The only sparks of joy I feel now are from joking around a little with my sister (she is around my same age) and honestly anything negative said to me brings me down instantly. I wanted to make this post to seek advise from people that maybe have had similar experiences and maybe chat a little bit because I am seriously feeling alone in this (my family struggles understand my feelings)",25Sep2020,1

So my question is what are good tips for cleaning up such a mess.

11,"My husband (M27) and I (F27) are at that stage when our friends are starting to have kids, and we’re so excited for them. We have always said we want to have our first before we turn 30, so it’s something we’ll have to start thinking about real soon.

However I’m scared by the fact that on a day to day basis I struggle to look after myself. I don’t often cook or clean, and just have a very lazy disposition these days. I worry that I would be a rubbish parent because of my depression. My husband is great but works long hours so it would be mostly me doing all the caring for the hypothetical kids. 

I guess I just struggle to see myself improving as a person, which is what I feel needs to happen before we have kids. 

Has anyone else had these worries then had kids? I guess I’d love some reassurance that you can be a good parent while still suffering from depression.",25Sep2020,1
12,"My relationship with my birth mom (shortened to Bm for this) has never been great. I always felt second best, and unwanted when in her care. It always seemed like she didn't care if I was happy or not, but always went out of her way to do what my younger sister wanted instead. 

My parents got divorced when I was 12y/o (15 years ago). Bm got custody, but dad got weekly/weekend visitations, and overnights. My Bm always threw in my face that I was just like my dad, and didn't care when I wanted to be with him. My sister is just like her, and adores my Bm. After their divorce, Bm started to try and corrupt us it seemed, tried to make us hate our dad, and did everything she could to make him still miserable. I hated it. 

Years pass, and I'm 16. Thanksgiving night,, my Bm and i got in a fight. I wanted to leave and live with dad, because I couldn't take her crap and the stress anymore. She didn't want to. My (late) grampa got her to see reason, and she agreed, but refused to let my grampa (the peacemaker) take me, instead choosing to do it herself, along with my gramma. When we got to my dads, after packing everything I thought I'd need, she told him ""she's  your problem now, I can't handle her anymore."" And left me. At midnight. On Thanksgiving. 

I've always been the black sheep, the forgotten one. 

Years pass. I'm 27 now, 2 sweet babies and a husband, and my grampa has passed away. I'm not invited to my sisters birthday, my step dads birthday, or my Bm's.  Im forgotten. The only person in the world who heard me,, every time, and the only person who cared, my second father (he called me his second daughter all the time), is now gone. My family had planned a final year of celebrations with my grampa, before we planned to release his ashes around New Years. I received a group message from Bm stating they planned to release him this weekend, and I only knew because of the already established family chat. My husband and I worked our tails off to free time between Christmas and New Years to go and release his ashes with the family. They knew. They knew because we told them we needed to work it out and they agreed. We got it worked out, and we told them. We had to settle for so much to make it happen, and they didn't care.

She doesn't listen when I speak, and she doesn't care about what I say when she hears it. It took 11 years for me to understand she never wanted me, and I was the mistake. Now, I dont know how to tell her so she'll listen that I, and my babies, will no longer be a part of her life. I know it means ill lose my gramma too, and thats my problem. I don't know how to end my relationship with my Bm, while somehow maintaining my relationship with my gramma. 

How do I say goodbye?",25Sep2020,1
13,"Hey there. I'd like to start off by saying that I'm pretty young (16) and I still don't feel like I know much about life and how to deal with certain situations, which is why I'm here

My father is an abusive, self-conscious alcoholic. As a child I witnessed a lot of fighting, especially between him and my sister (my sister was a rebellious and very short-tempered teen). They didn't agree on things, so they fought regularly. I remember watching as he dragged my sister by the hair out of the room, then threw her at a table and broke it. My sister moved out when I was around 12 and is now suffering from panic attacks. 

Unlike my sister, I was a timid child (still kinda am), so it wasn't often that he would hit me. He did bully me though. I was a chubby boy when I was younger, so he would often call me fat and ugly after getting drunk. I tried hiding my stomach by changing my posture. I grew up skinny and with serious back issues because of it. Now he's trying to make me feel bad by naming all his achievements and telling me what he accomplished when he was my age. 

My mother is an amazing parent, but also hates everyone except for me and my sister. She went through a lot with her husband, and I'm really worried about her mental state. Right now, my father isn't earning any money and is just sitting at home, so she's carrying the whole family on her back. I'm trying to make her proud by earning good grades at school, but I'm failing at that miserably. I think the stress from school is the reason why I'm having trouble with sleeping at night, but I'm not sure. Despite being ready to do anything for us, my mother doesn't believe in things like depression and doesn't let me see a therapist (we don't have enough money for one anyway). Whenever I tried talking to her about my problems she told me that it was just a phase, so I stopped bothering her about them.

I think there might be something wrong with me. Maybe it's because I'm young and self-conscious, but I'm just really unhappy sometimes. Whenever I go outside, my heart starts beating really fast and I feel dizzy. When people walk past me, I hold my breath and avoid all eye contact. I can't order food or answer calls from strangers. I know it's silly, but it feels like everyone is judging me when they see me. Sometimes it feels like there's actually no room to breathe. I'm really stressed out at school, and once classes end I have to go outside where I'm scared to take a single step. All that just to come back home to my drunk father who would look for reasons to argue with me when all I want is to take a break. 

I have amazing friends and they're aware of my family situation, but I stopped venting to them about a year ago. I just realized that they're also kids and they shouldn't be stressing out over my problems. I'm kind of surprised that they're still having me around. Whenever we hang out I act like some sort of leech, following them around because I'm scared of being alone and surrounded by strangers. 

Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. I know that life can be beautiful and occasionally I feel really happy, but then I come back and don't sleep until 3 am because my father decided to break all the windows during a tantrum. Then I go to school, get bad grades, go back home and the cycle repeats. By the way, my parents are divorced, but my mother doesn't have her own flat, and my father basically owns the place we live in, so we don't have anywhere else to go. I just feel so bad because I don't want to traumatize my friends or my mother, but I'm also so tired.

So, I'm stuck. I want to be happy. I want to feel safe. I want to have fun, but whenever something good happens it gets ruined because I know that eventually I'll have to come back home. And the worst part is, I'm not even looking forward to living alone anymore. Every broken plate thrown at a wall, every destroyed furniture, every mental breakdown makes me feel more and more unstable. I can physically feel myself getting tainted with filth. My throat hurts all the time because of how much I scream (it's hard to let my parents hear me when they're beating each other) and my head hurts all the time because I can't stop thinking about a solution to my problems.

Please, please, tell me what to do. Do I have to wait 2 more years before things start getting better? Am I supposed to bear with it, even though I feel like my mental state keeps worsening every day? I'm really lost",25Sep2020,1

15,"I've been in an out of therapy for about six years now, over the last month and a half, I've been in a massive depressive episode. I haven't felt this low in ages, so obviously I want to get help because I know I need it.
 
However, I'm currently in the talks with my local mental health service. I've told them that I don't think CBT works for me, as I've done it so many times on different levels. I'm currently waiting for her to get back to me, but she told me that she can't promise me the outcome won't be CBT. I also spoke to my doctor again and he said maybe I should just ""do it anyway"" despite telling him I wouldn't find it effective.

I feel so angry because I feel like no one is listening to me, I don't want to be hounded with work sheets or for someone to tell me I need to change my thought patterns. I'm very self aware on my bad behaviour/thoughts.

I just don't know what to do, because it feels like it's literally the only option for me and I'm going to have to do another course of CBT for like the fifth time. 

Side note: I am on antidepressants but I need to change them due to another health condition, however both myself and my doctor have expressed concerns about changing them whilst my mental health is so low.

21,"I started writing in my journals (This would be my 5th one.) documenting how I feel on a day-to-day basis. I feel empty because I have no friends and it is hard for me to make them.

My whole life sucked. My family was torn apart in a nasty divorce when I was 7, my older sister used to belittle and walk all over me to gain my family's favor, my family is close-minded and doesn't even bother to understand me. They just judge in silence. I don't talk to them and I live with other people, not friends nor family. They would never accept me for who I am unless I made them look good. 

I actually moved to the U.S. because I messed up big time over there and now I am paying for it in isolation. I alienated everyone around me, I tried to be a clown to impress others, I tried showing off and excelling at work for other peoples' approval, I tried to live a perfect life just so I can one-up my peers, my family members and my enemies because I had no friends.  

I always wanted to prove something to them. I was so angry when I left, I really thought I could reinvent myself and outshine them when I come back. But they never cared. Not family, not the people around me. I just created enemies everywhere for the sake of being number one. 

I had these deep-seated insecurities about winning, thinking if I don't win then I am worthless. Well I was the winner, but nobody cared anyway. 

I was so frustrated and bitter. No matter how much effort I put in nor how many results I yielded, nobody cared and I would antagonize them for it.

Now that I realized this, my life feels pointless.  I was *born* for this, and I never got the attention that I wanted. I don't even know what to do with myself. I feel like I dug myself in such a deep, deep hole and I regret everything. I just wanted to feel actually wanted for one time in my empty, miserable, horseshit life. 

I feel paralyzed since I undid my thought process. My system is kind of in shock right now because now I don't even know how to function in society if its not competing with others for approval. I don't know how to treat others, I don't know how to talk to others, what to talk about other than myself, and how to bridge the gap between myself and another person. I feel alone and I denied it for so long. I am deeply ashamed of myself for being such a prick to others.

I guess this is what I get for being the bad guy, trying to rise above others so they can say I am somebody important or I am worth a damn. Do you know how empty it feels to realize that after all that, you are still a big loser? 

Do you know how shocked you would feel if that is all you know? I was overwhelmed, so I started drinking and smoking weed to forget about my despair and my shattered sense of self. Now I feel like I have no purpose in life and I just want to forget about that, even if for a while. 

The pain goes away like this, even for a while I can forget about why I am so bitter about life or why I try to use success to hide my shame, or how I did irreparable damage to my interpersonal relationships with those around me. Or how I failed in my ambitions because I never learned to get along with others. Or how my dreams of fame and validation are just a fucking pipe dream. Or how I am so awkward and wooden at times because I am a fucking blockhead robot that doesn't know what to do with himself. 

I just fucking nuked everything around me. I was warned many times, I had people give me the talk many times, I had others try to give me constructive criticism and I took it as an attack. I had no tact, no awareness, no social skills, I looked more like an animal than a human. 

I hate myself for writing this but I feel alone and nobody is going to care. Nobody would even understand where I'm coming from. I'm just going to die old, bitter and alone.",25Sep2020,1
