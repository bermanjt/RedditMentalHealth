0,"I’d like some advice. One of my best friends is 10 states away and struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I want to be helpful and show love but it’s tough to be so far away. 

Other than texting/calling more do you have any advice on how I can help? 

I thought of sending gift cards but some days he struggles to get out of bed and I worry that will seem insensitive. 

What should I do/avoid doing? 

Thanks",01Jan2020,1

how do i feel better about myself? i keep pushing people away because i keep thinking i'm the problem

The past few years i have been in really messed up relationships and keep getting messed about. Now i am currently speaking to this girl and i keep constantly wanting to stop talking to her because i just have that feeling i won't be enough for her and it will end eventually.

I do like her, she's amazing but i feel i will never be good enough to be with her and i don't know why.

I just want to feel better about myself and stop getting myself down about failing relationships",01Jan2020,1

5,"For the past year I’ve had thoughts of death and meaninglessness for long lengths at a time. But as soon as I keep my mind off of those thoughts and find enjoyment with my friends I feel a lot better. Though I don’t think I have the courage to kill myself, I feel as if it’s better to die than to deal with disappointing myself and my family every day. I’m too tired to do anything and I get the most depressed when I’m by myself especially during breaks. All I do everyday is sleep, stay in bed and constantly spend time on my phone to keep my mind from thinking about my life and my future, which often makes me hate myself further.
Although the solution to this problem is obvious to me, to be more active, go outside, find hobbies that I enjoy, I’m far too lazy to do anything. The steps seem too big and I know I’ll suck at everything I do. I feel like my body is wasting away, I’m wasting my potential, and my parents are slowly becoming more and more disappointed in me. I’m too much of a coward to change my course in life and daily actions. What should I do? How do I stop being so lazy and feeling so emotional ?",01Jan2020,1

Moving countries at 16 was truly a really big mistake, as I left all my friends behind and now I am really struggling with making new ones. I feel like there are only a handful of people that I can really talk to.

I lose concentration, don't sleep as well anymore. Right now I've decided to just go on a 36 hour no sleep marathon because why not. Sometimes I will just wake up in the middle of the night, get out of bed, and do push ups until I hurt so much that I collapse on the ground. I go out running and push myself so hard I nearly faint when I finish. With winter in progress, I constantly forget to put something warm on when running, but I push through it, I let the pain of the cold bite into my arms, my hands, my legs.

13,"I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore. Like every interested I've ever had bores me to death, and everything I try these days can't capture my attention for more than a few seconds.

I used to be so energetic and optimistic, and I've always been the one to try to find a solution to any challenge. The thought of suicide or depressive habits was virtually unfathomable to me. Now it's all I know. 

The thought of pursuing anything meaningful wraps me in a feeling of fear of failure if I try, while sitting around doing nothing like I always do makes me feel like a lazy piece of garbage for not taking charge of my life. 

I'm lost. I never feel home even when I am home. I don't even know why I'm on Earth. 

I've got a wonderful supportive family, and a life that in most ways is very good, but I can't seem to feel happiness. 

This is all basically a big rant but I've never layed any of these things beyond my mind before. 
I have no concept as to how to overcome this feeling. 

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you all",01Jan2020,1

17,"Hey. So I've lost all interest in stuff I found enjoyable, I feel anxious when I'm not doing anything, it feels like I'm just a shell of my former self and my personality is non existent. I'm 27 and  can't talk to girls, I'm just not interesting to talk to and I suck at carrying a conversation with some one I find attractive. I'm ugly enough so I barely get matches with people I find attractive on dating apps. I just don't have anything to love about me. I have friends in a town 4 hours away but were not ""friend-friends"" and it feels like we're drifting apart. I'm not good at anything and I feel stuck. I don't want to die but is this it? 

Every time I achieve something I think I need to get happy I just find something else to drag me down and be unhappy about and its been this way since my early twenties. Yesterday I drove home 3 hours starting 5 in the morning, pretty far from sober, if the police would have tried to  stop me I wanted to drive away or maybe start a fight. I could have lost my job or worse caused a serious accident. Just lucky that no one is out driving/walking at that time of day after New years eve.",01Jan2020,1
18,"So I've been properly depressed two years ago in winter (was suicidal and felt empty for the most), didn't get diagnosed but the symptoms were too clear to be anything but a mental illness. It got better in summer and I understood what had happened and started getting a positive mindset and all that stuff to prevent myself from getting into another depression. For last year that worked quite well and it also helped that I fell in love with this cute boy. We became a couple on new years eve. Fast forward 9 months and I start feeling quite empty and depressed. I'm fighting it, but school made self-love and self-care incredibly difficult. So I was quite down but of course kept hope and knew I would be better in summer and my boyfriend supported me as good as he could. He is majorly depressed and suicidal and said I kept him from killing himself when we became friends. We kinda supported each other and that atleast gave us a reason to keep going. Not a good way, but better than the other option. It got horribly complicated between us and I tried my absolute best to safe the relationship which back then meant getting healthy and not being a burden. So I did. I worked my ass of having the most antidepressing lifestyle possible and the newfound motivation helped greatly. We couldn't really communicate in that time or as I later found out he simply ignored me. So one and half weeks ago he broke up with me over text. At that point I wasn't depressed or anything anymore I think. It crushed me but my positive mindset I had build up saved me from falling into a cycle of selfhatred and confusion. I've cried a lot at first but am quite alright now. I accept that he has to do what is best for him. I'm ok with that. So here's why I'm writing all this.
I feel pretty stable. I feel pretty good actually. Like I don't hate myself or think bad about myself. I have quite a lot of fun doing things.
On the other hand my body is showing quite dramatic symptoms. I've lost 4kg in the past two weeks (mostly fat, because of impulsive workouts to deal with the emotional stress) and my eating is a bit off. I also lay in bed doing nothing for hours at a time when I don't have a very specifications reason to get up. I lost a lot of discipline and a bit of interest in my hobbies. I'm always tired (well, more than usually) but I feel quite happy in general.

Has anyone here experienced something similar where they felt good but had not so good symptoms? I am not asking for a diagnosis, just for the your experiences, because this is completely new to me and it confuses me. I don't even know if it's being depressed or not tbh.",01Jan2020,1
19,"Hey guys over the past few years I have come across more and more people suffering with depression and I have found that many people resort to places such as YouTube and twitch and online games to escape the world that is causing so much pain.

22,"Hello, I have a question. I think I'm falling back into depression, and I wanted to know if depression can alter your interests in general. Like, I really don't care for what I generally do but I can do it machinally. However I'm obsessing over certain kind of food (I barely eat anything else other than bread, humus, potatoes and brocoli - the weird part being brocoli), I'm learning Dutch (I used not to like it and I have no idea why it has just come up), that kind of stuff. Also I've just spent two weeks feeling kinky to the point of considering to alter my general lifestyle.

Can it be linked to depression? I have the intuition it is because I can see myself doing stuff and absolutely not caring about what's happening. Like today I've started smoking again without any cue and I don't even feel sad or angry at myself.

24,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 7 months, and we both suffer from depression and anxiety. We had hiccups in our relationship along the way because of our mental illnesses, but we always ended feeling better knowing that we were there for each other and talking about our problems. However, recently, my boyfriend’s depression is getting way worse- to the point where he says that nothing helps him anymore, not even me. He has been seeing a therapist for about 3 months, but he says it just makes him feel worse. He won’t tell me how he feels anymore because he says that it just makes him feel worse talking about it. He says that he doesn’t care about anything anymore, and that he hates himself every second of the day. 
Last week, he hinted at suicide. He claims that he doesn’t have a plan or is not determined to go through with it, but he says that he really wants to die and was thinking and imagining the different ways he could take his own life. I encouraged him to call the national suicide hotline, and he did and said that it didn’t help. I have his mother’s number, but his parents are a part of the reason that he is depressed and he claims that reaching out to them will make the situation worse. We met in college, so we are both home right now about 5 hours apart so it’s not guaranteed that I can be there for him in person. We have FaceTimed almost every day during winter break and I have been nothing but loving and supportive, reminding him that I’m here for him and that I love him and care about him, but he is so distant and seems to be so irritated with everything I say, which is hard not to take personally but I understand this is normal. I am just stuck on what to do. He didn’t express that he will kill himself for sure, or when or how he would do it, but I know that he would probably hide that from me to not scare me. I am lost on what to do anymore. I can’t lose him. I understand there is not much I can do, but I feel hopeless and I feel like a terrible person. I am so anxious every second of the day, and he seems to be pushing me away (not responding for hours at a time, being short with answers, etc.). I don’t even know what advice to give him sometimes because I feel the same way. What do I even do?",01Jan2020,1
25,"Reading, playing videogames, studying, working out or even holding a conversation for more than 2 sentences. It doesn't matter the activity, everything is hard for me. Everything tires me, sometimes even before starting. It's hard to start, it's hard to continue, and it's been hard even to finish (the few times that I've gone that far). For some time, I even thought I had some sort of ADD problem (though now I know I don't). I only do stuff when I absolutely need to, like when it's for work or stuff like that. In the end, I've wasted so much time, and there is so much that I regret not doing. 

I feel like I want to do a lot of different things but when it comes to doing it I don't enjoy absolutely anything, and because of it I can't seem to stay on the task. I think it's been like this through all my life, but especially in the past 10 years it has gotten worse and worse, and now it's gotten to a point where even thinking about doing certain things stresses me a lot, probably because I have bad memories associated with almost every activity.

27,"Hey everybody,

My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I’ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn’t help my mind, or didn’t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn’t help either. I’ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. 

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I’m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.

So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a “yeah well you too” I didn’t reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn’t talk the rest of the night (she’s in Europe rn I’m in the states). I didn’t send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a “happy New Years, and all the best for you! 🥰” i replied with a “thanks and you too”. No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. 

I’m confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn’t feel anything, and later said she couldn’t love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she’d include the lovey emoji, she doesn’t use them much and it’s just something I feel an ex wouldn’t send to someone they broke up with. She’s also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first. 

Any thoughts? I’m not desperate to get back together, I know maybe she’s just trying to be nice and be friends (I’m not interested in a platonic friendship, I’ll be nice and talk sometimes but I’m not going to be friendzoned) but I feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.",01Jan2020,1
