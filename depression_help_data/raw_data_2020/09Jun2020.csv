0,"::::Rant:::: tldr at end 

Okay so this all started when I was 14, my parents just called it a phase, i called it a PHQ 9 score of a 9. But they didnt believe me. 

Now I used to try to defend my family and parents a lot when I was a teen. I would say oh but they help me pay for things and oh they care if I do well in life. 

But as I went through high school with increasing suicidal thoughts and violent erratic behavior I started to understand what was wrong and it was their mindset. The minute I got into college I went to doctors and talked about my ideals more freely and learned that I was heavy depressed and confused. 

Not only did I have depression but i apparently also had numerous panic attacks when I was younger that I found out were listed in my medical profile and were not just a normal part of childhood and my mother never told me about. 

Not just that but I had more conservative POV than I thought. Not understand Trans people, not understanding the point of protests, believing things should be authoritative and that people were too sensitive (I NO LONGER THINK LIKE THIS AT ALL THANK FRICK) 

But I found out it was my mother causing this. Or maybe her genetics. She is psuedo racist in the jokes she makes mimicking accents, telling me I need to be a man, and not cry, and always yelling or screaming or slapping or tugging at my ears and face. And of course if things were not her way they were wrong. She ""lived life"" she ""knows more than what I learned in school/college""

She would always fight with my dad and she always helicopters. I mean I'm 23 almost and she still watches my bank account and barges into my room randomly and demands respect while lacking boundaries and personal freedoms. 

And guilt trips me into things often, especially leveraging that they paid for my college for a degree I was guilt tripped into and greatly dislike and do not perform well in. Pharmacy, rather than music which while not as lucrative was something I excelled at. 

And when I went to college and found better friends and peers I got happier to a degree but the summer home only made me worse as well as a semi abusive relationship but I dont blame that on how I am. It had a minor impact at best. 

I found out I was Pansexual, I found out I had aspergers syndrome, and a PHQ9 score of 26 at its peak. It dropped to a 3 with Lexapro. 

But now I'm home and have one more year of work to do for my degree. I work a 9 to 5, and come home to my demanding and controlling mother. I cant do any music work. No theory, ear training, singing, guitar practice, etc. I'm too uncomfortable being myself at home becuase I know itll only get me put down or yelled at. 

 I could go on for days about all the stuff my mom does. Yells about my ear piercings, my love for tattoos, my love for the unusual, my lack of religion, me not wanting kids, me wanting to move ro Vermont, my political views, and literally everything just becuase it's different from her views. 

And now my score is increasing again. I'm back at an 11 on the PHQ9 and I just dont know what to do. I cant get my own place I don't have the money, I cant really do what I love, and everything feels hopeless and stressful. 

TL;DR my Hitler-like helicopter mom who used to hit me as a kid and calls me stupid never took my panic attacks seriously or depression seriously, now I found out I have aspergers and am pansexual and I am trapped in a toxic household with life on pause where I cannot talk about any of this becuase they hardly knew I even had depression, never mind the rest of all of this. And now I'm left with alot of regret and begging for a way out. 

Any advice would be appreciated",09Jun2020,3
1,"the simple way of explaining this is, im a dissapointment and i dont deserve to live. its now got to the point where both my arms and legs are covered in self harm scars and i feel like ending it all, ive tried once and the rope didnt hold. im not even good at killing myself. what do i do?

2,"I thought i knew where fitted in when i joined the army and it whent well for a time then i started to get some problems with myself, and was advised to see the psychologist that the  army offers and so i did to then only getting two sessions, a diagnosis of  undetermined menta lillness and a letter of immediate discharge to give to my superior officer. when the psychologist gave me the papers and told me that im getting discharged i asked why, and the only awnser i got was ""i have worked in  military medicine for so  long that i know how this will go"" and now that im home i dont know what to do with myself since my (ex) Gf broke up with me, i cant get a job and when i tryed to get a job at the local fire station i froze, and started to doubt myself. I now only go out of my dad's house to go to the store to buy some food but most of the time im stuck at home afraid to do anything because i fear that what i have left will crash and fall on me and tell me im no use to anyone",09Jun2020,6
3,"I've never been noticed or appreciate or liked anywhere or by anyone in my life. There's like an invisible target on me head that says ""this guys is less than human"". I'm sick of being alive. I'm sick of trying to trick myself into thinking I'm worth it or have any value as a human being. I'm sick of therapy. I'm sick of medication that doesn't do anything. Because guess what. Pills don't make people want you. And as long as Im completely isolated like this Im going to be depressed and suicidal. I fucking hate myself so much. I'm literally disgusting. I'm less than human",09Jun2020,3
4,"about 5 months ago i fell in love with this beautiful, fun and cute guy. and somehow he felt the same for me. 

im ugly, depressed, im not good at anything, my body isnt that great, i have random mental breakdowns at least 1 day per week. I know that several guys way better than me have asked him to date them, but he was already with me when it happened so he said no. Plus, we are a long distance relationship so i cant even give him fisical contact. 

And I cant stop thinking how much happier he would be if he chose any of the other guys that want to be with him. They all are more pretty, succesful and funny than me.

i dont know. he deserves better than me

7,"I am an autistic 17 yr old girl that can’t socialise and I don’t understand how humour mostly works on this site or just in general because I make shitty jokes that no one finds funny or I laugh too loudly or for a long time. I’ve been feeling like shit since the end of March but I refuse to tell my mom and grandma because they don’t get it and they never really will. I just wanna die and get it over with. I feel like no one will ever love me or date me because of my disorder and reaching out doesn’t do anything because it’s literally impossible for me to reach out for help and verbally say anything. I get super anxious when I go to work or just be around people in general because I have to put on a mask for them to think I’m not crazy and when I do that I internally feel crazy and just childish. I just can’t do it anymore with the inner me berating myself and making me feel like everyone hates me. I’ve tried the “positive thinking” but that doesn’t do shit. I only feel good and feel like I can be myself around those who know how I am and just others with autism in general. I feel so stupid for having fictional characters that I take comfort in. I feel really stupid for liking things that most others don’t like, and how my disorder fixiates on something for sometime until another thing comes around and grabs my attention. I feel so apart from my family like we don’t even like most of the same things and i just feel so childish for liking it. I feel like an infant who can’t do anything. I really wish I had the guts to kill myself and I just wish i was never born at all. Might try to make it a few months until I turn 18 and then I might do something but idk",09Jun2020,1

I thought it would be easier if we were on a first name basis. I have been struggling with myself every single day. Basically to the point where people feel sorry for me and or just tell me to end it all. 1. That sounds painful, 2. I have definitely thought about it. Pretty much every weekend. Man I feel like such a fuck up. I’ve been to therapists and usually they just say “stop being so hard on yourself” or “stop thinking that way, everyone makes some mistakes”. I have multiple issues with this. I have been this way for as long as I can remember and no matter what I do I deserve full responsibility for what happens and if anything bad happens to anyone I take responsibility for them to keep them safe. Seems fair? Yea until you just get told to fuck off or kys. If I fuck up, it’s my fault and no one else’s. Just me being responsible I guess. Now let’s get to the second thing they say “stop thinking that way, everyone makes some mistakes.” Well when you do it multiple times a day when do you draw the line and say well shit, I really am this fucking stupid and don’t belong doing anything. Usually ends up messing someone else up and it’s a accident. Well my country ass don’t think that way. It’s my fault I should have been better. When I was learning to drive, it was my dads car. I waited my whole life and I’m kinda a car geek. I get told to get in the drivers seat and back out of the parking lot. Everything is going well for the first few seconds and then bam. Smash into a brand new bmw because my dumb ass forgot to  shift into drive. Thousands of dollars down the drain and I basically fuck my entire life over because I crashed into a expensive car with a expensive car with only $4000 to sit on at the time. Now i would be lying if I said I didn’t have friends. Are they supportive? Not really. I’ve pretty much been self isolating for years because I don’t want to fuck up and get made fun of for the rest of my life since it seems to happen every time. I was a lacrosse player for my high school. I practiced close to 20 hours a week sometimes more with little to no improvement. This is throughout high school. With coach aid and also multiple camps. I was dog shit even though I practiced a lot. I also get asked the question a lot “why don’t you have a girlfriend.” Let me welcome you to my thinking when I see a attractive girl. Step 1. I think she is very hot don’t fuck this up. Step 2. Say hi normally. Step 3. “How the hell did you mess up saying a 2 letter word. Step 4. She laughed and I’m kinda surprised and happy. Step 5. Realize that you can’t take care of yourself and your stuck in a dream because ain’t no one talking to my ugly ass. I really really want a sort of relationship but it slowly become more impossible every day I live. I become more and more of an asshole and I guess unappealing to girls and more and more isolated and just don’t want to live anymore. Pretty much everyday I feel like I’m trapped in a never ending cycle of just wishing I could quit being so stupid and messing up all of the time. I just want to be normal, think normal and not mess up constantly. I guess the only reason I’m here is to make others have a good time. Ya know be the person everyone can laugh at or joke about. I guess I’m the funny guy that no one knows nothing about. I like to make people’s days better, I hate people being depressed and thinking of me like a role model. They are messing their own lives up acting like a guy that can’t take care of himself and is a failure of a human being.  I guess I need to help myself before I can help others. I just don’t know how. There is another part that I am afraid of (yes I know “an adult being afraid” yea I’ve heard it a million times I’m a pussy I get it) that I left out. I also never have been able to trust anyone. I have been fucked over by so many other people Ferris wheels would be jealous. It goes round and round and round through my head thinking “what if I said something wrong, well I can’t change it, good job Alex you just screwed your self over” with ever conversation I have. I guess I just sorted out some of my problems and tried to provide decent examples without becoming so transparent I’m putting others at risk. Also I guess I should be expecting hate since that’s every post I make on this app anyways. If you can help that would be amazing please. 

*i know this may seem really stupid and like a joke but when I deal with stuff like this I hate making others sad so I try to joke about it. I can’t help it and I’m sorry* 

I also before hand apologize for the vulgar language.

11,"My name is Dev (not my real name) and i’m 16. A friend recommended me to write here when I got a lot of things in mind that are still not answered and I really want to hear your advices for me. A young woman, living in such an awful place where mental health is not often talked about. 

I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for over 4 years ever since I moved to a different country, with a different environment and not knowing any single word from their language. I was looking forward into going to school here, but it wasn’t what I expected. I was bullied because of my skin complexion, my facial structure etc. Since I hadn’t learn the language yet, my classmates would bully me 24/7. I was alone. I couldn’t understand what they were saying and that made them feel like it was okay to bully me. I had my book taken away, stolen, and ripped in half. I couldn’t understand why this is happening to me. This went on for 2 years until I was in Junior High school. When I was in 7th grade, that’s when my depression started. They would make fun of me trying to learn their language and experimenting with different hair styles. They would often call me a “try hard”. 

I almost dropped out of school when I was in 8th grade. My only friend studied in a different country, and I was left with the bullies. I didn’t give up because I had a dream.

When I became a sophomore, I was very happy. Finally, I thought I wasn’t depressed anymore. I was enrolled in a new private school, made a lot of great friends from all around the world. Although my knowledge on their language wasn’t still very good, I could still hold a conversation and make a lot of friends. But winter came, and I became stressed and mentally drained again. I would often miss schools and make up some excuses so that I wouldn’t go to school. Sometimes the anxiety would get to me that I will vomit before going out of the house. 

I am now a junior. Almost 4 months into the school year, and my depression came back. I have no one to talk to. I am scared to open up because people wouldn’t understand, even my parents. They are close-minded about this type of topic. I tried telling them why I didn’t go to school today, I couldn’t explain very well. But my father’s words hurt me. He said that the reason why I wouldn’t go to school is that I don’t have a dream and I was just wasting their money. This is my reason why I didn’t drop out of school before, I was scared about what they would say about me, scared if I will disappoint them. Nothing hurts more that your parents not caring about your mental health, but only what their dream for you and not for yourself. I would definitely want to finish high school, but what about my mental health?

Please give me some advice.",09Jun2020,1

20,"I’ve been struggling with depression for the majority of my life. I’m 24 now and have probably had it since I was 11 or 12. The difference between then and now is that I had support back then. People to check on me and ask to hang out and force me to hang out when I wanted to lay in bed. For the past year I have had no body and it’s weighing very heavy on me. I cry every day about I don’t know what sometimes and sometimes about how unwanted I am by everyone. I still live with my parents and when I tried to go to them for support or advice, they’d just tell me to “get over it” and “I shouldn’t be depressed because I have so many nice things.” Just recently I told them that I can out go to them about my emotions anymore because they just make me feel worse. So now I have nobody. I abandoned my friends when I got into a relationship about two years ago with no one to blame but myself. They’ve all moved on and the ones who haven’t don’t even respond to me any more. The friend I had made in the past year blocked me on Snapchat and ghosted my texts for reasons I don’t know. I have no money saved. I have an okay job I guess but I feel unwelcomed at it. I feel like they are all talking shit about me behind my back. I know they are I’ve heard it.

28,"Everyday I wake up, take a morning walk, do some exercises, work out, try eating healthily, talk to internet strangers, make friends here and there and so on and so forth. What's the point of all that. I'm not happy at all, despite everyone saying that working on myself will make me feel some sort of accomplishment. I don't. Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people. But I'd have to force myself out there, put on some fake happy face and make friendships that won't hold because either A. I would have to maintain a false personality, forget that I'm an introvert and just go out there every fucking time someone wants to meet up and do something I will not enjoy or B. go on about my introverted life but in return people will just abandon me, as they tend to do because there's a lack of common interests in the end.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends. And, honestly, I think I'm even perfectly fine with my current friends situation. I just want someone to tell ""I love you"" to and the typical relationship stuff, but it's kinda hard finding someone compatible if I prefer staying home and cutting myself off of people. Dating apps? Fuck that, no luck there either. I understand you don't ""need"" that to survive and I could probably find some other purpose in life but this certain void in my heart will never be filled. And I can't just forget about it either.

32,"Hello, i am 18 and a medicine student. It’s my first year. There are multiple causes of why i feel so depressed so maybe you can help me.

I have had depression since the 8th grade. I didn’t know nor understand what depression was those days. I had this sudden urge to hurt myself and feel miserable all the time. I am ashamed to say i was a little masochist. I am 3 years clean now and i am quite proud of myself. Throughout high school i have had massive anxiety like really anxiety attacks. My hands were shaking, i had heart palpitations, dizziness and excessive stress. Now a couple of reasons would be childhood traumas i am afraid I cannot give deets. It wasn’t rape or anything. It was traumatizing tho. I developed stress and i never was able to talk it out with anyone. I am very secretive. I don’t even know who i am anymore. I don’t know who this person is behind my mask. Now i have tried suicide from time to time I couldn’t do it. So i killed myself in other ways. I killed the parts that I didn’t like about myself. The main cause was my family’s constant pressure, being sexualized by my peers for no good reason only because i liked wearing crop tops. I guess kids will be mean to you with no good reason. But now my deep depression is caused by my university. Yes, I don’t feel as smart as my other peers. I really want to become a doctor but i have a fear of failure because of my parents because they always compare me and get angry when I can’t do well. Most of these are just factors. I have been f-ed up for so long. At first I didn’t want to admit it and I didn’t want to seek pro help because I didn’t want anyone to know that i have had these nasty demons inside my head. Everyone knows me as life of the party, the girl who doesn’t care about anything, the girl who just likes to have fun and nothing more. But i have been depressed for so long. I am not even living anymore i am just trying to survive and battle my inner demons and sometimes it’s so hard i’m just shutting off. I have massive anxiety and depression. I don’t even know what to do at this point. I have tried to talk to a loved one but that didn’t make me feel good. I felt so guilty that everything was my fault. I have lost faith in many things. Even writing this makes me anxious and wants me to delete this immediately but I won’t because i really need help. I need someone to keep me going without judging me.",09Jun2020,1

34,"Hello

I've been struggling with a major depressive episode since around the start of the quarantine. 

I'm an incredibly anxious person so Covid has absolutely been a huge trigger for me, but in a multitude  of ways. I was initially just unmotivated with my heavy course load as I finished out the spring semester. I had put myself in quite the routine prior to classes being shifted to online and that just quickly fell apart no matter how hard I tried to recover. Things started to shift in early April as I received word that my job offer had to be rescinded due to the company losses due to shutdowns. On top of that I struggled with peaked stress and anxiety about balancing the due dates for the various project, assignments, reports and senior capstone project. My depressed thoughts and feelings skyrocketed as my motivations plummeted and 2 months later I find myself down again. 

While I was still able to graduate alright with decent grades, I still just couldn't even be happy about it. I worked so hard for the difficult engineering degree, but now I'm just being eaten by regrets, imposter syndrome and self pity due to my inaction since then and my disinterest the degree I achieved. My motivations to do almost anything have dropped so low. I used to be more creative and ambitious, but now I am a shell of that. 

With all of this I just feel like a lazy chump who is just making up his own problems. My parents have been supportive of me taking some time to work on myself, but I keep spiraling down into a void of self pity at the smallest trigger. So many people in my life are trying to give advice in assistance in finding work, but I've become engulfed in motivationless self sabotage. I feel as if the support I am receiving from friends and family is going to soon turn into resentment and pity (if it already hasn't) and it terrifies me. My self worth and confidence has never been lower. I'm crippled by my fear of failure in any semblance of a goal that I may imagine.  In a time where I have to be trying to sell myself to job recruiters, I have very little faith in myself.  I'm currently in my bed in the middle of the day retreating from the world right now. Have been perusing these subreddits for a while now and finally decided to post.

Are there other fresh graduates out there feeling this way? Anyone who has, did it get better?",09Jun2020,1

37,"I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety for about 8 months now, and I've been in treatment and taking medication for that long. I've been dealing with the illness for about 6-7 years, though. I'm a 21-year-old male, by the way. Although the current situation has worsened my mental health for obvious anxiety reasons and put a halt to some things my therapist wanted to try out, I think I'm going to be fine eventually and this isn't the reason I'm here. The reason I'm here is that a bit of a more complex problem has arisen (as they do).

In my friend group, there's this couple, a girl whom I'm very close with and a guy who I think is a really neat guy, but we're not very close because we seem to be too different (for now, at least). They've been in a relationship for about two years now, I think. Well, I'll get right to the point (and this isn't the main point of this post), I've kind of fallen in love with the girl. I'm not going to go into the details, as this really isn't what I'm here for, and I've already realized that the only way out of this is to distance myself from her/them so these feelings will naturally go away over time. I probably should mention that I've never fallen in love before, so the assumption that this is just a short-lived crush that will go away after some time distancing myself doesn't seem too far-fetched to me.

The problem is that my friends and I usually hang out (right now over the internet, of course) in groups, and this girl is pretty much a part of this every day. Therefore, distancing myself from her would require me to cut most of my usual social life for the time being. I have some people I can rarely hang out with alone or in another group, but it's going to be a very big change in frequency, and days in which I won't have any contact with friends at all won't be rare.

I've already tried this for about a week and I've seen my mental health plummet. I already tend to be very lonely under normal circumstances, so this has been a huge challenge for me. And, my determination spent, I  returned to my other friends and had to watch my feelings develop even more. This is kind of my dilemma - I can't stay because I'm really afraid of what will happen, and I can't go because I'm really afraid of what will happen.

I'd really appreciate any kind of advice at this point. I'm at a loss.",09Jun2020,2

39,"Today is my 29th wedding anniversary.  I'm married to the most amazing and supportive woman.  She has stuck with me through thick and thin, through repeated depressive episodes.  I can honestly say that if it were not for her, I probably would have left life long ago.  


And yet, despite the fact that I have literally hit the jackpot in life by having my wife by my side, I'm utterly miserable.  Not because of my marriage, but in spite of it.  My depression has just been literally sucking the joy out of everything for the last few months, leaving me feeling hollow, empty and sad.  


It galls me to no end that there are people who have real problems in life and manage to overcome them to the best of their ability and put on a happy face and live the best life they can, while I, who has almost anything I want or need, cannot be happy with my blessings.  It makes me feel so... ungrateful and unappreciative of all I have.   


Sometimes I just make myself sick.

41,"Last week I saw a post about the importance of hobbies in dealing with depression, and it inspired me to start baking again, which I've enjoyed in the past. However, I tried today and everything that could go wrong did. The store was out of ingredients, the recipe was off, I ruined two batches of frosting, I made a huge mess in my kitchen and wasted a bunch of ingredients. Eventually after wasting time and ingredients I still couldn't finish my cake and I gave up. I uninvited the people I invited for dessert. My kitchen is still a mess and I feel totally dejected. I know it's stupid and relatively minor but it was supposed to be one thing I could enjoy and be good at but now I'm at my lowest point in a while and I feel terrible about myself. I really could use some support right now",09Jun2020,1
