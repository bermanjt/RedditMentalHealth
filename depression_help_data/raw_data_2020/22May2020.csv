0,"My younger sibling is 7 (just about 8), and I‚Äôve been worried for a while that she may have depression. Her attitude fluctuates a lot, but she is will say things to herself and to me like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a horrible daughter/sister‚Äù, ‚Äúno one should love me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve this/that‚Äù (for basic things like a blanket or stuffed animal). I‚Äôm really worried because I asked her tonight if she would try and hurt herself, and she told me she might. 

I‚Äôm really lost. My dad says that he has depression (though it is not diagnosed), and I (also not diagnosed) can have mild cases from time to time. I‚Äôm afraid that something might happen when I‚Äôm not around, and my parents don‚Äôt seem to realize. I told my mother about the things she was saying, but I don‚Äôt know how well she will talk to my sister. 

If you have any advice or comments, please let me know. I know people with depression/other mental illnesses, and I don‚Äôt want her to struggle with it as long as they did.",22May2020,1

2,"Hi there,

My name is Liam. I have been having my ups and downs.

My mother has sad that I have depression but I am reluctant to admit that I have this issue due to the fact that people are actually suffering from this.

I feel great some days but terrible others.

I feel judged 24/7.

Just don't think I have such a thing as depression and was wondering people could help me figure out why I feel so grotty.

Thanks,
Liam",22May2020,1
3,"Soooo long story short because I dont want to bore you with the details...about a year ago from today I broke my hand, around the time of my daughters first bday and soon after lost my job, thus creating tension bewteen me and my ex-fiance, she left with my our daughter and left me to myself, I had gotten another job with better pay but then Corona hit...now jobless again (but have been looking again as of recently) at first it was hard for me and I didnt know what to do and it got to the point where she blocked me and only communicates thru my parents, now she wont even look at me or acknowledge me and I dont get to see ly daughter except maybe every other weekend...
How the fuck am I supposed to get back on track before I just blow my melon off?",22May2020,1
5,"I feel so fucking alone. All I have in this shithole is him, and he can‚Äôt stand my guts anymore and tbh, I am not fond of his bitchy attitude lately. Suicide rates are said to have gone up. Sure. I can see that. Fuck, I googled how to make a noose the other day and whether or not a hairdryer in the tub will kill me. ‚ÄúWhat are the odds of shooting yourself in the head and surviving?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow far do you have to jump from to die?‚Äù Even ‚Äúhow fast does a car have to be going to kill you if they hit you?‚Äù

But if I do much as voice that I‚Äôm not happy, he lets out a sigh and rolls his eyes. What else is new, right? Depressed girlfriend is depressed. I get how tiresome it can be. I really do. But if you don‚Äôt care, then why are we together again? Why? If you refuse to even give me a goddamn hug when I ask you for one, why are you with me?

I guess I just need someone to say they relate or that it‚Äôll be okay. That I‚Äôm not as alone as I feel. That if I should die, he will care. Or at least someone will. Give me a reason to not do it.

I‚Äôm not afraid to die. I am afraid of failing and then having to justify myself to every person who wants to know why I‚Äôd even think of something like that. As if it should come as a shock to anyone.

And to give you an even better idea of just how valuable I am, I can hear him snoring while I‚Äôm crying in the sofa, where I will probably sleep tonight so I don‚Äôt have to be near him.

All my plans are cancelled. All the events. Everything. Now I‚Äôm watching my boyfriend set our relationship on fire with his disregard for my emotions and his infatuation with some bitch he won‚Äôt stop texting. Idk guys, having a hard time convincing myself this will get better.",22May2020,1
6,"I‚Äôve been with my current gf for almost 2 years. She tries her best to understand my depression but I feel like she never will. She has a thirst for life, enjoys gardening, scenery and making the house as immaculate as you possibly can. She has an attention to detail that I can only dream of. My tasks everyday are just to wake up, work and then eventually go to sleep. I find myself taking care of her needs as much as I can, emotional support, hearing her out whenever anything‚Äôs bothering her. And she does the same for me (whenever I choose to share). I haven‚Äôt had the best life but I did have many privileges she never had so I find myself always torn about sharing the things that have happened to me or my every day struggle to get better. We‚Äôll sometimes get in arguments and she‚Äôll say things about my depression that really hurt me, they‚Äôre vicious and not understanding. 

Once when she was drunk and I was afraid of her hurting herself in the shower, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like you, I want to live‚Äù. It really hurt me and I don‚Äôt know what to feel or what to do with that, she‚Äôs said insensitive things before but I really want her to understand how hard it is for me to be a fraction of what she is normally. What should I do?",22May2020,1
7,"I was a survivor of sexual abuse at around age 8 and I have anxiety, ptsd, and depression.

I'm kinda genderqueer but I often find myself wishing I was a boy.  I've hated my body for years and I often feel too ugly to be a girl but not strong enough to be a boy.  I've also started gaining weight from eating, I had an eating disorder about a year ago and was okay a few months after but now I just keep eating.  Any attempt of mine to work out or eat healthier results in a breakdown because I can't stop thinking about how much I hate myself.

The only time I feel okay about my body is when I'm having sex.  I have a partner I've been with for a while is getting tired of me always asking for validation and always being horny.  He keeps cursing at me and it hurts.  I often find myself daydreaming about other men or even making moves on some of them and I feel extremely guilty after.  I love him a lot nd I want to stay with him.  I just keep trying to fill the hole of hating myself with more sexual love and it never works.

I just never feel fulfilled and I wish he understood me.  Sometimes things get so bad that I attempt to strangle myself.  I don't know what to do.",22May2020,1
8,"I never thought I'd see the day where I created a Reddit account to reach out for help.  I've always been that lurker who reads through sites like this and yes even yahoo answers! As I am typing this I do feel a little less alone since I was skimming through a lot of similar posts where people feel like all hope is lost.  There's so many posts actually I'm guessing I'll be lucky if I only get 2 or 3 replies.  

I somewhat abruptly packed up and moved from CT to TX back in August of 2019.  I had been planning the move for maybe 4 or 5 months.  My job has an office in Texas so getting the okay to transfer was simple.  I have no friends or family in Texas and my reasons for wanting to get out are another story.  

The outbreak of the coronavirus and the social isolation that has come with it has been slowly rotting my mind and I feel myself slipping.  I turned 30 less than a week ago which doesn't help my situation and I also quit smoking cigarettes back in March.  My short term memory has degraded into what feels like an 80 year old, my sleeping patterns are all over the place, I cannot and I repeat I cannot get out of bed anymore and I've just been sitting here pealing off all the layers of life realizing how worthless I am and what a failure I am.  I am a single 30 year old man with very few social connections and am getting older by the day.  Just 6 years ago all I wanted to do was have fun now I'm realizing my selfish way of living was a mistake.  All my friends back home are married, engaged or have kids and have moved on in a lot of ways.  I am so fortunate to still have a job during this crisis (call center) and working from home was almost kind of fun at first.  The novelty has worn off and and I can't even bring myself to roll out of bed anymore to get on the computer to take calls.  I believe I'm on a fast moving train to the unemployment line if my behavior continues.  I feel so guilty for even being depressed since I still have a job and maybe that has always been a problem with me.  I never want to reach out for help because my mind immediately goes to the people who have it worse and I feel unworthy of anyone's attention.  I don't even know what I'm looking to get out of this post.  Maybe just a response so I know someones on the other end? Maybe I just need someone to talk to and don't know how to do it.",22May2020,1
9,"The antidepressants I‚Äôm taking numb me out, and crying helps me deal with stressful/sad situations.

13,"I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other.
But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she can't even look herself in the mirror and says that she's a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though I'm not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because that's the only thing that I can do. 
Worst feeling is I don't know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she can't accept compliments.
I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so I'm seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles.
Thank you.",22May2020,1

16,"Currently I have a contract position with a healthcare provider and I network with their corporate staff. They have cut virtually all overtime however they have been requiring me to work at weird time frames which makes it really difficult to keep my hours consistent and almost always going over 40 hours. Not to mention I have to be on site for these events/time frames. 

My work consists of scheduling, producing and providing support for these meetings. I have orientations that last for 4 hours, others that are 1 hour, etc and it also leaves me very little time to eat as well. Let alone find the time to get help. 

I‚Äôm beginning to feel very used since I feel like I have no choice to do the work or get laid off. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for over 14 years and this whole experience has been a great toll to my mental and physical health (I also suffer from insomnia) I‚Äôm also afraid if I start seeking help again I‚Äôm going to be a liability and a hassle to work with and lose my job that way.

I feel like my parents are enabling him at this point (they mean well). He‚Äôs extremely rude to me, I‚Äôll say hi or try to start a conversation and he‚Äôll straight up ignore me like I‚Äôm not in the room. The tv was too loud one night and instead of asking to turn it down, he started beating the wall, yelling, cursing. He threw a glass cup against the wall and it shattered everywhere, my poor mother was standing right next to him. He had a complete meltdown about his depression. He blames us, but it‚Äôs hard to help someone if they constantly ignore you and shut the door in your face. He says he ignores us because what we‚Äôre saying is stupid. I have a lot of anger towards him because he‚Äôs mean to me, but plays the victim and blames us. My parents are not perfect, but they‚Äôre wonderful and have given us everything we could possibly want in life. I understand a lot of it is his depression talking, but I can‚Äôt take it anymore.

You think about what you could have done, what signs you missed. 

I put myself in his shoes. What he was feeling that night. 
Selfishly, I've been thinking back to 5 years ago, when I attempted to take my own life. Just knowing what he was going through and that mental state at the time, it breaks my fucking heart. It's painful to imagine him like that.

Its also brung up a lot of the pain from back then. The mental state. The triggers. The unhealthy patterns of thinking that I worked so hard to change. The overanalysing and self hate. Also moving back home and dealing with the mental abuse that fucked me up so much back then. 

Everyone is working on a project in his name to encourage people to speak about their mental health, but how can I get involved when all I do is hide it?
I think I want to talk. I dont want to go through this again. I dont like the path I'm on.
