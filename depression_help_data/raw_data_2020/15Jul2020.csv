0,"I am making this post to vent as I'm losing my mental sanity and have no one to talk to, currently having mental breakdowns everyday. I have been into online media/content creation for over 8 years now. Because of COVID I have overnight went from making $6,000-$8000 a month for 3+ years straight to less than $3,000, overnight. I say less than $3,000 because the figures shown are before the company I sub branch under takes their $500-$1000 cut. You might think $3,000 a month is still great, and while it is. It's not great when your bills are $3700 a month and you're in the RED for the first time EVER. Like I said, I've done this 8 years and never had any sort of drop in revenue. So with 3+ years of averaging $6,500 a month MINIMUM I am not living above my means. I do have a decent savings to fall back on but this crap just sucks. Like how temporary is this? I am going to have to sell my house and so much more. How do you stay positive here?

1,"I cant even describe how I feel after the girl ive been talking to for 3 months, decided to end it. She said my baggage is too much and it overwhelms her.  I fucking did everything she wanted me to do and still i feel like i wasted time. Fuck that bitch. Im glad tho, she didnt even want to have sex till she was married. I dont even want to get married. I ended it by saying,‚Äùok bye üëãüèΩ ‚Äú. She wanted me to be her friend but i refuse to be a friend to a girl who rejects me. Thats some weak ass shit. Going hard no contact, not so much for my healing but to be manipulative and mean. I want her to know how much she hurt me.

After all this i understand i have to work on myself but evrytime I try, i say no i rather but destructive because it feels good. Im done trying to be in a relationship. They are dumb to me. How can a woman love me for the rest of my life. That is fucking laughable. I hate myself so i doubt they can even love me, even if i love myself, i know youll leave eventually.

The point is people that I know something is wrong, my therapist is tryng to help me but, everytime i ask for it, something in me says no. 
This girl is the last girl i want to talk to. I hope going NC is hurting her. I want her to feel what she did to me.

Ive never had a good relationship, and they all leave. I told her she was going to leave as well, and she has fulfilled the narrative and honestly i love being hurt, because its the truth. I was hoping she hurt me. Now i want to drown in sex from girls i meet on tinder just to numb the pain. I know im speaking from hurt but this is how i feel.",15Jul2020,0
2,"For the first time in a while, I have been compliant on all my medication. This includes not only my antidepressant, but also my vitamin D supplement and methylated folate supplement.

Since I have been more compliant with the vitamins, too, my mood has been overall better. I am less prone to crying spells and I deal with negative emotions more easily. I genuinely thought my medication wasn't working, but it turns out that it wasn't working because I wasn't taking the vitamins I was supposed to take.

So I've been trying to get clean with cutting for a while now. But last week I had a relapse and got my thighs pretty badly. The cuts are pretty thin now but still definitely there. When I did it I thought fuck it and hoped my parents would finally take it seriously. I've kept it covered since because I regret it.

My parents are taking me swimming tomorrow and invited a friend of mine who doesn't know. I don't want them to know that I did this, and while makeup is covering some of them, it'll come off in the water. I'm really desperate. I can't get out of this. I want to get clean but it's hard because my parents are toxic and refuse to get me help. 

How can I cover them/make up an excuse/get out of swimming?",15Jul2020,6
9,"Let me tell you everything I absolutely despise myself about and if theres anything that makes you think ""hey, this guy might be even slightly redeemable"" then... idk, let me know I guess lol. You really dont even need to read all this to answer the titular question I guess. 

1. Born into a narcisstic mentally/physically/sexually abusive hellscape.

2. Spent 25 years of life being circus-level fat. The whole time, obese to avoid looking attractive to rapists I guess. I'm a guy btw.

3. Never had any friends or talked to anyone, I would go entire days without speaking, and when I did, I'd be so startled to hear my own voice, like a dog farting itself awake.

4. I'm God's original joke. I've never not been a laughing stock. Whether it's my appearance or attitude, most people around me scoff, or find themselves grotesquely amused.

5. My attitude. It feels like rage, loneliness and despair sit under my chest like a calm ocean, or probably more like a pressured container, just slowly adding more and more to it until... well, who needs to die naturally anyway? It's just that I'm horrible. I'm insanely short with people, I'm sensitive, and i mbv extremely paranoid.

6. My attitude (again). Beneath that first level of ""rage water"", theres a striking sense of fear of anxiety at my core. It used to make even saying ""here"" during roll call at school unbearable. Literal bright red face from .02 seconds of attention on me.

7. My weakness. This is probably the thing I'm most disgusted with. I front like im a normal person and that wards most assholes off now... but if they knew how easily they could destroy me... I'm utterly pathetic.

8. My desperate need for friends/relationships. I feel like I've been locked inside a glass case. I can observed, but not reached. People have tried to be my friend through the years, but I shut them down 100% of the time. I'll talk now, but I can barely stand to be out with people. Its exhausting. I've done without people for 25 years and it's been hell, but it's been manageable. Now I cant go a single day without fantasizing about sweet death.

9. I spent 2 years losing 200 pounds. I did it, and strangers noticed and congratulated me for it as I went along far more than my family did (even the good family members didn't seem to care much). I did it though, and I didnt reach my goal by only 15 lbs but I never felt better. That high lasted... well it's gone now. It did me no good but undo my ideal way to die.

10. My procrastination. I've never had any guidance in life. Sometimes people dont get heroes or role models. They just have to stumble around in the dark until they find a match. I've never tried to find one. There never seemed to be point. Now I'm 27 and I have nothing. Everything that seems worth working for is long-gone in terms of actionable time. Now it's just the foot of a mountain and I'm watching other people my age just finish scaling the top. If I start climbing now, I'll die if I fall. Maybe if I lived long enough to retire I could do it at 75 lol. Just enough time to realize I should've killed myself decades ago.

11. My social status. Drifters have more friends than me. My abusive, evil, piece of shit dad has more friends than me. I just cant do it no matter how I try. It actually took me until I was 15 to figure out how much of a loser I really was. It took me until I was 23 to learn I was fatally, ""unalterably"" flawed. It's taken me until now to realize I sacrificed all my good years for nothing but fear.

Really, I'm like a cockroach that survived a nuclear blast, mutating into a hateful, skittering, fearful little insect.

There's more I hate about myself, by God, theres more. My therapist seems to think the best course to let me slide down the suici-slide until she can Baker-act me and finally force me to take medication.

All I want is someone to tell me how I'm supposed to be. People aren't supposed to be permanently on pills, I'm pretty sure Darwin said so at some point. Survival of the fittest right?

The idea that I cant survive without them is very troubling. The idea of being dependent on something for life when theres nothing physically wrong with me is troubling. If I cant live on my own, why should I?

Why should I love myself? I don't feel like I deserve it.",15Jul2020,1

11,"This quarantine has been really hard on all of us. I know I'm not special. I know a lot of people are having a way worse time than me. 

I'm stuck at home with my pregnant fiance and our three year old daughter. I cook all the meals, I do most of the cleaning, and I'm the one paying all the bills. It hasn't bothered me until the last couple weeks.

21,"(First time poster - Let me know if there's anything wrong with the post itself or the formatting and I'll take it down immediately)

I have struggled with feelings of intense despair and hopelessness since I was 15 (I am now 24). These feelings would last for months on end, even for a year, but then they would always start to fade, to become less unbearable, every time I would find some hope to cling to, some goal to pursue, anything that would make me think that change was possible.

I can't seem to find anything to hold on to anymore, and it's been more than a year, now. I wake up every day wishing that I hadn't, I struggle to drag myself to the shower, to do even the most basic task. I don't feel hopeful, nothing I do brings me any pleasure, it's like I've died and forgot that I had to stop breathing. I don't listen to music anymore, I don't read anymore, I don't play games, I don't get out of the house unless it's to go pick up alcohol or cigarettes - which I don't even like -, I don't have friends to talk to and the ones I had ditched me because they couldn't take me faking it anymore and because I'm... Well. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. Everything is awful and empty and meaningless and I can't see beauty anywhere, even if I know I'm looking at something beautiful, i.e. a sunset or nature or whatever.... It's like I'm not actually ""seeing"" it. 

I've tried therapy last year but the advice I got basically boils down to ""keep studying and get out of the house"" and ""if immigrants who came here on a rickety boat managed to *make it*, so can you"". 

I graduated cum laude and I'm now studying for my master's degree, every exam takes a huge toll on my mental health because I can't allow myself to fail, I've always had the highest grades and I used to take pride in my work. It's incredibly difficult, I still force myself, it doesn't help me, it only makes me feel worse because I don't feel anything when my professors praise me for my work. I feel like an impostor. I'm only saying this because I was accused of avoiding responsibilities so I want to stress that I'm studying even when all I can do is cry on my books. 

As for the moving out part, I'm neither financially independent nor financially stable, my family is a mess to say the least, we're likely to lose our house and what little savings we had and finding a job that allows me to move out so quickly, both with the COVID situation and my country's economy, is simply not realistic. I do plan on getting this master's degree and finding a job, even if I'm scared of not doing my job properly because I'm not passionate about anything anymore. 

The comment on unfortunate immigrants (English is not my native language, I hope that the way I'm phrasing it doesn't sound racist or offensive) making it in spite of all odds has been obsessively replaying in my mind for a year. I'm aware that even if my life has been mostly crap, there's always people who have it worse and who are grateful of the things they have. I'm well aware that people overcome greater challenges than the ones I'm facing... and it doesn't help. It makes me feel extremely guilty and ungrateful for feeling the way I do and for struggling the way I do. I stopped going when she suggested I take some Bach flowers for my anxiety and unhappiness - I'm not studying medicine but I did try them back in high school (my father is a pharmacist). Maybe they help others, I don't know, not me and she wouldn't listen. I was wasting money for therapy sessions that I couldn't really afford to be told to just suck it up.

I've been pushed away by my last... Friend ? Today. Our relationship was complicated, other stuff happened but basically they were tired of me. I wish they'd stay but I can't find any good reason for them to do so, I'm not myself anymore.

Do you have any advice for me? Will it eventually go away and it's just the longest episode (my therapist called these ""depressive episodes"", I don't have a diagnosis but she did call them as such) up to date? How do you try and remind yourself how to be happy? Do you suggest trying to do the things I loved to do even if it's painful because I don't like them at all?
Please don't give me ""tough love"", it's all I ever get. I know it's not easy and pleasant to talk to me but I just wish people were kinder, it just hurts and pushes me down. You can say whatever you like or else I wouldn't ask for support and advice, but please, do so in a gentle way. It's embarrassing and I hate being so open about it, but I feel extremely vulnerable and every little thing hurts a lot. Thank you if you've read this far.",15Jul2020,3
23,"Hi all,

Thanks in advance for reading this to those of you who do. 

I‚Äôm afraid this is a long story but I will attempt to summarise the main points. I live in the UK and lockdown here has been on since March. Two weeks before lockdown my father was diagnosed with liver cancer the same day my partners long time friend was diagnosed with breast cancer. Lockdown kicked in and I work in a supermarket. Step daughter got symptoms, went into isolation for two weeks. We were all good but through this time my dad was having emergency surgery and then began shielding at home afterwards. After quarantine ended I went to social distant visit from his garden several times. He told me he was given 7 days to live. He made it through to June but sadly passed away. Obviously this has been devastating. I wasn‚Äôt able to fulfil his wishes of carrying him due to covid and his partner went on to withhold his belongings and is only communicating through solicitors.

During this time my partner has taken the lead on the kids front and the household duties but has mostly just berated me about how I‚Äôm not carrying my weight around the house. I‚Äôve been supporting her depression for the last two years as I had previously overcome my own and we began with a good dialogue. She unfortunately suffers from severe hormonal depression and has gone through a cycle of bottling things up and then exploding. Sometimes I‚Äôve coped well, others I haven‚Äôt but she often apologises and we usually solve everything each time. This has devolved over time into very little dialogue and as a step parent I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my boundaries anymore regarding her children and I feel uncomfortable doing anything without discussing what our agreeable values are with the things. The week before my dad passed away I was diagnosed with exhaustion and prescribed antidepressant and nerve blocking medication for a back issue and to help me sleep etc. My shift patterns were a mixture of early and late shifts, so the alternation wreaked havoc on my sleep patterns hence the meds. Since my dad passed have had two anxiety attacks and have slept for 36 hours with only toilet breaks twice now. These things make me drowsy as heck. 

My partner is saying I‚Äôve been avoiding my family by disappearing upstairs (to sleep or let my emotions flow) and going for walks but I‚Äôm really just struggling massively to cope and sometimes it feels like my heart is going to explode out my chest so I deal with it. 

I love her so much but now she wants to go our separate ways after heated exchanges over built up issues and I‚Äôm broke due to the things going on surrounding my fathers estate and feel abandoned. I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with family. The closest is my sister but she can‚Äôt accommodate me and my mother and I don‚Äôt have a liveable relationship, we‚Äôre fine but we can‚Äôt live together. I don‚Äôt have any friends in the area as I lived on the other side of the country for 10 of the past 15 years. 

My depression is kicking back in fast and I have considered seriously suicide twice but have seen sense at the last minute. I‚Äôve lost the ability to see ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù. Being awake is like living in a nightmare and nightmares are all I have when I sleep but I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôd rather just not wake up. I‚Äôm so very tired and I have no choices that I can see available, it was always my dad I could turn to and he‚Äôs sadly gone and I‚Äôd promised him I‚Äôd be ok. My partner has emotionally receded from me and I can‚Äôt bear the kids seeing me struggle. 

I apologise for what is perhaps pitiful but I haven‚Äôt anyone to turn to and feel I‚Äôm at a dead end. 

Thanks again for any of your time. And don‚Äôt waste yours with your loved ones!",15Jul2020,1
24,"Hello. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for 11/12 years. Maybe longer. I didn‚Äôt start to seek help until 8-9 years into it. Recently (within the past few months) I was diagnosed schizoaffective. My initial reaction was ‚Äúshock‚Äù and I cried to a close friend of mine about it. I put shock in quotation because I don‚Äôt feel that those emotions truly belonged to me. I don‚Äôt feel human. I never have felt human. I think different. Talk different. Look different. I feel like an alien in my own skin most days. It‚Äôs a sick, crawly feeling I get when I try to put too much thought into it. Maybe it‚Äôs part of the depression/ anxiety or maybe that‚Äôs just the new diagnosis. All I know is that I‚Äôm alone. No matter how many people tell me otherwise. The people I‚Äôve had near and dear have always been as inconsistent as the next. I‚Äôve tried building close ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù bonds. In my relationships I‚Äôve tried being that ‚Äúperfect‚Äù significant other. It never happens the way I believe relationships with other humans should. I see people interacting differently with one another. I‚Äôm always the odd on out. Always. As far back as me being the kid on the playground no one wanted to play with. Up until now when I‚Äôm the last choice friend for when someone is depressed. None of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù give me the support I need and it‚Äôs left me feeling like I need too much. That maybe it‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôve heavily considered killing myself this morning. Just to see the other side of things. I like to believe that it‚Äôs different. Better. Most days. Other days I imagine it being a dark void. Something that will still feel better than this emptiness I feel inside. I don‚Äôt want to be here. I never have enjoyed life in the ways we should. I‚Äôve definitely tried. I know how to appreciate the little things and be grateful for what I have. I‚Äôve done exciting things that don‚Äôt excite me. I‚Äôm immune to it all at this point so life is just a drag. If I‚Äôm such an outcast. If there‚Äôs no where for me to fit in and enjoy this experience. Why am I having it? Why am I here. Obviously, that‚Äôs not a question anyone else can answer for me, but it plagues my mind. Day in, day out. Plagues my mind. I am so unsatisfied and I don‚Äôt think that will ever end.",15Jul2020,1

27,"Hi, I discovered this subreddit today, thinking that I should finally talk about this somewhere, I really don't know much about depression or if my problem may be something else, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong but I can't keep hiding this, I hate my Parents, this is something that I cannot normally count because they immediately take it as a ""typical adolescent problem"" even though I am already 20 years old.

I am a boy who has always been shy and quiet, I suppose that as a result of having had to endure being in a class where everyone ignored me or laughed at me for things like not playing soccer. In the last years I have been improving this and I try to be more social with other people. I can easily converse with people of different ages, except my parents.

I cannot speak to them without my becoming irritated in one way or another. It's horrible, but I think not only this, I should talk about both separately:

My mother, my mother is a person who can not stand for a second without stopping screaming or getting mad at nonsense, there comes a point where she seems to look for any excuse to start screaming. She also says silly in order to win any conversation, you can be with her under a clear sky that if she starts to say that it is raining you have to agree with her, in fact recently I put some chocolate wafers in the fridge because I started To see that with the heat they were melting, she asked who did it and when answering that it was me for the aforementioned reason, she released me ""And then you put them in the microwave"", I don't know why that came, I would never put something like that at microwave, I don't know what was going through his head.

But it gets much worse, his way of arguing is stupid and illogical, most of them don't make sense, I take as an example one of the last discussions we had, I was alone with my parents, my younger brothers weren't there, while we ate appeared on Antena 3 a story that spoke of ""Violence in Video Games"", it was a disastrous news, they said they had done a study that showed it but surely there were 4 monkeys locked up with a typewriter, since there have been other studies much bigger before They showed the opposite, not only that, the news used games like Minecraft to indicate the great amount of violence and even added a boy saying ""If we get like this, let's censor everything"" while they showed him as if he were a fool. So I made a comment about the stupidity that I had just seen, and then it happened, my mother started to argue, I said what were the problems of that news, and she started saying ""If a child sees someone shoot in a game he will want to do the same "", I logically contradict that phrase with things like that can happen with anything and above all if that person surely already had a problem from before, and, here his usual shit technique begins, repeat the same thing from before, this is how she begins her tactic of making you look bad, start repeating the same thing over and over again, as if that proved her right, there comes a point where it irritates me and I start screaming too, so that's when she takes advantage to tell me that I'm crazy, that he's going to stop arguing because I always have to be right and other nonsense, he even goes so far as to say that I need therapy.

Not only this, even once it started crying, yes, crying, because the same newscast from before brought out a story talking about ""Poor little policemen who pupate them in Barcelona"" so comment on how the newscasts did not show the other side, the of the policemen who were causing problems for disturbing, like those who launched themselves to catch a man who only went with a bucket of water to help put out a fire, and then she started crying because I was not Spanish nor was I proud from my country, what the hell ?, of course, I have to be like them, insulting and laughing at other countries because ""they are not Spain"".

I still have to talk about my father, this man is a narcissistic cocoon, to begin with he is obsessed with his work, which is normal, but he takes it so badly that it is ridiculous, to begin with, he decides to take orders that do not benefit him, he can accept a job in which you have to spend 100 euros and only earn 40, he also works setting stages, long ago I hoped that both me and my brother, at 13 and 11 years old, would start to go with him to work, without paying us, simply because it is rat so as not to want to have an assistant where he works, he does not stop talking about what he wants to prepare us for when we have his warehouse and how we have to get our truck license, all this without asking if we want to have all that, a Once I decided to help him without complaining, adding that with my back and knee problems it costs me more, to get some money, to start he only gave me about 20 euros for a month to help him, but the worst thing was that he started saying I told everyone how good his son was because I helped him at work etc etc, until one day I received a visit from a friend that I hadn't seen in a while, I had to go to a stage so I told my father that He would not go, because he had my brother and another guy who was going to help them, in addition to the fact that it was a tiny stage, the fact is that the next day he began to tell everyone how his son did not help him and that he preferred to be lazy with others.

Once it was even worse, he asked me to fill him a few bottles of water so that I could put them in a jug the next day that he had to leave, the fact is that I forgot because a boy who had also not seen for some time came to help him with something from his computer, so we stayed all afternoon, when my father arrives he complains about the bottles, which was stupid, it was night, if he filled them now they would have plenty of time to cool down, but no, he started to insult me ‚Äã‚Äãfor this, at a certain point I breathed and then he asked me for my phone, I give it to him and he stamps it on the ground, breaking it because ""The fault is with the phone"".

And speaking of cell phones, I can get to about how he has no idea how to save, he will complain if you have a hobby or spend money on something you like, but he can spend up to hundreds of euros on his things and then complain that ""No have money"". I have gone with him to a certain market where I found consoles for less than 100 euros or even less than 30, clearly a good saving, but he says that it is a stupid expense so that he immediately sees an iron or rusty machine that he does not even know what it is for and he buys it, he has lots of artifacts piled up in his warehouse. Before I mentioned the mobiles, this is already ridiculous, as soon as you have a mobile it fills it with 200 applications, I wondered why and it was because not only did you download 200 applications of the same without deleting the ones that did not interest you, if not when you get a An announcement of an app can be installed, the fact is that as soon as it starts to fail because he got a virus or memory, he goes and spends 200 euros on a new mobile phone, by the face, he puts it on his shirt pocket while He works for what tends to break the glass right away, in addition to trying not to spend money on necessary things in order to do it even if he has no fucking idea, we have been in the bathroom for 2 years for not paying an expert.

But there comes the point that most makes me have that ""depression"" .... Useless.

They have the habit since childhood of not really helping me, just calling me useless when I don't know how to do something, when they ask me to do something I never did instead of explaining it to me they decide that it is better to say ""You are useless, you don't know how to do anything"", besides I add that they take the study as ""I have to make my son the best just so that I can show off to my friends"", instead of making me interested in studying or helping me they decided that it was better to be all my life Threatening me to study, they literally went as far as saying ""If you fail, I cut your neck"" as an incentive for me to study, this caused me to always have problems with my study, miraculously I reached the 2nd year of Bachillerato, but some subjects I failed did not get back so I am not supposed to finish, but, I have been a year without going to any kind of classes, to begin with I have the anxiety of not wanting to go alone to repeat those subjects because I know that I will fail again and I have no motivation in follow a course or a university degree, there is nothing that interests me to do, not because I do not want to, but because as soon as I think that something may interest me, what my parents taught me comes to mind, that I am useless, I'm going to fail and it won't work out ... and then I abandoned the idea, so I spent the day at home, I asked them if I could do an online course and they denied me because ""That's not true classes, how are you to give an online course ""....

29,"Hi everyone, 

My mom underwent surgery in late March to remove a glioblastoma (brain cancer). She recovered well and was doing great, all things considered, but as of the last few weeks, we've noticed she's become very depressed. She started taking 2 anti-depressants in May and that helped, but as of the last week or so, all she wants to do is sleep (and throws a tantrum if we wake up her early- 10am), doesn't want to shower or brush her teeth, doesn't want to talk to a psychologist and puts on a show when she speaks to her doctors to make them think she's fine, has isolated herself and won't respond to calls or text messages, and the most concerning of all, she won't eat. 

I wanted to reach out to see if you had any advice for things I could do, or how to say things so that they land better with her, and any other advice you'd consider important. 

We've had two psychiatrists, the first one was awful and wouldn't consider taking her off of heavy sleeping pills, the second one doesn't follow up with us. We're seeing a new psychiatrist today and I understand no pill is magical, although it does help, my mom wants to also get better, which I think she doesn't and has quite literally laid herself to her death bed. 

Thank you!",15Jul2020,1

33,"As I'm writing this I have just minutes ago stopped crying. It was a feeling of extreme despair that came out of nowhere. I was watching a video of a girl roller skating  and I was in relatively good spirits. I love roller skating, and always have. to this day I maintain that there is no more freeing and exhilarating experience. the problem Is I can't roller skate. I haven't been able to roller skate since I was around 12 years old do to a bad knee joints that just got worse over time until I could no longer run or even walk for long periods of time. I usually try to block out the things I can't do but as I was watching that video I had a thought. ""I will never be able to do this again."" And it all just sort of snowballed from there. I found myself thinking back on how it was one of the only things I was truly good at, and how I spent hours almost every day for years practicing that one skill. And then another thought came. This is it. This is the only life I have and I will never be able to experience any of these wonderful things that I so desperately want. One day I will day and my reward for years of unhappiness and suffering will be absolutely nothing. My knees get worse every year. I might not even be able to walk by the time i'm 30. I will never be truly happy again and I just have to live with that for years on end and then die alone.",15Jul2020,1

41,"The title is only the surface of a plethora of problems I've been dragging myself through for years and years. 

I was a very bright child from the outset till my early teens where I used to be eager to learn whatever was advanced for my age. Not only was I a voracious reader, but I loved to write and sketch. My academic life was more than promising. It started to go downhill when I moved countries (for personal reasons I cannot disclose), and I've been perturbed ever since. I never adjusted academically. I was bullied constantly and I barely had any friends. The pain I harboured perhaps worked out for me as it fuelled my ""art"" and I still managed to read a lot. 

However, my horrid grades at high school and college (not university) along with its fair share of depression and anxiety halted me from getting into promising places. I'm enslaved to my own mediocrity as I see people around me excel. It's like I've regressed to the point where I can't do anything anymore. 

 It was a miracle I got into a university where I studied English Literature for my bachelor's, graduating with an okayish GPA. Now I'm 23 and doing my master's and my inadequacy is back to haunt me. I cannot understand what I can read. I can't recall what I read. I had grip on the English language and I find myself making the silliest grammatical mistakes and not remembering the definition of the simplest words (the irony given my degree). I cannot write anymore. I can't draw. I only find comfort when I'm detached from the world while I watch movies or YouTube videos. In other words, my attention span has taken a turn for the worst. 

I have my semester break at the moment and while I'm doing practically nothing, the thoughts regarding my future are gnawing at my mind. I have goals which are simply encased in boxes only to be stashed away and never fulfilled. 

It's as if my life has already gone down the drain. I know I won't be able to get published as a research scholar nor would I be able to get a scholarship because I'm simply not good enough. I wish there was a way to separate my consciousness from my body so I won't have to experience what lies ahead of me. 

I'm in desperate need of advice and perhaps some support that there is a realistic chance of getting my life back on track and perhaps take shape of my former self. Or maybe an alternative route because I simply cannot see through this permanent haze. I want to know whether there is hope for people like me.",15Jul2020,1
44,"My life is not going how I thought it would or hoped it would at all, I know this is how it goes most of the time for people but I‚Äôm just so disappointed in myself. 
 I moved to LA 6 years ago bc I had a following on social media which I was making money from and I wanted to be around other people doing the same thing. It started off so well, I met so many people and went to amazing parties and thought I had made it. Obviously I didn‚Äôt, I just felt ‚Äúimportant‚Äù and wanted places for the first time in my life. 

  Fast forward 5 1/2 years.. stuck in the same place haven‚Äôt done much productive. 3 years into living here I quit posting on social media bc it gave me the worst anxiety... I know how it sounds but I had been BULLIED beyond belief for my Instagram by my peers in HS so anything I posted I always had the fear they would make fun of me online or to each other. I know this is ridiculous and I shouldn‚Äôt care but I do. I wish I didn‚Äôt. I gave up my dreams bc I was scared of what people would say about me or think about me. I gave up opportunities for amazing job‚Äôs because I felt I wasn‚Äôt qualified enough since they only wanted me for my following, or because I was too anxious.. about what? I don‚Äôt know. I get a feeling in my whole body like I‚Äôm on a rollercoaster drop. Every morning when I wake up, randomly throughout the day.. it‚Äôs miserable. I‚Äôm sure a lot of you have experienced this. 

   NOW- Feb of this year, my best friend/ roommate moved out suddenly bc the other roommate convinced her I was talking badly about her, which I wasn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt even give me a chance as I was in Vegas for the weekend. She packed up and her and her boyfriend moved out, hasn‚Äôt talked to me since. I told her I didn‚Äôt say anything bad about her ever esp. since I wasn‚Äôt even friends with our other roommate. Then, it took 3 months to get that other roommate and HER boyfriend who was not supposed to be there out. I kicked them out bc they gave me a move out date and just didn‚Äôt move out, the next month I said you have to leave. I‚Äôm the only one on the lease and was subletting to them so that‚Äôs okay for me to do. They ruined the walls and floors of that room, stole many of my things which I have on camera bc I set up one in my room bc I was so paranoid of them taking from me when I was gone, which they did and I caught it. 
      Now I have to move home, bc I can‚Äôt afford rent for a 3 bedroom apartment by myself and haven‚Äôt been able to find any more roomates. This is SUCH a depressing thought to me bc moving home in my mind means failure. I failed at everything that I have tried. Lost my media marketing job bc of Covid, have just been delivering on Postmates&amp; DD for supplemental income but can‚Äôt make enough doing that for this apartment. Drained my savings paying for the extra rent and the lease isn‚Äôt up until August. 

      Back to when my best friend abandoned me, I was also going thru the worst heartbreak of my life with a ‚Äúclub promoter‚Äù *eye roll I‚Äôm ashamed* but I really really liked him. When that ended and my best friend moved out my social scene went caput. I haven‚Äôt seen a friend since February. I know there‚Äôs a pandemic and I do abide by the rules but it‚Äôs sooo hard seeing so many of my friends party, hangout whatever and I‚Äôm feeling so left out. Not invited by the boy anymore anywhere bc we broke up, not invited by my best friend anywhere bc who knows?! I don‚Äôt know why she believed the other roommate, she knows I never even had more than a 10 minute convo with her. When I am invited places, I don‚Äôt go bc I‚Äôm scared of running into either my ex or ex best friend. I also deleted my instagram (temp delete) bc I don‚Äôt want to see all the things I‚Äôm not invited to. 

   I guess I‚Äôm just kind of ranting now but I wanted some advice if any of you have any on how I can possibly move on from caring what people think/feeling left out. Also the jealousy of others. I don‚Äôt want to feel jealous. I want to be happy with my life and proud of myself. The more I think, the more I feel like I should end it all but I‚Äôd fail at that too somehow. I just don‚Äôt have any passions that I can find so far besides traveling, which I‚Äôve done so much of these last few years, I‚Äôm so thankful for that. But, unless I continue with social media I won‚Äôt be able to have a travel for work job. Idk what to do with my life or myself. I feel like I‚Äôve always been the disposable friend bc unfortunately this is a pattern in my life, having a big group of friends and then spending months and months alone. I don‚Äôt want to be disposable.

45,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I've been a cutter for over a year.

I have tried to get help four times. Twice with my parents, one with a teacher, and once with a school counselor. Nobody has ever listened.

Since then I've been struggling to get clean and improve my mental state. I make excuses, I take all the emotional abuse from my family, and I bite my tongue. But I'm done.

I went swimming today with my family and a friend. I tried covering my scars on my legs up but it was too noticeable. So finally, I said screw it.

I have been trying for years to get somebody to hear me when I scream I AM NOT OKAY. Nobody listened and I stayed in the dark ashamed. But I refuse to hide anymore. I left the bathroom with my scars in full sight. People stared, my family whispered and at first I felt embarassed. 

But then my friend took my hand and led me into the water, treating me like a normal human being. And for that hour I wasn't hurting anymore. When we had a minute alone she hugged me and told me she would always be here for me and I could tell she meant it. 

My parents were pissed when I got home. They wanted to know where the scars were from and I just ignored them. They lost the right to ask when they scolded me the first two times. They don't get that anymore.

For the first time in my life I feel like I actually want to fight against this. I want to help myself, because I want to be okay for myself and not for other people. I want others to feel like people care, and I don't want them to be alone anymore.",15Jul2020,1

I used to love drawing but it now seems like a chore, as well as ballet. I wasted a few months in my room isolating myself from friends and even family, i was embarrassed and was trying to get out of this little ""depression episode"" that I get every now and then. The problem? I cant seem to get out of it. I want to so badly, and I feel I am ready to start living again but I need something to bring me joy.

I dont want to ruin the vacation for my family and I'm really worried I went through all the trouble of planning it just for me to be a depressed pos.
