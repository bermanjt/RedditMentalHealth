0,How the fuck do you rest and allow your body to recoup after a burnout when you can’t financially let your body or mind rest because you experience financial issues already. I feel like it’s impossible to let my body rest as much as I need and also continue to support myself financially. I’ve already dropped out of school but it still seems like I’m not getting any better. I am the only one I feel like I can depend on. Help...?,17Jan2020,1
1,I am so fucking depressed that I can’t take it. I have always been the responsible older sister and been very put together and kept it all inside and dealt with it on my own no matter how much it hurt. I’ve always been like this. And eventually I break in fact in the seventh grade I attempted OD and because I didn’t really want to die it was just a serious cry for help it didn’t work. My parents told me to stop being so dramatic and that other people have issues and that I scared my siblings. And then that was never addressed again. And I kept it all inside. My mom had postpartum with me and it effect our relationship pretty seriously. She has told me several times she doesn’t love me as much as she loves my younger siblings. This has really hurt me but I can rationalize it. In the past year I’ve had a very mentally abusive ex and it was just what it took to push me over the edge I started self harming. My sister goes to therapy because she throws big fits on the regular and it very dramatic when she isn’t feeling well. This isn’t me trying to say that she doesn’t need or deserve therapy she just has become everyone’s main concern. I just want my parents to notice I’m hurting. I just want a fucking I’m sorry we didn’t notice YOU WERE FUCKING CUTTING YOURSELF FOR A YEAR. Instead of being told to worry about your sister and to be nice because she is sensitive. I’m fucking sensitive too and my mom told me she didn’t love me. I’m 17 now ans just counting down the days till I leave for college.,17Jan2020,1

You  know those feelings of built up anger, frustration, anxiety, etc? You  know when you just sit there and think, and think, and think, and that's  all you feel able to do with all this built-up emotion? Well, I found  something that helps: exercise. I'm not saying you need to do a routine  or anything, but say, for example, you feel angry with someone or  something, use that anger to do push-ups or go on a jog. It doesn't even  have to be many. Just a few. I was feeling angry and frustrated because  I was tired and I had come home to my mom and stepdad arguing as I  tried to just eat a sandwich. Instead of brooding on those emotions in  my room like usual, I instead did something like 8 pull-ups on a bar  above my door and then 10 push-ups and I feel so much better. I feel  genuinely good right now.

3,"I stumbled upon a website that only uploads violent and graphic content and Jesus did I make a mistake... I saw people getting beheaded, tortured and killed by others.

I don’t know how to cope with all these emotions, I’ve never seen this much violence and it makes me feel depressed and scared.

I don't want to tell anyone I know because I know word will get back to my therapist and I'll get sent back to patch for the 4th time. I really don't want to go back.

7,"I have struggled with diagnosed depression for the last 18 years (early teen years). Due to financial issues growing up and in my adult life I have only been able to go to professional counseling twice each for about two months. I have gotten by talking with friends &amp; family and some self medicated drinking when things get really bad.

The holidays this year were exceptionally hard to get through so that motivated me to began working on making a major life change (career change). I am happy with the effort I’ve put into that, but for some reason have hit a low I can’t bounce back from again.

I have tried to reach out to my small circle, however this is one of the times they don’t understand how hard I’m struggling as they see the good things I’m doing right now (not understanding it’s taking every ounce of strength just to push forward on that). I’ve tried to explain more but they just really don’t get it.

I have depression, and I don’t lay out everything on him.

((I'm new to reddit, and this is a throwaway account, so please forgive me if I committed any reddit faux pas))

I need help- not direct financial aid, but help navigating the system. I know I should qualify for financial help, but I have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue.

I'm scraping by, deep in student loan &amp; hospital debt that I can't afford to pay because I can barely make rent, trying to save up for a super-cheap, used, under $1,000 car so I can get a better job (I currently work retail part time and take painting &amp; illustration commissions part time), but I'm exhausted even working the few hours that I do (thanks, brain). I've been struggling with depression &amp; anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt &amp; an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can't afford counseling, and I can't get medication without a car. It's been a while since I've been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, ""common"" sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.

Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don't have a lot of energy at the moment...

Has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?

Other possibly relevant details about me:

\-I know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line

\-I think I may have ADHD or something similar but have never been evaluated for it

\-I was \*\*\*VERY\*\*\* briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there's no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, I'm very lucky)

\-I live in California &amp; I am a US citizen

\-I am cis, pansexual, female, &amp; white as a ream of printer paper

\-I was disowned &amp; cut off by my family for religious reasons

\-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best

\-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated

\-I pay rent under-the-table, I don't \*legally\* reside at the place I live

\-I have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, I've never had a credit card but I've been wondering if getting one might help

\-I've never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)

I can't think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity I'm an open book.

I have been depressed on and off as long as i can remember. Im such a mess right now. I cry every night and smoke weed to even sleep a little and i struggle to get out of bed. I have nobody to talk to.

Im a 30F and i quit my job to start getting an education here in jan 20. My parents have wanted me to get educated like forever. I have 3 older siblings who all have very high degrees from universities and one is a very skilled engineer. We are a very close family. We live in the same town and on the outside everything is great. Since high school i have started and then dropped out of 7 educations. Yes...7! For the last 4 years i have worked a min wage factory job. It was so horrible and my parents kept pushing me to go back to studying and get my life together. They worry about my future and think that to be educated is the only right thing to do. So i did... i just started my path to be an automation technician ( a 4 year long education) . And i fucking hate it!! Im the only female student and its all mathematics and electricity. Not at all what i thought it would be. I expected it to be more like mechanic. I failed math in high school and this is too much. I just cant keep up and the whole education have barely started yet. How on earth am i going to get through. I honestly just did this to get some respect from my parents and ""do the right thing"". I want to quit...again. But if i do i will loose my families respect, they will think im just lazy and i will once again be unemployed. Im so sad and alone. I feel like the weakest human being. My family is eveything to me.

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.

15,"On 31 December 2019, I had an appointment with one of nurse for counselling. I have PTSD and now I am a student abroad. I got confused with the insurance system because of a new system of an international student. The health care and the university are not even explaining to me. I asked my embassy because I had lots of bills and they said I should get help from a social worker.

People told me nurse is also a social worker so she would have an idea where I should get help. But she told me that a social worker in the Netherlands is paid by the government is not for a lame case like me. She told me I am an adult and should be responsible for the bill by myself. She said it is a simple thing I just need to pick up the phone and call them. I did but they didn't speak good English that was how I got trouble with the uncovered bill. They charged me in the wrong insurance. 

She kept insisting that I am too smart as a master student, so I should be able to solve my problem without involving anyone. Most of the people I called in the government told me to browse the internet because they could not speak good English. But on the website is unclear and most of them in Dutch, google translate could not translate it properly. I also confused with abbreviation and terms in the Dutch government. But she didn't believe me and told me I never try. WTF.

21,"Hi all. I'm bipolar with treatment resistant depression and self harm issues. I receive ECT every Friday to keep me on track, in addition to taking 4 different medications. To be honest, the ECT is the only reason I'm not currently self harming or dead. My husband is very supportive of my treatment and does his best to keep me stable and in a healthy place.

This last week, I've been having some abdominal pain. My doctor sent me to get an ultrasound and they discovered that I had a cyst on my ovary that ruptured and I was hemorrhaging into my abdominal cavity. I went to the ER and they monitored me for a bit and sent me home. They said it would heal by itself and set up a follow up appointment for tonight (Friday) for another ultrasound to see if the bleeding stopped.

Well, this morning I was set to receive ECT. The nurse got me settled, but asked about my ER visit. I told her that the doctors said it would heal by itself. She told the doctor in charge of the ECT procedure and he said, ""absolutely not. We will not do a treatment until it can be verified that the bleeding is stopped completely."" and sent me home.

I've been receiving ECT once a week for nearly 6 months. Once a week, because stretching the treatment out longer than that usually ends up with me injuring myself or fantasizing about blood and death. I already constantly feel like a burden on my husband and family, and frequently feel like they'd be better without me. ECT would reset those doubts and feelings to where I was actually happy and hopeful. I don't suffer any side effects, other than a bad headache the day of, so my mental health team supports my weekly routine treatment.

Now, I don't have that routine to count on. The earliest they will reschedule me is for Wednesday. That's 5 more days when I already feel desperate for a treatment. I'm paranoid and terrified about what can happen in those 5 days. The only person I can talk to is my husband, and I am worried that I lean on him too much. I don't know what to do with myself to keep me under control. I feel betrayed by my ECT doctor, but I understand why he is hesitant. This whole thing sucks. I need help/advice/support.",17Jan2020,1
22,"When you're depressed and on a bad luck streak, positive thinking makes things worse because it DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. In fact, it makes you more depressed because it just leads to more disappointment. 

The reality is negative or positive thinking isn't going to change any situation that has outside influences such as being in financial distress, jobless, homeless, or a bad relationship. You're purely dependent on the mercy of others. 

If you're depressed, don't waste time on positive thinking, words of affirmation, and all the other bs people try to suggest. It only makes you depressed. Just work hard, have no expectations and maybe the law of averages may swing your way at some point, just don't expect miracles or when you need it most.

Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesn’t really understand what I’m saying I feel. I’ve talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or “you’re just in a rut right now”. Which can sometimes piss me off.

31,"(Let me know if there's some other subreddit this would be more / equally appropriate for.)

I'm 26, and currently living at home with my parents while I'm between jobs and recovering from some rough life experiences (including going overseas to pursue something of a dream career, getting dysentery and nearly dying, and realising that that particular career isn't really safe for me to do). Everyone in my family has depression - my parents have both been struggling with it since before they met, and I've only realised in the last three or four years that what I thought was normal life was actually depression. We've never really been a happy family - we love each other, and there's never been any conflict or abuse or anything like that, but we're all pretty messed up people.

At the moment, though, my parents are *vastly* worse off than I am.

My dad is burned out beyond all recognition by work. He's super unsatisfied by his job, but it makes good money and he feels like he can't leave and take anything with less of a salary; and he's high enough up and has enough responsibility that he feels like he can't possibly ask to do any less, or set anything aside for later. He's the kind of person, though, who will always give his job 150%, not because he's enthusiastic, but because he believes that if he can give 150%, giving 145% is 1) shameful and 2) likely to get him fired. I take it that he believes that if giving 150% all the time kills him, so be it - at least no one can say he didn't try. The result of this for us, though, is that he comes home from work and sits down in his chair and becomes a lump of rock for the rest of the evening - sometimes we're lucky to get two words out of him. Attempting to talk to him about much of anything results in a quick end to the conversation; if you try and talk to him about how he's feeling (even trying to help him!) he runs away - either emotionally by insisting there's nothing wrong and he's 'just tired', or literally by getting up and walking out of the room. 

My mom has chronic illness (she's been diagnosed with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia), and has some pretty significant health anxiety. Some of her aches and pains are familiar and just frustrating; some of them send her into a state of terror and acute distress (and even if she's not in such a state, she regularly asks me things like 'does this mean I'm dying?' or 'what if I just drop dead from this?'). She sees both her death and mine lurking around every corner. On top of this, she absolutely *hates* that she has these problems, and regularly confesses that she feels like she's only a burden on us and that she figures we must hate her because she can't just be happy and not have problems. She's getting help for herself, but she's been seeing two counselors (a normal one and an EMDR one) for two years now and is beginning to convince herself that she just isn't ever going to get better. (I imagine she will, but I get where she's coming from.)

Neither of them has much of anything in the way of self-esteem, and both of them are the kinds of people who imagine myriad responsibilities for themselves that no one is actually expecting them to fulfill and then feel like failures when they can't fulfill them all anyway. They've got good reasons for this stuff, though - my mom's older brother had some serious mental health issues including suicidal depression for many years when she was very small (I think it started when she was three or four), and my dad grew up as a third-culture kid caught between the US and his stoic post-war Norwegian parents who had *absolutely zero* support for him or even understanding of what he was going through. (He refuses to see a counselor because he hates the idea of having to explain all of his mess to them, and he (quite rightly IME) fears that they won't understand his third-culture-kid experience any better than his parents did. Shockingly, his mom was a practicing psychologist for decades - you'd never know it looking at him.)

So having dumped all that, my question is this - how do I take care of myself while not only living with but legitimately caring for my parents? I don't want to just close myself down and refuse to even try to help, since I am very obviously more able to care for them well than they are me, and I love them and care about them and want them both to get better. It's very hard to talk to them about how they make me feel - I'm sort of able to talk to my mom about it sometimes, but it's a *very* thin tightrope to walk, since just about anything I say about her contribution to my difficulty is going to just further confirm her sense that she's a worthless burden. (Trying has at times resulted in comments like 'hearing that makes me not want to live anymore', and it quickly turns into me doing damage control rather than having a good frank conversation.) The few tiny cautious attempts I've made to talk to my dad result in him either *strenuously* defending himself and his honour, or curling up in an emotional ball and not coming out for days on end.

You might call them 'toxic', though I'm not sure exactly what constitutes 'toxic'; but they're certainly not doing this out of selfishness or callousness or narcissism or anything like that. I know my mom hates that she causes me problems, and I imagine my dad would as well if he really knew (and was willing to talk about it). The problem is that I can't just ask them to change, since they would have long ago if they could, and I don't want to just write them off as toxic and/or leave since that feels entirely unfair to them, and would utterly crush at least my mom if not also my dad. I'd love to move out and just get out of the situation entirely, but that requires getting a decent-paying job (not easy when you're only really wanting something to tide you over between careers - I can maybe hope for 15$ an hour, but that's not enough to live on where I live). Just moving out anyway and living on savings for a while would be just another way to tell them 'you have too many problems and I have to leave', which again, would be the end of the world to my poor mother and probably would hit my dad pretty hard too.

(And of course, if I leave, I leave them to have to live with each other - which I get isn't my responsibility, but feels gross anyway.)

I am seeing a counselor, don't worry, and we do talk about this stuff, though one hour a week feels kind of insufficient given all the above. I'd just like to hear some more advice.

(TL;DR - 'how do I take care of my own depression while living with parents who are vastly worse off than me, without just getting up and leaving since that's 1) largely impractical at the moment and 2) if I did it anyway could very well send the message that I don't care about them or their problems when I really, really do.)",17Jan2020,1
