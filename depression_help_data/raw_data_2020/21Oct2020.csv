0,"So my depression is weird right now. If it wasn't for my antidepressants, I'd be in a genuine deep depression but its seems to be doing its job mostly. But right now my depression and antidepressants are conflicting so I am sad as hell for a good 5 minute at a time. For example I started writing this sad as fuck but now I'm doing ok. I'll probably make myself sad again ranting but I just need to rant so bad.

Usually I'd just rant to my friends but someones dad died in my school (im a highschool junior) so were just gonna steer clear of that cause nobody wants to deal with my petty bs while theres actual problems going on.

So yeah, first of highschool sucks because of a certain little virus. I usually just socialize in school (because nobody ever wants to hang out with me out of school), but that nearly impossible as were all 6 feet and wearing mask. Would be one thing if we were innocent children, but 17 year olds don't tend to have ""shout across the room"" friendly chats. But this is only if I actually know anyone because my school has been split into two groups so each group goes on different days and I know fucking nobody. 

Along with this, my existing school friends relationships are heading down hill. The fact I haven't socialized with folks 6 months is like a burst dam of if social awkwardness was an extrovert. So I think I've been too clingy with folks and thats the real sad part. I've been too forward with people, which is hard to recover from. Its just hard watching people being good friends and talking about deep shit when you don't have none of that.

Social media has also been tough. First off, I get it, social media is a bad way to view people but there still folks who at least have the confidence to post shit, and show pictures of them hanging out with people when I have neither. Plus it has turned into a political war in which fellow teenage girls are brutal to me because of my views.

I'm just fucking lonely. Before even as a out cast, I managed to slide my way into have a decent social life. Now I feel like I've lost everyone and I'm alone. And it's hard because everyone online is so positive mental health and suicide prevention (like all the basic bitches in my school) yet flat out ignore someone obviously struggling like me. I've made it loud and clear I'm fucking lonely and nobody ever does shit. 

Everyone fucking sucks.",21Oct2020,1
1,"I don't believe I have depression I'm generally content and happy but also I never have passion towards anything really, life feels dull and pointless and there's nothing that feels like it has any real meaning to me unless its fleeting or superficial. I used to be really passionate about art, relationships, friendships, etc. Now I don't care, not like I used to. I feel like I don't feel as intensely as I should. I've been like this for years. Is that a mild form of depression or just something else I need to work out? Also anyone have any tips for dealing with it?",21Oct2020,1
2,"So im at a cross roads of my life. Badically the run down is that I applied to graduate school and I’m going for OT and my undergrad degree I will only be in about 15-20k debt so I can pay that off. The grad schools I applied to are SUPER expensive but I did work very hard to get there. Or my back up is to get a job and try to find something with my degree. Im just so sad and miserable that i just turned 25 i never had any fun, im ugly and short and not good at anything i was given such a shitty hand and I dont know what else I would do. The only things i can think of doing is UPS,amtrak, a trade an Occupational Therapy Asssitant or taking the police exam. My main plan is graduating and then see if i get into school and if i dont inplan to work untill i have enough money to move to colorado or texas b/c im so sick and tired of NY and living with my parents its horrible i want to get laid, make money and have fun. Thats all i want. Idk why i have to work this hard and not be guarenteed something",21Oct2020,1
3,"The big problem is ive wanted to die for as long as I can remember. I’m worried I won’t get any better for a long time and as it is I’m 20 and this is my first serious and not long distance relationship. I want the experience of romantic love and being with them makes me so happy. 


At the same time though, when they’re not around I feel like all the tiredness and displeasure with myself as a person comes rushing back. I still think about dying every day (whether they’re with me or not) and I am uneasy feeling like I’m starting to use them as a crutch or the ‘one good thing’ in my life. 


I don’t want to live for someone else, i think that’s unfair to them and myself. But I’m worried if I try and wait out my depression (I mean this as in I’m working on it, I’ve been going to therapy on and off for about a year and half now and am considering medication for it) that it might take me years upon years and I will have lost my prime dating age. Or worse, I’ll never really get rid of it (or never get it to a manageable state), and I’ll simply end up teetering on this choice, sad and lonely for life. 


To top it all off, I feel really bad for my partner. I don’t want to burden them dealing with my shit and my self deprivation. I know already that it’s upset them when I say something about myself (I’m trying to be nicer to myself in my head and aloud but I’m not there yet) and I can’t think about how upset it would make them if they saw me in one of my panics or when I’m really low. I don’t want to upset him like that and I definitely don’t want to hurt them as badly as I know it would if I ended up finally offing myself. 


And worst of all, if I do decide that this simply isn’t sustainable for me I have no clue how to break up with them. I love them so much and leaving them just doesn’t work in my head, i literally have no conception of what I could say or do to get through it",21Oct2020,1

5,"I've tried a handful of meds at several different dosages and combinations. I still feel the same impending emptiness regardless. 

I haven't officially tried therapy, but looking through it and talking with people that have had experience either as patients or professionals, and giving it a lot of thought, I've eventually realized that depending on another individual (even one that simply offers me only the tools to help myself) is not something I trust to be the least bit effective to break out of this wall I've built around myself. 

I've guaranteed that no one will ever get through to me. I know so far that not a single soul has really gotten to know what's on my mind, the things I've pushed so deep into the smallest confinement will never see the light of day. I personally can't even tell you who I am (at least not so easily) because it's all hidden away and no matter how long I search for myself I always come up empty.",21Oct2020,1

11,"This is a message going to myself since I have no one else to talk to. My heart is hurting so bad worse than ever before. No one will ever understand the pain I feel. I just wish my dad was here with me. He was the only person who never left my side no matter what. I don’t even see a point in being around anymore. No one cares whether I’m here or not, no one life would be different if I just died already. What did I ever do to deserve so much pain? My boyfriend makes me feel worthless. Hell never understand how bad it hurts to be do in love with someone who doesn’t care about the way your heart feels. Hell never understand I do care about him more than anyone else. That I could never see myself without him. I wanted to have his baby so bad but he made it clear he didn’t want his child to call me mom. He even told me he didn’t want his kid to be running around with me. He won’t understand he’s the person I want to marry. He won’t ever see that I would do anything for him. I just have bad luck in love. I have never been in a relationship where my special other really cared about me. I know my boyfriend does, well I hope he does because I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love him. I love too hard it hurts, and no matter who I end up with they will never be able to love me back that much. It just hurts I can’t be better, maybe then I would mean more to people. Be more worth it. Maybe if I was prettier and had a nicer body and my hair wasn’t so crazy all the time then maybe I would be good enough. It’s just hard to be someone who loves so deeply when there isn’t one person on earth who really loves me. I even love my mom and she does not care about me. My mom has always put my stepdad before me, always. She does things that she knows will hurt me. Do you know it feels to be a girl growing up and you can’t trust your mom? I can’t go to my dad because he’s dead and I can’t go to my mom because she tells everyone my business. No matter how my mom treats me I always look out for her. She wanted to cry when I tried to kill myself, yet she always tells my I’m just a sad person, that I’m crazy, that I’m never happy / nothing makes me happy, that I can leave the house if I’m so unhappy. She always says she should send me back to where I got baker acted to because I’m obviously not okay in the head. How is that my fault? Nobody wants to be so sad. Ever since I was 6 years old I have been depressed. That’s almost 12 years of never having a genuinely happy day. I’ve felt happy yes, but I always have that feeling of sadness in my throat and my chest. My childhood is a whole another situation I can’t even get into. My mom swears I don’t appreciate anything, when I do. She wants to always tell me to quit locking my door but doesn’t even know that her own husband used to be creeping in on me. How would you feel if someone who’s known you since you were a small child would come into your room, lift up your blankets to see you sleeping in your panties, to touch your private parts over your panties, all while he thinks your asleep? He doesn’t even know I know. One time he thought he was almost caught and acted like he was giving me a hug. Another time he was in my room at like 4 am and I heard the door and I woke up and he got startled behind me and said it’s time for school and I looked at my phone and it was 4 and I said to him, “it’s only 4” and he said, “oh I thought it was 6:30”. The thing is I knew. I knew every time I heard my door open it was gonna happen again so I tried “waking up” before he got too close. Even now I keep my door locked and if I forget as soon as anyone opens it, it makes my heart race. I should’ve stood up for myself I was just too scared. I always felt frozen. The only way I knew how to make it stop was to pretend I was starting to wake up. No one knows. I mean, I told Amador but what if he doesn’t even believe me? That’s the reason no person, male or female, will ever be in charge of watching my child, ever. Being so depressed has caused me to do poorly in school, and no one sees that. I can’t focus, I can’t stay awake. Everyone always tells me to just go to sleep at night or I like to stay up, but it’s not my fault. I can’t help that I stay up all night crying. No one wants their heart to feel like that. No matter how much mental and emotional abuse I have gone through my whole life, I have never played the victim because people always tell me I’m strong. Being strong hurts too much. Who’s ever going to be there for me? How am I supposed to ever be okay when nothing will ever make me feel better? Medication? Yeah I’m not trusted with that since I took 125 strong painkillers. That’s what they’re supposed to do right, kill your pain? I honestly started hoping for a better life, but lately I have came to see that I will never get that happiness I hope for. Nothing will fix me. Maybe it’s good I was not able to have my child, what kind of mother would I be if there was a chance I would hurt myself? Why put a child through losing a parent? It just hurts. I want what everyone else wants, just to be loved. I’ll never get that. There is not even a point in me being here anymore. For two days I’ve had a rope next to my bed. Each day I talk myself out of it because I try to find hope and keep my trust in God, but this is the third night and I don’t know if I can find a reason this time. There’s no reason for me to be here at this point.",21Oct2020,1

14,"Sorry for the bad English not my mother tongue.

I love my wife, she is a lovely person with a kind heart who's trying to help others always she can. She's smart, sweet and funny. My days with her are just like heaven.

But, since before we got married she told me, and obviously I noticed that she had depression and very low selfsteam. We struggled some times with that but when our relationship was maturing we had more control about it.

Right after the wedding, honeymoon we moved together, and the issues started. The real ones.

She had panic attack episodes, mental crisis, and some really hard stuff that I can't describe properly in this lenguage. It was one of the saddest, and terrible experiences of my life. When she has these episodes her personality changes abruptly, She's aggressive, mean, she tells horrible horrible horrible dark words.

I tried to get over it and we went to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed her with several depression and some patterns of begging of bipolar. She started her treatment back in January. And it really help her but sometimes (way less often) she had some REALLY BAD crisis.

Like I said, I love her, I can't imagine my life without her and she's the light of my life, but with this situation, after every crisis that she passes, I die on the inside a little.

She even hitted me, pointed me with knives and made me bleed while she's on crisis, and saying HORRIBLE word about us, me, her, everything and everyone at that moment. I try to tell myself that she's not herself, but I'm starting to feel weaker every time, I'm not the same anymore, and I know she suffers about this, and Im suffering too.

I love her so so so so much, but I need help. I'm screaming for help.",21Oct2020,1

23,"I don't really know what's going on in my mind since I have not been officially diagnosed but I'm pretty sure I have depression, anxiety, and maybe others issues. Most importantly, I just don't feel good in my mind at all a this has been going for a little more than a year. I also dropped out my studies and have been without a job since then (still have a degree in IT).

  
I want to get better but I'm so unmotivated, hopeless and can't be enthusiastic about anything most of the time. Most of my days are so boring and I absolutely don't know what to do except scroll the internet, play the same games and getting riddled with anxiety. I'd say that I spend most of my day worrying on the same topics and being unable to distract myself.

  
I've tried many things, meditation, sport, finding new hobbies, but like I said, I have no motivation to do that most of the time and I can't do that all day as well. I kinda want to go outside for example to have a walk, but it make me so anxious to maybe meet someone that I know and having to talk. Even the look of strangers makes me really anxious. I have no friend that I feel comfortable with except for one person that I really care a lot about but who is very occupied by work and their own problem lately. I can't seem to count on family as well as it seems they just don't take my problem seriously (mom says I'm a ""zombie"" and my dad just gets annoyed everytime I am even remotely sad).

  
What can I do to get out of that life ? I just hate it, I want to get a job but I don't know where to start, nothing seems appealing and I don't think I'm capable to do anything, even in the field that I studied for (and that I used to like and be good at it). I don't have my car driver license either, I'm trying to get it but again, I don't have any motivation. On top of that my phone battery is dead and I can't imagine myself spending at noon break without refuging myself in it. Nor can I receive call outside of home. I have tried to talk to my parents about this, but again, they don't take it seriously. It might sound childish but it is just very important to me.   


I am just scrapping the surface here and probably forgetting a lot of things that cause me worrying and why I am unhappy with my life. I desesperately want to get out of it and be happy and myself again.

At the moment I am switching from venlafaxine to sertraline; I also take mirtazapine, busprione, clonazepam and nefopam (a painkiller which also may have anti-depressant properties). It seems common sense that if there are external problems in your life contributing to the depression, to solve them. However, what if they are extremely difficult to solve? Is it that we need to adjust to a situation which seems insoluble and carry on taking the medication? At present my life situation is not at the point where I feel that I could stop or cut down on any of my medications. I once watched a youtube video on CBT where she was saying things like ""...and if you end up homeless on the street, would that really be that bad?"" and I was thinking, no, that is not the way to help someone with depression.
