0,"I live in the US of A. I'm 28 F. 

I was very very depressed 3-4 years ago. To the point where I didn't want to leave my room and I gained 200+ lbs. 

I'm slowly feeling like I'm getting into that depression mode again. The recent events in the US make me want to cry. The whole government is corrupt. The cops are abusing their power and violating humans left to right. The ronas . The brokenness . I felt all these things before but now we SEE how often it happens. 

I don't even want to start level 8 of Jumanji. I don't see any positive things coming out of the near future and I'm scared to raise my kids in a world like this &amp;&amp; I don't even have kids yet! WTF. 

I had the ronas and it almost wiped me out. I'm scared to get it again and actually not make it since I'm high risk. Just venting.",09Jul2020,1
1,"I've (21M) been living with my gf (21F) for 2 years now at university and had booked our studio apartment for the coming year starting in September too.

We had an amazing relationship, I love her more than anything more than life and we had planned our future after university and talked about kids and everything and we just shared one life we did everything together, I was also very very depressed for roughly 6 years before meeting her and when I met her although I was still depressed it was much better, I became a better person.

Roll around to COVID-19, we both go back to our parents houses for a short period (1 week) but then lockdown happens and we can't go back to the flat or see eachother and I miss her greatly after spending near enough 24/7 with her for 2 years to be without her was horrible. Fast forward 10 weeks and she says she feels depressed but won't talk to me about it and won't seek help,fast forward another 4 weeks and she won't talk to me at all just blanks my messages and doesn't answer my calls, this carries on for two weeks of me just sending messages of 'I'm here if you need me' 'I love you' etc and then she just turns around and tells me she doesn't want to be with me anymore and it breaks me.

I try to talk but she just ignores me more so now I try and talk to her about our flat but she won't respond so i told her I'll move out if she doesn't want to live with me (I can't afford the rent on my own where as she can easily) and she confirmed that's what she wanted...

A few days later I ask her for my half of the deposit back because I need it to put on a deposit for a new flat when I find one and she refuses to give it me and then blocks me on everything so I can't try and get it.

Now tomorrow I am going to to pick up all of my belongings from our flat - my home which I love very much and can't stand to be leaving not only because I love it but because it means our relationship is truly over.

Without her paying 50% of the rent I now have to look for a much much smaller place with none of the facilities of our flat (it had a onsite gym and a games room and stuff like that and a lovely reception and security team)  and our flat was a 2 minute walk from the university and all the ones I can afford are at least 15 so that's not great.

I just feel so lonely, I feel like half of me is missing like it's been torn away from me, I am going to feel so alone in a flat all by myself without her there to talk to about my day or to listen to hers or to just entertain eachother with random shit. All but one of my friends is doing a work placement for the year too so it's just me and one other person I talk to in the entire city and I'm going to be so lonely and I just don't know if I can carry on with university anymore, I already got extensions on all my coursework last year due to being overwhelmed by it and now I'm more depressed than ever all I do is cry and think about her and about how alone I am and it makes me sick and I physically feel pain whenever I think about her, our flat, living alone or anything I just don't know what to do anymore üòû",09Jul2020,1
2,I can't define who l am and I hate myself when I speak because I feel that no one is interested to listen to me. Maybe I'm not in the right place or deal with the right people but in whole life I will deal with many different types of people so the problem will be there. Sometimes I feel like there is no value of my life. I just keep making people angry with me but I swear I don't mean it!! I just behave naturally with white heart. I don't want anyone get upset because of me. I don't want them to understand me in a wrong way. I love all the people I have met. I'm so sorry for myself because everyday I'm hating myself over and over..,09Jul2020,1

7,"  

I am 24 and have been depressed for years on and off. Lots of anxiety too. The last 7 months have been particularly rough. I sleep when I cannot keep my eye open anymore as laying in bed at a normal hour is impossible due to my mind racing with thousands of thoughts. Also, my sleep schedule is completely fucked. So typically, I go to bed around 5 am wake up around 2 pm do not get out of bed sleep for another 3-4 hours or so. I will sometimes not eat for that day and drink only when it becomes so bad that I must. Days that I do eat it is a small meal. I have lost about 30 pounds (I‚Äôve always been skinny so it‚Äôs not a good thing). . I‚Äôve tried to hang myself three times and never made it off the chair. I‚Äôve looked up exit bags and that‚Äôs my next method I feel. I bought a gun and returned it. I would never harm anyone else as I see it worse to be alive than be dead. Also I don‚Äôt want to go to jail. I am not a threat to anyone. I‚Äôve thought about making a post on darker parts of the internet to see if some sick fuck would want to kill me but then I thought what if they don‚Äôt and just torture me.

I‚Äôm typing as I think sorry for the structure.  
 (This next part is for some background I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm a man child. I kind of feel like one tho as I type it out. At the same time, I come from a wealthy family and I don‚Äôt see myself as a financial burden).

I‚Äôm 24 and 75% of the way through my associate's degree (big thorn in my side that I haven‚Äôt finished my bachelors) but changing my major from computers to business. I got accepted to a bigger name brand college from my community college. I live with my dad and his girlfriend in the basement of a nice house which he has spent close to 1 million in the few years renovating. I do not trust her as I‚Äôve found her on multiple dating websites (9 months ago after they have been ‚Äúserious for years‚Äù) and that has driven a divide between me and her. They told me I had to move out (never happened as my dad thought it was unfair it was pushed by his gf) at the beginning of my school semester in January which triggered a lot of anxiety for me at the time and I did poorly last semester and dropped all my classes. I now have until the end of the year to move out which I appreciate being told upfront in advance. I have a job that pays ok but not enough hours to cover rent. My dad would help with groceries under the table (his gf doesn‚Äôt like it when he gives me money for anything). He pays my car insurance as well.   
 

I think I‚Äôm depressed because I feel like she‚Äôs taking advantage of him and is a gold digger. But she makes him happy so I‚Äôll live with it even though I think its fake on her side. My brother told me to feel better that my dad gets to be happy and she‚Äôs unhappy because its fake. She acts like a child (both in mid 60s) and is generally toxic whenever I or she initiates conversation. She aided in severing the relationship between my dad and my two other brothers and I feel like I‚Äôm next. So I stay out of her way as much as I can. I can‚Äôt join the armed forces for two years as they won't take anyone on amphetamine (I take Adderall). I talked to the army but I was suggested to just not tell whatever branch i look at next.  I‚Äôve looked for trade skill sort jobs like plumbing, heating and air, etc with no success. My current job has no actual physical location (its small real estate) so I work from home. I‚Äôd like to go to the gym I have a membership I pay for but due to COVID, I tell myself no to go. Also, I rarely make it out of bed. If I got my dad sick and he died I‚Äôd have another reason to kill myself if I had the balls to follow through.   
 

What can or should I do to get myself on a better track to be independent over the next five months. I want a degree and a place to live in. I don't want to find a relationship until I have my life together. I cut my last one off because I felt so fucked up and didn't want to bring her down with me and I told her that and she wanted to help but I pushed for ending it and it did and she still helps and talks to me to this day.  I have a therapist and psychiatrist that I see. I was on an SSRI and sleep aid but stopped because I had seizures, brain zaps, sleep paralysis and just didn‚Äôt do much to make me feel better after months of use. The first day on the SSRI felt the same way a good mushroom trip does as you start to climb. After that, I felt the same depression and when I told the psychiatrist a month later they told me to up the dose and that‚Äôs when I said no because I don‚Äôt want to be drugged up. I used to smoke weed a lot quit for a few months used it a little on 4/20 now I‚Äôm off so I can piss clean for whatever job I get. 

I know suicide is the most selfish thing to do but I never asked to be alive and I haven‚Äôt been happy since my parents split 15 years ago. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what actually started it because I remember not caring.",09Jul2020,1

33,"Throwaway account because people I know follow this sub, and I don't want to be recognized.

Boy where to begin, This will be a long post and more of an advice seekin this is gonna be a rant about my life, so feel free to skip to the next post without regrets.

So here we go, I'm 18, since I was a little kid I started thinking, a lot, and with a multitude of factors, in middle school I got bullied a lot because of my appearance.
This caused in me insecurities about my appearance and social anxiety, I worked out, and now I'm in a good shape according to my mother, and according to measurements too, but im my mind, I'm not.
I'm always caring on how other people look at me instead of how I feel, I have negative self-esteem.
From I year now I started working on myself, developing myself, I know who I want to be.
Now here is my situation: I'm in this limbo, where one day I am happy about my life and I work for what I want ( I want to be an actor, and I have so much work to do about improving my skills ) BUT the next fucking day I don't know what hits me and I start destroying everything, I dress differently, I don't care about anything, I throw away all the work I've done and I waste time, I can't seem to do anything useful about my future.
And I don't know how to get out of it.
During this period of time I start realising the hypocrisy that's surrounding me, with fake friends and a useless life, and I enter more deeply in this loop, and get more depressed.
I started doing things to change this, I did anti propaganda against shitty stuff in my city ( there where anti 5g pamphlets, and I wrote things on them making people think, I discovered that our library illegally collected citizens information, so I organized a group of friends and we hacked it wiping everything )
But all of this seems useless, it doesn't help me at all, it did the contrary.
I started smoking, because the society tells me that it should make me more relaxed, but it is actually awful, you smell like shit after and can't breathe.
Now here's the problem, maybe after a few days, listening to a song or randomly i just snap out of it, instantly, and I change completely, I start dressing well, caring about life, I reject technology because I want to be and actor and spending time on that is useless, so I start studying reading, practicing. I enjoy life. But this last a few days, and then something happens, and I fall into that hole again, in the dark.
And I don't know how to get out of this, how to end this pain, I know what I want to be, the other myself, the one happy actor who enjoys life, it's just that I can't be that thing, and I don't know why I just keep falling again and again, I get up yes, but it seems all useless.

35,"I  met her through a mutual friend a few months ago and we would chat and  play games on Discord nearly every day. Even though I don't know her  super well, she'd open up about her past problems as well as a current  one and it obviously had her down, but I had a chat with both her and  the mutual friend (who she has known for years) and we both told her  that we're here for her if she needs anything. There are also a few  others on the same Discord server who I fully believe would have her  back, and at least one of them is also a good friend of hers. She has  also talked about her parents and they seem reasonable, so I imagine she  could talk to them as well. She also mentioned she has a  psychologist/psychiatrist (?) but that she has had trouble booking time  or something like that recently.

The  reason I think she's done it is that sometime last week her problems  became worse from what I understood, and she hasn't been online on Steam  or Discord for nearly 3 days. It might not seem like a lot, but before  she was always online, even when not hanging out and/or playing games.  She'd always have the online or away status. But she's been straight up  offline for days, and it scares the shit out of me. She was my only  friend that would talk to me extensively about her life, and the only  one I felt comfortable talking to as such.

She  lives in a different country and I know her first name, age and what  she looks like as well as a broad location where she lives, but my only  ways to contact her are Steam and Discord, and I have no idea if she has  Facebook, Twitter, anything like that where I could possibly find  information. I tried looking, but nothing turned up. Our mutual friend  also lives in the same country, over an hour drive away AFAIK. I don't  think he knows exactly where she lives or has her number or anything,  because I talked to him and he seems none the wiser, but agreed that  it's a little worrying. I figure he would've called her to check up on  her or something.

I'm just hoping  she took some time for herself unannounced but it doesn't help the  constant sense of dread I've had for a few days now, and I can only  distract myself from it briefly with work, games or such.

I  had several dreams where she logged on again and messaged me, and then I  woke up and realized she didn't. It's fucking soul crushing and I don't  know what the fuck I'll do with myself if she's gone.",09Jul2020,1

Saying things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be okay‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you‚Äù all sound so cliche and over used. What are some ways I can I comfort her?",09Jul2020,3

I think OCD and depression go hand in hand with my problems as I'm trying to cling on to any happiness to fill the gap so I end up changing my mind about my identity because I myself have no idea who I am and or if I belong anywhere and I'm scared of it being taken away from me as that's what is keeping me alive at the moment.",09Jul2020,1

40,"So a girl I know (we are close, we know each other from university) is going through hard period. She usually always down, but I always there to encourage her. As background knowledge, she has a problem with her family (abuse father with middle age crisis problem + some medical conditions) In the quarantaine period she had to go home she always hated it (she is only girl in big family of 4 older brothers) Luckily her father is not in the house. Another thing is that she must do her graduation project from home. Despite all that she was doing good, we had few zoom meeting (she lives far from me) so I can help her with the project. In these last days, she is not replying or interacting with me (we usually exchange memes). All she is saying is :Im tiered, I want to disappear, I can't take it anymore. I asked for the reason but she wont answer me or talk about it. If anyone can help me help her get through this safely.

I am a 36 year old latino male. I've dealt with depression since i can remember. I have been raped as a kid, i have been beaten as a kid mentally emotional and spiritually scarred. managed to live my life as a passive. not even aggressive either. just passive. no backbone whatesoever. biggest mistake of my life was to join the military. after basic is when i noticed a change in me where all the anger hate diapointment regret and self loathing blew up in my face. drinking got heavy. Too heavy. to a point where i could name myself an alchoholic i guess. the only reason i would drink was just to drown my sorrows and self hate. i would lash out at everyone. hence why i have two baby moms. yes i concider myself a piece of shit. two of my three children live with me full time. i doubt i am making any sense.. question is how does anyone deal with their emotions without taking anyones constructive critisism without offense. i get super defensive over nothing. i need help. i've already recently tried to ""off myself"" on the 4th for many reasons. im sure i will get a lot of hate from this and its ok. its the internet. i can't seem to find help anywhere. im at wits end. and its getting to the point where i am finally going to give in and just do it. help.",09Jul2020,1

I'm just sitting hear listening to Pasta, if you call,  and keeping time -Angie McMahon and im fine -Hazel English over and over. 

Her reasons are justified and I cant be upset at her and im not. Im mad myself for ruining the best relationship I've ever been in. She actually cared about me. I didn't feel like a prop for once. I wasn't someone's dancing monkey for a change. 

But I let my insecurities poison my head. Im.trying to use this for growth. But all the rational thoughts  keep getting out yelled by the shitty self loathing thoughts.

I'm going to watch untamed heart to try to feel better.  But I know it won't last.

I also feel so angry and sad sometimes, because all of this is not my fault. my mental problems are from abuse, and I feel like that person took away my life. like my chance to live a normal life. I dont think its fair that I'm struggling so much... I can't work, study, have a social life etc. and they're just living their life happily. i just really really reallt want to go to university and have a job and a ""normal"" life. but I'm afraid it will never happen for me. 

are there more people on this sub who are in the same situation? how do you cope with this? I've been home several times throughout the last years, but never this long. I've been home for over 6 months now. and I think it's best for me to stay home for another 6 months AT LEAST, maybe longer. but how? how do I do this?

I‚Äôve been dealing with persistent depressive disorder for the past 10 years, in and out of therapy (in currently), on and off of meds (off currently), and I just have no idea what to do anymore. At best, I can function, but by the time I‚Äôm there, I‚Äôm too exhausted to try to improve or make my life better beyond just ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù. 

Recently, some external life events have really made it hard to even reach functioning. I blame myself for everything and no matter how much I talk through it with others, I can‚Äôt seem to forgive myself, even if there‚Äôs not much to forgive in the first place. 

Is this the best I can do? Is this the best life has to offer for me? Just... functioning? I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything, and it makes me want to give up.

TW: abuse :(

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm super nervous to be posting this but this group seems so helpful and friendly..

I am trying to gain enough courage to leave what I think is an abusive relationship. We‚Äôve been together for a year. I told him the things he did were okay, so I totally know my actions made everything worse. But I know I have to end it. Only one person in my life knows that I‚Äôm even dating someone, he wanted to be a total secret. No one in my family knows and they would be shocked. Even though he‚Äôs been a constant, never ending part of every single day of my life. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I can get away with not talking to him for a few hours if I‚Äôm at work, but I‚Äôm scared to upset him so I try not to go that long. He controls every part of my life. What I do, spend, eat. Literally everything. He has hit me because he says it gives him pleasure. But again, I told him it was okay to do all of these things. 

I‚Äôm sorry to ramble about this because I know this isn‚Äôt the group for this. What I‚Äôm posting about is asking for help in preparing for what I know is going to be an emotionally devastating thing to leave him. To go from someone being a part of every single day of my life, to having no one. I don‚Äôt really have any friends- besides the one who knows about this, but she lives 9 hours away.

I already suffer from depression, anxiety, and clearly codependency issues :(. Is there anything that anyone can recommend to help me get through this when I finally do end it? It might sound crazy but I want to do anything I can to prepare to keep myself safe. My friend suggested re doing my bedroom, for example. I would like to work on something like this but waiting for pieces to come in will be a while, too. 

I‚Äôm so sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Or if this isn‚Äôt allowed, I will remove it immediately. Thank you all for any input or ideas. I‚Äôm really worried and struggling here so I apologize in advance for all of the rambling.",09Jul2020,1
56,"My best friend and i communicate everyday since i had a pretty severe breakdown 18 months ago. I know its her way of checking in but we just have general chat on the phone. However, there are times when i just feel i need total space. Ive been trying to say this. I really just want a few days in total isolation to get out, probably go camping or walking just to escape everything. Ive said i dont want to have the daily chats during this time but she seems to really get upset. I just feel i need the space and want to get away from my phone, social media, tv for a few days. I dont feel suicidal or really down like i did before, but i just dont seem to be able to get her to understand. She keeps getting me to promise i wont do anything stupid or she will too. Im not going too but she seems to be really upset at this idea of me getting space.",09Jul2020,1
57,"I had my escape last year. I got away from home and  lived abroad for a year. I met some amazing people and my depression  got a lot better. I was feeling happier. 

Due to different circumtances, I had to spend a year home before going off to study. It drained me of happiness, freedom  and the feeling of having somebody who would listen. It drained me empty and in the last couple of weeks, I feel like I have stopped living.

You know the feeling when you look both ways before crossing the street? I have stopped looking. I have not care about car hitting me or not.
I have stopped mostly eating, I'm not hungry most of the time. I feel empty and stuck. Im not trying to die, I'm just too tired to put effort into staying alive

Everybody else in my family has somewhere to go when they have had enough of everybody, I don't.  I'm pushing myself deeper into this hole but I have lost the way out...",09Jul2020,2
58,"Hey guys. Lately (past two months or so) I (19m), have been in a weird state. I've had a history of depression since I was in 10th grade. I was a recluse, would mope around complaining a lot and self harm. But through all this, despite the melancholy and anger. I still felt alive, like I meant something. 

This brings me to how I've been feeling lately. I've been feeling nothing, no pleasure. No overt sadness. Nothing to really look forward to. I feel like I'm living through a meaningless sea of.. ""stuff"". I always think no one wants to be around me even when some of them say they don't mind hanging out, I always feel they're trying to be polite to me. Everything seems pointless and it feels like I'm living life wrong. 

Can any of you help me understand this and maybe how I can fix things? Anyone you might recommend me to see etc. Thanks.",09Jul2020,1
