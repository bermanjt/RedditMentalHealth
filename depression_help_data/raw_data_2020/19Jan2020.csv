1,"I feel like an object for other people, I don't have a personality and I don't remember having one also due to absence of any friends and the constant breaks up (eleven in total) I feel like I'm gonna be alone forever, a meaningless life. I think a lot about jump on the rails when I take the train, I already tried it but someone stopped me.
I don't care about nothing anymore and nobody knows that I feel like that, I always try to hide this part of me that keeps consuming me",19Jan2020,1

3,People at my school go around saying people like me are “faking depression” because it’s the “cool new thing”. Nobody wants to be depressed you fuckin dick heads. All you cunts are doing when you tell them that they’re faking it is increasing the chances they are just gonna tie a noose in their basement and hand themselves. So fuckin stop if you do that,19Jan2020,1
4,"I just moved to the city I’m from (it’s no small town; super thankful to be here and came back to see opportunities here) but today I just got hit with a wave of depression and intense fomo of where i’ve been the last 7 years. I miss my routine and it’s taking longer than i thought it would to get my bearings here.
I feel kinda lonely out here, and my friends are a little hard to pin down since they’re more established in their daily lives than i currently am.",19Jan2020,1

I don’t do self harm, and I seem happy for the most part around others,but when I’m alone or just randomly I feel, emotionless, like I’m just going on autopilot for a few days, and I’ve had the occasional thought of killing myself, even though there are people who’re having worse than me right now. I always get stuff that are just for entertainment to make me feel happy. I’m not entirely sure so it’d be great if someone could give me some info.",19Jan2020,1

I posted this on r/BreakUps but didn’t get that much of a response. So, my ex boyfriend and I had been together for 9 years. We lived together for 6 years and we basically did everything together. Throughout the years we definitely weren’t perfect to each other but we had a good relationship and we both loved each other and had always been there for one another through the tough times that we each had to endure. 

About 2 years ago I fucked up bad though. I ended up cheating on him and started a secret relationship with this guy that I knew from work. A lot of bad stuff happened because of this but the worst was when I stupidly got pregnant late last year. At first I didn’t know who the father was but ultimately, it wasn’t my boyfriend’s baby. He was devastated. It wasn’t just that this baby wasn’t his but I fucked up again and didn’t even give him a heads up that it might not be, so he was blindsided. The day that I told him the truth we broke up. It was the worst day of my life.


Fast forward to now, it’s been 6 months. It seems like he’s trying to live a new life while I’m raising a baby that I don’t want all on my own. It’s so hard. He’s given me all of the stuff that we’ve accumulated together over the past 9 years. He wants none of it cause it hurts to look at it. I can’t even go through it, it hurts too much to see all of our memories that he doesn’t even want to remember. It’s actually embarrassing how many times I’ve begged him to take me back. He says the obvious: how is he supposed to be with me when I cheated on him and I’m raising another man’s baby? I did the ultimate betrayal and I can never take it back. I get it - if this situation were reversed I would probably do the same thing. But I can’t let him go, he was my everything. What makes it worse is he says he still loves me and cares about me but he just can’t do that to himself to take me back. I feel like a part of me is missing, like I’m mourning the loss of a family member. I have gone into a pretty dark depression because of this. Ive has people tell me that it’s just postpartum depression but I don’t think that’s it. This breakup is what is making me depressed.

Anyways, I recently found out that he has a new girlfriend that he’s had “for a couple months”. I was furious when I found out because I thought that we had the common courtesy to at least let each other know if one of us got into a new relationship. Especially so soon after our breakup. But nope, I was the one blindsided this time.

Recently, me and my ex have had to be in contact because of our lease ending and problems he’s had with the car that we once shared together. The fact that him and I are still speaking is apparently causing problems in his new relationship. This has made my ex not want to talk to me at all because he says he’s going to try to respect his new relationship. Whatever. I know this relationship won’t last if they’re already having problems. I told him I would wait for him as long as he needs to and that I would never stop fighting for him. He told me that we both need to move on but I can’t.

Anyways, here is where I would like some advice. Like I said our lease is ending and it turns out that my ex can’t get another apartment due to legal issues so he’s asking me to be the co-signer again like I had been for the last 6 years we lived together. I was pissed. He doesn’t want anything to do with me but he wants me to co-sign on the apartment for another whole year and I won’t even be living there? At first I said hell no, but I really don’t want him to be homeless because I do still really care about him and love him. I told him if I sign the lease that will be another connection that we will have for a whole year (not to mention the car that he has that is under my family’s name). He says we will have no connection but I don’t believe him mainly because he has called me every time something has gone wrong with the apartment/car so why would he stop now? 

Idk what I’m looking for as far as advice goes, any advice/support/tough love would be helpful, about the lease issue or just help with the breakup/depression in general. I have no one else to talk to about this so I figured I could start here.",19Jan2020,1
8,"I (22m) have recently discovered reddit. With the wonderful people and comments I see through many posts I think this is possibly the only place where I can actually reveal what is happening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in college trying to get into university in Canada. The goal is to go to MED school to be a doctor. The issue is I have my transcripts yet I shiver at the thought of uploading them. This has happened to me throughout my entire life. Applying to College to upgrade for Uni, studying for a test, trying to make friends, even thinking of leaving the house is all terrifying and crippling to the point where writing this I'm shaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I was admitted to the hospital because I shared with my Chaplain (Catholic School in Canada) that I was having suicidal thoughts and couldn't see any other option. The doctor who oversaw me said something about generalized anxiety but I'm not so sure since I held back a lot about what I was actually going through. When my parents found out my mother reacted by breaking down and Father by being confused and uncomfortable. My parents are kind and loving yet don't have the highest emotional intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then I have patched my relationships with my parents and they think I'm fine. However I had a breakdown in front of my father. Parents are separated so only he knows. I showed him a small glimpse of my insecurities and he looked extremely uncomfortable. It was about how I feel disgusting and worthless over wasting time in my education and being a waste and strain to my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

The saddest part is this is only the tip of the iceberg; I've been trying to find cooping strategies and methods to improve my mental health but it's not working. At my worst I was having full blown hallucinations not knowing reality from fiction. For some reason they stopped after the hospital visit and I don't fell a need to take my life, yet I do think about it if I'm being honest. I know the advice will be to come out to my parents about this or to a friend but that is not an option. I would rather suffer in silence than hurt anyone with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've hidden this by using what I call my mask; a reflection of the ideal me that interacts with everyone so they won't suspect anything. I've done things and accomplished things that make my family proud and happy; yet all I fell is either shame, disgust, anger, or worst of all nothing about everything. For most of my life I've felt nothing, I'm somehow able to stuff it all in a corner in my mind and go numb.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this would be considered depression as I've never been diagnosed yet all I know is that I'm spiraling. I know life shouldn't be this way yet I know nothing else. I apologise if this is the wrong subreddit to post this but I need help. Thank you to whoever can help. And sorry for unloading this all on here.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I'm crumbling from the inside out and have no way to stop it or anyone to help. Please help me?!",19Jan2020,1
9,"Ugh another ""fun"" feature of this depression: eating lots of cookies, and being hella moody, or not eating much, then thinking I want' something...to find out I don't :( . Man this is irking me. :(  i've noticed: for the last week, or more: When I get upset I crave oreos, little things just set me off to be super enraged or intense. And I'm having a hard time figuring out what i'd want to eat, if at all.

And just soo. mad at being fragile, then sometimes a huge asshole, or a stupidly hyper.  And then wanting to just sleep.

I don't know what to do with that.",19Jan2020,1
10,"I'm new here, so if I used the wrong flair, sorry.

Lately I feel like I've lost who I am. Around October or November, I ever so gradually began to close myself off. I have friends who mean the world to me, and I'd do anything I can to help them. I used to feel like I could truly be myself around them and trust them with anything. However, I realize about... a week or so back that I don't feel that way anymore.

I don't feel comfortable talking about anything. My likes, my hobbies, the good things, the bad things. My brain writes off everything as ""meaningless"" and ""adds nothing to the conversation."" Its gotten to the point that I now feel so alone and like I don't belong in my friend circle. I want to be myself again, but I don't know how to or where to start. It doesn't help that my depression has made me lose sight on my passions and interests and hobbies. I struggle to enjoy anything.

Why can't I feel comfortable anymore? Why can't I be open? Why do I feel like I don't belong? What's wrong with me, and how do I find who I am again?",19Jan2020,1
12,"Like the title said, I'm tired of living but I'm scared to die. Honestly, I'm so tired, everyday is the same routine and every day the same thoughts of suicide make it's way to my head. Throughout my life everyone has left me, my friends, my family, they all stopped caring. All trauma and other shit that happened throughout my life haunt me everyday. I know everyone says talking to someone helps with the pain but ive tried that and my friends judged me saying I'm faking it. God, do wish I was just faking everything. I wish all my pain didn't exist I wish that my life was perfect. I feel like I'm nothing like I'm not important. I've thought about killing myself way too many times, I've written so many versions of what would be my suicide note, I've wondered so much about what other people would say if I did. Death is such a weird concept to me. Nobody knows what happens when we die. But from death the pain would stop, I wouldn't have to live a life that i dread living.  But what exactly would happen after life. God, it scares me so much. What if it doesn't stop and the pain gets worse. What if heaven and hell really is real, where would I go? I really really just want all my pain to go away I want it all to stop but I'm just scared of what'll happen and it's confusing me so damn much.",19Jan2020,1
13,"It's hard to explain to people that even with the offer of support, you can still feel alone when it feels like no one understands what's going on with your thoughts and emotions.

Things will be okay!"" just makes me feel worse, and I'd rather be alone and that they spend their time on...other things in their lives that are important.",19Jan2020,1
14,"The guy I'm dating has been having a tough week due to two things happening and I think it has triggered his depression (he's told me about his mental illnesses before). Our relationship has been amazing so far but this week he has been really quiet with me and doesn't want to talk, and now it has come to leaving my messages on read. I'm really concerned about him because I don't want him to feel he has to suffer alone, but I also understand that everyone copes with things differently, and perhaps he just needs to get his thoughts in order before talking to me again. 

I've sent messages telling him I'll always be there for him and nothing will push me away, and I know how rough it can be because some of my family members also suffer from depression. I've also told him I will give him space to think and get his mind in order and that he can message me anytime he feels like talking, but I do want to keep checking in on him over the next few days to show I'm there for him.

If anyone else has any advice on how I can support him, then it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",19Jan2020,1
15,"I don’t know if this needs warnings or anything. I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. So just in case, I am going to be mentioning self harm.

Anyway. 
For a while now, I’ve had issues with invasive thoughts. Thoughts about self harm/ mutilation or worse. Normally, I can get them to go away by drawing, or writing/ reading or some other healthy stuff. But lately, it’s been harder and harder to focus on other things. I know my trigger for cutting is anxiety/ depression pains. If I can make the physical pain I feel something I can see, it makes it manageable. Heals, goes away. But cutting isn’t healthy and I know that. But the stomach pains and fatigue and dizziness. It’s just too much and I have no reason to be feeling this way. And I get stuck in this loop. 

I’m sorry this is all over the place, but do guys have any ideas to stop the invasive thoughts?",19Jan2020,1
16,My boyfriend of 8 years cheated on me multiple times each time I found out and confronted him each time he had been apologetic and he told me he doesn't know why through tears. Each time I've forgiven him and moved on. But this time was different before it was mostly through texts and occasionally kissing. This time I found out he actually had sex with the girl and lied to me until there was no way he could. He promised that it would never happen again and that he never wants to hurt me this way again but even though I want to forgive him and move on I have been having a lot of uncomfortable thoughts and I have been picturing things and although I am still very attracted to him intimately it has been hard not to let it get to me during it.

20,"All my life i felt like i have to dress like a boy bc i wanted to be a tomboy. like i always thought they were so cool and tough. kind of a facade cuz i’m rlly so weak internally. i can’t seem to think for myself. i feel like i don’t deserve to dress girly. like it’s not for me. it gives me anxiety to dress in anything other than hoodies and sweaters. i try to look girly some other days and it just doesn’t work. i immediately feel self conscious and want to change right away. i was bullied in elementary school by cute tiny little girls and i didn’t know how to defend myself verbally. i just kept quiet and let myself feel inferior. i’ve always been tall as a girl (5’9 now) and i felt so so so inferior when i tried defend myself against these tiny cute girls with slim bodies. like i felt like a giant dumb loser who couldn’t defend herself. becoming a tomboy kind of was like  a facade. hide the weakness inside. i can be tough no doubt, but words rlly hurt me. to this day idk how to fight with words. fists and physical play fighting seems easier. i have no idea how to defend myself at 19 years old. it’s getting scary.  like i think i should have some grip on life by now but it’s getting looser and worse every year. i’m just so discouraged and i don’t even want to leave the house anymore.

22,"Over the past year or so has been shit to say the least. I have lost my grandfather on my dads side, and then my grandmother on my moms side. If that hadn't been hard enough, my mother was brought into the hospital for treatment for her on going issue with alcoholism, and needed to put her under to check her out, except she crashed when they did and was left on life support due to how bad her body was shutting down from years of abuse to drugs and alcohol. This broke me, but I figured I would be fine. A month later, my at the time GF of 5 years and i sat down and had a long talk, that resulted with us breaking up, it was civil and we have remained friends since. With this, I found it was super hard to live her her, let alone share a bed with her, and moved out after a month into my mothers old place. I did fine for about 5 weeks, but I just keep breaking down, overwhelmed with how quickly my life turned to shit. Ever since i moved out, i can feel myself getting deeper and deeper into this pit of sadness, but i have only friends online who do what they can. I've lost all interest in everything i loved, working out, singing, playing video games with my friends. My sleep schedule is all fucked and ill sleep for 14+ hours to not have to be awake. The only piece of happiness i have left, is the dog i got with my ex a year ago. She is my entire world, but i don't get to see her often and it kills me to leave when i do see her.

I've lost all hope for any goals and ambitions, they are still there and i have these ideas on how to get them but actually making then happen seems so out of reach. I work as a Call Company fire member at my local fire department but that only pays for calls i go on and its once a month, but has become impossible to do as i was on the Department with my ex and we used her car to get to calls. The only other car belongs to my brother that he uses for work, so I'm stuck home all the time.

My only hope, is when we sell my mothers old house and split the money, so i can get my own car, and work on my goals, but even that sounds like a fairy tale at this point. I'm just so lost, being a social guy, now alone. Someone who use to be proud of how he looks, now scared of a scale and mirrors. Once athletic, now i can barley run mile without passing out. I feel so broken, and I'm unsure how to fix myself, unsure if ill ever be happy.  I've tried explaining to others what i felt, but was brushed aside and told to ""man the fuck up, and just deal with it"". I'm tired of something small causing a full blown meltdown and breaking down over nothing because mentally I'm so worn out.

TL:DR -Ive lost everything but my dog, and i don't even get to see her often. I'm depressed and have no friends anymore and needed to vent to prevent another mental breakdown.",19Jan2020,1

26,"I have a huge crush on this girl. And she isn’t interested in me back. Ok. I’m almost 20. And I honestly like this girl. And she doesn’t feel the same and the pain is so bad. I’ve never had this pain with anyone else. Other girls didn’t matter. This girl it matters. I’ve never had a relationship. 


I can’t help but check on her Instagram. And simple stuff like seeing her update her bio or profile picture, kills me. Seeing her comment on a picture hurts so bad, because I see her say nice things and make comments about memes, and then I wish I could be apart of her life, and then I see how I won’t ever ever be apart of her life, and what I’m missing out on. I’m selfish to even feel she needs to feel the same way. But I can’t help long for her. Seeing her update her picture smiling. It hurts so bad. Not because she’s happy. I’m happy she’s happy, but because I don’t get to stand next to her smiling with her. 

This is horrible. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to move on. And I don’t know why my feelings won’t die, and I don’t know how to make them die. Even if I get responses like keep busy. Even when I do, it doesn’t help the fact I feel the pain whilst I do activities. No matter what the activity.

They have their own lives... they don’t seem to interested in the fact she is leaving always stating: “It is just training.” Which I get. I’m not ignorant knowing that there are people out there who have it worse than me. That she is going to training, not being deployed.

I feel like I’m supposed to look like Vault Boy with my thumb in the air and smiling. All the while knowing my communication with her will be minimal. Knowing that I’m going to be alone for that long. Knowing that people think I am being too sensitive or whatever.  It would just be nice if someone in my life would be like “Hey. I’m here for you.

I used to get up every morning when I had work and I would get myself ready, hair and makeup (even though I work in a call center and the customer never sees me) I felt good looking nice going to work everyday. 

One night at the end of August I woke up with a excruciating pain in my lower abdomen. So bad I almost called an ambulance. I have been sick since. I have been passed around to many different specialists and had countless tests and procedures. Turns out I have a bladder disease with no cure in site. I have to have a surgery this month to hopefully help with the bladder retention since I am relying on self catheterization. 

Now when the alarm goes off I dread the day ahead of me. I am filled with fear and anxiety. I am exhausted because even though I have slept I don’t feel like I have gotten any rest. It takes so much energy to shower. I no longer wear makeup. My eyebrows haven’t been groomed in 2 months. I only blow dry my hair. And I can no longer wear jeans or constricting pants due to the inflammation in my abdomen. I have missed work so much but thankfully I have doctors that have filled out the HR paperwork so that my job is currently secure. 

This past week was the worst it’s ever been. I have had days where I have stayed in bed and not showered but this past week I called in on Wednesday and Thursday (my days off are Friday and Saturday) I stayed in bed the entire time and didn’t shower until Saturday afternoon.

I have been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. Some days are better than others, but lately, it's just been bad days. 

I have lost interest in writing, and I force myself to write for my blog in hopes of reaching out to others who have similar interests. 

I get unmotivated in my life, seeing how others have succeeded or have the life that I would have loved to experience. I start to wonder what I did wrong in mine. 

My SO and I have been having problems caused by his mother. We have come close to breaking things off twice. We have been together for almost four (4) years and have a two-year-old daughter. I simply can't handle the pressure that it puts on our relationship, and it's bringing up past issues that I have been trying to deal with for years. It also doesn't help that I keep having nightmares of confrontations with her.

43,"i used to get like this really bad after i graduated high school. once i got a job and met my boyfriend i havent felt like this in forever. im 20 now. i have it really good and i’ve had such a good mindset. never really been happier. i have no idea why this happens, i know that this is a usual symptom but why. i just want to cry all day. i really enjoy playing video games and drawing on my computer when i can. my boyfriend and i set up an office so we have our computers in a room together. he usually is making music or playing games too. both yesterday and today i started up my computer and i just looked at it and there was nothing i could do it felt like. i went to play a game i really like and i just couldn’t perform good. i also haven’t been drawing consistently so it’s like i losing that muscle memory and i can’t draw anymore. today when i went into the office i realized i really have nothing to do. i just sat there looking at my desktop feeling lost. i got this overwhelming feeling of just wanting to cry. my boyfriend is talking to his friends so i don’t want to bother him. plus i’ve already talked to him about it. i just want to know how to fix this. i am do passionate about the things i enjoy. it’s sucks so much that i can’t find it fun anymore. i can’t even watch my boyfriend have fun, i just want to lay in bed and cry. i am on birth control (the pill). so that’s probably adding to it and making me feel worse. but i really don’t want to quit it because i just want to be safe.",19Jan2020,1
44,"I’ve been depressed for almost 9 years now. i have anxiety too but i can control that a lot better now so i’m not too worried about it. but my depressions really bad. I’m also deficient in iron b12 etc. so that makes it worse. I’ve gone to therapy throughout the years and it helps the first few weeks, then it goes down hill again. they suggest medication but i have my own reasons as to why that won’t work for me. one being i have an addictive personality when it comes to that kind of thing. 

I’m extremely unmotivated all the time, i used to be so active and lively but that feels like so long ago. i’ve been unemployed for a year and only my boyfriend knows. he’s so kind and wonderful and he’s the only reason i’m still alive. i think about death and offing myself all the time. it’s sick. i’m always sad angry frustrated tired, idk what to do anymore. I have so much potential and i’m wasting my life away. please if anyone has any advice or survival stories pls leave a comment. i’m desperate for some motivation.",19Jan2020,1
45,"Hi, I am new on this sub.

First of all I am not planing to take my life anything soon.

With that being said lets start.

I am currently 17 years old. 2 months ago I droped out of school. Now I am working as an Optician 30-60 minutes away from my hometown. (depends on your prefered traveling method) I work 4-5 days a week from 9am to 7:30 or 8:30pm. So I am literally working all day long. But thats not the problem. I really enjoy working there. But as soon as I come home depression hits my like a brickwall. The cause of the impact is my Mom. She instantly starts yelling when I get home. Accuses me of not being there for her and the doggo, because I am at work(!). She is a longtime-unemployed women in her mid 50s. Nobody wants to employ her whether because her age or her...yeah herself. So she is a fulltime dogmum and im literally worthless to her. My dad ist working abroad earning quite a lot of cash and is home not even 2 days/week. I can understand this pretty good. Who wants to be at home with such a wife and a depressed son. Altough we really need the money. My mom spends every cent she has on the dog. My lunch at work consists of 2 piece of bread, not even toasted, with ham and cheese, that i make myself every morning.Sometimes even only bread. My mum even cooks the dog seperate meals consisting of meat, rice, boiled carrots and fresh, chopped parsley. When I get home I get...nothing. The fridge is constantly empty, because she doesn't even bother to go groceries shopping. So i have to find something to eat. After I ate, i go downstairs, in my room, because I dont want to get yelled at further. Smoke a cig while crying in bed, take a shower and then cry myself to sleep. And that is my daily routine. On my days of I get yelled at because I wanna hang out at a friends place. Then she complains why I dont bring my friends home. Once i did this. She yelled at him, because he spoke too less(!). He is an very introvert man and it took him a lot of effort to take a single step into my house.

Now that money is tight and the dog needs treatment, she was willing to sell her car to buy him his meds. (Doggo is little bit sick; but my mum exaggerates because she fills him up with a ton of meds every day. She doesnt even bother to check if he still needs them. She keeps pumping.) We talked her out of selling her car. But now she wanna put the poor doggo down. Because he is ""IN CONSTANT PAIN"". Remindes me of the one cyanide and happiness episode with firedash. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2\_8cfVpXbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_8cfVpXbo))

Agh. Im running of track as it seems lol.   
I cannot take this any longer. I need a solution for my problem. But I cant move out yet because I am a minor and have literally no cash because I am supporting this ""family"". I am earning 600€ a month. I am spening a third of it on groceries, another third of it on cigs (cant quit; only constant in my life), other third on eating at a restaurant while playing cards with friends or for train tickets for a little getaway for some hours.

I need some life advise.",19Jan2020,1
46,"So I'm the one with depression and anxiety. I need stability in my life to help manage it. 
I'm not controlling at all. I know he has his life and I don't hold him back from anything he wants to do. 

But I don't think it's unreasonable to ask he lets me know a bit in advance if he plans on going out randomly. Or to let me know he's home safe (I don't care what time it is but I need to know he's safe. I've lost someone like that before and it makes me anxious to not know). 

He keeps saying things like it's always been like that, he's used to doing what he wants, I should just trust he got home safe, he doesn't want to tell me because he thinks I use it to check up on him to 'catch him out', and a bunch of stuff like that...

Sorry for the long-ish post, but the point is - how do I deal with this? How can I help him to understand where I come from? Is it even worth it to keep trying to get him to understand? 

Please help! :)",19Jan2020,1
47,"I don’t know what to do.. I’m so tired of explaining it to people.. no one understands.. in November my future step son was killed, now I’m losing my fiancé too, I’ve always been there for her but I have no one. I can’t do it anymore I just want to die and I could never actually do it because my cousin beat me to it. I just want to stop all this pain without hurting my family.",19Jan2020,1
48,"I mean yeah, there's therapist, psychologist, meds and shit. But i'm asking something bit more personal. Little things you do to help yourself. 

I usually take a toke (which is kinda bad, you shouldnt smoke weed when youre super depressed lol) and I take myself out to a park.. I go to small parks and big parks. People watching is pretty fun and watching occasional doggo walk past me makes me slightly happy.  Plus getting some sunlight on top of that actually kinda feels good.",19Jan2020,1
49,Laying in my bed with tears in my eyes thinking about why nobody loves me.. obviously it’s my fault but what do I do wrong? Can anybody help me? I will explain the details later if you are really interested in helping me,19Jan2020,1
51,"Hey, hope you’re all doing well. I have just been losing interest in things, I’m moving slow, talking slower, sleeping more and more, and letting things I like slowly slip away. I hate this feeling. I do indeed have some people I can talk to, but they are seemingly upset a lot of the time, so I do not wish to bother them. How can I stop depression from taking control of my life when I have little to look forward to, and how I can better help my friend take care of his problems?",19Jan2020,1
