0,"Maybe this title is a bit of a exaggeration. Basically my parents split up a while ago meaning my Mum lives in New Zealand whilst my Dad lives in Canada. I'm a 18m and I live and study at university with my dad in Canada. Even back there I was feeling very lonely and isolated pretty much ever since I was forced to move across the world after the divorce. I have aspergers and am generally introverted so making any friends is very difficult. These feelings got so bad that I eventually fell into deep depression. It didn't help that I also got rejected by a girl whom I had pretty strong feeling for around this time. Because of this my Mum invited me to New Zealand so I could spend the holidays there with her. She runs a campsite by the beach with lots of people at it so she thought it would be better than being stuck home with nothing to do while I was already feeling lonely.

So I agreed, but during this time the coronavirus started to shut things down including my university. I left early, worrying I couldn't leave at all if I waited any longer and since university was now online that was doable. Traveling during the virus was hard and I had to lock down for 2 weeks but after that I arrived at the camp and things where alright. I got to walk my Mums dogs on the beach daily and I eventually started working part-time. Despite this, I really despise the guy who manages the place who is also my Mum's boyfriend. He had a role in the divorce so things were already awkward but he was generally just a very emotionally manipulative and abusive person. He'd force me to do jobs I wasn't comfortable doing while I felt I had little choice and then get really mad when I couldn't do them properly. I just generally felt uncomfortable, I wasn't in need of money at the time, and I was still feeling sad and anxious about things so I was not really looking to work that much, yet I was kinda quilted into doing so, slowly getting more involved then I initially agreed. I was just feeling really uncomfortable working there, but eventually my Mum's BF crossed the line when he really viciously insulted me over something really dumb. I was nearly crying at the time, as he dug deep into my character so Mum took me away from the camp to her house where I am currently staying.

I have been here for a couple weeks now, and because my Mum has had to work I'm mostly alone. I wasn't comfortable at the campsite but with my Mum, Brother and other people at the camp I at least had people to talk with. Despite this I was mostly fine staying here. I have games to play and schoolwork to do so I was mostly busy and the dogs are here with me so I have company and a excuse to go out for a walk every day. But then the news arrived that my flights out were cancelled for another 2 months, and probably more. I could leave, but I'd have to go through the US which seems to be in a mess quite now so my parents are reluctant, and even that might change. 

My Mum felt bad for me being insulted but now she has seemed to have relapsed back to her BFs side. Because I'm staying here longer, she wants me back at the camp given I can't stay here forever. Yet I feel uncomfortable with that, I tried to tell her I didn't want to work but she started guiltiling me, and now I don't know what to believe. I already feel confused about my future but have some general ideas about career options. Yet my Mum and even my Dad have been pretty much calling me lazy, but I'm not sure what to do about that... I have been doing schoolwork, procrastinating slightly due to feeling unmotivated and anxious, but still confident that I'll be able to finish on time. In terms of part time jobs I can really only work at the camp given my situation but I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Now I might even have to do my next university class online, which greatly depresses me, given that I have been struggling to even do a few classes online, let alone a full course loads. My favorite part about uni was going out to lectures and learning, not being forced to lay in bed and write essays. Frankly I don't even know if I want continue with my current career paths, but I feel like I have little other choices other than sticking to university and studying what I know is a useless degree. I have a great passion and understanding of history, philosophy and politics, but not any practical skills which I tend to despise doing. I had ideas about maybe even joining the military as an intelligence officer as it seems interesting and actually achievable, but I'd still need to finish a degree while I'm stuck here for who knows how long. 

Because of all of this I feel lonely, anxious and depressed once again. I'm talking to a counselor online but she seems to be rather useless most of the time, repeating useless platitudes over any over again. Because of my general loneliness I have been looking online, doing some debating on discord as it was a hobby in high school, and trying online dating (changing my location back to Canada), but I have found little success with the latter. After about 5 months of trying I only went on 2 video call ""dates"", one of which I didn't continue from a personal lack of interest and the second never continued after she suddenly told me she found someone else. I have well done photos, I think I'm decently attractive and I have a lot of hobbies and interests which I have listed. I mean I have been reasonably picky, but only about not actively pursuing people whom I know I have nothing in common with, not about looks or anything like that. 

So I don't know what's wrong, and I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and incredibly alone. Everyone seems to be against me. If anyone has gotten this far into this long rant, thank you, and I hope you can give some advice.",27Jul2020,1
1,"My mind is a battlefield of constant awareness.

I avoid mirrors because looking in them for too long makes me want to puke. 

Leavening my house gives me nightmares of people looking at me. 

The lard in my veins is consistently my greater demise. 

Maybe an early death shall permeate my mind. 

I just want to be beautiful. I want to look into a mirror and not need to avoid it. My face is my greatest shame. I just want to he beautiful and I want other people to think I'm beautiful. I'm tortured. I feel so vain talking about this, like I'm a bad person. But it's the truth. I need to feel beautiful. I just want to be beautiful. 

Sometimes I look at my gentailia and I find it so disgusting. It shouldn't be right? It's a part of my body and that's fine but I just want it to be gone. It's not beautiful. It's so ugly. 

Being in my body feels incredibly terrifying. I can feel the imperfection on me.",27Jul2020,1
2,I have reoccurring thoughts and day dreams of ending it. Day and night just seeing myself downing my stash of pills before going to bed or copying 13 reasons and going out in the tub. It helps to have distractions like personal time or gaming but it’s getting harder to focus on hobbies projects and stuff like that. I feel like Jack Nickelson in Over the Coo Coos Nest or Shining. I don’t trust the places I have left to vent. Reddit always buried my posts for help which reeeeaaaly helps with the invisible feeling and the only people I feel confident enough to confined in are too busy. In a fucked up sense I don’t want to go into therapy (other than lack of funds) because I could be taking time from the therapist helping someone... worth it. If that makes any sense.,27Jul2020,1
3,"i’ve been denying my feelings for two years. in my head, i really thought i was getting better, doing better  and feeling better. however, when i read through the journal i started in july 2018 (ive written like 5 days a week since then), it’s very clear that i haven’t gotten better. i’ve just forgotten all the stuff in the past. i don’t know what to do because i feel so tired, like it’ll never past. i really want to talk to a therapist, but opening up to anyone is really scary for me, and i would have to talk to my mom first which is hard. she tries to get out every little detail but i really don’t want to tell her how bad i feel, that’s what i want a therapist for. it just feels like there’s nowhere to go.",27Jul2020,1

8,"This little rowdy asshat has been my best friend and consistent source of comfort for the last 8 years. She was incredibly protective and extremely cuddly, and her seemingly endless flow of energy gave me strength through some of my worst moments. She’d stand guard and try to protect me from everything; all 5 pounds of her lol. 

Earlier today, she wormed out of my grasp and high tailed it into the street to bark at someone walking down the other side of the street because the entire block belongs to her in her mind, but I wasn’t fast enough to catch her in time and an SUV ran right over her. She didn’t die, but she had two broken hips, nerve/spinal damage that precluded her from using her hind legs, and internal bleeding. The surgery for everything would’ve been around $10,000, so I didn’t have too many options at that point.

Rest In Peace, Lily. You were the most consistent homie around, and you kept me alive through most of my adolescence. You’ll be missed.",27Jul2020,1
9,"It’s weird because I can spend the whole day out having fun with my friends but the minute I get home, the feeling comes back. To be honest, I’m not even sure exactly why I’m upset all the time. Today wasn’t even a bad day but now I can’t stop crying. And the pain is so unbearable that I want to talk to someone, anyone, just to calm me down but I never feel that I can for a lot of reasons. Like, for example, I’m afraid of being judged for how I’m feeling (“why is she depressed her life isn’t that bad” or “she’s just looking for attention”). And if it’s someone that I do trust, my first reaction is “they already listened to you complain last week you don’t need to burden them anymore than you already have” and I’m afraid they’re just being nice to me because they feel too bad to say no. And as a result, I end up just internalizing all my frustration which makes me feel even worse and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m sorry if this is long, I just need an outlet to say what I’m feeling at the moment so I don’t explode.",27Jul2020,1
10,"I was recently lucky enough to start talking to someone, and they suggested I be more kind to myself, and perhaps try to record my moods to track my thought process.

I want to do this, but my whole life, I've never been able to keep a journal for more than a handful of entries.  These days, my motivation is very poor.  I barely get out of bed in fact.

Does anyone know of an app or program that can perhaps make writing words into a light game?  I don't really want something that bugs me to write, but I hope if I have something that I can set say 50 or 100 words daily as a starting place, I can form a new, low pressure habit, and see where it goes from there.

So far I haven't been able to find just the right app (would be for Android, but can also be Windows)

11,"So I am a sole breadwinner and my job is killing me. Best part is the company is shutting down or being bought over ( not concluded yet ) and I plan to start my own home bake business (this is good but I cannot live with uncertainty), as theres heap of utilities and debt to clear.",27Jul2020,1
12,"I moved countries at the start of this year. What was supposed to be a great new journey for me has turned into a never ending hell hole. The stress of finding a job, performing well, doing well for myself is just fucking me over so bad.

I used to be so active back from where I was (even with dysthymia), I had enough of a support system that I could power through most bad days. Now the days are passing me by so quick and I can't seem to keep track, let alone live them. I spend 22+ hours in my room on average.

One of the low points was yesterday a friend took me to a store to buy me an electronic item I said I was interested in, usually I am very good with researching stuff like this, but right after I bought it, massive buyers remorse kicked in because buying it has actually stressed me out. The old me would never have done such an impulse buy and I am going to ask another friend to put the thing I bought on Ebay so I could hopefully make some money back. It's second hand, no receipt so can't just return to the store.

I've generally become dumber. My mind isn't as sharp as it used to be. I used to read books, go for workouts, create goals and plans to accomplish them and actually go out and accomplish them. Now, the goals are just too huge and I've lost all interest in even trying because I feel embarrassed and ashamed with how poorly I've done in life.

When I try and improve my life the energy literally zaps out of me. I went out for 6 hours yesterday and came home so depleted I was barely able to stay up and slept.

My question is how can I go back to being the person I used to be, that person had a ton of flaws, but was so much better than the person I've now become. This one has just lost the fire to live and just exists till he runs out of steam.",27Jul2020,1
13,"To the point: taking extended time of work (to potentially finding a new job) has been a hot topic between my therapist and me. I'd love to hear thought/suggestions that anyone who has gone through something similar may have.

My story: my depression started in my third year of college (and I met my now fiance around this time). The following summer by (step)sister died by suicide. And suddenly I'm navigating grief, survivors guilt, concern for my families health, and my own depression. Essentially one big shit show.

I interned with the company I now work for the summer before I felt like my depression developed and the following summer when I lost my sister. I have been working for them for the (just over) three years since I graduated. For context, I working in male-dominated technology field so I have been the only female at my office (besides the payroll/HR person) until very recently. My company was great when my sister passed and supportive but not pushy about it. They were also supportive when I had a bad, extended episode and made an agreement to temporarily reduce my expected work hours from 40 to 32 (I think this last for maybe 6 weeks...).

In the last year or so, my company has gone through a massive growth spurt more than doubling the size of the original team (7 people) in less than a year. I have become more and more uncomfortable with the changes in policies and the attitude/expectations/interactions at work. It's even gone so far as my boss gave me a self help book. (Side note: I tried to tell him the 'get over it' mentality that I read in the first few pages didn't sit well with me and made it seem like he didn't understand depression. His response was to tell me that I might not want to hear it but it was good for me.) I can't focus because of my depression and anxiety and the fact that I'm not performing well causing more anxiety. I can't interact with certain coworkers without a panic attack. My anxiety is reaching extremes to the point where I have had to run to the restroom for fear of vomiting on many occasions. Prior to this my anxiety has only ever caused me to vomit at my sister's funeral and made me that I needed to be hugging a toilet a few times shortly after. I don't feel supported anymore, especially given the amount of work my company has. 

I hope I've given enough context that y'all agree that my work as a toxic place for me and my current situation. I'm struggling with what to do next. Luckily my fiance is amazing and is supportive of my leaving me job if that's what needs to happen. We've looked over our finances and could survive on his income alone for 6+ months. I know that if I step away from work my co-workers (those ones that I like and care about their opinions and mental health) will suffer with my absence. I also know that I'm not performing to my boss's expectations. Beyond leaving my co-workers in a shitty situation, I'm scared to leave. I'm scared that I'll fall to find a new job and scared that failing to do so will bring about a new angle for my depression/anxiety. I feel like this short term disability option is a good stepping stone for me to a healthier work environment, but the thought of having to battle insurance companies and talk to my bosses gives me so much anxiety. I just feel so paralized.

And just to touch on my treatment, about 4-5 weeks ago I took a doctor recommended week off and it was great; I felt relaxed and able to focus on me and my health. However by the time I felt I was in a positive, healing routine, I was already going back to work. The week following I felt like I was doing awesome and was productive. I pushed myself to talk to my bosses about my situation and try to teach them about depression. I also pushed myself to make minor friendly gestures to the coworkers that are causing me anxiety (like bringing them their waterbottle that got left behind in the break room). But that lasted for such a short time, and I've already slipped back to were I was before. I feel like after dealing with work I don't have the energy to take care of my self like I need to. I'm on medication (and apparently have been for nearly 2 years as I realized earlier tonight). My doctor and I recently increased my doseage as well. I have also been seeing a therapist on and off for about 4 years (since shortly have my sister passed). Unfortunately for me, she got back from maternity leave about 6 weeks ago. But I'm back to seeing her weekly.",27Jul2020,1

16,"Alright so the past 2 month has been quiet a ride. I decided to deal with my 3 year old depression, and deal with the course of it; my 4 years old anxiety of talking to people, about things like emotions.

This has pretty much controlled my entire life; no social appointments, no drinking, not many friends etc. But after 2 month of feeling the worst I've ever had, and thinking and reevaluating my life, I finally feel like I'm getting somewhere.

I feel the best I've had in years, and also have the energy to create some boundaries around my life. I can stop surviving and start living.

Of course it'll be exciting to see what happens when I get back to high school, if it will last, or if I will get a fall back, but for now I'll like to thank anyone who ever replied to my posts, or wrote dm to me. You've been a fantastic help, and I wouldn't be where I am today, without you guys. So thank you, you're all amazing ♥️

17,"I've been feeling really depressed for a few months now, at one point it got so bad I attempted suicide. I have no one I feel safe opening up to, and the times i have, it never helped and I regretted it. Therapy or medication is completely out of the question. Anytime I do try to open up, the only answer I get is that I'm selfish to feel bad about my life because I'm ""so lucky"" or they just tell me to ""pray about it"" which is ironic because I don't believe in God anymore (nobody knows, it's one of the things I keep bottled up that causes my depression. My family is extremely religious and if they found out it would be the end of me). At the very least I'd wanna get diagnosed by a medical professional. Idk if it's depression, anxiety, and based on the research I've done, i fit all the symptoms of ADHD. I'v always felt different. From the kids at school, from my family, even acedemicly you can ask my teachers, my brain works differently. I would at least like to know what's wrong with me instead of having to guess.

18,"So overall been feeling shitty Im 17 btw and generally stressed about life and all that. I’m Paksitani-American but i got bullied for it as a child. I seem to have depression every once in a while around the day usually at night but also occurs during the middle of the day. And the thing is it’s not just “oh I’m different so I get bullied” it’s mostly looks and my horrible voice. I don’t think I’m hideous but I’m far from good looks and confidence. God knows how I got the confidence to make friends back then. Literally never felt liked by anyone in my classes for the past three years of high school, entering junior year rn. It feels like I’m a ghost although I wouldn’t occasionally get bullied if I was a ghost. Additionally, my parents clearly don’t love me since my dad views me as a failure as a kid, plus my grades are shit since I’m in this Cambridge program and was forced to take AP classes because of that. This year I took a class on my own because I was confident in myself, then in the last minute I couldn’t think of how to do the assignment and my motivation went so far down even when i tried doing the assignment I could only make it half way because my head couldn’t fucking work straight. My parents have fought, from a neutral pov I would say usually my mom is at fault and very few is my dad. I have to pray and not like five times a day prayer more like pray to god personally without the whole muslim prayer thing; I do it so that nothing bad happens to me after i “feel myself”. I know it’s not bad for you because nothing proves it is but every time I nut something bad immediately happens except when i pray for specific things to not happen since god isn’t really that merciful with me. I try doing the things that help me feel better like working out but gyms are closed and home exercises are hard since my friends usually tell me to keep working but now they can’t do that and check up on me all the time because obviously that’s annoying. Many people lowkey see me as Indian and I know our countries are closely related but that doesn’t make me Indian, I get offended because it’s said as an insult like you shit on the floor like an indian or stuff like that. Worse part is that this is most of my friends that say this shit at times. I don’t have a single girl friend or female friend which I guess its my fault for not talking to anybody but when you have social anxiety then it isn’t too easy. Moments where I do badge and try to talk to make new friends, people often ignore me or barely respond  so that lowers my confidence even more. Also, the depression might be genetic as well since my mom and grandpa and great grandpa had it so yeah. Depression and social anxiety is a bitch because they both influence the other, example: being alone in class makes me feel depressed and isolated which, in turn, cause me to be less encouraged to talk to anyone and so it becomes a cycle. I have somewhat edgy ass humor but if it’s something personally related to someone, then i don’t joke about it unless they’re fine with it. Even then i try not to depending on the severity of the personal experience. I’m always compared by my parents and sometimes my friends in being smarter or stronger. Even though I pray to God I don’t feel like he’s there, I always feel like I’m alone, there will be people who reach out and talk to me but none of them genuinely wanna be my friend, they’re just trying to be the hero or some shit like that. Here I am at 4:32 AM typing this shit. Yeah I’m not the only one, does that make it better? No. I’m a guy btw, I wonder how many of you ran away when you saw that I wasn’t a depressed teen girl :) Funny thing btw is that I fucking love this country to bits and would die for it but people still label me as a terrorist so. I have a shitty 2.8 unweighted gpa and I doubt ima get accepted into a good college after high school. My friends also bully me for watching anime even though i barely watch that much. Fucking love Japanese and Japan. I think the only good thing about me is that I’m tall 5’11 or more probably, but my looks are a 4/10 probably.

21,"Hi everyone
Any of you have allergies and think that the meds prescribed to you somewhat triggering your mental problems?
I have rhinitis allergy &amp; nasal septum deviation, I guess my condition is pretty much like hay fever (bcs it gets worse at certain period of the year, May-September). I started to get it treated seriously in July 2016. It was the first time my allergy get worse since my nose would bleed every time I sneeze or sometimes for no reason along with my nose discharge. I was prescribed with some meds and after consuming those for a month I started to feel like it deteriorated my mental health. I even didn't get my period that time for two months. Since then my mental health go downhill until finally I decided to consult a psychiatrist because the pain has gone physical and affecting my productivity, but when I told her when was my mental health started to get worse, she didn't believe me that my previous allergic meds was making me feel bad.

24,"For the love of god I REALLY hope a lot of people read this and get some insight from it, but I’ve also created a TL;DR down below if this is really too long for you.

So I’ve been depressed for 6 almost 7 years right? I’d been seeing people/trying to get help for almost 10 months and had been getting shit out of it. I was literally trying different meds for over 10 months and nothing was working for me and that was literally devastating. It was devastating because I was trying to help myself and even that wasn’t working. Therapy wasn’t working for me either because I didn’t have the motivation/drive to participate (which is why the meds working was such an important thing) I was having an incredibly hard time staying afloat (understandable) and towards the end I tried to commit suicide. Ended up having to stay in the hospital and go inpatient. Got out and was recommended by my doctor to do TMS. TMS is basically shock therapy. I was like yeah sure whatever. I kind of sneered at the fact that it was some random alternative form of treatment I had never even heard of TMS until my provider had recommended it. I made an appointment with this clinic but I didn’t expect anything out of it because I was like whatever I’m fucked up nothing is going to help me that’s why meds haven’t helped me because it’s all my fault I’m just fucked up in the head. I end up going to get treatment and I start feeling better within the first week. The whole point of this post is goddamn it if me my incredibly depressed ass can get better than so can you I’ve been at rock bottom so many times I have literally LIVED at rock bottom for YEARS. I’ve felt so dead inside before I literally felt like buzzards could feed off of me if they wanted to and the fact that I’m feeling better?? This post is to tell you that you can too. Everyone tried to tell me that my depression could be caused by things I had no control over and I dismissed it because for some reason I thought I was “different” and that shit like that didn’t happen to me it was just my own fault that I was depressed. To everyone out there who is depressed I really want you to entertain the idea that the reason why your feeling this way could really possibly not be your fault and that you really could be lacking something in your brain chemistry/neurons in your brain are not functioning. Medication fixes irregular brain chemistry I believe and shock therapy turns on shut down neurons that have stopped working in the brain that directly impact  mood so please just be open to the fact that whatever is making you feel like shit literally could be caused by one or the other. 

TL;DR Be open to the possibility of various forms of treatment helping you. The most common methods of treatment such as therapy/meds didn’t help me but now I’m doing shock therapy and I feel MUCH better. I have been SO depressed before and had such low sick moments before this thing is really a disease but I just want you to know that if me, out of anybody, can get better than you most definitely can too.",27Jul2020,1
25,"Why did they not tell you this, why do they keep trying to get you motivated but forget to tell you the secret about motivation. Don't allow motivation be the cause of your action because if you do let motivation be the cause of your action, you won't do anything if your not motivated. start doing what you want too do then and only then will the motivation be effective because when ever you feel like quieting or giving up on yourself or your dreams, you will always remember why you started. For everything and anything you want too accomplish in life, you must clearly define your ""WHY"" because that will be your greatest motivation.

27,"Hello, my partner has depression. They take meds and go to therapy. We talk and keep communication open on a lot but I’ve been asked to not bring up their struggles. I have a tendency to insert help and it’s not helpful and I’ve been working on that for months. I know the sleep issue has been a thing since November. What happens at night is that they will stand in the bathroom and tweeze their skin. it started back in February and is a nightly occurrence. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about it before and while they are working on it, it still happens. In the morning there’s blood on dried toilet paper in the bin. It started with eyebrows and now is scabs. When I wake up to get some water they will stop if they hear me and leave the bathroom. Their arms are full of pocks and scabs. I don’t want to squeeze control but this is unhealthy. How do I proceed?",27Jul2020,1
28,"Title says all. I'm gonna do community college for a bit to improve my GPA and get back into my regular college, but honestly I don't know what's going on. Might just say fuck it and work a regular 9-5 for awhile.

But especially with COVID going on, I seriously feel useless and lost in this world. Having very serious suicidal ideation and I relapsed back into self harm because I feel so awful. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.",27Jul2020,1
29," (18M )I think it started 5 years ago and its slowly getting worse. I realised 2 months ago that something was wrong because i had too much time because of corona. I dont realy want to get better.

 I dont think i have any right to get better. I dont think i have any right to care how i feel. I know something is up with my brain so why sould i care how i feel. i could be actually happy and i dont realise it as far as i know. I dont think anyone likes me, i cant think of any reason they could. i dont think i ever did something i could be proud of. I cant imagine feeling a better way.

I cant go to a doctor because its embarassing to make a big deal out of nothing.

The only reason to stay alive i can think of is that im too much of a coward to kill myself, that the person who would be needed to clean up the mess wouldnt like it and that everyone would propably laugh about it and i dont plan to give them the joy.

My plan right now is to earn the money back that was needed to raise me, pay it back and kill myself after that.",27Jul2020,1
31,"I hope you will forgive this little rant/whining/pity-party or whatever else you want to call it. I just need to let this out and don't have anyone else to listen.

I'm just tired of never being good enough. All my life, in jobs, relationships, in every aspect of my life, I've never been good enough. Of my best only ever amounting to a pathetic mediocrity.  Can't count the number of times I've had teachers and bosses complain that if only I worked just a little bit harder I'd be better. (I will admit, do occasionally slip into the cycle of ""well if I'm never going to be good enough, why should I break myself"". With so many people saying it, must be some truth in it. )

Truth is I want to be good at whatever I do. Who wants to be an abject failure in life. I feel like I am loving stillborn: I am alive, have been for almost 34 years and yet...I feel like I'm missing somethong intangible but vital to a full life. That no matter what I do I'll only have a shadow life. 

Not that I can blame anyone but myself really. Everything in my life is fully my fault, the result of the choices I've made. I'm 33, high school dropout, bouncing from simple job to simple job (that no matter how easy or simple, I'm still never good enough at), still living with my parents cause I've never been able to afford to move out, and never had a relationship because I've never been worth anyone's time.

This year was when I was going to try to change things. Try to make some positivity. Started a new job (where unsurprisingly my boss doesn't think I'm good enough). Get out, expand my social circle. Go to the gym, get to a healthy place. Covid put paid to all that. It feels like whenever I try to make forward progress, work towards something better, the universe slaps me down with a hard ""stay where you belong"". 

I realise all things considered, in spite of my failures, I have it pretty good. Yet rather than being a source of encouragement or comfort, it is merely another source of shame and guilt: that other people face much worse and overcome greater obstacles than my insignificant self-inflicted ones. If I wasn't such a coward I know I should end things. Yet I am, so I all I can do is hold it in and rant to internet strangers.

Reading over this rambling mess, I can't help but laugh at what an absolute piece of shit I sound like. Well so I am.
I'm sorry for taking up your time, but thank you for reading.",27Jul2020,1
32,"I am unhappy. That's all there is, I feel like an empty husk of a human. I am 17 and have everything in the whole f*cking world going for me.A very pretty girl, friends, enough money to live the humble life I want to, but I feel bad.I feel sick in a way. Defeated I would say. 

My dad is a very loving man and gives me anything under the sun( that is capable with our means and finances) like a brand new laptop that I never asked for not to mention the clothes and other material possessions.But some times waking up I just think of the reasons not to break/burn and generally destroy all of the things I own.I dare to call myself not needy and low maintenance. But nothing can fill the void I take with me( drinking/weed/steriotypical crap)

33,"So I'm terrible at communication, doubly so I'm my current state. If I don't get back to you, I'm sorry, I just need some help. 

3-4 months ago my life was going incredibly. Then covid happened, I spent a month not going outside not exercising, and just generally treating myself like shit. 

This triggered my first manic episode where I walked the streets of my city convinced that I was going to be able to run for mayor. I was hospitalized and diagnosed bipolar type two. 
I lost my job, my sense of self, and I've almost lost my girlfriend of 5 years. 

I'm so fucking depressed now. I am having intrusive suicidal thoughts for the first time in years and I sleep 12ish hours a day. I moved across the country to live in my aunt's basement and my girlfriend is starting to see other people. 

Anywho... If anyone wants to talk I'd really appreciate it. I need some friends right now and I don't have many of my own.",27Jul2020,1

38,"Hi all,

I am diagnosed EUPD but high functioning. I have had DBT which helped tremendously and I have been pretty stable for a few years. 

 The past year has been really tough for me, I have lost 6 family members and friends amongst a lot of other hardships. The most recent was my high school friend (TW:Grief) passing away a few hours after giving birth. We are both 25 and it was very unexpected. 

 The culmination of the events of the past year and this most recent loss has sent me into a huge downward spiral. I am the most depressed I have been in years and I honestly don't know how to claw myself out of this.
 My usual coping mechanisms like mindfulness, self care etc are having no impact at all. 
I am suicidal but I'm no immediate threat as I'm aware and don't want to act, so I am making an effort to reach out to people for help and also trying to help myself. 
 The main thing I'm asking for is any alternative coping mechanisms, anything that I have missed that might give me a glimmer of hope or a shred of happiness. I really am desperate not to feel this way again, and I don't want to turn to medication if I can help it.

TL/DR: Please suggest coping mechanisms, especially unusual ones as I am struggling to pull myself out of the pit! 

Many thanks to all that take the time to read and even more to those who comment with ideas &lt;3

Also I am writing this on my phone so apologies if the format isn't great.",27Jul2020,1

I've been working on an app and was told it would be a good idea to post about it here - you can see previous posts here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hq63ue/hey\_you\_yeah\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hq63ue/hey_you_yeah_you/)

The idea of the app is to improve your mental health through conversation.  
You do this by having anonymous conversations with other users in the app.

I've got a decent amount of work done since my last post so I made a video on what it looks like so far. You can watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB\_Ja8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB_Ja8)

I've also decided to call the app Chai - it's another avatar reference. I think the experience is similar to having a cup of tea with a friend and they're listening to whatever you have to talk about. Kind of like how Iroh has tea with people and gives them advice.

If you are interested in future updates you can follow me on twitter @ chaitheapp

I'm hoping to have the app released by mid September. In terms of what's next - I need to get notifications working, a reporting system working, and finalize asthethics and stuff.

Again, please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions on how to make the experience better. You can also email me at [chaitheapp@gmail.com](mailto:chaitheapp@gmail.com)",27Jul2020,1
44,Today it feels like a good day to just drive fly away from earth and never return. I might hit up the park. Idk. I can't even go outside anymore or even open my windows without feeling self conscious and my energy being leaked. I done had my energy stolen from me and I have huge energy leaks in my solar plexus I feel it and my third eye + crown. Well yah I just feel sick to my stomach everyday and I also have a lot of unspent rage. Feel like I'm gonna literally blow up some days. I wanna cry but I also feel tight feeling in and around my neck. Like I can't breathe or swallow I can't even walk right literally I feel like I'm in a panic rush mode thanks to the fake ppl who used me for their own struggles. I want to scream I want to flip my room upside down sometimes and just in general want to unleash this pent up anxiety and fury. I'm sick of being in this mentally and physically sick state. If I could Rewind and do it all over again id do too many things differently.,27Jul2020,1
45,"Just need to rant honestly because I have no one else to talk to my family all hate me or dont understand and my friends are busy with their own lives and problems. 

Today is a shit day I'm probably a 6 pushing 8 on the scale today. So this might be a long post.

Death is consuming my mind today, that or just up and disappearing.

My S.O. has been crap to me lately. He's been through depression and I have been there for him but the second the roles reverse Im ""woe is me-ing"" and making him ""feel like shit"" I feel like Im not allowed to feel like shit or depressed.

I suffer from undiagnosed anxiety and generally cant stand being around people, cant even go see a doctor because it's too expensive and the ""free"" help they give here is a joke (Ive tried many times)

My oldest child has been very hateful towards me more this year than ever before and tries to play it off by saying ""Im just joking"" and the S.O. plays into it too.

Honestly I just want to die but I'm afraid of pain and Im scared to try it. 

I feel like the only one who would really care if I died is my youngest child but thats probably because I'm the one who takes care of them, or the dogs because no one else would feed them.

I do some much stuff to keep this ship Im on running smoothly but it's like Im a ghost. Only time Im seen or heard is if someone needs something. I'm the lowest rung on everyones priority list including my own.

I just want to feel like I matter, like Im loved and not like a used toy that is broken and cast aside in a corner. Somedays that pain is worst than the physical pain that could take away my life.

If you made it this far thanks for listen to my sob story.",27Jul2020,1
46,"I mean the title says it all, and i want to preface this whole thing with saying this isnt about pity i fully accept that its my choices that have led me here.
I have never really had friends minus a few online that i play video games with, but as a kid i had none not until i was about 13 when i was able to play World of Warcraft (online video game) and made some friends on there. Idk why i was able to make friends online but not in person. As a kid school was torture and thats when i first really started thinking about suicide, if i didnt have the friends that i did online i would have killed myself, but knowing that i could come home and play WoW with them kept me going at that point, along with the advice that ""just wait till school is over, everything changes then"". I never excelled at school, C average probably like a B was really good for me. Threw most of school besides the bullying i did everything i could to just avoid contact with anyone my age then go home and play WoW.
Then my working career started, 2 years at Walmart... yee ha, yeah that was torture, I eventually quit walmart and moved to another province(in Canada) did general labor eventually where i was living fell through so i moved home. Then i moved around a few more times, moved home a few more times. I have been out of my mom's for like 3 years now pretty sure there will no be another move home lol(pretty sure). I never had career plans of any kind idk why but i have never been interested in anything... not as far as a career is concerned, people have asked me ""you like video games why dont you do something with them?"" the truth is i have no interest in making them, i like playing them, dont want to make them couldnt tell you why. If i sound lazy well the simple awnser is a just am, i work for minimum wage still as little as possible to pay my bills and allow me to skate by. I live with a roommate I am 28 he is 43 so we dont spend much time together due to lack of similar interests, we will watch a movie together once in a while thats about it.
Since i never went to college or anything pretty much the only good thing i have going for me is i have no debt and a few grand at least in the bank, which is a pittance but at least i know i can lose my job and have a few months bills.
I think something i have just developed over my whole life and as a kid the way i hated school and felt safe and happy playing video games I just feel very uncomfortable outside of my home. I go to work and i suffer through it but i really hate it, even though i do enjoy a solo bike ride and stuff like that there is something in my room where i just feel safe and idk hot to explain it, almost as if when i am in my room my batteries are charging, as soon as i leave it they are been expended. So as a result of that i mean i still obviously have no friends or at least local friends lol, even though my online ones have been getting fewer as they all grow up and dont have the time for video games i still do lol.
So idk to wrap things up I am just disgusted with myself but i have no confidence at all that i can change anything about myself, honestly i have the opposite i have a certainty that i will fail whatever i attempt, and i know the first thing anyone will say is ""well of course thats the first thing you have to change"" but i mean 28 years idk how to do that",27Jul2020,1

I’ve been struggling with that since I was younger. It was at bay for a while in the middle but recently has surfaced again and it’s so hard for me to get out of the feeling of not being good enough. Like someone else has it better than me so what is the point of my existence even. Or of me trying. I don’t know. I hate this feeling. It’s stopped me from doing so many things in my life.

51,"Ever sense about 3 years ago I’ve been feeling like shit everyday. I used to lock myself in my room for hours when it started bc I didn’t know what to say or how to get help waiting for someone to notice but no one ever came. The only thing that happened is that I’m just more far away from the people I used to be close with. I don’t have any friends. I barely talk to my family. I feel discomfort every time I leave the house. I’m also always defensive because I feel like everyone is judging me all the time and I end up hearting the people I love. About a month ago my mom told me she thinks I don’t love her anymore because I don’t talk to her as much and because I don’t volunteer to help with chores and stuff. I didn’t know I needed to go and ask! I thought parents just tell kids what to do and they do it! If she asks me to do anything for the house I do it! she also told me she doesn’t like my dad anymore and she was crying... now every time I look at them I feel terrible. I wanted someone to notice I’m in my room alone and help, who knew I’m going to still be here three years later more alone then ever. I went to a psychologist and it didn’t help, sharing my feelings makes me too anxious... i just end up putting on a smiling face and say that everything is fine. I want to be alone, but I don’t want to be lonely. I don’t know what to do. Please help",27Jul2020,1
