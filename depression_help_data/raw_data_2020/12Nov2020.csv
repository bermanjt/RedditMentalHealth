0,"Changing names:::;;;  
So basically my brother's spouse killed themselves February 2020 and my question here is, even if they may have been a frustrating person what do I do?  
My cat has the same name and there's no way to shorten it or give her a nickname since she's so old.  
Charlie killed themselves on my brother's ex-wife's birthday and left a suicide note to my brother in email form.  
The only problem here is that my brother has 3 children in total from a previous marriage and so does Charlie and they had 2 children of their own but the oldest of my brother's had a mental disorder but my mother, brother, and I have all been thinking maybe Charlie was being mean to my brother's 3 children in some way but the oldest is hard to believe due to her mental condition.  
They aren't my children, but it's messed me right up ever since Charlie killed themselves since all  7 children grew up with Charlie, and those select 5 no longer have a mother.   
The only reason I'm so messed up is because I was the person at the house when Charlie and my brother were getting diapers and maybe they could've waited, maybe they could've done a better investigation but maybe now I get to see those 5 again but they don't have a mother anymore and it's going to make me cry seeing them and I don't want to be painted as an abuser since I spanked the oldest about 3 times in my entire life.  
It's getting worse now, but can I get advice that isn't negative??? Please? A family member killed themselves and these kids don't have a mother but people want to get upset when I say there were times I didn't give them breakfast when they already ate enough cereal for 7 hours??!?!?!",12Nov2020,1
1,"Alright. I have depression. I have my whole life, like since age 5. Kind of the bipolar side, diagnosed BPD.  Recently quit smoking so thats exasperated my mental health like a lot. Boyfriend of 2 years feels like he's walking on eggshells lately because he thinks he might upset me. Finally told him today that on the scale of depression it is always a 3. Nagging and a general downer. Lately its been a 7, which is like immobilizing depression. A very heavy sad drag, but not go hide the gun depression. Ya feel?

So, he wants to know when ill get over ""it."" I dont understand how he doesn't understand that its not going away. So what im asking is how can I handle this better so he doesn't feel dragged down as well? Also, any words or books that would help him understand this better? That im never gonna be the rainbows and sunshine girlfriend?",12Nov2020,1
2,"Last four days has been devastating, My friends told me they are burnt out this was a week after they told me to come to them if I'm hurting. I feel betrayed, because I trusted what they told me. Now I'm laying here feeling more alone then ever. If i ignored their plea to be there. If i kept it to myself, i would of not changed anything. 
I would of had the woman I love in my life, and I would not of been called a burden and told that I burnt them out. 

Everything would be better for everyone if I was just by myself. If I kept them away.",12Nov2020,1
3,"Tomorrow is the 2nd anniversary of a medical trauma I had. It‚Äôs riddled me with chronic pain, panic attacks and PTSD. I‚Äôve noticed myself snapping a lot today and just being very short with my kids. I am grateful I‚Äôm still alive because before that I thought about suicide. Being that close to death does put things into perspective. I want to be here to see my kids grow up, and for me and my husband to have a long happy marriage. But I am struggling. I thought I put it behind me but the closer the date gets the harder it is for me to feel normal. I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds like I‚Äôm rambling I just don‚Äôt know what else to do at the moment.",12Nov2020,1
4,"Hey guys. First off, I am 18M and was never formally diagnosed but was told by a doctor I show all the signs of major depression and was medicated //// that's not important to this post.

Anyway, I have strict parents and although I'm sure they would never force me to do anything against my will the last thing on Earth I want is for them to be disappointed in me. My girlfriend wants me to ask my dad if I can sleep at her house &gt;!(not even sexually)!&lt; which I know he would disapprove of. We have talked about this for almost a year and she gets more mad at me with time and I keep failing to do so. I am asking him tomorrow night. How do I cope? I have a **VERY** critical math test Tuesday and I haven't even *started* looking at the chapter because all I can do is lie on my floor and cuddle a stuffed animal and cry while my stomach churns. I have secretly been eating junk food for weeks even though I am supposed to be on keto. I have no friends and my grades in college are starting to drop from lack of work. What can I do? What if my parents become disappointed? What if my girlfriend breaks up with me?",12Nov2020,1
5,"About a month ago I got tired of being so depressed and having no energy. So I decided to cut (added) sugar, upped my workouts to running at least every other day, made sure to eat a lot of healthy fats and salads and protein and blah blah, cut down caffeine, no food after 7 pm...

But now, I have lots of energy but no motivation, and I feel even worse. And angrier at myself for being such a piece of shit

Because at least when I had no energy ‚Äî going to bed immediately after work and sleeping 12 hours ‚Äî I could be like ""Wow I sure do need to improve my bad habits because they're making me depressed.""

But now I physically feel ""better"" and can no longer use that as an excuse. So I feel even more empty. Like I have nothing to work toward anymore, and I'm so bored all the time because I really hate social interaction and whenever my friends text me I can't help but ignore them. So soon I won't have any friends. But I am physically incapable of social interaction right now...No motivation or wish for it

It's just so frustrating having ""energy,"" but just feeling like staring at a wall like üòê for 8 hours and not feeling like doing anything else...And I feel like if I went to the doc they'd just be like ""How's your diet and exercise and sleep?"" Only thing is, sometimes it's hard for me to sleep because I feel so depressed and angry. So I know this is really bad but I have been abusing NyQuil to sleep occasionally. I just don't want to get worse and don't want to hurt my liver, but I would rather be asleep than suffer the pain of being awake. Hurting myself in some way feels like the only fun thing sometimes to be completely honest",12Nov2020,1
6,"I feel very unhappy and I don‚Äôt have any useful outlets for that feeling. Even before quarantines and isolation and social distance I didn‚Äôt exactly have a stable circle of friends to support me. And now that we live in the cursed version of reality we do, I have even less ways to deal with it. 

Even this feels like not enough because I‚Äôm sure even if people offer support I‚Äôm still gonna feel this way. Something about me is broken and I can‚Äôt seem to fix it. 

Therapy, medication, all the stuff you‚Äôre supposed to do to make the depression less painful never seems to last. I still end up feeling so alone and so helpless.",12Nov2020,1
8,"I'm very tired so I'll just try to make this very clear and simple.

My depression is back, just like years ago. Same shite. I got better within time because of friends, family, hobbies etc. But things changed and I dont just refer to the pandemic.

Depression stole my burning passion for music and playing guitar, which before used to help me now it's just more like a burden. I still love it, but it's harder to wake up in the morning, get out of bed, grab it and practice. It's impossible to get out of bed to be quite honest. 

The point is, I've become very anti social because of that. I'm used to being alone now and I really hate talking to people, even the ones I live with. The ones who care about me, love me and worry about me.

 I get fucking mad when they complain I dont wanna talk to them because I hate them, they just don't understand. I dont have the energy anymore. At least not for now. Them begging me for my attention makes it all harder. They think they are the problem when in reality it's me. 

All in all the pressure doesn't help, and I just don't know what to do. I just need some time. So if someone has some advice, please let me know. Talking to them about my situation is not an option.",12Nov2020,1
9,"I'm laying here with my sweet sweet boyfriend, who has been so patient through all of my struggles. But it is getting harder and harder and I feel like the only thing keeping me from disappearing is the thought that it would hurt him. I hate myself. I can't stop thinking how much I hate myself, and I don't know how anyone loves me to but he does and I couldn't leave him. 
I'm sorry this is nonsensical, I'm in bed drowning and tears and just in need of a reminder, a reason to keep going.",12Nov2020,1
10,"I don't have depression. My SO does. 

One of the most common conversations I have with my SO is her asking that we break up because she thinks she's becoming  ""too much of a burden"" for me and that ""she wants to 'go' (as in take her life)"" so that I won't have any problem anymore. 

I recently realized that such kind of talk needs reassurance that she's NOT the burden. I told her that the depression she has does NOT identify her nor does it define her.

I told her that she's not the burden. The depression is the burden and that I'm more than willing to help her carry it. 

I then created this picture in her mind of her carrying a big box full of heavy weights, and that I'm here to assist her in carrying said box. I told her that I don't find /her/ heavy. The box is the one heavy, and I'm here to lift it with her.

She calmed down soon after.

I think our partners with depression have really low self esteem. We just need to remind them always that they're not the problem and that the problems they have do not and will not identify them.",12Nov2020,1
11,"Sorry if this is rambly... the brain fog is real  
For context, I am a student, diagnosed with anxiety/depression and am currently in a depressive episode (or maybe its PMDD?!) and super super strugggling to get my final assignments of the year done. Literally cannot concentrate or think properly, on the verge of tears etc etc.  
Yesterday my 2 very studious housemates were talking about/judging someone who gets exhausted after 3 hours of studying and complains, when they just procrastinate and don't 'work hard' during the semester. They were essentially saying its as simple as getting up, and going to work... you get up and you study hard. Just showing a complete lack of awareness and inability to understand. I didn't say anything at the time. But its made me feel even worse about myself. Its not like I choose to not work hard. I want to. But sometimes it not as simple as that. It was hurtful, I've been mean enough to myself about my inability to study... I don't need external judgement too.   
So I guess... any hacks to overcome the brain fog and lack of motivation to complete my assessments?  
And is it worth pointing out to them that its not that easy for everyone to simply 'work,' and its really inconsiderate of them to say that, especially when its something I've struggled with in the 2 years of living with them....?  
Also curious as to responses to my question in the header?",12Nov2020,1

A year ago I ended a year long engagement to a man who wanted to exercise a savior complex on me, and decided I was going to make that year mine and grow as a person. I was the. sexually assaulted by my teacher, who was sexually assaulting all of his other female students including my friends, an event that led to issues with my father (who was close friends with the teacher and I had just began to build a healthy relationship with) and the death of a friend, who‚Äôs wife was also assaulted and it weighed so much on him that he killed himself. 
Immediately after, I went to an intense training camp for my dream job, which was increasingly difficult even without the baggage. But I made it through, and was so proud of myself and by the end of the year, I had my dream job and was moving to another state so I‚Äôd be far away from my past. I decided, I‚Äôd had a bad year, but this NEXT year was gonna be my year. 
Except not. As much as I love my job, my boss is so incredibly hostile and invasive, even going so far as to violate my privacy and has illegally procured my recent ptsd diagnosis and announced it in front of my coworkers to me before my councilor even had a chance to discuss it with me as a reason to possibly get me fired. I‚Äôve ended ANOTHER engagement this year, was sexually taken advantage of by my coworker and closest friend here who I‚Äôm no longer friends with, not because of that, but because he told me he didn‚Äôt care if I killed myself or not because he ‚Äúhad other friends and was screwing someone else‚Äù when I came to him about my depression and I decided I‚Äôd had enough, which is a lie and I‚Äôm actually having a horrible time getting over it but it is what it is.

I don't know if this is the subreddit where I should post this. Tell me if it's not.

Today something happened. I discovered that unlike what I would like to think, I am a selfish person.

Today for the first time in maybe two months I called two of my friends. One her family is seriously ill due to covid and the other one has gotten married and I wasn't there for either one of them. When I'm having an episode I just shut completely off and do not want to burden them with my shit so I withdrow. Eventhough I really mean well and I really love my friends but I'm a shitty person like that. Someone could've died for god's sake and I wouldn't have known. One of them just plain told me that she decided to not contact me anymore since she feels the effort is one sided and I totally get it and she's right if you ask me. Alright I have serious issues yes with depression and anxiety and other things, but don't we all ? I baby myself and just let myself avoid life but this time it really was a slap in my face. poeple who really care for you are not always going to be here. Life happens, good things and shitty things happen but if I keep being selfcentered and just take all of that for granted I'll lose them all.

I say I'd call but then be super anxious and don't. I deactivate my social media accounts because I feel like shit. I close my phone because I'm afraid to get a call. I disable notifications of my emails because I'm afraid to receive one. I delay sending my work till after the deadline because I'm too concerned about what they would thing of me and see me as incompetent and that fucked my studies up.

38,"I've never posted here. I made a reddit just so I can post here. i dont expect anyone to reply. just a place to put my thoughts down. 

im growing tired of my depression. ive been diagnosed with severe chronic depression since i was 9. im 21 now. it hasnt gotten better. 

my whole life all i remember is being upset. my heart breaking all day every day. 

let me tell you about my life after 9. so i moved away from my hometown when i was 9, which was really shocking for me and i feel like what caused my depression. when we got to the new place, my skin started to lose pigment in patches, i started to lose my hair, i wasnt social anymore, and my anxiety was on the edge. 

then i moved again. i was still quiet. still tired. didnt get stimulated in this place like i used to (i used to be super bright, super smart. even argued the concept of gravity between magnetospheres before NASA talked about it a few years later) 
this time when i moved, i began self harming. i dont know why. it just ran across my mind to start cutting myself. so i started cutting patterns into my wrists, an X on the back of my hand. Slowly, i started carving words onto my thigh whenever my emotions would get too intense. i also began starving myself during this time. not because i thought i was super fat (though ive always been insecure about being curvy), i just hated eating in front of people.

then i attempted suicide three times in a day on impulse. i had no plans. i was hospitalized for a month. it didnt help. i just got tired of being there. so i convinced them i was better and left.

then i moved back to my hometown because my parents were afraid of what people (like relatives) would say if they found out i killed myself. so we just isolated back to my hometown. 

i was put on suicide watch in the eighth grade, and after that ive stopped trusting psychs and therapists. 
high school was a mess. i met my abuser online and started dating her. i have a whole timeline of what she did to me too because she kept gaslighting me and saying nothing ever happened. lemme know if yall want it. 
but throughout this relationship, i was neglected. yelled at. called a whore for being bisexual, her trying to convince me i was a lesbian and not bi, her family being racist and hating me. even to the point where she encouraged me to carve the words ""sorry"" and ""whore"" into my thigh and laughed at me when i failed my suicide attempt again.
my eating disorder began to worsen. i would throw up my food in the shower, run 10 miles a day, eat 200 calories a day. but i was still chubby and curvy. and not the ""normal body curvy"" i mean im 5,4"" and i was 180-190lbs. 

move forward five years of me crying every night for five years, i finally met a guy, H ill call him. he convinced me to leave her, saying my honor (im pashtun) wasnt worth someone abusing me. so i left. but he ended up using me for nudes and then ghosting me when i asked for more. which i get it, i dont blame him. 

fast forward, i would get panick attacks every day at university (im premedicine). i still managed to get good grades (had to retake chemistry though because  my proff failed all her students (only 5 passed with a C-)).

i also started talking to my current boyfriend during this time. i was infatuated with him. hes gentle, very very gentle. hes soft and sweet. hes patient. he mever yells, he never gets angry, and hes always there for me. he does more for me than iever ask for. and its hard to accept that i'm being treated right because here i was thinking that im the abusive one when all i needed was someone to care for me. 

he has me listening to love songs every day, he has me drawing hearts on my papers, he gives me butterflies each time he kisses me (yes through the mic, we're long distance). and despite all of this, i feel like im not good enough for him. 

fast forward to summer break. i tried tk kill myself again, this time without cutting. i overdosed on my antidepressants. i ended up going to the hospital 4 hours after i overdosed. my oxygen was at 40-50%, i was having seizures, i was close to passing out. my mom kept me awake the whole time. the ER doctors said it was a miracle i survived. the nurses kept calling me princess jasmine because of my hair (voluminous, long, black). one nurse called me sweetheart. i felt so loved. 

i came back home with heart problems, any time i would get anxious, my arm would start hurting, my heart would get sharp pains, and i would begin to faint. 
i also came back home with a diagnoses in bulimia and severe chronic depression, and he told me to go get screened for borderline personality disorder and PMDD (i attempt suicide or am very suicidal three days before my period) 

so the only thing that helped me was watching unnas annus and 39daph and markiplier. theyre all my safe space.

but now that i'm here. currently. i wanted to kill myself again. im in therapy. and shes great. i love her a lot. but i just feel like im not in the place i want to be.

i used to be smart, and now im not getting the best grades (i have Bs and Cs, and the one C im concerned about is chemistry lab, because i feel like i wont pass) 

my self harm has become frequent again. music doesnt help me anymore (music is the only way i can explain my feelings when theyre too intense). 

and i just think about how i want to go into everything and nothing as my career. im really good at math and engineering. im also really good at science and medicine and biology. im also really good at singing and writing. 

and overall, i wish i could go into making my own music and being successful. but a) i dont think id get anywhere and b) i dont know where i would start. 

i dont know. im tired of this constant ache in my heart and head (migraine for the past three weeks). its been about 12 years and all ive been getting is worse. 

so is life really worth it at this point?",12Nov2020,1
39,"It's been getting bad and every time it does, I go to my boyfriend. He's pretty much the only person I have who supports me and makes me feel okay.

Or he did and just didn't care. Usually when he notices I'm getting \*sad\* he checks up on me and is just all round even sweeter and more patient with me.

44,"Hi everyone, I am a 19F at wits end and am reaching out for some support. I am a second year student at community college and have had a traumatic year. Long story short, I ended up dropping out of the University of Washington in January due to both health and financial reasons. I started my community college in February 2020 however, COVID-19 put us in lockdown by March 25. On April 1st, I broke my jaw and underwent major surgery which ended up with my jaw wired shut for a month. I lost so much weight during this time and my appetite practically died. Its been a months-long struggle trying to eat and gain weight. In June, I started developing some pretty severe anger issues (at one point even getting into a psychical altercation with my dad). I thought moving out of the house would fix these issues so I moved to Santa Barbara to do online school from there. My doctor put me on remeron but Kaiser Permanente (my insurance) is so shitty that I can barely access any mental health care. They schedule one therapy session every 4-6 weeks and my psychiatrist is barely accessible. I've been going on and off these meds. I had to move back home last week because my roommates were being very mentally abusive and i couldn't take it anymore. Also worth mentioning that my psychiatrist thinks I have mild OCD due to intrusive thoughts and my behaviors.

I am trying to transfer to a top school, hopefully UCLA. My parents want me to transfer to a top school as do I. However, I just can't fucking do this anymore. I need help. I have a calculus exam tomorrow and have spent the whole week staring at the ceiling. I am a top student with great grades but my brain feels like its stopped functioning. I just cry all day and sit in bed or drive around crying. I don't know how to be a student while mentally stunted like this.¬†Please someone help me I don't know what to do. I don't have good healthcare and my family is going through parent separation and i can't keep burdening them like this. Please help. Any advice on how to study while depressed would help. Literally any help on how to get out of this. I think about dying every day but I know I can't because I love my family. If I fail my calc exam tomorrow I won't forgive myself. It will bomb my grade and fuck my chances at transferring anywhere. Please how do I study when my brain just won't work.",12Nov2020,1
45,"I‚Äôm pretty desperate at this point, I‚Äôm so done with everything. I have no one so I‚Äôm pretty much forced to put my bullshit on the Internet. Everything feels like a shit ton worse since I left inpatient. I‚Äôm trying and absolutely no one in my life understands how difficult it is for me to continue going another day feeling like this. I feel like saying fuck it to all the medication and therapy it just feels like it‚Äôs useless and I‚Äôm useless.I feel like a constant burden to everyone and everything and like I have no other purpose. My heart is so heavy and full of complete sadness and no matter how I try to relieve it I‚Äôm left feeling empty. I feel so done and as if I should just disappear. I‚Äôm hurting so bad and it feels like it never ends.",12Nov2020,1
47,"I was heading into a relapse of depression anyway, then ran out of some of my medication and didn‚Äôt get it again for a few days which has made things worse. 

I forgot how shit this is, I look at everything differently. It all looks hopeless now. Looking at things in my room (even random things like a window or wardrobe) make me feel guilty and undeserving and everything just feels so empty and sad. I feel so bad about myself as well and even though I know I want to want certain things I just don‚Äôt right now and that‚Äôs really frustrating. 

I can‚Äôt sleep properly, I can‚Äôt be bothered making food, I can‚Äôt get the energy to shower, everything around me is a mess, I don‚Äôt want to see anyone, or do anything at all. Nothing I do feels good, or even real. Even though I‚Äôm not suicidal at the moment I feel a similar hopelessness of what‚Äôs the point. 

I just hate this feeling, I hate that things that were planned to happen before I started feeling like this are still going to happen but who wants to do those things basically isn‚Äôt even here right now. Right now I just don‚Äôt care. I am seeing friends I haven‚Äôt seen in so long tomorrow, should be excited but don‚Äôt care. Have a job interview in a few days and it would be incredible if I got the job, but I want to cancel it because I can‚Äôt face them right now. 

I am seeing my psychologist in a week but if anyone has any advice or anything on how to do basic things while feeling like this I would appreciate it a lot. 

Thank you for reading this and even if you don‚Äôt reply I hope you are okay and have a good day.",12Nov2020,1
48,"im sure that other balding men agree with me on this

balding is a terrible condition that these clowns or whatever they are from the medical and scientific field don't bother to take seriously

for me personally gradually losing my hair is a faith worse than cancer, or losing my limbs

i really hate anyone who is really ignorant regarding balding, especially those who did not experience it, yet they act as if its not a big deal

i seriously dont give a flying fuck about corona, the world falling into pieces or if the planet explodes

all i want is to have my hair back but since there is no viable cure im just like a cancer person waiting for my death

i hate my parents, grandparents, and my whole genealogical tree for putting this curse on me

i could never think about reproducing knowing that even if i would have 3 generations of daughters, there would still be a chance that a boy that could come by the fourth generation would inherit androgenetic alopecia and suffer just like im doing now

what kind of monster would want his own great grand child to be depressed because of the shit genes you knowingly transmit to him?

my ancestors have an excuse because they didnt have the knowledge we have access to nowadays, but i dont have any

so next time baldies, when you reproduce, think about your poor great great grankids and how they will suffer because of your own selfishness",12Nov2020,1

50,"TW: Suicide, abuse mentions, dissociation mention.

I just got out of a hospital after an episode of psychosis left me really suicidal. I live with a relative who also deals with depression. I‚Äôm still dealing with paranoia now and then. I have PTSD from long-term abuses of diff types and from diff people.

I just mentioned about a family friend who committed suicide years ago, not about her suicide but just about her death. I had a dream of her dying young, years before she actually died. 

This encourages her to go on a tirade about ‚Äúit is said that people who commit suicide are selfish‚Äù. I argued finding the middle ground and throw perception from someone who deals with suicidal thoughts now and then. That people who deal with severe mental illness crisis don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù facts or emotions = facts. I told her to never say that to me again. 

I‚Äôm not actively suicidal but passive, depressed and dissociative. Going to try to smoke (it helps) and play RDR2.",12Nov2020,1

53,"Kind of a long story but kinda not i guess. 

4 years ago I went to the doctor for help. They asked what was wrong. I straight up told them that I wake up some mornings wanting to die. And he looked me straight in my eyes and laughed. That day I almost ended it all.  Then 2 years ago when my son was born i had an allergic reaction to food that almost killed me. After that I was fine. But 1 month after my first reaction I had food that was cross contaminated and I almost died then to. So for 2 years I've had really bad nonstop anxiety towards everything I eat, wondering when it'll happen again. I can't take it anymore. I've lost over 125 pounds from not eating like I should. And to add more fire to my deep depression state I'm in. With this covid thing going around. My girlfriend thinks just because there is a 99% survival rate everything is gunna be ok. Well since it started I've been fearing it and keeping myself as safe as possible. But she hasn't. She knows how much this whole thing has been bothering me. But she still didn't wear a mask. I've  been having breathing problems the past week and a bad fever a couple days ago. Well today she tested positive. And I'm not stupid we live together so I know I have it. And my biggest fear is being put on ventilation. And losing my life that way. Which in turn I can beat it before it beats me. Yes I know I could easily survive just like other people have. But in the front of my mind. I always feel like bad shit is gunna happen. And 90% of the time I have a bad feeling it always happens. I'm so tired and I just want it all to end. I can't do this anymore. 


You don't have to reply. I'm not looking for pity. 

I needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it will get better and maybe ill be gone. Who knows.  But I know the hotline number. But i don't trust anybody since the doctor. 

If you read this. Thank you for listening and I hope you have a good rest of your day. Take care.",12Nov2020,1
55,"Not sure what‚Äôs been going on with me lately but I feel extra sad. 

I haven‚Äôt had suicidal thoughts since I was 16 (10 years ago) but now they‚Äôre back.

The only difference between now and then is I don‚Äôt actually want to die now. I don‚Äôt have plans on taking my life and I want to get better.

I want to live and experience things but sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre in a rut you can‚Äôt get out of and this is the way life will always be. 

I don‚Äôt want to die, but I don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore. 

I feel like I need to hear from others who have gone through what I‚Äôm going through now. 

Please share your success stories to give me some hope",12Nov2020,1
57,"Hey everyone, I'm new here on Reddit and I can here to ask for help, because one of my friends got helped on here and it actually helped her a lot. I've been feeling bad for the past 4 years and I've had some serious bad times, I was feeling so sad and so down for so long, ended up hurting myself which also resulted in a suicide attempt...I tried to talk about it with some of my friends who have depression and really have been diagnosed with it, but they all me that I probably have something really bad going on with my mental health and that I should consider talking about it with a professional, someone who knows what might be going in with me, and maybe even see if I truly am in depression or not...The problem is that I just don't know where to start, where to look for help and where to find the right people... I don't know if this might help, but it is always worth a try. I've seen how such posts helped others, how it even helped my friend, and I have faith that maybe one day I'll get helped aswell",12Nov2020,1
58,"I‚Äôm depressed, close to suicidal. I‚Äôve been depressed for close to 2 years now. And before that I was depressed for a year some years ago.

Last time I was depressed, my parents found out and rushed me to the hospital because I was going to kill myself. I had detailed plans and I knew what time, how and where I would do it. However my parents just knew I was planning to do it, and when urged by the doctors to tell what I had planned I said I didn‚Äôt have anything specific planned.

This resulted in my problem not being urgent, however I got a psychiatrist a week later. To this psychiatrist I also never really talked about the issues I had. And after a couple of months I faked being better to the point where I started believing it myself. That was 4 years ago and I believe I never really got better since then.

Now in 2020 I‚Äôve been depressed since late 2018, I‚Äôve contemplated suicide multiple times, but no one knows and I know I can‚Äôt ever do it. I‚Äôm filled to the brim with guilt over lying to my family that I‚Äôm not depressed anymore, because I know if they find out, I will cause so much sadness between them. 

A couple days ago my mother asked me if they hadn‚Äôt found out about my suicidal plans if I would have gone through with it. I felt as usual unbelievably guilty and of course told her that I don‚Äôt know as I don‚Äôt remember much from the time. A lie, I would‚Äôve gone through with it and no one but me knows. I wish I had gone through with it, because I‚Äôm not strong enough to do it anymore.

I know I need help, I know I do. But my mind is 100% that nothing is going to help, I know talking won‚Äôt help, because it feels that my depression and my thoughts is a literal part of me, it feels as if this IS me. It feels like my depression is a part of me and that if it‚Äôs ripped away from me I have nothing left.

I don‚Äôt really get happy anymore, I used to love gaming, I still do it, but it doesn‚Äôt bring me joy, it‚Äôs just a time filler. I hang out with friends but only because I hope it will change something inside me. I only ever feel content or alone...

I‚Äôve started thinking I might have anxiety as well, I hate social situations, I feel trapped when I‚Äôm at family gatherings or anything else with people I‚Äôm not comfortable with (unless I‚Äôm drunk). I avoid any situation where I have to talk on the phone with people. And I feel awkward at everything I do, and it feels like everyone is watching me...

At the same time, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just self diagnosing a 100 different things, I feel like no one would believe me and I feel like I need to prove myself constantly. I feel like a fraud and a failure.

I often dream of becoming a professional at gaming, I know I have a high potential, and I know I could reach that potential if i had energy, and if I had motivation, and if I had fun. I have a chance to reach this potential in half a year. But I know I won‚Äôt be able to because depression keeps destroying everything I want, it puts a literal block in front of me and my wishes. 

I want to get help, I really do, but I can‚Äôt. If my family learn I‚Äôm depressed it will destroy them, and they won‚Äôt trust me since I‚Äôve been lying to them. If I tell my friends then they will feel helpless, and if I somehow get a psychologist without anyone knowing, I have no idea how to tell the truth. I don‚Äôt know how to trust anyone.

I know this has been a long rant. This is just some of the things that runs through my head 24/7 and I felt the need to write them down. I hope someone has anything to say, as I just hope I can get an outsiders input. Sorry.",12Nov2020,1
