1,"I am sarcastic, cynical, quick to tease and the first to see flaws in everything and everyone around me. Even if I keep it inside, I feel and think these poisonous things. Im quick-tempered, easily annoyed and hard to excite. Im the kind of person that looks at Christmas and thinks first and foremost of corporate manipulation. Someone who sees a couple in love and thinks of the skeletons in their closets, and how one must secretly have one foot out of the door. Someone who sees a pregnancy announcement and thinks of overpopulation and the unpaid and under-appreciated near-slave-labor that is motherhood, and how the kids will grow to deeply resent their parents over the small and ultimately very human mistakes they make in trying to navigate raising their own home-grown human for the first time.

I see girls who are light and airy who seem to move and exist and flow like water. Girls who smile and giggle easily and have big bright eyes and cry over hallmark movies and call their dogs silly names and make baby voices at them. Girls who dont have to practice smiling in the mirror or do weekly vocal exercises to sound more animated, or try to make themselves feel anything by exposing themselves to shocking media. Girls who turn hardships into personal strength and it doesnt break them because they were secure in themselves to begin with or had the support they needed to move past it. Girls/Women who are rich with ideas and hobbies and enjoy them to enjoy them, not to prove anything to anyone or to themselves. Girls who dont feel any type of bitterness towards other women because they are perfectly content with themselves and just want the same for everyone else. Girls who dont have to try so hard. I relate a lot to robots and ghosts. I like to draw them a lot in my art because I see myself in them. Ghosts: Invisibility, suffering, stuck in the past, haunting lost loves, scaring people away. Robots: Faking emotions, not feeling quite human, being used, being manipulated, feeling lost.

I used to be one of those “Me vs Other girls” girls, and I find that that actually never changed; its just that im more self aware now. I understand that the me vs other girls and putting down other women was born from this deep seated self hatred and feeling socially outcasted and that those other girls I hated for being “shallow” were actually just people I envied because they had what I wanted. They were accepted and generally happy. I understand that life is difficult for everyone, but from the outside I sensed something in them that I lacked. I was complex, fat, ugly, “weird” and disliked. I had no friends. Nobody wanted to sit with me or partner with me on projects. I had severe social anxiety, I was “depressing”, I wasn’t sociable or cool. I still feel that way. I put those girls down in my head and the internet. ie My depression made me complex. Their mental health made them shallow and boring. My poor grades and their academic success was a matter of school failing those of us with a different kind of genius. My odd interests were cutting edge and theirs were basic. But now Ive stripped the veil away from the bs I was spewing as a hurt child. My brain was doing what it could to keep me upright when I felt deep down that I was an inherently defective human being. I took the things I hated most about myself and spun them into a story about how misunderstood and special I must be to be so “othered”. “Main character syndrome”. How else do you survive knowing that there isnt a soul around you that understands you, or even sees you? How do you cope with an unbearable loneliness? You pretend youre the center of the world.

I forgive myself for that, but it doesn’t matter, because nothing has really changed. Im still that person, Im just not a child anymore. I just want to be a loving, kind person. I want to be the “other girls”. I dont want to be this selfish jaded asshole, but I think maybe thats just me at this point. I dont know how to heal from everything that’s happened in my life. It feels cruel that if you get off to a bad start in life it just seems to snowball from there into all these events that just make you worse. And at some point youre told to start taking responsibility for it. Not that I disagree, it just hurts and is confusing. I just want to be that person that is loved and happy makes everyone happy. The person that, when they die, people say they “lit up any room” or “touched everyone they met”. Instead, I feel like a burden and a drag. A person thats destined to suffer, cause someone else to suffer, or be alone. Lately Ive been choosing to be alone, and I think its working for me. I was really hoping to find love in this life.",26Dec2020,1
2,"This has been the year from hell. I really wanted it to be a good Christmas. I feel really out of it right now, so this may be sloppy compared to my usual writing. 

I’ve had depression and anxiety for years. This year has been the worst. I went through losing family members, a horrible breakup with the person I thought I was going to marry, losing my 4.0 as a senior in college, many health issues, nearly losing my dog, and I’m running out of money to support myself. 

I have been doing everything I can to get help. I have a therapist, I’m on a cocktail of medications, I have a therapy dog, I participate in yoga, yet I’m still so incredibly unhappy. I suffer from fear of abandonment and I constantly feel so alone. I’ve gone on a few dates with no luck as I’m looking for more than just a hook up. 

I was finally starting to do a bit better when I decided to go home for Christmas. 

My parents were always neglectful and emotionally abusive to me growing up. Because of this I have severe anxiety and I am a people pleaser. Although my parents, especially my mom, have caused me so much pain, I wanted to go home for Christmas. I used my credit card to buy everyone meaningful gifts and drove 4 hours home to see my family. It didn’t take long for things to go south. 

The harsh criticism and unkind words began early on. My parents promised me that if I came home from the holidays my extended family members - drug addicts that caused me severe trauma - would not be there. And guess who showed up. I got so upset that I had a panic attack and had to leave to come home. I spent Christmas alone. 

I upset my parents by leaving and feel like I ruined Christmas. I cried the entire 4 hours home. I feel so worthless and alone and I have no idea where to go from here. The last time I felt this low I went to my doctor and ended up seeing a crisis counselor, but I don’t know if it’ll do any good and I don’t want to end up institutionalized. I can’t get out of bed. I can’t eat. I feel sick. I am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t have a family to go to, or a boyfriend, or even a close friend. I am graduating college soon, and I feel like I have missed out on so much. I crave human connection. 

I don’t even know what to write for a TL:DR and I feel like this has just turned into me complaining. 

I just want to feel better and be happy.",26Dec2020,1
3,"So for the past 3 years I've been having patterns of consistent ups and downs. At a point I wanted to get a test to see if I had bipolar because everything was getting too intense for me. I did not get a test because doctors said I didn't apply to the necessary things for bipolar to have and I believe them. I do not have mania episodes. I do not act impulsively or do risky behaviour in a state of mania, I do experience the depression part of it though. Every few weeks or days or hours I get a huge dip in mood and I can go from completely fine and relaxed to the world is ending and it's all my fault.

Recently the dips have been happening daily and it's emotionally exhausting and I know alot about mental health and stuff like that and I can't see anything that makes sense for me. I can go from completely fine and stable to extremely depressed and unstable. People have told me it's related to my period and I will admit that a good amount is, but I will be so far from my period and it still happens, it just gets more intense around that time of the month.

I recently experienced a trigger from out of nowhere where I was arguing about something and a close person to me texted the word ""fight"" I had an immediate fight/flight/freeze response and it was immediate tears and intense panic and I was in a public space so I choked it down well enough to be able to go without making a big deal out of it. I have abandonment issues as well as attachment issues (being clingy/very codependent on someone) and it's becoming so upsetting to me because I keep ruining relationships. I did not have anything traumatic happen to me that I know of in my early childhood and I had a relatively good childhood but as puberty came I became emotionally parentified. I take medication for severe social anxiety and depression which greatly affects my mood. I have seen many therapists (CBT method) and nothing ever worked. I have difficulty coping and it's just getting worse and worse as the years go on and when it comes to suicidal behaviour I more so imagine being non existent. I will not commit suicide even if I feel this way. 

I want to know if I should look for something specific like a mood disorder or if there's a type of therapy offered to adolescences that I can look out for. This is affecting my everyday life constantly. If anyone knows anything that sounds like what I've been experiencing I would appreciate being educated. Thank you for reading.",26Dec2020,1

6,"We had our family here and he just stayed in his room and ignored anything. He is 26 and since graduating high school just sits in his room playing videogames. Sleeps all day up all night. He only comes out when no one is around. Leaves the house at best 1-2 times a year. Mostly to buy weed im sure as he is always high. My mom will leave him leftovers in the fridge he eats at 3am. 

Fine as long as he is happy but I peeked in his room when he was on the toilet and there was a pile of trash 3-4 feet high. Paper plates all with rotting food, tissues, garbage. All over his soiled sheets, rotting peas and crust spilling off of plates onto his bed. Window open in the winter with a fan blowing the putrid stench outwards. The pile of trash he sits next to gaming literally he same height as him, thats how bad it is. 

What can I do? Im gonna try to tell him to clean it but its clearly a symptom of deep issues.",26Dec2020,1
7,"I try to be grateful for all that I have, and I don't ask for much in return. I don't have any money to my name, and I'm doing my best in studies and whatnot.

I told my parents before that I just needed a cheap car to get me to and from school, but instead, I got an amazing subaru forester that they financed for 15 grand. I felt like utter shit and undeserving of it for days.

I told my sister that I just needed like decent cheap earbuds for Christmas around the $10-$15 range, but I instead got $70 earbuds that are amazing.

On another occasion, I just wanted an ok mic for discord or skype calls. At most like $30 or so, but my dad got me one that cost like $300.

The thing in common with all of these gifts are that I truly feel undeserving of them. A lot of things I use, I use just normally or casually. I don't feel the need to get the best of anything. I like to use cheap reliable stuff. Over time, I learn to love and appreciate these gifts, but I almost always become depressed and I feel undeserving of these items as well. I can't even give anything in return.

My family is always on the verge of financial destruction, and I don't want to add to that strain to the best of my ability. I rarely ask for food I like or to go on trips that cost much money. I'm ok with going to the park or a friends house or staying at home.

Several other factors at play here such as the fact that I hate myself, but I've been in therapy for a while making strides. I would just like some advice as this Christmas made me extremely depressed with these nice gifts, and I'm putting a facade of love and appreciation.

Any help is appreciated :)",26Dec2020,1

10,"Hello :)

I’ve been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder recently and I’ve just started trying to get help for mental health stuff. 

~The question I have is, does it ever get better? 

I’ve felt pretty much how I feel now for as long as I can remember (about 10 years I don’t have an awfully great memory). I only just realized that routinely thinking of suicide is not the norm but I’ve wanted to die for, well as long as I can remember. I am 20 now, I’m exhausted and I’ve tried everything I could possibly think of but I’ve really just been getting worse.

I’m a student and I have a really hard time keeping up with medication and therapy payments, and I’ve just become completely exhausted. I’m just worried that all the work I put towards getting better will amount to nothing (just off of the pattern of all my other solutions). 

I don’t want to be happy, I just want to feel okay. Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you :)

11,"Hi I'm 24 y/o. Lately I've been feeling so bad, to a level that i just don't know how to function as a normal human being. I'm sad all the time, i feel like if i have a rock on my stomach and that feeling of constant worry and fear doesn't go away with anything, except alcohol, wich i know it's not a good idea (I stoped drinking bc i know it would make everything worse). 

This isn't regular sadness, this feel awfully wrong, i want to cry almost all day, and the only way i can get a little peace to my heart is when I'm sleeping, therefore i want to sleep all day, i need help, i need someone who tells me how to stop this and make things better. I don't want to die, but how can i live like this? I've been thinking this so much and I really don't like it, so i try to not to think this and ignore it but it is always in the back of my mind. I've even noticed that i try to remember something, like, something specific, and i can't, it's like i have no memory.

In the past few months it was like i had no feelings at all, I don't know why, I don't like it  but at least i was fully energetic and could enjoy things like a little break in the sun or watch tv, but now, absolutely nothing seems interesting and i don't want to do nothing. The only thing i can do now with some energy is travel to see my boyfriend on the weekends, it's like he is capable of shut down a little those feelings, but then he fall sleep and I'm in bed, spiraling in my mind and just want to cry, then i go back home and everything is bad again.

 Yesterday i went to a Christmas party, and got druk and it was ok while i was waisted, but the I started to feel worse and worse. 
I've always been a person a little maniac, I mean, it's something normal in me worrying about things, but not like this. 

 I can't talk to someone about this, and absolutely don't want to talk about this with my boyfriend. Something else, i really don't have any money to go to therapy and where i am there isn't free resources to help me with this. I need please please if someone can help me, give me some advice or anything. I don't know what else to do, here is my only hope",26Dec2020,1

15,"OK, so I guess this is an expansion on the classic panic attack ""focus on a few sounds, smells, visuals etc."" (which I've also personally found useful in various situations).

Setting: car passenger so there was plenty of stimulus; I needed to clear my head and focus on the now as I was kinda stuck in the usual thought whirlpool. Basically I tried concentrating on individual objects around me e.g. 'apartments', and then label as many synonyms or associated words before it passed by (Tower block, high rise, concrete...). By repeating this over and over, with objects varying from grassland to the dashboard in front of me I somehow managed to return to the present, and actually ended up feeling a lot more 'present' than I have been for a few weeks.

Not sure if this helps anyone else, but hoping it might. Planning to try it out next time I take the train as my headphones world is comforting but can occasionally stray into melancholic territory 

Does anyone else have any similar techniques or experiences btw? Putting this under inspiration as I'm kinda interested to see if there's any verifiable cognitive processes behind it.

18,"So I've been feeling negative for about 3 years now. 3 years ago I started high school so maybe that has something to do with it. But I don't like my favourite food anymore, i hate being outside because of what people might think of me (mainly cause im 5'8 and indian so thats pretty much the worst of it). It's really gross but I stopped having showers everyday because I cant be bothered. Every time my mum calls me to do something I get really moody and when I'm finished I just go to my room and cry. My curtains and windows stay closed everyday and I have no intention of opening it. At night, I never sleep so I end up sleeping in the middle of the day. I don't have a girlfriend and I'm 16 so that's pretty shameful. I used to play so many video games. Make fun of me if you want but I used to enjoy playing fortnite alot. There's this creeping fear that I'll never grow physically or mentally. I'm scared that I'll never get married or have kids. I don't know whether I'm over thinking things or maybe I have anxiety. I don't plat games that much on my phone anymore. I used to love anime so much and I used to enjoy the storyline and events. Now when I watch anime I just think of how badly I want to be the main character or have their abilities. Because its better than being me. A 5'8 ugly kid who's scared of everything. Sometimes I just lay down for hours thinking about how my life would be if I was the main character. No family, no school, no future problems. Just me, my imaginary girlfriend, my imaginary friends, and me being the hero of that imaginary world. The worst part is I have real life friends. Although I feel like they're friends with me out of pity. So yeah that's all I can think of. You don't have to respond to this because I just needed to tell someone about all this.

I want to be clear as well I will not accept any judgments or insults so if you wish to hurt my feelings, don't waste your time because I have none. Anyway, I've been on this earth for 19 years and it's been a wild ride. But most of it has been 1 traumatic experience after another and it's all caught up to me. I've never felt so alone as I do these days, even when I have a supportive family, the best partner I could ask for and supportive friends too, I still feel alone. All the things that have happened to me I wonder why they happened, but I'm left here just feeling like I wish each of them had killed me. I've been through many things like abuse, assault, robbery, suicidal thoughts, self harm and separation to name a few. Through most of my life I was bullied by most people, couple that with a fatherless home and an abusive stepfather I have some serious abandonment issues. I've never felt like I belonged and I'm always scared that everyone in my life is going to leave as well. Constant fear of being left alone but also being surrounded. The trauma from my assault and my robbery both make me really insecure when it comes to social interaction and it confuses me because it's like there's a constant duality of wanting to be alone but wanting to have company. I'm always confused, I'm always lonely and I'm always thinking about ending my life or hurting myself.

I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didn't understand where it was coming from.

This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year.

OK, so I want to know what happens in your everyday life. Please comment if you can. I wanna hear it. 

For me, it’s waking up late at 12PM. Sometimes not eating on time. Use my phone for 9+ hours, if not, play a video game, or video games for 9+ hours for the day. Eat food, maybe shower. Poop and piss. Sleep late. Procrastinate homework. This is for the holiday break or if there is no school. 

If there is school, it’s just the same except I wake up at 7AM and go to online class and do the same things after school. There’s no fun and mental stimulation. Are your days just like mine? It’s super sad.

Do I have to live like this until the end of 2021? It’s sad to see so many people in my country are fine with this. Like I don’t see any sad people or any rants with living like this.

Plus life is dog-shit in my country. My main goal in life is to leave this country and settle in a first world country so I can be happy, no joke. You can’t do anything here, they say it’s more fun here but it’s not. My future doesn’t look bleak or bright. Just normal, my grades are awful. There has been some tiny progress on bettering it though.

Also, time is sooo fast. It’s been so faster since the start of quarantine. It’s crazy. Time flies so fast because of the monotonous activities I do. This contributes to my sadness. 1 second kinda translates to 3 seconds. Some months feel faster than others. :(

I think quarantine has taken a toll on my mental health, maybe physical health too. 

I watched a movie again for the first time since April 2020 in December, I actually watched 3 movies so far in December 2020. I kinda just spontaneously watched a movie with my family which is pretty cool.


Last thing I’ll say, Christmas was kinda depressing. It ended so quickly. I wish it snowed here. How was your Christmas?

38,"I’ve recently been pushed very hard by my therapist to persue medication, and I was wondering what options you guys used and what worked best.

I am concerned about the side effects and also general impact it has on your wellbeing. I’m mostly scared of having a negative reaction which can be quite devastating emotionally apparently. 

Also if it matters I live in Australia",26Dec2020,1

These videos depict the physical manifestations of mental illnesses and the wide variety of struggles that people face on a daily basis. This is a great resource for friends and family who don’t understand what you’re going through, and it is a helpful reminder that you are not alone.",26Dec2020,1

42,"When I say all I want is what I’ve **WORKED** for, how does that mean come up with an excuse?

When I say I’ve worked 20 years in order to achieve a career as a professional opera singer, how does that mean “you need mental health resources”?  

When I ask what would be so terrible about giving me what I’ve worked for, why does that mean avoid the question?  

When I say I have suicidal tendencies because of **SOMEONE ELSE PROVOKING THEM**, how does that mean send the mobile crisis unit to come after ME, instead of send the police to come after THEM?

Obviously we seem to be having some problems with our fucking ENGLISH LANGUAGE motherfuckers!!  Either everyone speaks a completely different language from English, or something about the things coming out of my mouth translate into something ELSE!  So what’s the problem!?!?",26Dec2020,1

44,"""In a small study of adults with major depression, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers report that two doses of the psychedelic substance psilocybin, given with supportive psychotherapy, produced rapid and large reductions in depressive symptoms, with most participants showing improvement and half of study participants achieving remission through the four-week follow-up.""

Not improvements, REMISSION!

45," I use to be very active in middle school (sports, hanging with friends,  ect...). High School came along and I lost touch with pretty much  everyone and never said a word in classes for all 4 years. Once I got my  first job I felt much better and felt I was living a normal life. Then  gradually 6 years later I noticed little things changing like being more  anxious and panicky, especially driving. I use to drive everywhere and  had no issues. Every year has been gradually worse since than and the  best way to describe my symptoms is that my mind feels like it has  receded, like its exposed or something. I also am beginning to question  reality and if I moving parts of my body. I have had MRI'S and CAT scans  and everything turns back normal.  On top of this, the worsening of  symptoms has restricted me to staying home because of the now fear of  driving and panic attacks and being afraid of night. ANY HELP or  GUIDANCE as to what this could be??? greatly appreciated!",26Dec2020,1
46,"Context: I (20M) have had depression symptoms since 14, but began medications at 18. Family doesn't know. A select few friends know, but none are really my source of support and comfort. 

The holiday season always gets me in a more depressive mood, but with covid im able to slip further into it. I live 45 min from my fam in an apartmemt by my school's campus. I rarely go home; before Christmas i hadnt been back since July. But I'm sleeping excessively (around 12 hrs), I spend my day watching tv. im not good with group chats and my friends arent good at convos with just me. i just don't want to get stuck. how can i stay motivated on a daily?

i may go to the gym, but that's all i got at the moment 

any tips would be helpful",26Dec2020,1
47,"I went to the emergency room Saturday night for SI. I was in denial. I went to the emergency room my husband worked at and he made me promise I'd be honest. So I was. I told them about my accidental overdose on my medication (10/10 don't recommend), and how it was office gossip the next day. How my manager accused me of making myself sick on purpose and said I can't he breaking down at work, that patient's can't he seeing that. (I was in my car, on my lunch break.) How my manager said they were trying to accommodate my illnesses but I was making it too hard. (Sorry wall of text.)

I ended up in a psych hospital because I was ""gravely disabled."" The hospital didn't even keep me 72 hours because they said ""this is a place to get psychiatric help, not run away from work and life.)

As soon as I got discharged I called my therapist office on Tuesday and they got me in a house called Respit. It's run by people who work for my therapist/psychiatrist office. They don't care what you do, it literally let's your brain rest. They have an app through the office called My Strengths. One of the questions was about writing your story, were you writing it or were you allowing others to write it. On my blog I wrote part of my story, but I blanked stuff out so I wouldn't hurt people's feelings. Stop caring! Those people did stuff to you to make you depressed/gave you PTSD! When I get discharged, hopefully tomorrow, I'm rewriting my story. The good, the bad, the ugly. I'm not blanking out names this time.

Draw, write in a journal, blog. Get these horribly, depressing feelings out of you. It's a start in the healing process. You may lose family and friends, but if they were really family and friends wouldn't they care about hearing your story, about why you were depressed?

So who's writing your story. You? Or people around you.",26Dec2020,1

49,"For context, I'm a recovering drug addict (303 days sober as of today), I have had chronic depression for 13 years. I've been on and off medication and I'm currently on 100mg sertraline. I've been having non-contact CBT due to COVID-19 (all online) for around 6 weeks and I'm planning to go private with therapy in January when I'll have a little more disposable income. 

One thing that I just can't seem to get back into my life is being able to see past today. I'm trying to think about what I want for myself in 2021, I've been sat here with a document open titled ""Goals"" trying to imagine what I want to achieve in my life and it feels like a physical barrier in my mind when I try to think, I just can't imagine what I want for myself. I wasn't always this way, until I was about 22 I used to plan out all these things I wanted to do and all these things I wanted to achieve, but I guess now I haven't wanted anything for myself because.. Well, I just wanted to not be alive and all I've done is survive the day for years. I sometimes wonder how much damage my chronic drug use has done to my brain and if my inability to think complexly about the future is related to this. 

How, if you have experienced this, have you gotten past this? How have you gotten excited for your life again post-depression? Is this a sign that maybe my CBT and medication isn't helping as much as I thought? 

Any opinions or advice would be much appreciated, thank you.",26Dec2020,1
