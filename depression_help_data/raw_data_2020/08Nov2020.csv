My best guess is its because moms still alive, but who knows. If i  could die lets say ""not wake up tomorrow"" that would be awesome. Or maybe magically blink and time-skip to my last elderly breath, that would work too. Been reading a lot of Schopenhauer recently. Been hating myself as long as i can remember. Wish i had some sort of amnesia because i wish i could reset my memory every morning, because i regret every single choice I've made. Want to spend... or should i say will spend my future alone. A girlfriend is a waste of money and mental health. Kids are a crime, why would i want to bring life in this world? My parents are going to die, friends (if i will still have any) won't have time for me, so whats the point. Don't know what to do. I have no hobbies, i spend my day in from of a monitor. Don't see a future for myself. Push new (maybe even old) people away. Hate going outside. but somehow cant end it... what a life...",08Nov2020,1
1,"Hey, I know that sounds super pretentious and this is probably silly but I just...really want some advice. Im 16, and literally ever since primary ive never had and kept a friend...
I had one for a few years in primary...who'd been bullying me behind my back.
Im not touching secondary school Im already fully aware I need actual therapy and lots of it to even unpack that- but it ended up in a year of being a pariah
And now its not miserable like there but the divide is palpable. I try...I really try my best! To talk to people and form relationships and just...be noticed! Im loid and...everyone says I talk to much..
But...its starting to feel like im never gonna have friends...i have some online but its not the same when everyone around is doing fun things! And...you cant...youre always lonely...
Whenever i even entertain the THOUGHT I just start crying (which btw if theres typos in here its because of that reason haha..) and...please I just dont want tp accept that no one will like me..

Do i need to change myself or something?? Thanks in advance to anyone who reads",08Nov2020,1
2,"There was this girl I met a a high-school music program at a college I had gone to for years. This one year I meet this girl who I really enjoy talking with. I feel more comfortable talking with her then I do most of my friends. She is a 10/10 stunning and the thought of her being attracted to me never even crossed my mind. The teacher of one of the master classes keeps joking we should get together while helping us with music. I ignore it. There is no way this girl would like me. Welp. Last day of camp, she walks up to me, gives me her number, and tells me she loves me. And you know what I did? Because I‚Äôm retarded? I told her that my family didn‚Äôt want me to date at that age and I couldn‚Äôt. You know what was more frightening? She understood. And fucking gave me a kiss and told me to tell her if I ever changed my mind. For the next two fucking years I kept running into at multiple music events and NSSMA competitions and subsequent area all state choirs. And every time she saw me we talked and she‚Äôd ask me if I wanted to go out. But I was so brainwashed by my parents wishes that against my own brains wishes I‚Äôd say ‚Äúsorry, my family doesn‚Äôt want me to date at my age.‚Äù After that and my subsequent high school Graduation, I went I. To choose college. My Grandfather works on the stock market and for my college fund he made risky investments into tech during the 90‚Äôs, so there is enough to pay my whole college life. I know this is a blessing but I feel a pressure not to waste it but I personally have felt like an idiot my whole life. I am now in my freshman year taking a bunch of required classes I‚Äôm not interested in so I can hopefully start doing some classes I like next semester (biomedical prosthetics) but I‚Äôm just here sitting studying as everything I‚Äôve been interested in (music, voice acting, drawing, working out, I used to bench 235, now I‚Äôm a depressed string bean) fades away to reality of adult life and I‚Äôm just thinking of the opportunity I wasted.

12,"I'm 41yo and I have no life. I do have a wife and kids, but I feel so empty. My wife brushes away how I feel. I've been diagnosed with depression about 10 years ago, and it was determined I was since the age of 7. 

I used to be a successful photographer and musician. But because of my controlling and paranoid wife, I quit those and sold all of my gear. The money I got from those went to my sister who was about to be evicted and her electricity cut off. No regrets there.

 I tried to work in the corporate world, but was made to quit because of the hours I had to work. My wife is the sole breadwinner now and k have about $20 to my name. I don't ask money from my wife because that will trigger comments about me being lazy. I tried recently to find work, but since I've been out of work for more than 10 years, pickings have been slim. If I do find a job, my wife would say it pays too little and I shouldn't bother since she can provide for us all. 

I don't have many friends. The few friends I do have, I am usually barred from spending time with then because my wife would always say I should spend my free time with the family instead of friends. I do spend time with my family. 24/7 in fact. Because I have nowhere to go, and nothingand else to do. 

I took up leatherworking but once my materials ran out, I can't afford to buy new ones. If I ask my wife, she'll say it's a waste of money. I have hobbies to keep me sane, but once those need replacing or repairs, my wife will say money is best spent elsewhere. My laptop which I used for freelance work is now broken, and repairs will cost me $600.  Of course I don't have that kind of money and my wife is telling me I don't need it anyway.

I want to leave. I want to just end it all. But my kids are keeping me from doing so. If I do leave, I can split time with my kids but with no money or career, I don't know how I can survive. 

My life savings would have helped but I donated most to people who needed it more (people I know who live in squalor, for medicine, their kids' books, even for their kid's funerals, etc). I always felt it's just money. Money has never been something I've been too obsessed about. Sometimes I feel I might be too nice for my own good. Which is probably why I have no money left and why I always agree to whatever my wife says. A doormat? I guess so. 

The last of my savings now go to anti depressants and anti-anxiety pills. I'm on my last month before I can't afford any more. I spend 90% of my days in bed. Only getting up to eat and help my son with his homework.

I really want to end it all. I'm just waiting for my kid's to grow up so they won't need me anymore, then I'm gone. Been thinking about that for years. And when I do end it all, it pains me that all I have to leave my kids are my old guitar, my rusty leatherworking tools, and... Nothing else.",08Nov2020,1

14,"Ketamine Revealed the Truth and Now....

I am lost and just don‚Äôt know what to do.  Im not even sure what I need your help with. Ketamine worked and relieved my depression, but now I am left with the person I created.

I am in my mid fifties and have suffered from chronic acute depression my whole life.  I can summarize my level of depression with a quick anecdote. Two years ago I was sent to see a neuropsychiatrist to try to get help.  After a days worth of testing I had to wait two weeks for the results.  After conferring with his colleagues he brought me back in. Upon sitting in his office he looked at me and , and I‚Äôm not exaggerating or joking about this, he said, ‚Äúhow are you alive?‚Äù I was stunned.  He elaborated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to say it so bluntly, but in my 35 years of doing this I‚Äôve never met someone with you scores still around at your age.‚Äù

My whole life has been led under the black cloud of depression.  The sound track of my life was an endless loop of, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a loser, failure, piece of shit, waste of life, etc., from the second I woke until I went to sleep exhausted from living.  In light of this I accomplished great big things, had runs where I achieved, but always I would destroy my own victories so they fit my depressive beliefs about myself.  Even when things went right I was a complete fake, because no one want to follow the depressed guy, so I hid the real me from sight.

So ketamine took away the emotional drain, the nonstop voice of self-hatred, and the pervasive feeling of helplessness and doom. However, what is left behind is 55 years of bad habits, behaviors, a litany of fact based failures, poverty, inability to form relationships, and the list goes on.  A typical person finds it challenging to change one single behavior, I created 100‚Äôs. Now what the hell do I do? It's withering. I got a therapist, practice new habits, changed my diet and nutrition, quite smoking and hired a career advisor to help with my toxic resume to try to get a job.  Despite all this and being out from the black shrouded illusion of my existence, 1000 times a day I come face to face with the reality I creates. I'm just overwhelmed. It no loner is a artificial feeling of being hopeless, it's the hopeless reality of what I've created.",08Nov2020,1

I always suspected myself having depression and social anxiety but never really got it checked until I was forced to meet a psychologist due to work requirement.

Everything that happens, I blame it on my mental health. Nothing gets done, and I'm unable to do anything about it. Over the years, I have developed body dysmorphic disorder, and it is worsening. I can't find anything that I like about myself. It went as far as me changing the way I speak. I spent the last few months changing my pitch and tone to change my voice because I always hated it. I hate my ugly looks and I can't even remember the last time I looked in the mirror. Pandemic has helped me as I have to wear a mask. But that also means that I'm not removing my mask at all. I often skip meals in school just to avoid removing my mask.

21,"I'm not sure if anyone could relate because it doesn't seem like none of the people I know in real life do. I'm a guy in my mid 30s, feeling stuck in terms of everything that's important when it comes to living a good life - career's not going anywhere, not in a relationship (which I'm okay with, after being cheated on a couple of times, I'm okay and much happier being by myself), life is day in and day out merely a routine that I can't get out of (because of money mostly.

I also am in a worse financial state as well. 

I fear losing a lot of friendships and not being able to get back to a better, healthier lifestyle. I want to make a routine or figure something out that will bring me some structure but I'm not sure how to go about it.

23,"I got rid of toxic friends way before the pandemic begun as I figured that I rather be alone than to hang out with people who think of me only when there is no other option available.

I do not have close bond with my family and they live far away. I have few people with whom I write from time to time but these are not close relations (mostly long-distance relations or they are current/previous work colleagues, all kept out of courtesy).

So, there is 2020:

I've been diagnosed with dysthymia and social anxiety, had a suicide attempt last May. I see my therapist every two weeks, I am on meds and I attend (now online) group therapy.

I suppose to socialise and I am really envy of people having friends right now. I feel really lonely. I do not remember when was the last time when I have a good genuine laugh with other people. I always had a problem with connecting with others, but now it feels impossible.  I feel like I get forgetting how to speak with people. I know I can get online friends but I do not feel it's genuine - I am more comfortable online than in real life, I am simply different and I know other people can pretend they are someone else too. I have trust issues in general, so it's not easy for me to connect with others anyway. It seems impossible to make friends during pandemic, cause most of the places where I can find people are closed. Also, I am over 30ys so people my age have kids - they have other parents as friends and I do not plan to have kids at all. Or they somehow (how?!) kept their childhood friends and they are not really open to connect with such a desperate person as me.

27,"Hello, 

I think I need a help getting myself out of depression. I was never diagnosed with it, but I believe I was in this constant state of depression for a quite a long time. It all started when I transferred to the top university in my country, cried throughout my whole university, graduated with no job prospects, accepted completely irrelevant career paths and currently working on changing my degree. 

At some point I came to realization on how much I hate my current job, most likely my company. I am trying to find a new job without much of success. I am taking some courses in the evening for my new degree, and I am already failing one. I don't have any belief in myself anymore. 

I sleep a lot, as I don't want to wake up at all. I tried some counselling sessions through my university. I didn't find it much helpful as the counsellor just listened and I didn't get much of an advice. 

I understand my current state is quite bad. I get triggered and cry pretty much all the time. 

I NEED SOME ADVICE IN GETTING MYSELF OUT.

I am ready to try anything at this moment: meditation, self-help books, anything. I don't think any anyone help me at this moment, until I try to help myself.

34,"Basically, in the past we used to have people with depression, these people could continue their lives being depressed nonetheless without taking their lives. All of this without medications. I am wondering how all of this would be possible? I am afraid of medicating myself after reading some stuff online, to give you some excerpts from [this](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/06/dont-know-who-am-antidepressant-long-term-use) article.

&gt;In October, the British Medical Association published its response to a [two-year fact-finding exercise](https://www.bma.org.uk/collective-voice/policy-and-research/public-and-population-health/prescribed-drugs-dependence-and-withdrawal) into long-term use of psychoactive drugs. It noted that while benzodiazepines, z-drugs, opioid and antidepressants are ‚Äúa key therapeutic tool‚Äù, that their use can ‚Äúoften lead to a patient becoming dependent or suffering withdrawal symptoms... the evidence and insight presented to us by many charity and support groups... shows us that the ‚Äòlived experience‚Äô of patients using these medications is too often associated with devastating health and social harms‚Äù; it was therefore, the report concluded, a ‚Äúsignificant public health issue‚Äù.The BMA made three key recommendations: first, and most urgently, that the UK government establish a 24-hour helpline for prescribed drug dependence; second, that it establish well-resourced specialist support units; and third, that there should be clear guidance on prescription, tapering and withdrawal management (they found the current approach to antidepressants, in particular, to be inconsistent: too many patients were suffering ‚Äúsignificant harm‚Äù). There are also increasingly urgent calls for studies into long-term effects that are not funded by drug companies, because, Moncrieff says: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have very much data. This research is really important, but hasn‚Äôt been done. It‚Äôs a massive blind spot. It‚Äôs extraordinary ‚Äì or maybe, given the pressures and interests at work, not extraordinary at all ‚Äì that it hasn‚Äôt been filled.‚Äù

and

&gt;‚ÄúI think you have to adopt a very conservative approach,‚Äù says psychiatrist Jon Jureidini. ‚ÄúThese are brain-altering drugs, and our overall experience with brain-altering drugs of all kinds is that they tend to have a detrimental effect on some proportion of people who take them long term. All we know about the benefits is from short-term symptom-reduction studies. The careful prescriber needs to say, ‚ÄòWell, in balancing the likely benefits and harms, I need to be very cautious about how much benefit I‚Äôm expecting, and I need to be very generous about the possibility that the harms might be more than they appear to be.‚Äô‚Äù

and I'm also omitting interviews with ‚Äù a few long-term users \[...\]‚Äù where they'd *agree* with the author on the article.

I've had moderate depression for 5 months now. I scored a 19 on the MADRS-scale, but the family doctor I was speaking with (he told me he used to work as a psychiatrist, but left, which struck me as odd so I didn't believe him or his judgment that I should start my treatment with 50mg sertraline.)
