1,"I’m not only needing support but advice I’m 35 years old, I’m going through trauma therapy, yesterday’s session was absolutely breaking, broke me down like no other, other than getting up to feed my dogs this morning I never got out of bed today I’m just now getting up to get a shower and it’s 8:15 PM. My family is not there to be supportive nor is my husband we’ve been married 11 years, he has multiple years of cheating, I don’t know if it’s ever been physical but I would assume that it has but assuming makes me an ass as they say. Yesterdays trauma therapy session really made me realize that I’ve never had a positive male father figure or a male figure in my life that has not screwed me over in someway shape or form. I want to move out of this house, I wish he would go to marriage counseling we went once I have about three sessions and the guy was just bat shit crazy in my personal opinion so we’ve never been back to any type of therapy I go myself counseling once a week and trauma therapy once a week and I see a psychiatrist every three months I am struggling with no finances as he took me off the bank account several years ago as POA and I don’t know what to do in order to get out and I don’t even know where I would go.

4,"My boyfriend struggles with depression. Looking for advice on how to help him from people that know what its like

Hey so the guy ive been dating for 7 months now struggles a lot with depression and anxiety (MDD and GAD to be exact and some psychotic depression). I want to do everything I can to support him. Ive talked to my therapist about it and other people who are involved in his life, including him, but usually get a generic answer like “talk to him about his feelings” or “do nice things for him”. Mental health is complex and this type of general advice certainly helps but it’s can only go so far. I try my best to understand and I struggle with anxiety myself so at least i have some personal experience but i want to help him as best as i can. So im asking reddit: as someone who has depression what have your loved ones done that has helped you the most?",22Aug2020,1

Even feeling happy is wrong it feels good but at the same time it’s wrong it’s not right in anyway just spending time with my mum watching some films we have a few good laughs and that but I don’t know why that makes me laugh but other things which should don’t, like one person I talk to just makes me feel so much better she makes me laugh and smile just by talking to me and showing memes and that I’m not sure why she makes me feel these way and I’m not sure I will ever find out, truth be told I’m not expecting to get a reply but I don’t know anymore my self report says I do but really I just think it’s in my head now and it just makes me feel even worse of a human being for being happy",22Aug2020,1

I always felt so guilty when I would call in sick in the past, so I’ve tried to push myself every morning to get to work. It has not been easy and it’s like pulling teeth to get out of bed. The last few weeks, I have been insanely stressed. I noticed myself feeling less and less happy as the days go by. This morning, I was completely swamped with work and I just couldn’t focus. I made several rookie mistakes and got totally flustered. I finally realized I needed to take care of myself without feeling guilty. I asked my Director to call me (I work from home), I explained what was going on, and asked for Monday off to get myself together over the weekend. He was so understanding and even told me to take the rest of the day off to unwind. When we ended the call, I cried for a little while and kinda let it all out.

9,"A week ago I started to feel sad again, I didn't really think that much about it because I was still for the most part happy, and I only got sad at night, but a few days ago things got really bad, and I only realized when I started thinking about cutting myself, I was able to resist doing it for a day or two, but did it for the first time last night, and again tonight. But when I cut myself I wasn't crying, or having a mental breakdown, I just kind of sat there and did it. I am worried that I am not actually sad, and that I am just forcing myself to feel this way, nothing really bad has happened recently to make me sad. I feel like I only cut myself because I hoped I would stop thinking about it, It wasn't like I really wanted to do it, it was more of an intrusive thought, and something I wanted to do impulsively. My understanding of self harm has always been that you are so sad you want to hurt yourself, but it doesn't feel that way for me, it was just that I wanted the thoughts to go away.

Is this normal?

That's the main thing that I wanted to say, but there is something else I want to put in here because I probably will never say it if I don't now.

I have noticed that I haven't been eating enough recently, I have been overweight ever since my parents got divorced and have been trying to lose weight for a while, I hadn't managed to lose any weight up untill the start of quarantine where I lost 10 pounds and was healthier than ever, but I gained that weight back, because I stopped excersising, I started excersising regularly again about 2 weeks ago, and have only missed one or two days of excersising, but I have noticed that the past week I haven't been eating enough, I have barely eaten two full meals every day, usually I eat a full dinner (although haven't some days) and have a small breakfast around 1:00 PM when I wake up ( I usually fall asleep around 5 AM) today I eat a pretzel for breakfast, and another day I eat a packet of dried mangos, the first few days like this I would eat a small snack around 4:00 PM usually an apple and a few chips to satisfy cravings. But  now I have noticed that even though I am constantly hungry, when I eat I get full quickly, and recently haven't had the small snack at all, because I felt so guilty about eating, even though I was fully aware that I have been practically starving myself. I have already lost the 10 pounds in two weeks that it took me a month to lose the first time I was losing weight. I have eaten less than 1000 calories yesterday and today, while that isn't healthy, it isn't insanely bad, my worry is that this will get worse.

I feel like I am forcing myself to have all of these issues so I can prove something to myself (I don't know what I would be proving, but that's just how I feel)  when I found out I had tourettes a couple of years ago, for some stupid reason I went around telling everyone I knew, I cringe at this stuff now, but I probably did this for attention, I likely have anxiety, and am 90% sure I have been diagnosed with depression, and now I am worried that I may have, or be developing an eating disorder,  I rarely cry (mabye once every 5 months), and when I do it's over petty things, most of 5he tkme I am not  feeling sad or happy, just empty, I am not sure if I am just so used to feeling sad that it doesn't bother me, or if I am just really not that sad. I am worried that I am faking everything and that I am doing all of this for attention.

I don't feel comfortable talking about most of these things with anyone irl, partly because it's embarrassing, and partly because I don't want my family to worry about me. Because I didn't have a way to say these things to someone irl (comfortably) I figured that I would post them here anonymously.

10,"For those of you who have come out of AA or recovery centers. Did it truly help you?


Here's my story:

Our wedding was set for next month. Two weeks ago, I found my Fiancé's fb messenger left open and flooded with multiple women he's had late night convos with over the years... right up until the day I found out. When I confronted him about it, he broke down and admitted to everything immediately. No lies to cover anything up, no excuses. Just plain defeat. Apparently, it's been going on for seven years (our entire relationship)... My fiancé has a huge prescription drug and alcohol problem. He has depression and insomnia. And would take the drug to help him sleep every night. But when you mix it with alcohol, it causes all kinds of issues (black outs, memory loss, erratic behavior, etc.) although most of his messages were between 3-5 a.m. he definitely talked to a few girls in the morning as well... just to continue his 'character' . There was no emotional connection as far as I see it, it would be random one word messages or convos with girls from all over the country or outside of the state (about 60 girls, if I could give you an estimate). If one girl wouldn't respond to his messages, he'd move onto the next one. He didn't have a type, it was anyone really, whether they were in a relationship or not. None of it mattered to him because he didn't consider them to be 'real people' . It was like an online game for him. He told me he got a dopamine kick out of it and thought it was ""harmless"" because in his head that was fantasy world and what he had with me was real and genuine. He was able to separate the two lives all these years and think nothing wrong of it. We don't live together, so whenever we'd hangout, the online world didn't exist to him. But as soon as I'd leave for the day, he starts to self loathe and feel down, which makes him want to get right back on. Sometimes it's doing random things around the house (trying to cook and almost burn the place down, waking up somewhere he doesn't remember how he got there in the first place, ordering random things online and not knowing where it came from the next day and talking to girls online) -it varied depending on the severity of his drinking and pill popping) It wasn't every day but it was on and off all seven years - I didn't know because he'd do it when I wasn't around. I consider myself crazy and oblivious for not realizing sooner but he was too damn good at being a functioning alcoholic and repressing his depression and darkest secret - anyone who knows him, loves him. He's the funny, sarcastic, highly intellectual guy who you wouldn't think twice as to someone who suffers with depression. Only his immediate family and I are aware. He's had severe depression ever since he was a kid. When we started dating, I've always feared something like this would happen because of his lack of self worth. I even had my doubts throughout the years too but I didn't want to believe it. I never expected this and for all of it to be closer to our wedding time....I know I tried my best to understand him, be there for him, and make him happy. But sometimes that really isn't enough. He never allowed himself to seek professional help as an adult. So all these years, it's been simmering within him. Until our big blow up two weeks ago. It all came out. And it was weird for him to hear it out loud. Its been a long two weeks. Before I could even process anything else, he went ahead and took off from his work for a month, and checked himself into a drug and alcohol addiction center. He's been there for a week now and they won't let him out until mid September. It's a 30 day program that his psychiatrist recommended. My initial thought has always been to leave if it ever gets this bad. But I didn't expect him to check himself in and take full responsibility for his actions... He didn't even use the alcohol and depression as his crutch, he knew his sober self played a huge role too. This is a new thing for him. It gave me a sliver of hope that he wants to help himself and continue to fight for us. I know if I were in his position, he'd give me a chance to help myself too. So that's why I'm here, that's why I haven't left yet. I guess I'm waiting to see how seriously he takes this. The wedding has definitely been canceled for now but I'm willing to wait and see if this is something he needed to do to. I have nothing else to lose at this point so I'm here, I'm waiting, and I will give it a final trial run before I make my decision to continue anything further with him. I told him I'm done taking care of him and that nothing is holding me back. I've accepted being independent if I choose to. I am not afraid to leave. Just thought I'd give him one last chance.

Wanted to know what everyone's else's thoughts are. And how to cope when he's away at a rehab center for a month. Would you give your SO another chance if they dropped everything around them and checked themselves in?

This is the first time he's ever done something like this. He hates change, he's so dependent on alcohol and his prescription, he has no money but is willing to be in debt just to show me that enough is enough and he wants to help himself. And now he's there and I will hear from him on the phone for the first time in a week tomorrow.",22Aug2020,1

12,"my boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years now (long distance) and his depression seems to be at an all time high. We also believe he suffers from some form of OCD. When he's in a cycle he fights me on my past, he looks down on me for having had a one night stand. And even though his sexual past greatly surpasses mine he cant get over that i have a past at all.

My boyfriend is the love of my life, ive never felt these feeling before, I want to be his wife, and have his kids and live life to the fullest with him! And when he is feeling good he wants those things too but when he is in a cycle he hates me with all that he is, and says he wants to die and that hes going to kill himself. He texts me relentlessly any time of day or night asking questions about the past. To me this is all completely irrelevant because im with him, im in love with him and want a life with him. He consumes every aspect of my life!

I want to move home to where he is and be there for him but even when we are together, we still fight. A part of me is scared to move home, but its always something ive wanted ever since we started dating. I wasn’t ready to leave my job, but I am now and that’s a whole other fight that comes up. 

My boyfriend started taking medication a month ago, but refuses to go to therapy. Getting him to take medication was a huge step and im so proud of him! I want to be there and support him any way I can, including moving home but when he get to that place where he is relentlessly texting my and calling me names it gets really hard to be there for him. I shut down, I don’t want to talk to him when he gets mean, then he gets even more upset that im not talking. Everything has escalated so much, im scared he will do something. I don’t know what to do or say anymore, especially from so far away. Ive called his parents late at night cause the things he says have scared me so much I needed someone to check up on him.

I think he needs to change his medication, but maybe its too soon to tell, its just a gut feeling. And I really wish he would talk to a therapist. He thinks he can do everything himself, but theres no shame in talking to someone and ive tried to make him see that. He's an adult so these decisions are up to him. At this point I just don’t want him to kill himself and im scared he'll try. I love him so fucking much and want him to be happy and see the joy in life again. We use to be so happy and i want my fun, silly, loving man back.

15,"I just wanted a place where I could speak a little about the things that traumatized me as a child. I never thought it was the worst childhood(as I was raised to believe I was fortunate to have immigrated to North America, and I know I am quite lucky for it), but I only recently realized how actually horrible parts of it was.

The next bits can be slightly disturbing/triggering, so I don’t expect anyone to have to read it. It’s just some stuff I’ve never talked to anyone about until recently.
I’m glad for everyone who has supported me until now, but still feel horrible about myself because of what happened before. My self image is very very low, especially as a teen.

When I was younger, around 5 years old, my parents were working a lot during the day, so I was left with my uncle and cousin. My uncle wasn’t a very good person, and my cousin was raised with horror movies a big part of her young life(she’s two years older than me).
My uncle never gave me anything straight up, not even when I begged him, and he made me do things for his benefit whenever I wanted something(even as simple as playing four in a row). I didn’t understand how the exchange really wasn’t fair.

And after that, they’d force me to watch really terrifying horror movies with 18+ gore and sex scenes.  I could’ve went to the other room(there were only two since it was pretty small), but they’d turn off all the lights and wouldn’t let me turn them on. I was terrified enough with the sounds from the tv, so I huddled in the blanket and covered my eyes because I didn’t want to be alone.
I spent the 5-6 years having nightmares almost every night. I thought it was normal.

My parents divorced. It was a big argument and I didn’t understand, but stayed with my mom. Their relationship is still very unstable.

The first few grades after kindergarten, I mostly drifted and didn’t have many friends. When I did have some, I was mostly outcasted. I had one best friend who truly treated me well, but she moved away and I was desperate for friends.

In grade 6(I was around 11), I got a friend who I felt really needed me(let’s call her Sarah for now). Sarah and this other friend ‘Wendy’ would make me feel like shit.
Sarah would be the brunt of it, and Wendy just followed her. Wendy was nice-ish when we were alone together, but she could be vicious with Sarah.

They’d both make fun of me, from my appearance to my interests, even going far enough to stick leftover macaroni in my desk for me to clean up.

Sarah would step on my head when I bent down to pick something up. They’d both make horrible inappropriate jokes about me and this man they met online who was 18(or older). I won’t go into detail, but it was sexual and something I didn’t want to know or understand at my age.

It lasted for more than half a year, and I thought it was completely normal for friends. Perhaps I was just too desperate.
I had wanted to sit with someone else in class(for obvious reasons), but they messaged me after school on social media and blackmailed me until I cried. I didn’t go to school the next day.

It only ended when my teacher intervened and made them apologize. They both started crying, despite what they knew they did. 

I continued being friends with ‘Wendy’, somewhat best friends until I couldn’t take being made fun of anymore. I still thought that was normal, and was very much surprised when I moved schools in high school.  

Everyone was so nice, and they respected my hobbies and looks. I still feel distanced from my friends because I’m scared that I’d bother them.

My self worth and confidence have been very low(perhaps non-existent at some times) for the past 2-3 years. I have hurt myself on many occasions, and only recently have my parents found out. 

My biological dad isn’t the most understanding, and I see him on the weekends. I feel often that he’s very stubborn and somewhat narcissistic, but it’s to be expected because of his own childhood.

My step dad and mom are very supportive, but because I live in Canada with the free health care, it takes forever to have any therapy. 

Also, we don’t have much money so we can’t afford to pay for therapy, so I’ll have to wait until the pandemic settles down.


Thank you if you’ve read through that big block of text. 
I’ve never talked about the worst part of the bullying, as I refuse to remember it, but it’s still there with me, as are the emotional and physical scars. I’m trying my best to stay clean, but I find it difficult. Yeah, so, just parts of childhood that traumatized me. Thanks for reading.",22Aug2020,1

17,"Using a throwaway account so that my friends don't see. 

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It gets worse towards September and better around March for me. So I'm already kind of going downhill but what makes it worse right now is how left alone I feel.

So, for anyone interested, here is the story:
Around three years ago (in my early 20s now) I started getting more into Judaism and I have found my spiritual home in it. I didn't grow up Jewish but my matrilinear great-grandmother was a Jewish women. My grandmother converted to Cathplicism later in life and also gave my mother into a children's home. As far as I know, she denied any Jewish heritage. One of her daughters fled the Nazis to the Netherlands, nobody knows what happened to her, the other - who was more open about our family history - died a few years ago. Most of her personal documents ended up in the trash. Everybody alive in my family at this gets defensive and denying over our jewish past. (Despite the fact that - apart from the oral stories we have - my grandmother's generation and the ones before all had jewish names.)

So, if you don't know: orthodox and conservative Jews consider everyone Jewish who can prove their jewish heritage on their mother's side. Liberal/progressive (which I feel closer to) Jews mostly consider people who grew up Jewish to be so.

As I just explained, I neither grew up jewish nor can I actually proof that my great-grandmother was a Jew. I live in central Europe, there is no Rabbi available near me. (But a small reformed congregation.) I reached out to a few different American Rabbis. They either right out denied talking to me/ignored or ditched me (two Rabbis, 4 times each). The local congregation is (rightfully, given recent developments?) suspicious of new people and won't accept me either. Other Jews often bully me out of the idea (happened to me over a year ago on r/Judaism too) and tell me that I am not a real Jew unless I can prove it and that I should stop pretending. Judaism is a religion that is heavily community-based, yet I feel absolutely excluded and unwelcome, up to the point where I now mostly don't even pray, have Kiddush &amp; Havdalah (Shabbat ceremonies) or celebrate holidays for the most part (all of which I did before) because the situation makes me feel like a fraud and question my identity.

Being cut off from the community that much amplifies my feelings of being on my own and the ongoing rejection just brings me down more and more. I see religious communities as support groups for tough times (among other things) but being so beaten down by exactly that group makes me feel hopeless. I don't know what to do about it anymore.

If you have been reading up to this point, thank you very much for attention.
