0,"Sigh here goes. My professor sent me an email saying I’m pretty sure you cheated on this part of the final and I was thinking about lying and trying to cover it up but I can’t. I’m so nervous and I feel so bad that I’m going to confess and say what I used and how I checked my answers using an outside source. 

I know this is my mistake and I did it and even though we’re living through a pandemic and most schooling is online, that’s no excuse.

I don’t want to die. I don’t want to kill myself and I realized this year that I actually want to live and stay alive. I’m gonna admit to my mistake but I’m so scared if I get expelled or just the shame of admitting to cheating will cause me to self harm or worse. 

Please do any of you have anything similar you’ve gone through or have any advice as to how to deal with it afterwards? I’m gonna talk to a counsellor as well to vent to and also them for advice but if you have anything else please help :(",22Dec2020,1
1,"It's been a bad day for me. For God's sake, this is supposed to be the time of my life. I'm young, I'm at the peak of my youth, yet at the most joyous time of the year I'm alone in bed, bundled up and crying.

I don't think I've been okay for a little while now. Every day the intrusive, hateful thoughts just get worse. I'm tired of the random crying bouts and the aching loneliness. I'm tired of self-isolation. I'm just... tired of the heaviness.

I've prioritized my family above all else, believing they'd be the ones there for me when shit hits the fan, but I guess I was wrong. Now I barely have any friends, and I'm stuck with people who do nothing but guilt-trip and bemoan the fact that maybe they've raised me wrong whenever I open up about how I feel. I feel bad enough as is. How difficult would it be to say I'll be okay?

My boyfriend (if I could still even call him that) is growing more and more distant every day. The pandemic has put a huge dent on our relationship, and now he'd rather spend time with his friends than with me. I'd be lucky to get a ""how are you"" in a day. The one person I thought would follow through with his promise of being there for me, has admitted I make him feel ""uncomfortable"" when I ask for support. 
I don't even know what to tell him. ""Hi, I need a little attention, can I have some?"" Then ""Read: 4 hours ago"".

I don't have anyone else to turn to, so I guess I'll talk to you, Reddit. I'm just sick of feeling unwanted and lost. Maybe share some of your own stories.  If nobody has asked you how you're doing (fuck knows nobody's asked me), then:

How are you doing?",22Dec2020,1
2,"I’m not doing well and I’m scared I’m going to hurt myself. I have no one to talk to, I live by myself. I have a long history with depression and suicide.

I’m wasting my days with sleeping, drinking alcohol, taking painkillers, smoking cannabis and listening to sad music. I know. Terrible idea, but it’s keeping me afloat.

I don’t have the money to see a therapist. I’ve looked online for free resources, and I even tried a few apps in the past, but the good ones mostly require a subscription.

What (free) tools/apps are you using? Any advice to keep me sane?",22Dec2020,1
4,"Some of words used may be offensive to you, but it's how I was called, not how I call people. You may also not like reading certain stuff. It may make you feel worse. I don't want to be a burden, don't help me if you are in a dark place, focus on yourself please.


Yeah, so basically it'a a huge mess. I started working out, but my body is in bad shape. I returned to basics, because I have no properly working muscle tissue at all after years wasted trying to sleep through my life. It's about six years of this mess at this point (i mean depression) and first two I was still in decent shape since I was kinda of an athlete and lived healthy lifestyle my whole life. I was also a shining example of an educated man. Plenty people still think of me this way, but I screwed up. I wasted a year at uni trying to get help, another one when covid got here and I got my finances screwed. I am almost debt free, it's a damn change, not a large sum, but it's only thanks to my old habits. My homies get their degrees this year, I am still working on it, but got burned out. I kinda want to do it and kinda not, but I will get back to this later. I've had cash, I had none, now it's more stable, month or two and maybe I could save some, because when I feel enough then I work a little and can make use of my skills which I still have plenty. The thing is I don't feel well most of the time. Then there's whole interacting with people thing. Shit, I fucked more than kissed folks. I have no idea what it feels like to be loved. I have vague idea from this one relationship and few random kisses from few friends. It's like, if I get with someone, I'm literally the dick appointment and my wallet. If I brought up any weakness of mine, I would be called a fag or told to kill myself like it used to be. I am bi, but I hide it, because aside from few bars I can't really let anybody know. I unconsiously built a wall around me, or maybe it's others, I have no fucking idea, but I feel like burden and I woke up alone, people may drink with me, party a little and chat, but I am alone with anything other than that. I also do not drink. I was too good at that, didn't want to drink myself to death, even though deep in my heart I want it so bad. It's like I have this image of me that is a good image, image of good person, but I can't keep up with it. Then there's issue with medication. I have none, I was trying to get help. Public healthcare is shit. I pay plenty in taxes, but I have no chance of getting help. So i turned to a private one, but there it's more expensive than US help and my currency is like 3 times less valuable. Go figure. I don't even think my diagnosis was finished. I am afraid of asylums, there was plenty of scandals recently, because abuse there is quite a thing. I was given some pills that were supposed to help me wake up and do shit, because at one point I would sleep 12 hours and be unproductive the rest of the time. I had issues with getting them. I felt worse and there was nobody to help me get my medication. Few times it was delayed. Fucking ride of my life, made me feel even worse few times. No real talks with psychologist or whatever, they judged from me talking that I've got shit figured out, but I do not at all. Whenever I look at something, it has it's colours, but they are mixed with grey if it's the right way to put it. I don't enjoy stuff I eat, things I smell. I am fucking numb most of the time and then there's other me, fucking screaming at me when I fell worse. He wanted me to kill myself for a time, bullied me when other weren't close to do so, now he's the only of me left, because I am husk of a man. He makes me insanely angry at myself, so I put my hatred towards my existence and train like there's no tommorow, but physical exercise gives me no dopamine at all. I have no drug issues or alcohol issues, I am sober, no addictions, it's just like that from time to time, little psychosis here, little I have no fucking idea what there and I am confused. My parents ain't help. Mother has victim complex, father is a fucking living dead. The real example of what can I be is what I've shown myself when I was a kid. Mfs along with the family make me anxious af. Nobody believes in my issues even though doctor literally signed papers to help me (now I am left alone thanks to corona), I was told I seek attention, that everybody in family has it's worse and they wanted me to be the punching bag, so when I retaliated, they would all work on making me feel ashamed for myself. No fucks given, few bucks here and there and ""look, we gave you enough to buy some food, now quit your job, withdraw your cash, give it to us and rely on us, so we can make you work for us again"". Fuck, I've done so much and nobody gave a shit when I told them what to do to be safe, then they screw up, because nobody listens to me and expect me to fix it while they sit and watch. Same with random people I meet. I feel worse with each person I help, because I can patch those wounds, help them get rid of toxins, survive some shady shit they took during the party, but I never I hear anything. I just do it because someone has to, but heard thanks only once, because the guy was fully sober and watched me trying to take care of his bleeding. Nobody helps nobody, then I guilt trip myself into this for complete strangers, but no stranger so far helped me. I got drugged, avoided by accident getting used and robbed after that and nobody gives a shit. I try to kill myself and I get encouraged to do so at best. I cut the rope, decided to live, but I don't know why. I keep trying, but I don't know why. I feel ashamed, like a slut, because I got taken advantage of, nobody gave a shit, because how dude could be given some shady shit. I am a fucking meat bag who needs to help someone to feel a little like a human. Nobody is interested in my health. Nobody checks up on me. Fuck, I keep trying, but there is so much to do. I've almost got the routine going, I am on my way to slowly regain my strenght, maybe I will manage to get my thesis finished, maybe I will manage to focus again, but I have no power in me left to get back on therapy, to trust someone that they won't use me, hurt me. I feel like an object at this point if I feel that way and it doesn't help when people say they have it worse, because they had headache. I just want, just once, to be hugged and told that everything will be fine. I won't ever write any letter, I don't want to finish this, because I hope for a change, but it feels so bad and I feel like I can't handle the world I live in. There's nothing in it for me anymore, even though I do those tasks just because. I handle this world, but I feel like I can't. I feel like I stand alone against it. I can't bring myself to cry or scream, I don't want to be a burden. I've burned my notebooks with scribbles of how I feel. There were many, it doesn't help me anymore. I vomit with all that negativity, I fear talking to people recently like at all, not even in shop. I just got this part out here, without the details, because I feel like if I scream into the void, someone will tell me that I can make it. I don't even need that hug, just tell me once that I can fucking handle this, because everybody needs protection, help, assistance, whatever, but the moment I stop for a second, I become everybody's number one villain. You've got yourselves a man who is no longer a man, no matter how hard he works, how much he knows, how much he can handle, he ended up telling all of this on some random page, because he can't make it no more. Please tell me what to do, where can I find a reason in all of this. If I keep working out, making cash, studying, spending time with those who ask, can I find a purpouse? I was the best for a while, fighting the other who dedicated their lives to work hard, but now I am here and I feel empty",22Dec2020,1
5,"So for the last 6 months or so I feel like I spend my days doing nothing, I'm always bored and wanting to do something but when something does come up I just don't have the will power to act on it. Only when I'm around friends do I feel happy, but it's always a double edged sword, because when that time comes to and end I just feel even sadder that I can't be with them longer.

6,"i just want it to end man

i don't fucking know.. 

the world is just so empty, and i'm so so alone. everyone has used me to the best of their advantage and are living happily ever after. forgetting i even exist. 

i'm just so lonely and feel so unloved. however i would rather be alone like i am now than be surrounded in fake friends and love. i could go have a bunch of fake ass friends right now if i wanted. are true friends and love really this fucking hard to find... i can't. they say it will get better, but it's already been 4 years and looking grimmer than ever. they say go do a hobby or something you enjoy and you might meet someone, THATS HARD WHEN FOR YEARS YOU'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN NOTHING AT ALL BUT TRYING TO BE LOVED. maybe i'm just an empty human being.

people will suggest that i just become comfortable  being alone, i tried, and i can't. if i end up being alone for much longer i'm really just going to do it. i already planned and had the means of doing it last month but someone made me hold on a little longer, and now i know i'm just annoying them with my constant crying and rants. i've barely even got to know them properly, and never got much further than the how are you question, and i just broke down. since then they've tried so hard to help me and always checked up on me a few times a week (just such an amazing fucking person idk what i would do without them) but there's obviously nothing they can literally do to help me (they're online not irl) just like anyone on here i guess.

i have lots of online friends but none in the real world which hurts most. all i want is to have real (irl) friends and love. most people have atleast one person, i have no one. i'm so fucking just i dont know. i'm only a teenager too, so shouldn't i be out there having the time of my life, making memories with people that i love and they love me? 


FUCKING LOVE IS ALL I WANT MAN. FUCK. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE LOVE THE FUCK OUT OF SOMEONE AND EXPERIENCE IT IN RETURN, BUT THERES NO ONE.

There's nothing I can do. I'm expected to just wait around in complete agonising pain for an unknown amount of time, potentially forever...?

Just to make it even worse, I don't even know my sexuality. Possibly bi. So there are many closed doors... I think it's best that I go ahead with it instead of trying to somehow unscramble and fix my mess of a life. I know many people will probably agree, but obviously can't literally say it for obvious reasons lol. I need all this figured out and fixed somehow for like 1 years time maximum as I agreed mutually to myself a long time ago that I don't want to live past my mid 20s. So yeah

Idk. I just don't want to live in such pain everyday. Now or wait and be disappointed again? It's inevitable anyways.",22Dec2020,1
7,"I called up my payee and she says I only have about 400 something dollars in my savings account.

It's been 5 months so that's kind of odd that for the money that's leftover is only over 400 bucks. I don't know. But anyways, I need to find a place to move out with my disability money. My family and I constantly go at it everyday. Is there any charities or something or should I just wait years until I save up enough money to move into a shitty 3 star hotel at best? I'm not sure but with the way my home situation is currently it's kind of urgent that I get the hell out of here.

9,"Using a throwaway account for the time being. It’s so hard to talk about these things but holding them in is killing me.

My childhood was so lonely due yo friends either avoiding me or treating me like dirt for no reason. My family life felt cold and empty and literally abusive. I was molested by an uncle, but rather than get me help or try to punish the abuser, they brushed it under the rug. It made me feel as though I didn’t matter enough to care about, so when my brother also started abusing me I didn’t believe I could tell anyone. I still haven’t told. He is a sociopath. 

Everyone somehow believes that he is some good kid despite him getting kicked out of two schools due to violence before he even got to high school. Despite the verbal abuse my parents witnessed. Despite his multiple attempts to drown me in the public pool. Despite him literally stabbing me in the face. If they still think he’s a saint, why would they ever believe me telling them he was sexually abusive? 

So i said nothing. Did nothing, for years. I suffered in silence and cried myself to sleep countless times, all the while keeping up the act of being fine “for the sake of the family”. That’s what they’d always say to me. “Just put up with it for the sake of the family.” Well what about me? Aren’t I family? Don’t I matter? I assumed not and I still feel that way. 

I’m out of that house, away from my abusers and those who were supposed to keep me safe, but I still feel broken. I don’t feel like a person. I don’t feel like my life means anything because all my memories growing up are filled with pain and loneliness. I have an amazing partner now, and if it weren’t for her I wouldn’t have made it this long, but I worry about how my sadness will affect her. 

I don’t want to make her sad or worry any more than i already have- especially since I’ve started self-harming. I don’t want to cause her more pain but I don’t know if I can tell her how bad it’s getting.

I doubt anyone genuinely cares about me and the way I feel. All everyone cares about is how I make them happy. BUT never did it ever occur to them on how I would be happy. What did I expect.

14,"First... sorry if formation is off... I am on mobile. 

   Lets start with September 2019. I just finished my education with good grades and wanted to build up on it. For this I moved out from my parents home with some. I always had to pay them rent and was happy to be able to leave them (they arent bad parents but we have different opinions which often lead to disputes).

   I moved in with 2 other dudes from my school which i habe known for about a year now. All was pretty nice, I was decent in school, made some new friends. We even signed up for the gym and I got so close to my target I wanted to reach. Then Corona came. Both my flatmates went home as the lockdown was announced in march 2020. Knowing my parents I decided to stay. Since then I was pretty much alone aside from occasional visits of my flatmates if they forgot something.

   At first it didnt seem so bad, I always was someone who could be alone and still feel good about it. Lockdown was done for and summer vacation was approaching. Suddenly I see social media posts from my friends where they are together at a lake or travelling together without even telling me something. They actually never invited me to anything. Only if I came up with something I would be involved...

   I began to distance myself and in school I became the one who is always negative about everything which made me distance myself even more. 

   I began to gamble which soon backlashed via depts and even account attachments for over 1000€ (I get 900€ per month). I lost interest in lots of things... I loved cooking, now I am happy if there is a steak with sauce on my plate.

   And then second lockdown came for us which we are currently in. I pretty much self isolated me, doing nothing else then sitting in front of my PS4, ignoring my other needs, only get up to eat or to use the toilet. Remember the gym? I got from 125kg down to 110... now I am at 140kg.

   I dont know what I should do. I cant even phone my doctor since my contract got canceled due to the account attachments... and I am not feeling comfortable with speaking to anyone I know even though they might listen and help...

   As a matter of fact I also developes suicidal thoughts but I am mostly certain I wouldnt do it.

   Anybody has some advice for me? Thanks!",22Dec2020,1
15,"I need advice to get over a lost romantic relationship. I dated a guy and lived with him for eight years. 

Around the time leading up to the end of our relationship, my mother fell ill and I had to leave my boyfriend for a few months to take care of my mom.
He was unsympathetic to my mother's illness,  acting cold and distant upon my return.  And he was acting different and treating me different all of a sudden.  I think he had been cheating on me.

He seized on the opportunity to dissolve the relationship subsequent to my mother falling ill (easier to get rid of me when I'm distracted by what's going on with my mom in my hometown/homestate).

So he and his friends took advantage of me during a vulnerable time, treating me bad and purposely trying to make me want to leave. One of his female friends said,  "" We're just friends because we have to be, right?""

He ended up giving me a fake marriage proposal, while continuing to treat me bad and his family was mean to me too. I got scared by their behavior and went back home to be with my mom again.  Instead of my ex trying to rekindle the relationship he cut off all communication with me immediately.  He must have been planning it for months,  maybe years. Instead of giving a reason for the breakup he simply quit talking to me. And I couldn't believe that someone I had been sleeping in the same bed with for 8 years had the nerve to treat me this way.


But he, his family, his friends,  his new wife......they all act like it's no big deal.  Like they don't think they've done anything wrong. 

It breaks my heart.  I cry everyday because of how cruel they treated me and its like the nail in the coffin that they act like they haven't done anything wrong. 

I don't know how to get over this.  I don't know how to move on. Cry everyday. My stress is so severe it has caused permanent damage to my vision  ( no joke! I am serious!)

Hence, I stopped scheduling late last month. I will be honest, I did lie consistently about not actively planning suicides, because I was very resistant to inpatient.

With her saying that, it seems like it was pretty obvious my diagnosis was fleeting, with her saying I didn't fit it anymore shortly after. Even now just looking at diagnostic criteria it makes sense. I only fit 2 out of about 8 symptoms of the chart; less than the minimum of 5. So now I am at a loss of any resources I could go for or next steps.

When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school / friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didn’t see them as much as most people see their friends. 
I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school.

I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and I’m realising that I barely have any memories from that time.
I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. 
It’s 6/7 years of a weird blur. 

I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink.
I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and don’t have great social skills because of it.
I was wondering if it’s normal to have a vague memory of such a huge chunk of your life, and if depression could be to blame?

I thought this would get me back into my hobbies and interests but it hasn't worked. I deleted everything back in July/September so it's been a while.

I don't have a job, I'm trying for disability for my diagnoses. I don't have a car (it died over the summer). I lost a lot of personal relationships and burned a lot of bridges (facebook made it worse) so not a lot of people reach out to me. Even if they do reach out, I develop an anxiety that makes me instantly exhausted and immediately want to come home.

When I'm at home nothing gets done. My fiance works, and so does our roommate (which makes me feel even worse because I'm the only one without any money) so the agreement is that I keep the house tidy and cook. Like it's literally only washing dishes, folding laundry, cooking, and washing dishes again, it shouldn't feel like it's impossible. I get no reward thing in my brain.

I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i can't look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. I'm crying all day, i don't eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I don't have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they don't take me serious and say i ""should stop bother them"". My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now I'm crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself. If I'm alive today it's just because I don't want to make my boyfriend sad and I don't want to leave my dog without me because he would miss me and nobody would take care of him or love him like i do. 
Please help me. I don't know what to do and i have no one to talk about.",22Dec2020,1

I didn't talk to her since a few years now, I hate her for several reasons. Just her voice is enough to make me angry and  every time I see her I get pissed. My parents want me to talk to her but I just can't. My Mother is hurt and is talking with me about family n stuff

33,"I have always struggled a lot with suicidal ideation. It comes and goes in waves of being stronger and weaker. I never have any intentions to act on it. But sometimes they’re so heavy I feel paralyzed by them, like if I move I might not be able to control what happens. Like I just can’t move at all. I barely even want to breathe. And I feel so horribly alone. This time of year I struggle the most. I have a lot of negative memories associated with this time and it makes me feel incredibly stressed and anxious. And then New Year comes which is the anniversary of my sister’s death. Sometimes her death, is the only reason I stay alive. I know I couldn’t put my family through that all over again. She died due to health complications, not suicide. This is the first year I’ll be spending Christmas away from my family, as many people are. Anyway. Back to this moment. I’m just so tired of fighting and feeling alone. I live with my boyfriend who is very wonderful, loving, and supportive. But a lot of my depression revolves around deep rooted guilt and shame. I feel so guilty for even breathing and taking up space sometimes. And I know he’ll always be hear to listen to me and would never push me away from getting things off my chest when I need to, but what if one days he decides he’s tired of it. Like he’s waiting for the day my mental health is just better and I’m all done talking about it and that never happens. I feel like I have to give him a break sometimes and not say anything. But if I don’t talk to him, my options are kind of thin. I don’t have anyone else to turn to and it’s my own fault. I don’t know how to maintain relationships beyond this. I’m just so sick of being trapped with my awful thoughts. I wish I could just stop breathing. 

Well. If anyone would like to talk or has some ideas on how to create healthy friendships, that would be wonderful. Sending love and hugs to you all.",22Dec2020,1

38,"*Sorry if this is messy and disjointed, I'm crying my eyes out right now* 

Basic info:  19yrs | Male | Bisexual | Ontario, Canada 

Recently my depression has gotten worse with the realization that I've essentially wasted my 19 years on this planet doing nothing and feel completely unloved and unwanted right now. 

Of all the years to come to terms with my bisexuality it had to be this one, and while I've come out to two people (the closest to me being my sister), I only did so while intoxicated, as I didn't have the confidence otherwise. I lack any and all confidence to do so while sober and its become mentally draining to think about to the point where I have shut myself away from the world in relation to this part of myself. My parents and friends would be 100% accepting of me, I know this for certain, but I just can't bring myself to say anything to them and it hurts to not be able to feel like myself around them. 

I need advice on how to develop this confidence as it not only impacts my ability to be who I am, but my ability to meet new people and form intimate bonds. I've been on Tinder for 2 years and not once have I talked to someone for more than a day before I begin to get ghosted (even if they liked me first) and it really makes me feel unwanted and unworthy of anyone's attention, to the point of me bawling my eyes out for hours on end and feeling totally worthless. I feel totally alone in this world and just want someone to love me for who I am. Every time I think about how alone I am and how I wished the perfect someone would come along to love me I only fall deeper into my depression and self-hatred. I don't mean to sound like an incel but I truly don't understand what people don't like about me and it hurts to not know, my friends and even my own sister all tell me I'm ""literally the perfect, sweetest guy"" so I'm just so lost as to why no one wants to talk to me. (Reading this incel-sounding shit back made me cringe so hard)

I know no 19 year old is meant to have their life figured out by now but it doesn't feel that way and while others succeed, I feel completely lost. I've tried college this year and had to drop out due to my poor grades and my deteriorating mental health as a result of them and it hurts to see my peers continue their education and seemingly have their futures figured out when the most I can achieve is a factory job. I know people learn differently and at different speeds and some people are naturally gifted when it comes to schooling but I am not, and cannot come to terms with it in a healthy manner, it just feel utterly useless and feeble-minded because of it. 

I hate my body, its not disphoria or anything of that magnitude but I'm a bit overweight and hate how I look. But I can't go into a gym without feeling ostracized and like everyone is watching me (though they aren't) and I cannot keep a consistent work-out schedule at home or hold a diet as I stress eat too often. I can't look into the mirror without wishing I was someone else at this point. 

The past week has been especially bad for some reason and I constantly cry myself to sleep, like actually, to the point of passing out from exhaustion. 

So yeah thats me right now. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated and please feel free to ask any questions you have. I just need a friend right now.",22Dec2020,1
39,"My brain is just too fucked up for me to ever be happy in life. Severe depression which is also extremely treatment resistant (more like completely non-responsive). Since I was 6 years old, I've been to over a dozen therapists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other people for support. I've been on more medications and combinations of medication than I can count, made a ton of dietary changes, routine changes, mindfulness courses, and other alternative treatments. None of it has made even the slightest bit of difference and it seems like my brain is just not wired to be happy. Currently I'm going to two different therapists. I see one every week and the other every two weeks. They can help, briefly, while I'm in their office or on the phone with them, but I always plunge right back into extreme depression after I leave.

I basically have no friends left, I can't work because my area's gone back into full lockdown, a lot of the stuff I like to do is off limits, the stuff that I can do from home doesn't bring me any joy anymore, I live with really unsupportive and cold parents, I probably won't be able to move out and get my own place for at least 10 years if ever at all, I fucked things up with an amazing woman who wanted to date me about 3 years ago and still can't get over it, I can't drive because of a visual disability, I feel like a prisoner in my own house, I'm so crushingly lonely that it's almost literally paralyzing, and a lot of nights I go to bed just hoping I don't wake up in the morning.

I'm NOT suicidal, not because I have even the faintest shred of desire to live but just because I'm too much of a pussy. I'm just always going to be a depressed, worthless, basement-dwelling piece of shit neckbeard. I just hope I die sooner than later.",22Dec2020,1

41,I had to put these out somewhere. I am extremely depressed. Sad. Hopeless. I dont really want to change. Every positive thing about me makes me sick. Anything positive I imagine for myself makes me feel terrified. I hate life. I hate my loneliness feeling. I hate every headache that's been caused by my mental state. I hate to feel sad st the nights and go to sleep sad. Every fucking day. Waking up feeling sad. Killing days one by one. Sometimes I think about getting covid and no matter how it scares me it also makes me feel that random event would end my miserable life. I hate myself. I even hate the people who try to be kind to me bcs I dont want to see myself getting help. That's it.,22Dec2020,1
42,"I have never been on reddit before but I'm at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I can't contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness. I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I don't know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting. 

This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me. I'm scared of how much I have internally changed as a person, my lack of empathy and willingness to care about others, and that has never been my character. This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didn't want to end up acting toxic. I felt (and still do now) that no one cares about me, everyone is busy with their lives and their friends. I may have ""friends"", but they have THEIR friends who they give more attention to.  I have been online and have had ""friends"" or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. I've just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much. This applies to real life experiences to. People who just stop making the effort to contact me, under no particular circumstances or conflict. I have always struggled to make friends, and the only long distance friendship I had for over nine years also resulted in stopping contact from their part this beginning of the year. Everytime I've felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I can't be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time I've been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. 

I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not people's responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldn't be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels I've been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. 

There's a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I don't know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, I'm simply expecting something that normally isn't how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever I'm online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say ""LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS"" and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I can't even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldn't be demanding people think about me.

I just wish my headspace wasn't so messed up. Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most (exam season), its all just bad timing. But I'm more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didn't get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that I've caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but I'm so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.",22Dec2020,1
