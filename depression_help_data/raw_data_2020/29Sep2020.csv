0,I don't have much money to be able to pay my first month's rent. I'm not good at my job. I'm having a hard time getting into my therapist. I've already had neighbors cause problems and I'm honestly waiting to be kicked out already. I've had so many people cuss me out on the phone today and I honestly want to die. I feel so stupid for wanting to kill myself. I'm pretty much a fucking telemarketer if I didn't want to be harassed I shouldn't have taken the job. People out there have legitimate reasons to want out but I'm just crying and wanting to die because people are mean. Fuck even if I had a legitimate reason to want to die I can't go to the hospital anyway because I'm not insured,29Sep2020,1
1,I’ve been feeling “depressed” for a few months and I don’t seem to be getting better I haven’t told anyone yet because I keep telling myself that I’m faking it to get attention or that I’m not really depressed I’m just sad I don’t know what to do I’m not really enjoying work anymore and I’m isolated in school I just don’t know what’s wrong with me,29Sep2020,1
2,"
I have been facing with mental illnesses to the point where I have suicidal thoughts and deep depression for a while, I decided I can’t do school anymore, my relationships were falling and I was going insane. My father told me to stop going to school and he will take care of me and my future spouse will support me in his future career. I don’t know what to do. School makes me so depressed. I can’t focus and I’m just scared all the time. What do you guys think? 
I had plans to become a Rn. but that is even too hard for me.. I’m such a failure. If I continue school I will go mentally insane.  But my father told me to drop it .. I don’t want to tell anyone",29Sep2020,1
3,I really just feel like shit all the time. I got better for a while and have had lots of talks with my ex about things and she's apologized countless times. Its not like she's a jerk to me so that isn't bothering me but just remembering what happened. Feeling so betrayed and blindsided. The one person that was supposed to be my partner and always by my side was going behind my back and leaving me in the dark. Small things cause me to remember it and i just feel broken and worthless. And the fact that it happened will never go away. How do I live with the fact that it happened without wanting to die all the time,29Sep2020,1
4,"Hi, I've been on SSRIs for 2.5 weeks now (first time on any meds like this) so my mood is still very very bad but I'm starting to see other things like increased energy and better sleep (marginal for both). And it has occurred to me that the last time I remember sleeping well/waking up easily was when I was about 8. When I was 9 I was bullied very badly and its never really been addressed and I've never been able to make friends the way I could before that. 

I know it's possible to be depressed at a young age... but I have no way of knowing if I was. I don't remember a lot of self destructive behaviour before I was 14-15 or so but who knows? 

I'm nearly 30 now and have a 'full' diagnosis of Autism, Anxiety (GAD), and Depression. I didn't have any of those until I was 19 and as I said above, this is my first time on meds but I think I should have taken them when I was 14-15 and/or 19. 

Do you think it's possible I should have had interventions when I was much much younger too?",29Sep2020,1
5," lost interest in most things besides drugs and my friends 5 years ago, I wouldn’t say it was anhedonia because I still found a lot of comfort and fun with my friends. But my lack of interest in motivation has been something iv really struggled with. I really haven’t been able to make art since then when it used to be the number one thing I cared about. I was on and off ssris for years which I feel caused it, as well as doing coke and molly all the time for a couple years. I have adhd so motivation is something I always and will probably always have to deal with but this is different and more than inability to focus. 

This year iv struggled on and off with suicidal ideation which was something I didn’t deal with too much the year before, because I made a lot of improvements to my life style and emotional health. Covid and growing distant from my friends this year made me want to die. It’s been a lot of ups and downs the past few months. Iv been disciplined in prioritizing my health by cutting down on psychedelics and ketamine and stimulants, smoking weed and drinking less, making an effort to do some exercise, taking my vitamins and eating well, monitoring my binge eating, going to therapy, and reconnecting with my friends. Progress isn’t linear but overall Iv definitely made progress. 

The last 2 weeks iv slipped into a deep depression. I moved back in with my parents and am not able to see my friends and generally have less freedom. But I was excited to be able to work on personal projects and also get to work to make some money which I desperately need to do. But now it’s hard not to think about dying and it’s hard to care about anything, even watch tv. It might be my period coming up because it used to always trigger Suicidal thoughts in the past when I was more vulnerable. I’m also trans and taking hormones which cause mood swings so I’m trying not to be too hard on myself. 

So far iv worked on 
-eating well and taking my meds and vitamins to boost my energy and have a stable mood 
-talking to my therapist 
-making a to do list of everything that needs to be done 
-setting timers to chunk tasks out 
-reaching out to friends even though iv cut our conversations short because I haven’t felt like talking much or paying attention 
-doing yard work for the neighbor to get some fresh air and make a tiny bit of money 
-going surfing which I really love but hasn’t really helped much 
-deleting instagram 
-stretching and pull ups 

I haven’t been able to successfully do deep breathing for longer than a few minutes because my mind wanders. 

What are some other things I can force myself to do when I just want to stay in bed in the dark and scroll through my phone or stare at the wall? I really just want to do drugs. I cut down on smoking weed and hit my pen before bed, but I want to be high on ketamine or adderall or psychedelics because I’m stuck in my brain and I feel so bored and sad.",29Sep2020,1
6,"(I'll be breaking this up so I can be more organized with what I'm writing)
I'm not okay, I know I'm not. I thought I was doing okay so far and then reality hit me. My stepmom is verbally abusive and everyone in my house just listens to agrees with what shes saying. She has threatened me but hasn't done anything. My breakdowns are worse and this is because when we get into arguments I'm not allowed to excuse myself to calm down. I have to sit there and let them watch me. Feeling them state just...makes it worse. Because of that my breakdowns consists of me rocking, dragging my knuckles on eachother until they are purple, squeezing and clawing my arms, muttering to myself, cutting very badly, and sobbing so much I have to gasp for air. This has made me go unconscious before and I'm guessing its because of the pressure and lack of air, idk. I have been begging my dad (because I'm more comfortable telling him things instead of her) for SIX MONTHS for help. And when my stepmom confronted him about it he denied and turned the story on me saying i haven't said anything. Theres text proof but he told me to sit down when i offered to get my phone. I do so much around the house. I clean the dishes, mop the floor, wipe the counters, clean up after them of they leave dishes in the living room, my brother leaves half cups of tea in his room to the point they become slime, I have to helpclean my parents room a lot, take care of the dogs, they call me out of my room to poor them tea...the living room is litterally 7 steps from the fridge, and a lot more. If I dare complain they argue it's my chores. No one here does anything though. They call me out of my room all the time to clean up after them. 
    •When it started•
This isnt even what started it. When I was in 2nd grade my Grandma got murdered by her husband. I honestly havent been the same since, but then the next year I got taken away from mom for drug abuse, so I'm living with my dad...who lives in the same house my maw maw was killed in. (I can ""maybe"" link the article if yall want). Living here feels so off and when I cry I suddenly feel..warm but in a weird way. My mom is really my only source of comfort now. My dad doesnt like her because of the drug abuse thing. When I was in 7th grade (4 years ago) my mom was kidnapped and when she escaped she had trauma, she dealt with it by drinking and wrecked causing a DUI (not going into detail that's her business) but my dad is stuck on believing she ran away with some guy for some drug bust. My mom is my only source of hope now...I talk to her when i down. I plan on living with her when i go to college bc theres one near where she lives now. I just have to keep on hoping I can last 2 more years. I'm torn between both my parents and I feel so unloved.
•why I came to reddit•
I came to reddit for some kind of emotional support. Ik its cliche to come to the internet with problems but I'm not a very verbal person and it's very easy for me to type instead of speak what's on my mind. I also like responded or at least someone coming across my story...its comforting in some way. My parents did make the attempts to call around but my stepmom kept making comments like ""this is what we do for you"" or ""you better be thankful"" or even ""you're faking it and I wasting my time"". I've tried to call prevention hotlines but I kept zoning out on the phone so I hung up. I'm not good at focusing. I didnt like my last councilor though. She was always on my parents side and turns out...a lit of kids at school had the same problem. She also got my stepmom hooked on essential oils instead of meds and now that's all she uses. We have since then stopped going and as expected my health decreased. My doctor said I have anxiety, severe depression, ADHD, and something she likes to call traumatic schizophrenia, it's not the real term but she calls it that because its basically what it is. When I'm breaking down I can see my mawmaw or my momma and then they vanish. She said its traumatic for me because I got taken away and my maw maw passed so close together. Which...I dunno it's weird. 
•coping•
I cope in many different ways, they include:
Drawing, painting, coloring, chatting, playing games, sleeping, helping others, and I might even scroll through this reddit and drop positive comments for other people. Doing at leas that helps.
•then end I guess•
Thanks for reading my vent or whatever this has helped me calm down a tiny bit... I know none of this made sense and you all probably think I'm bat shit crazy, dont worry I think im bat shit crazy too. But um...yeah that's all I guess. I'm stuck on what I do from here...like do I still let my stepmom trample me? Do I tell mom to make a court case to get me (which she has wanted to do many times) or what?",29Sep2020,1
7,"Fuck today was toughest in a long time, well the last couple have been particularly tough but today even more so, I've been feeling really lonely again, I had a dream last night, well more of reliving a memory, it was about when me and my ex went on holiday and one night we went for food just the two of us, we walked along the coastal cliffs to this little, over priced fancy restaurant, we dressed up all proper, her in a nice dress and me in a fancy shirt and trousers which is rare, the only moment we had our phones out was to take a photo and brag to our friends, we had amazing food, a nice big burger and some strangely named pasta, we had half of reach as we usually would, after food we found these big bean bags, each one was the size of a double bed, not the comfiest material, basically just a bunch of super sized hackey sacks all spaced out atop the cliffs, we choose a blue one not too far from the pathway as we initially only went to it to inspect, but decided that we'd lay there for a bit while, we knew the sun would be setting in about half a hour and so we decided we'd wait, we talked a bit, hugged a bit and just enjoyed the moment, as beauty as the sun setting over the dark blue sea, or the ships in distance or black rocks beneath us, I couldn't take my eyes off of her, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, I knew I'd do anything for her, I felt like I had everything, I felt invincible.

That holiday was so long ago, that moment as if it never happened, half a year later I tell her I think I've got depression, she holds me and says she knows and that we'll get through it together, the day after she says she wants to break up, a month or so after that a long discussion ends with her saying that if I don't suicide she will too as she feels guilt, skip another 7 months to today, nothing is going my way, I hate everything and everyone, I'm driving, I get to the bypass, I start speeding up more and more and more, changing gear accordingly, I'm not thinking, not about driving anyway not about anything that's around me, not about anything that's current, just about what she said and about the night so long ago it could just be a dream.  A car going the other way catches my eye, all of a sudden I'm not thinking of the past, instead I just want to cry where can I cry, I can't cry while driving that's dangerous I'll find a layby, holy shit how fast am I going, oh fuck 120, oh shit oh fuck twat fuck cunt, I slow down so quickly and without really noticing I'm already stopped in a layby with the engine off crying like a baby, I want to die I really do but I don't want to hurt anyone else, especially not her, so much time has passed maybe she wouldn't care if I did, the two of us are two completely different people now, so much is happened since she said that well so much for her my life has pretty much been on pause, so much hateful stuff has been said between us over email, she's moved on, had two boyfriends since both turned out to be priks, I don't care about that, I just wonder whether what she said is still valid, not in the way that I want it to be, or her to feel guilty, sure I miss her but it's not just her that's made me feel as I do, there were times while I was with her that I wanted to be dead but I had her pulling me away from the edge wether she knew it or not, now it's just me at the edge, sometimes leaning over asking for death, other times I'm sitting there with my legs over and looking at the sky, but I'm always there, a bad thing away from jumping, I'm never happy, I'm miserable and I hate my life, and I really mean hate, from the bottom of my gut I've never meant hate more than when I say I hate my life. 

I know there are people who say shit like ""oh but you're so young"" ""there are steps you can take to change stuff"" ""once you get a job it'll...."" well all those cunts can fuck right off, you don't live my life and don't know shit about me, I've tried everything I can find, tried exercise, getting a dog, get fresh air, tried drugs, tried no drugs and most of all I have tried getting a job from literally every place hiring within 25 miles, fuck even Morrison's has 6 bloody failed job attempts for various postings they've had, I'm sorry jannet but it is not easy to get a job now days even without a fucking pandemic, yet alone no decent qualifications nor references and being so dyslexic I gotta think which later is b, d, q, 9 or p, and such poor social skills that a frog could hold a longer conversation with someone, so yeah I'll say it again I hate my life.",29Sep2020,1
8,So I’m 21 years of age and have suffered with mental illness most of my life. I have never actually been employed and lately it’s starting to really get in on me.

But I've noticed that I've been getting more and more nasty with my husband and I don't mean to, I don't want to, it's not me.. I've been pushing him away more and more. We've been together 11years next month, he's my entire world, I love him and everything he does for us. But tonight... all I've been thinking about is how he'd be better off if we got a divorce and I left (we've only been married 11months), how it's not fair to do this to him.. but the thing is, I'm not upset thinking about it. Normally I'd absolutely hate myself for even thinking such a thing, it makes my heart hurt.. but tonight.. it just seems so logical and the best thing to do.

11," This might be a cross post so forgive me for that because I guess Im looking for anyone who can give me advice. Im struggling with respecting a no and being bitter and resentful

I genuinely feel I do love my LO. But i also have struggled to respect her no before. Ive always respected her as a person and i know its her right to say no. But i got around blocks, made false accounts etc. 
I know i shouldnt have. But i always thought if she heard what i had to say, how i feel etc it would change her mind. I know its silly but it was almost like a puzzle where if i could combine the right words it would click.

Realistically i know why she doesnt want me. Not only the distance issue, but shes very fit and was a fitness competitor. Shes very driven and has right wing beliefs and values strength and stability. I get it. She dates very successful athletic men. Im depressed, nothing of value money wise to support a family and am fat. Depression really wrecked my body as much as my mind as food is a comfort. I will never be rich or have a good career at 37. Im left wing too. So i get it.

But it still hurts. She doesnt see me as a mate or potential. Because i know one rich douche she dated cheated on her and dumped her by text to go back to his ex he never got over.

I know ill never find someone as good as her. I aimed high and found an amazing woman who was top tier in every sense. However i myself am not top tier so i understand her not wanting me. It makes sense.

So why did i and do i struggle to accept no? I am trying to fix my life but even then im thinking about coming back to her once i do just to see if it changes her mind. I seem to need that or i give up. People say do it for myself but whats the point of getting fit and living longer to just spend more life alone? And i am bitter. I am generally not a fan of fit muscular guys anyway so the fact she likes them makes it worse.

I dont know what to do. I am respecting her wish to leave her be. But im struggling. And every single day before bed i pray to any god that might listen (tho i dont think there is one, not one who cares anyway) that i might die in my sleep.  A small part of me has hope life will be better so i dont think i will successfully kill myself...but a part of me just wants to be dead and gone and finished and at peace. I just want peace because i know now love is out of reach for me and being as lonely as i am...i dont wanna live that way for another four decades or so.",29Sep2020,1

16,"Hey there. Like many here, I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety for most of my life. I've gone through several different channels to get help and some things have worked, but it's always seemed temporary or like I was improving in some areas while getting worse in others. Anyway, I'm currently unable to take advantage of the resources I once had and the idea of joining a support group popped into my head. However I'm extremely nervous about getting involved with one and always back out at the last second whenever I push myself to join. I figured asking here might help ease the pressure a bit.

Have any of you guys been a part of a support group? Was it helpful? Did being around so many other people that were struggling add to your own stress? Any recommendations if it did work out?",29Sep2020,1

But why am I constantly compelled to just end everything? Part of it is curiosity, and I get that. But the rest seems to come from nowhere, and it’s just been getting worse (so I think). I don’t classify myself as ‘at risk’ I have to exercise self discipline, I carry a firearm everyday, so, i’m very conscientious. I’d never; i’ve got so much left to do and don’t want to be another damn statistic. I have the drive, future, and life to go on, and I want to. But I can’t help but cry and wonder why. Why does this plague me? For years I have dealt with it. No rhyme or reason as to why, but, it just is. It’s quite annoying really. I always avoid sharing like this, never felt like I should put it upon other to try and handle this sort of thing. I’ve helped my friends through the darkest of their times, I have an idea what it’s like. I have tried seeing a psychologist/therapist, didn’t help much, almost made it worse. That whole bit where you wonder if you actually have a problem or not, and think you’re just wasting their time. Anyway, writing all this up helped, (i’m a little surprised).

21,"My will to live is gone pretty much. In the past months i haven't felt alright, my head as been messing with me, and i hadnt felt like this for a long time. I was diagnosed with depression some years ago, my mom thought it was all a joke, she laughed at me and never helped me really, she just kept fucking me even worse. I went throught a really hard time w someone at the time, a really really toxic relationship that lasted for 2.5 years, where he used to hit me, he broke my arm, he manipulated me, always insulted me 24/7, said he would kill himself if i left him etc etc. I was so lost at that time, he made me stop talking to all my friends, bc i supposedly wanted to fuck them all, so i was left with myself basically. So i was really lost at the time, i lost my will to do everything, lost a lotta weight, started to sleep a lot, and the thoughts started to appear: i dont deserve to be here, im shit, im better off dead, it hurts to much to be here. After that i tried to take my life three time (not successfully obviously), started to self-harm, i saw no point in living, i was pretty much alone with someone who told convinced me that i was nothing, that everyone was better, that i just served him to fuck, that my friends and family didnt love me bc i was shit. I don't know how i'm here today, i just know that my best friend pull me out of it somehow. The recovery was hard, i still didnt wanna be here even when he wasn't around, and i realized i really didn't like myself. I realized that i wasn't anything. That i wasnt interesting, that i had nothing to offer, that i was a big nothing that didn't deserve to be here. My best friend made me see otherwise, she was always here for me and i wouldn't be here if it wasn't her.  


The problem is, those thoughts are back. I'm back with panic and anxiety attacks that literally make my heart hurt and the whole area, i can't breathe, and i feel myself starting to turn off. I haven't felt this urge to not be here for a long time, but the thoughts are hitting hard right now. Why? Things at home aren't great, my mom really does not help me, she doesn't understand, she just says shit to me, how useless i am, how disgusting i am. But with this corona stuff i had to stay home, i lost my job, i can't leave home so it just keeps getting worse and worse... But one of the biggest motives is that someone i really loved and love, just teared me down once again. After that ex that fucked me in every way possible i really have trust issues, i don't trust many people, i don't talk to many people, i just don't like people in general. So for me to trust someone it was a really big big step for me, and i really trusted them. Told them a lot off stuff of my past, what happened, how i felt and so on. It was really good, but for 8 months. After that he left me. He erased me from everywhere like i was nothing, like a was a piece of shit that meant 0 to him. He started to move on w his life, posted a lot of shit of how good he was, started to flirt w people, and i would just watch and cry while he was alright. After a while i stopped caring about everything, did a lot of shit, got involved w some people, and it kept me distracted for a bit. But then he came back, message me again, we talked for a bit and then he ghosted me again, althought he tells it was me who ghosted but in reality when he doesn't realize it was him.. So all fun and games, til i go to my father and he message me again. (for the record my father lives in his parents' garage so yeah). we started talking again, it was actually going good, til he did something and i was really really hurt. Rn i don't remember what it was i just remember that it was something that took the little trust i had in him away. So he sent me a big message telling me that this wasn't worth, that if i kept going like this what was the point etc etc. I dont recall how we started talking again but we did. The problem is, i really wanted to solve things w him, but he never listens to me, he doesn't make me feel good with myself, and we had a discussion bc he has a bad memory and didn't recall what he just said 2 seconds ago so he started saying shit and i was like, ok i wanna go, don't want to play now, this isnt worth it, and he thought i was just making things up, that i was overreacting, that i always do, and then he started to say some shit just to hurt me, he started to tease me so i would explode and it really just reminded of how shit i am. Of how people always leave me, and they always said it wasnt my fault but it must be. I can't keep anyone close, i try to do my best, to hurt alone, to not bring anything to anyone, to help the best that i can't but i always fail. Then i just see that he's alright as he always his, that he just flirts w whoever, that he just moves on and i mean 0 once again. He tells that it isn't but im not that stupid, and if it was the other way around things would be different. So it really just reminded me of some really bad arguments, and it opened a little box that i tried to control over the past years. I know that my problem is that i get way to attached to people, bc i don't have many people, so its all i have. I really do everything for the people i love, and when they aren't here, when they leave i feel so empty, especially someone that i trusted a lot. And that's how i feel right now. Empty, without any will to live, to do anything. Last night i had some bad panic attacks and i just thought about ending it. Those thoughts are strong in my head and that worries me but at the same time i really want to end it to get some peace, because rn it hurts to be alive. It might seem like its nothing for u guys, and that it was just a bad breakup, but my life really is falling apart rn, with everything at home, and with everything that has happened.

Does this sound like my parents are hiding something.

I’m 15M and when I was 8 I was constantly wanting to kill myself, I told my parents what I was going to do, and after a few months of this they took me to a therapist, I went to this therapist for a few months, I was terrified of it so eventually I managed to convince my mum I was fine, during my childhood I have had strange problems with my mental health, so I was thinking is it possible that I could have been diagnosed with a mental health issue, that my parents are trying to hide from me? I mean being suicidal at that age doesn’t sound normal, and 2 months of therapy, would I go for that long if nothing was suspected? I’m just curious so be honest.

25,"TW- drug abuse, self harm, suicidal ideation

   I can’t form any type of relationship with someone in which that person becomes a part of my support system. Within a month i’m emotionally attached and within a month in a half i’ve begun spiraling off the deep end and having mental breakdowns left and right. 

    I create problems out of nothing and i’m incredibly possessive and jealous when someone I enjoy being around talks to someone else. I can never stop myself in the moment and only realize i’ve fucked up when it’s too late. I can never seem to snap back into reality that it’s okay and I don’t need to be so upset over small things.  
 
   I can never believe people when they tell me that they aren’t mad or bother about something i’ve done. If someone breaks plans or stops talking to me as much I automatically assume it’s because of a situation that the person said they were already over. I stay stuck on things and can’t let them go I HAVE to keep talking about them until i’m satisfied that the other person understands why I did something and that I regret doing it. 

   I only ever begin to get better when I cut everybody out of my life and stop talking to people beyond a surface level. Everytime I tell myself that I’m going to focus on fixing my issues and stop building relationships until Im in a better place and every time someone new comes along and the cycle starts all over.  I’m only 19 and I get high just to be high and stop thinking and when I can’t get high I spend the entire time wishing I was dead or could hurt myself. 

   I’m completely dependent on other people to get me places so even when I need to just go sit surrounded by books in my happy place I can’t and things just deteriorate over and over until I have temporary personal freedom. I feel stuck like I can’t do anything for myself and I honestly wish I had just died when I rolled my car a few months ago because at least then I wouldn’t have to be here in the hellscape I keep putting myself through.",29Sep2020,1

Car engine scrapped out. And the cherry on too, my (now ex) GF has decided that we need to work on ourselves, separately. I'm a big burly hard working dude that's just tired of being in such a dark place. I have no insurance to get therapy medication....

Im scared to do it because i promised to myself i will change and become a better person, but it is never enough, it is never enough no matter what i do. no one aknowledges or appreciates it...im nothing but worthless.

why even continue living if no one aknowledges you being a new person? why even try to live life to the fullest when you just live in constant regret, pain and misery?

28,"I m just blown out of my mind in all proportions. I can't articulate what I m feeling right now because my mind doesn't have that ability right now. I feel very lifeless as if someone had sucked the soul out of me. I m on the hospital bed as I write this. I had a panic attack and mine are sorta like seizures so I had to be rushed to the ER.  I've started shutting down myself from human interaction because posing my social needs has only resulted in not getting them fulfilled and feeling empty, inadequate, and left out. There are some things that I will never get about other people, why must you be so cold? and I have to do the same or else my nonconformist behavior is hurtful. I fully understand that it is and expecting that people owe you something is bad on my part but I just don't know, I m back on suicide watch after getting off it for a month. Have been on it since February. I've also quit therapy because it was becoming exhausting and the therapist wasn't really getting me? and to find a new one required far too many spoons which I didn't have. I m blown out of my mind and everything feels so fast and rushed. I don't know what going on and the last few weeks have been just one big blur and I have disassociated my way through them. Just took out the battery from my phone and smashed it against the wall(this is the third time I have done this to my poor phone). I m currently planning on going into hibernation, which is a very difficult task for someone who was really fond of human interaction but I have also lost hope that any of this is real. I wanted a soulmate, I find myself unable to find any feeling of attraction towards anyone and forcing them only worsens the situation. I m loosing all sense of reality and it all seems very unreal in this moment. I dont even know why I logged onto reddit. I never even use it.

29,"I’ve dealt with depression since 5th grade when I first started cutting. It was dumb and I was quickly caught because they were on my arms and immediately got counseling and eventually it was forgotten about. There were no more events til sophomore year of high school when I was sent to the hospital for considering suicide. Since then I still think about how much I don’t want to be alive, and have a plan if I were to do it but have NO intention on actually ending my life. I feel stuck in this world and so tired of having to be on medication and being told it’ll get better. I have no motivation to do anything other than sit in my room all day and even that makes me extremely tired. I’ve stopped talking to my parents about it specifically my dad because he always says the same things that I need to do things in order to be happy and I’ve brought this on to myself and just isn’t helpful. I don’t see a future and even if I do, I don’t want to be dealing with depression my whole life like my grandma and mother have. I don’t know what to do anymore.",29Sep2020,1

31,"I don’t know what flair is right to use for this but I just need to say somthing so that I can hopefully start to change it. I mean we all know the saying “the first step to fixing a problem is to admit you have one”. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression but then again I never talk about it with family and such. I just have no motivation to do anything and not not much stuff makes me happy these days. I have the occasional kick start of dopamine when I’m skate boarding or hanging out with friends but then again sometimes my friends just ignore me. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for about two years now but they have been happening a lot more recently. I’m smart enough to to know that it’s stupid to kill myself when I haven’t even experienced the real world yet but now I’m starting to think I won’t ever even make it there. I feel like I’m stuck. I’m not old enough yet to go and do things in my own. I’ve always wanted to travel and just see the beauty of the world, but I won’t be able to until I’m done with my education.  I’ve always wanted to write a book but whenever I get around to it I can only stare at a blank screen.  My grades are slipping and when you come from a household of really smart people and siblings then the bar is always set really high. I don’t know man. I just want to admit it. Life has lost its touch. My eyes used to be hopeful but now they seem dull. Thanks for your time. I just wanted to get it out.",29Sep2020,1
32,"Ketamine Infusion Round 3

So round 3 was interesting.  First thing in the morning my sponsor decided it was a great time to attack me over something he has since apologized for being totally wrong about, but it started my day off with him chewing my ass. Oh an by the way, this was right after I picked up my 10 year at the meeting, so that celebration was short-lived.  Then I received some good news on the way home and shared it with my wife, who responded, as is typical, ”yawn, whatever.”

Now the interesting thing about both incidents is my response with two ketamine treatments under my belt. In the past either would have floored me for the day, maybe the week. This time, I walk away from my sponsor and set a clear boundary on what behaviors all accept and don't have to. For my wife, I stopped her from moving on to something else and gently asked for a simple attaboy. She apologized and did so(tepid, but at least something). So with this as my morning I went for round 3. 

Rd 3 I think they increases the dose. The session was a little odd in that the front desk girl came in midway to have me sign something, which brought me out of state. Also at the end the sakes guy came in to talk to me. By nature, I assume everyone is untrustworthy, like I've always been, but as far as I can tell, he was genuinely just checking how I'm doing. He's got nothing to sell me anyway. So I guess genuine decency still confuses me.

Now he was the real hiccup in today's treatment, I was keeping a secret from them. Because of the argument with my sponsor who was supposed to be my ride and my wife not interested in helping, I drove myself too and FROM my appt. I believe that was bad on two fronts. One, you can't let ketamine cut through to he truth while your telling lies.  Second, that was dangerous as shit!  

So it's the day after, I feel pretty okay in general, which is quite a huge change on its on. However, I'm having a really hard time making decisions and my nerves are on edge.  From what I've read the decision thing for 24+ hours can be natural.

33,"This has been a question going on in my head for quite a while now. Ever since August, I have been feeling strange. I was unenergetic, and tired. I didn't feel like doing anything besides eat, drink, and sleep. I don't take showers, get dressed, or brush my teeth unless forced to. I dropped all my hobbies and even my possible addiction to video games, something I thought was impossible. Now school has started, and you can probably guess how that's been going. I use to be an ace in school. Getting nothing below an 80 and always excited to learn some more. Now I've been failing all my classes, mainly because I'm not motivated enough to even do them. I usually wake up, get on zoom, pretend to listen while doing something else on my phone/laptop. Sometimes I don't even go to class. Yesterday, I actually just skipped school entirely, and was planning on doing so again today, until my dad came in and yelled at me, which brings me to the the next topic. I'm starting to avoid people, I don't go down stairs unless I'm grabbing a snack or dinner. I'll be coming down stairs, grab food, and just before I go back up my mom will say something about school or what I've been doing which i will always respond with ""mmmm.."" 

So I have come to you guys to seek help. I have done LOTS of Google searches and they brought me nothing.",29Sep2020,1

37,I dated this guy awhile back but we ended up breaking up. I still had feelings for him but we maintained the friendship. He wasn’t in the right place for a relationship or I just wasn’t a good fit and he didn’t want to hurt my feelings. That was 8 months ago. It started getting to me recently because he has drifted away and started hanging out with other people. I told him how I felt otherwise it would’ve eaten me alive. I didn’t know how else to try to maintain being friends if I wasn’t being honest. He just saw me as a friend and he did truly ‘like me’ at one point. I took some space (not enough) and now I just feel so stupid. He linked me to a stream he was doing with friends for a game and his friend made a comment about me being his imposter girlfriend because I love him and I have never felt so humiliated and hurt in my life. He shut his friend down because I was watching but now I can’t let go of what he has said about me where I can’t see/hear. I just feel like I’m this huge joke. I flipped out on my ex/‘friend’ and he understood why I’d be upset but it didn’t make me feel better. It doesn’t change that it happened and idk if I can trust him. He kept saying that his friend is an asshole and he can’t control what he says. I can’t stop feeling like I’m just a joke and that I’m an idiot for being in love with someone who doesn’t love me back. That has friends who could be so cruel to someone. I deleted him off of my social media today. I honestly don’t know what else to do. It was his friend being the asshole and he was put in an uncomfortable place. I could tell he was upset when I messaged him while he was still streaming. I just don’t think I can forgive the situation because if I do I’m basically saying it’s okay to mock me for something that I’ve struggled with and will have to deal with the fact that my feelings are too strong. I keep cycling between really bad depression where my mind keeps telling me that I’m a joke and worthless and just a waste of space to being angry. I don’t know what to do.,29Sep2020,1

40,"I graduated earlier this year, but I just feel so sad about how it ended (I had to move out really suddenly because of Covid, and obviously all teaching went online).

I didn’t get to say goodbye to my friends and lecturers, or the city and campus that I loved. I spent 2.5 years envisioning how it would be and feel to finish uni. I imagined being in my final lecture, and studying with friends in the library. I pictured walking out of the exam room and having a great party to celebrate. I thought about going to the quirky shops I had never gone to. I even planned to go to every cafe on campus, and to revisit my first-year halls, just for the sake of it. Instead, I studied, had my exams and graduated alone in my bedroom, half way across the country.

I lost contact with all my uni friends, and graduation was obviously cancelled. 

But perhaps what I’m saddest about is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to my therapist. We had been in sessions together for most of the year, and she was the only therapist (out of *lots*) that I’ve really felt understood my issues. However, as I had to move out really suddenly, I had to cancel my final appointment with her. (To clarify - she works for the university, so I can’t have more sessions with her now). I just feel like that one final appointment could have made all the difference - though I know that that’s stupid to think, and it that therapy doesn’t work like that. But I wondered if she had saved anything to say to me in the last appointment, and now I’ll never know. I wrote her a card and gave it to the counselling office, but I’ll never know if she got it, and it didn’t say half the things I wanted to say to her. (Also, it didn’t mention that I had to leave because of Covid/the impending lockdown, so I worry she thought I just didn’t want that final session, and that I was rude). What stings even more is that the week after I emailed to cancel the appointment, the uni started offering online sessions for students who moved out - so I *just* missed out on that.

When I talk to my parents about how I feel, they just say about how everyone has suffered from Covid. They even complain about their missed holidays. And my friends just don’t seem to care or understand. I know other people have had it much worse than me - people have literally died and lost loved ones. But I know that doesn’t invalidate how I feel (though it’s hard to accept that).

I now live at home, lost and depressed, and wishing I could get those 2 and a half years back. I know hindsight has rose-tinted glasses, and I know that I was super depressed for most the time I was at uni. But I just mourn for that last term, and what could have been. I don’t know how to grieve this lost time. (I also miss the independence of living at uni, but that’s a whole other story).

How to I deal with feeling this way? I just can’t process it. I’m in therapy again (with a different therapist), but it’s CBT, and we really don’t talk about this sort of thing as the session are very structured and scripted (and I can’t afford private therapy, so have to just put up with the CBT). I hate living in this cloud of nostalgia. 

(Also, I know I will see my friends and some lectures again when graduation finally happens. I know that I can go back to the city and campus to see it again one day. But it just won’t be the same. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s like I won’t be a part of that community anymore, I’ll be an outsider looking in. I don’t want that).",29Sep2020,1

44,"My parents just grounded me for coming to them when i said that I needed help with school, because ""My grades are just unacceptable."" My grades have been dropping because of lack of motivation to do anything. I hardly get out of bed on some days, and rarely ever eat. They took away my phone, my tablet, and any other electronic device except for my computer for school. I don't usually come to them for help with my school for that exact reason. It's not like I'm some spoiled brat that makes a big deal when their phone is being taken away, but my phone and tablet were my only source of coping with my depression. I could talk to a friend for help with my phone and I could read write and draw with my tablet. But now, I literally have nothing to live for. I can't talk to my friends for help, and I cant even listen to music (which has kept me away from my thoughts most of the time). The worst part of it all, is that I will never even try to take my life. It might sound like a good thing, but I have to live with all of my feelings for the rest of my useless life. I would not ever take my life, so there's no need for me to call a helpline. But then again I couldn't even get a hold of them even if I wanted to (no phone). So I guess this is just a rant.
