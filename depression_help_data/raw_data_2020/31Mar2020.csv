0,"So I have been feeling super anxious these past few days and weeks and my mom knows that. I’ve always had it (self-diagnosed), but more recently it has been rly bad. I’ve also been feeling super sad and down (I don’t wanna put a label on it right now). So, because of this I have been acting very irritable and not down to do anything besides be alone in my room. My mom constantly wants me to be with her and go for walks and it seems she is being very passive aggressive about the fact that I am acting like this, as if I am personally attacking her. Today was the absolute worst tho. She told me what we were having for dinner which I was completely fine with (lol) and thought I said “ok cool” in a perfectly fine manner. Apparently this wasn’t ok with her, and I heard her immediately mock me with moaning, “annoyed” noises to her sister who she was on the phone with. I know this was her mocking me as she has done it before, and I just felt so ashamed and upset. Every time I try to tell her how I feel she yells at me and makes it seem like it’s my own fault and how I don’t treat her right and only think about myself, which I know isn’t true. I’ve tried to ask  her about going to therapy but we don’t have enough money to afford it, despite the fact that her own therapist is a call away and she has a cabinet stocked full of her own anxiety medication. I just don’t know what to do anymore",31Mar2020,1
1,"I have been extremely depressed for the last few of my teenage years along with crippling social anxiety, panic attacks, supposed ADHD (for which however I have never been diagnosed as I have never seen a doctor about it) and a whole bunch of other stuff - so much that I can’t list everything. 

Because of all these problems mounted on top of each other, I simply cannot focus on one thing and also easily get frustrated. I sometimes get so frustrated as a result of the smallest inconveniences that I would want to squeeze something really hard or slam my desk.

The social anxiety by the way is so crippling that I can’t even talk to my family. I think today I said four words to them, they were either yes or no. It’s that bad.

But there is so much bringing me down, I’m thinking, “How the heck can I even deal with all this on my own?”. All these years and I’ve never even told my family that this is how I’m feeling. I just don’t have the courage to tell anyone, nor the energy as *just given up and don’t feel like doing anything, all day, every day*. I have too much on my mind and feel like it’s going to explode. I’ve also thought many times about ending my life. It’s a common thought for me, honestly.

Thank you for reading how I’m feeling. I tried my best to describe it but like I said there is just too much on my mind that it is hard to list everything that is overwhelming my mind (and has been for a long time as if it will never end). 

I ask kindly for your advice.",31Mar2020,1

3,"2nd rant of the day. This is just a horrible day for me.

Just had a moment of realization today. Pretend for a moment that you could see your own life, as if you were the main character on a TV show. You are watching yourself behave, go to work, be sad, be happy all of it. Think about the moments in private, and some of the things you struggle with, dealing with stress or whatever it is. You are now not experiencing those emotions, and instead watching them. You are watching yourself react to everything. How would you gauge you are handling it? For me. I think I look like a crazy person. If i was watching a movie and someone was acting like I do in private when I'm stressed out, depressed etc. I would instantly assume this is a crazy person I'm watching. 

So this got me thinking alright, I'm crazy, its a blessing I realized this because that's what they say about crazy people: they don't know they are crazy. So what can I do about it, well I can look up symptoms online and see exactly what mental illness I'm suffering from. I know for a fact already I'm ADHD, I was diagnosed as a child and it still holds up today. I'm now also thinking I may be also be BPD. I don't have all the symptoms, specifically the one that gets the most commotion (i think) the relationships one where you love the person one second, hate them the next. That's not me at all, that's like the opposite of me. My last relationship was 3 years and We only had 1 fight, the breakup, during that time I never felt angry with her or that she was a bad person or any of that stuff. The other BPD stuff though sounds very true. The all or nothing people are all good or all bad, no in-between. Splitting on people, yeah honestly I've kicked several people out of my life in order to protect myself, honestly I thought that's what healthy people are supposed to do, I thought I was doing the right thing. The thing a strong person does. I realize now I was splitting and maybe causing more harm than good.

Would anyone who has BPD like to talk with me a bit? See if we can relate?",31Mar2020,1
4,"I can't get into reading anymore, any show or movie is just on and I don't pay attention to it or care about it. I so enjoy being with friends but because of isolation that's not easy and everyone still finds a way to be busy so calling them, etc, isn't a simple solution.
There are days I can't get out of bed and I have no motivation for whatever various reasons. But even on the days when I can, there's not really anything I find joy in doing or am even remotely interested in. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my days now. I have some schoolwork I can do (which I don't really need to do because exams are cancelled) and I don't mind it at all, but when I have nothing to look forward to it just seems pointless to even try to do any.
Any advice?",31Mar2020,1
5,"I get severely depressed at times and have suicidal thoughts. I haven’t told anyone, cause I’m scary things will get worse. How do I deal with myself, when I feel suicidal? I know dying will make people upset. I feel so horrible at times and can’t keep feeling this way.",31Mar2020,1

I'm just really scared of changing and being different from the person I am now. Yes, I would like to not have depression but like I don't want to not be me. Plus, I have a lady in my life and I don't want to change to the point where I drive her away.

9,"I feel like I'm going nowhere in life. I'm stuck. I have two kids, so I try my hardest for them everyday. But sometimes it feels like my hardest isn't good enough. I am always stressed out, about time, about chores, and ALOT about pain. I have a screwy back that needs surgery. I was born with a rare bone deformation that has created two sudo joints that are causing tremendous trouble. And has also led to a slipped disc. Because of these issues I am currently not working, not that I have any skills. I had my first child when I was in high school. My principal at the time suggested I drop out and pursue my HSED. So I did drop out, but I never pursued my HSED since I didn't know how to. I was a teenager couch surfing at the time. Since then, when my first child was about 3 I started to further my education until I had to uproot my life and move away from my home city, away from my family and friends, because my boyfriend's mother didn't want me living with her son, and she owned the house, so she started eviction eviction proceedings which weren't followed through on since I just agreed to leave. I am now still away from everyone, I haven't met new people, or I should say, my tribe. I cook, I clean and I have the want, to be someone, but I don't know how. I am so stressed that I convince my self that I don't have time to do what I want. But truthfully I'm scared. I would love to finish my education. I would love to make money doing something I love, which is connecting with people, but at the same time I'm riddled with anxiety. Have you ever met a social butterfly that was scared to fly? Well here I am. I feel alone. I feel lost. I have virtually no money, so I don't know how I would be able to pay to learn skills either. But I'm not sure if that's the right path for me either.  Im not close to anyone anymore since I've moved from them, and everyone I was once close with, have turned into different versions of themselves. Not that I blame them. But what can I do? Is there. Place for me in this world? How can I get to where I want to be. I would love to YouTube, or just belong to something important, where I am important. I feel like I am a good person, an interesting person, but no one knows it. I'm scared to even show people who I really am....",31Mar2020,1

11,"This happens every few months.  Around my Period time, I get the blues.  I’ve always had depression and anxiety. But every few months, it’s worse than normal.  It’s this nasty consuming darkness, it steals all of the magic and light that makes me ME. 
It fills me full of pain. So much pain caused by all the doubt, insecurities, resentment, feelings of worthlessness and guilt.  So much guilt.  
I know I should feel this way.  I know it’s an imbalance of chemicals in my brain. I know I have easy compared to others.  That just makes the guilt stronger and amplifies all the other negative feelings. 

Depression is the ugliest disorder.   All you need is love and support. But your behavior is hard to be around and honestly makes people want to give you space.  So they do

You want them to reach out. 
You want to feel missed 
But When they do, it’s never right 
you can’t talk. 
Not right now. 
You don’t feel like crying anymore. 
And about what?  You really don’t have it that bad.  
So Why. Does. It. Hurt. So. Much. 

The only thing you feel like doing is curling up, into a small space.  And staring into the darkness. 
You hear life. Happening above you, all around you.  You want to smile. It feels good to hear the love that is life. Then the cold reminds you, your not with them.  
Your alone. 
Your arms wrapped around your body as you rock back and forth. 
Staring. Your eye are not focused. They are just open and staring. Blurring the space around you into somewhere unrecognizable.   

Once it passes your usually a fragile mouse (weak, submissive, averting your eyes, walking on eggshells... not how I wanna be) or once, in a great while, I feel good. Like wow- I needed that.   
Until someone says or does something, or I struggle with an easy task and I’m back where I started. 
This happens every few months. I *think and hope* that’s what it is. 

We are all going through stuff. 

Lots of hard stuff.

13,"So some context: I became friends with this dude in 7th grade and we hit it off instantly.  Up until this year, we have been the best of friends for a long time, and then, he started doing some things that annoyed me, and everyone else around me.  He kept doing those things and went on and on.  It didn’t faze me the couple months that he was doing it, because I was used to it.  Fast forward to the start of the new semester in January.  I’ve been talking to a kid in my choir class and now in my 2nd semester civics class.  He invited me to be in a podcast with a couple other kids in my choir class, and since I don’t have very many friends, I instantly said yes.  The first month was great, we were having fun and just messing around, until February rolled around.  My best friend found out that I had “neglected” to add him to our podcast.  I was worried that he would annoy me again while with the people in the podcast.  You see, I needed an escape from him, because he was literally attached to my hip at the time.  The thing is, the guy that invited me in the podcast, didn’t want my friend in it because he also thought he was annoying.  He then hesitated and added him in after a couple days.  Here’s where things get bad.  A couple of other guys in the podcast and I were getting annoyed by him and decided it would be best to kick him.  He then “left” the chat as a joke, but I really didn’t want to let him back in.  1. Because I needed someone else to talk to, and 2. I didn’t have permission.  So then he started spamming me to let him back in, so I blocked him because it was getting on my nerves.  I then unblocked a few days later after I saw something on his Instagram story, and decided to make up and apologize and also tell him the truth about him annoying me.  Me and the kid who invited me to the chat/podcast apologized too, because he also blocked him from the spam.  He didn’t take it well, and that was the last I heard of him, until tonight.  He sent me a message that he had made up his mind about this whole situation, and he then told me I wasn’t his friend anymore.  I don’t blame him, but it was all my fault.  I just didn’t have the guts to tell him that i was being annoyed and needed some space to begin with.  I feel like I don’t deserve to live and speak to people if this is how I’m going to treat them.

20,"*Not used to writing stuff like this, so sorry if it’s a little all over the place.

I’m an unemployed 21 year old and have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don’t know why I have such bad commitment issues when it comes to big decisions, but I can’t commit to anything and it is really taking a toll on me mentally. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve always been a quitter. for example, when I was a kid I would get really excited about playing a sport or learning an instrument, but would ultimately quit because I never thought I was good enough at it. This mindset has stuck with me throughout my whole life and I can’t take it anymore, I fear that if I continue to let this mindset eat at me then i am going to end up an old man who is full of regret at the things he never did. 

College is something that I’ve struggled with because of my commitment issues. Ive quit and re-enrolled in college multiple times because the thought of being stuck to one type of career terrifies me, but I have no back up plan for me that doesn’t involve going to school. Everywhere I look it seems like everyone else my age has their life planned out and the fact that I don’t makes me feel like I’m worthless. The worst part about this situation is that I know I am smart and capable enough to attend and graduate college, I just overthink the future so much that I end up losing all motivation to really commit to it.


I don’t have any thoughts of self harm, I’m just so tired of quitting and thinking something is wrong with me. I want to change my mindset about everything and get my life on track, but at the same time I’m scared that I’m going to make the wrong decisions and continue to be unhappy, please help me.",31Mar2020,1
21,"This is an alternate account I'm using so my friends don't see, and I'm not diagnosed with depression, but I just need some help with some stuff.

If I were to pinpoint a time for when my thoughts have been dipping into darker areas, I would say its a few weeks after I came out to my parents. At first, they seemed okay.  My mom is taking it fine, but my father seems *sad.* He says he'll be praying for me, which is expected, since we are all very religious. He hasn't gotten over it yet, and he keeps wanting me to reaffirm my faith. I think that's a major problem for me. I want to grow spiritually, but he doesn't think I can since I'm gay. He also seems more aggressive with talking to me. He doesn't touch me or anything, but he yells more. These two things could be unconnected, but its still causing me stress, especially since I'm around him more because of the quarantine.  

Other things have happened that put me in a bad place. I had this boyfriend, and we were really close. We bonded over music, memes, basic teenage boy things. The most important thing we bonded over was our common sexuality. We broke up after a while, but that didn't matter too much. We could still comfort each other. We made each other feel like we belonged. Something changed drastically, however. In a class, he just seemed mad at me. I asked him about it, and he went off . He told me things like ""I fucking hate you"" and ""I'm so done with being friends with you."" I had no idea why he was mad, and I still don't. After that, he didn't talk to me for months. I had no idea what ticked him off, and all I can think about is *why.* He apologized over text, in the most stupid way. He texted me two months later, saying stuff like ""Sorry, I was just tired."" What really hit me hard was his confession. He told me he was straight, and that hit me like a truck. I decided not to be friends anymore, since he wasn't changing his attitude, and he clearly only wanted to be my friend again because he was getting backlash for going off on me.

Both of these things are filling me up with so much anxiety. I used to have someone I could confide to, someone that can make feel good to be me. I desperately needed that, especially with whats going on with my father, but now I don't have his friendship. In a sick, bizarre way, I ***MISS*** my friend, but I ***KNOW*** he won't treat me well. I saw how fast he changed his attitude changed, I ***KNOW*** he doesn't actually care about me, but he was my confidant. I feel like I was put in a situation where wither I had decided to say friends with him, so that I could feel security in my sexuality, but be complacent in a toxic friendship, that I'm just set up to fail. Its stupid to think about it so much, but I can't help it. 

Since these events, I've stopped eating, even if it makes me uncomfortable. I've also been cutting myself, but shown restraint in that area. I only cut myself in the shower occasionally with razors. I've lost interest in drawing, which I used to do a bunch. My sleep schedule is going to shit, and I can't even look my dad in the eyes anymore. I just need some help, or maybe just some advice.",31Mar2020,1

23,"I'm (26f) autistic and schizophrenic. I was once involuntarily detained in a high security mental ward and strongly medicated for two weeks. It was not rehabilitative for me and I spent a year bedridden at my parent's upon discharge, and two years building up my abilities gradually before I, against all odds, bounced back, and was able to move out, and become a functioning member of society again. 

All without the use of medications, aside for that which was forced on me in the ward, which had adverse affects. I was cooperative with western medicine, and am still convinced that I require a strong western medical form of support for my conditions, but the detainment fucked me up so incredibly badly, that I have resisted the long trek of seeking proper treatment again, and I now have fallen through the cracks.

I managed 4 years without psychoses, and 2 years of being a functioning adult again before alas, this pandemic hit.

My partner (first friend and companion in 5 years), who, although I have been with him 1 year, does not know about my conditions in depth, just broke up with me, and now I am forced into absolutely zero human interaction for the remainder of the self isolation period. I have no supports in the form of friends, family, medication, and therapy, and the emotional pressures became too much for my partner to continue seeing me. 

I cannot come to terms with the seemingly inhumane act of him abandoning me during this time, but have to accept his limits. I am now a vegetable at serious risk of self harm and suicide.

25,"TLDR: I failed to cut the story down. I'll try again here. I reached my breaking point in therapy today. I talked about the things that were making me frustrated at home. This made my parents angry at both me and each other. Prior sessions of therapy had the rule that I wouldn't be retaliated against for what I say so I would actually participate. They haven't done a great job of this since the session and I suspect it will only get worse. I blame myself for how difficult things are about to be.


I'll cut the story down because I don't think anyone wants to read an hour of ""world building"" to get to the actual catalyst for why I'm awake at 4 in the morning.


The spark notes is this: I asked for nothing for my birthday, I specifically said I didn't want this item. I got this item anyway. The item turned out to be a chore that my parents continued to force me to work on. Sunday night after dinner my dad is cleaning the kitchen and I stepped away for a second to write him a rent check. (I don't know how to set up a electronic transfer and I'm the only one who seems to have a problem with that) My mom lost her shit when she saw that we weren't all in the same room and had all started to do different things (funny how free will works like that) she yells at me and my dad to go get the thing I got for my birthday working. Supposedly my dad was supposed to be helping me all month. I wasn't working on it a lot over the month and I sure as shit didn't want his help. The evening ends, we get nowhere with the thingy. I'm now informed that I won't be allowed to return it unless I get it working to prove that I do in fact not like the thing. My parents want me to use it or they want their money back, not unreasonable.


Today in family therapy I was at my breaking point. I laid it all out. How I felt about the whole thing, how I couldn't comprehend how they don't even try to see things my way, how I told them I didn't want the thingy, I got the thingy anyway, and now I'm being punished for not using the thing I didn't want. Also I pointed out that they don't even realize that they're punishing me. They think that I don't notice when they yell at each other when something doesn't get done, I end up having to fix it so they may as well be yelling at me. I voiced my thoughts that the forced family time 100% of the time, all of the time, was way too much. I even touched on how I've been so lonely for so long that I've hardly noticed the social distancing, and I find it weak that my mom is breaking down like this after only two weeks. 


Therapy ended shortly after that, and I bugged out of there because I knew my parents were going to start arguing with each other which ends up crashing down on me anyway, regardless of what I had to do with it and how far away I am physically. I went to my room, closed the door like I was going to be alone for a while, then jumped out the window. I hid up in my childhood treehouse for about an hour crying. I knew I was only making things worse by not being there, but I really didn't want them to see me cry. 


My parents claim to be furious with each other, but they're really mad at me. When my parents are mad, that makes life harder for everyone in the house. My parents, my brothers, and myself. My parents don't realize that this is a form of retaliation, regardless of if they recognize it or not.


I knew nothing was going to get better, I was only going to make things worse. My brothers are going to be affected by my parents being angry too, and they didn't have anything to do with it. It was selfish of me to talk honestly about this stuff. Nothing ever gets better, any attempts to change that will only make things worse. I'll just add this to the list of failures that have been my life up to this point.

I’m not allowed to do a lot of things despite being 28 and if I break any sort of rules (or even do exactly as she says) she has a meltdown and blames everything on me.

I’ve always had OCD and I freak out over anything possibly being dirty to the point where I have a sensory disorder that makes my hands feel like they’re burning if I even touch metal, so you would think this virus would be freaking me out.

29,"Trigger warning...


My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years, I have been out of work for several months I have mostly been paying my own bills from saving but he has paid towards my portion of the rent a few times and he pays for our groceries. 

I know he loves me but after 6 years I wan’t him to propose. I don’t care about a fancy ring, a thought out proposal and a simple ring to mark the occasion is all I ask. 

So I feel he always makes excuses about not proposing because of not having the money. Now we aren’t rich by any means but he makes about 80k a year and has money in savings for a down payment for a house we want to buy later in the year. 

Other excuses is now that with coronavirus he can’t go shop for one and see it in person because all the stores are closed. 

I’ve showed him rings available online that range from $50-$500, I really don’t want an expensive ring that would take money away from our down payment for the house. 

We also are looking to adopt a child this year and we also need that savings for the adoption fees. 

So with all of this, I know he must love me, because buying a house and starting a family is a big deal. But... I don’t want to do all of this without an engagement and then to be married. 

Anyway, after discussing engagement again yesterday and getting the excuse about “you expect me to spend thousands of dollars on a ring I can’t even see” I lost it. 

I just felt so depressed and worthless. I don’t have family my dad left when I was a baby and my mom when I was a teen dumped me on my fathers doorstep with no warning saying I was going to live there now. 

I know I’m messed up and broken, I have abandonment issues, but I don’t think I am being unreasonable wanting a proposal at this stage in our relationship. 

Anyway... I had been drinking and I took several pills I cut myself and eventually passed out on the sofa. He had no idea I did any of it. He knew I drank some wine and assumed I passed out from drinking too much. 

Anyway... I woke up in bed and don’t really remember how I got there or remember passing out. I woke up this morning feeling fine physically, just tired but kind of sad. 

I don’t know what to do. 

Anyone have advice for me?",31Mar2020,1

Some specific questions I have include how long it takes to work, what changes I should expect, different dosage effects and most importantly, whether it all helped long-term and if so, how? Also, will a psychiatrist actually sit and talk with you or mainly just try drug treatments?

34,"I feel so lethargic and nothing seems worth doing. I recently had to chose between btech in cse vs a bsms degree. I knew I took the wrong decision immediately after I cancelled my chance to go to one of the most prestigious institute in my country to do btech. I was kind of more into that mentality than choosing for a science degree. Even the professor who was there while I was cancelling my admission asked me to think twice. I have been a person who didn’t really listen to anyone while taking decisions for myself and most of them were things I would regret. So this time I listened to everyone (parents and relatives) and chose to take up bsms leaving behind what I was actually excited to do. I always talked about studying astronomy as a kid and everyone really knew it so when I asked what I should chose everyone told me to go for the degree(parents and all my cousins) although I had kind of lost interest in it. At this point I was trying to think practical. A btech would take 4years and I could get a job or even do what I want to do without fear as I had a safenet. But the bsms course is five years even after which for me to get a job it would require me to do a phd. I am not sure of what I’m supposed to do with my life. I feel like I have just kicked away a golden opportunity and now I feel dumb as hell. The scientific community as I thought is not a sweet place. It is highly competitive and not particularly rewarding. I feel really empty and not one moment passed by without me thinking about wasting an opportunity. I am really not enjoying what I am doing. Everyone else seems that what is happening is good except me. I don’t want to be left alone while literally all my friends would graduate to get well paid jobs and settle and have a peaceful life while I struggle with no success. The same thing had happened after graduation. All of them went on to btech from various universities like cornel etc. but I took a drop year. So I am already a year behind and I feel like I am doing nothing that Is useful. While I see everyone else doing amazing stuff at tech fests and creating stuff I am buried in books learinging theorems that are of absolutely no help. I am completely lost and I don’t know what to do now. Please, I hope someone honestly tells me what to do. I  cant do this any further.

37,"Hey,

So excuse me if this is not the right thread for this. So for the last few years, I have suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts and I’m a little better now still working on it but...better. I would go as far as to read suicide letters that I would find on the internet, and I’m not sure why I would read them, I think it was because I wanted a find a reason to end my life, I kept a large collection of the ones I found online. There were also times when I would feel better and to keep my mind occupied I would write stories. I re-read them later and had a friend who would read them and edit them so that’s what I would do when I wasn’t feeling terrible. I once wrote a story about death and after re-reading it several times I realized that I had just written the things that I wanted and how I wanted to be supported through those times. I read that story to myself when I am feeling down on myself to be more patient, loving and caring to myself since I know the dark thoughts I had during those times. 

I write this because this has made me think about how often people keep their suicide notes, their art, or whatever reminds them of those really dark times and if they use that as a reminder to care for themselves or to just reflect how tough those times are and how they might be in a different place? Does that make sense? Is that strange? I would really like to talk to folks who have done that and see if maybe this is something that can be helpful for other folks. I know that suicide and depression look very different from one person to another and I also think that there are some feelings that are kind of the same. In my moments of wanting to help other folks, I thought about working on a project where other people also reflect on their suicide notes or anything else they made during their darkest times and talk about where they are now and what they think about when they re-read what they wrote. Is this a bad idea? Would this just be very triggering for folks? Just wondering..Hope y’all are well!",31Mar2020,1
38,"Warning: drunk so the writing may not be too coherent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is certainly hard to accept ones flaw, especially because most of the times that single flaw ends up at the center of it all and you start using it as an excuse for everything else.  
Why you can't do this and why you can't do that.  
Everything ends up being caused by that one thing, to the point where you think about how life could be were it not for \*this\*.

You would obviously be more successful, lead a better life and be more social,

but would you?  
How much do you let your own faults dictate what you can and can't do in life.  
How much time have you lost just sulking in your own sadness instead of trying to do something.

Of course I am a hypocrite too, writing about this is extremely easy while actually taking action for yourself, well, that's a whole other story.  
I never did manage to do it (take action, that is) yet advising others with the knowledge of my own struggles seems so easy.  
The answer is right there, in plain sight, with nothing stopping you from reaching it. But then you do try to reach it you suddenly understand how hard it actually is.  
Sometimes I wonder, if I do take that leap, if I do reach the solution, would it be so simple? No, it isn't something that clicks and suddenly your whole life gets better, that would be too easy. Instead it's something extremely hard, that you have to keep up for the rest of your life; and the only thing going for it, it's that every day it becomes a little bit easier.  
Maybe you did try it, you did try to get better but you relapsed into the old habits and the old sulking, then you also understand how easy it is to lose all the progress you tried to make.  
So there you are, or even, there I am; in what seems like a bottomless pit of sadness that you can never reach out of, but can always fall deeper in.  
What are you doing there? Waiting and hoping for something to change? Attempting suicide? Or maybe, like me, you just ask yourself why you can't seem to free yourself from it, why does everyone else look like they managed it while you can't. Is it just easier for other people? Did they have to struggle less than you? Or are you not good enough, are you not strong enough to do it. But why? Why would you not be good enough? Afterall you were born like that, were you not? Oh, maybe that's too easy; blaming it on how you were born, putting the blame off from your shoulders. No, that doesn't seem right, you should have to bear all that weight, after all you deserve it don't you?  
So you are here, after all the thoughts you've had, still in the same pit.  
Living life one day after the other, but without any lasting joy, just going on with your life in autopilot mode, trying to sleep as much as possible to avoid living, while not having the courage, or perhaps selfishness, to end it.

I have depression, anxiety and panic syndrome. 5 years ago my grandpa died and he was the most perfect person i was ever able to know.

My family never care about me, they always complain with me because im not like my brother, because i am diferent. But then, 4 years later, i met this girl. We studied together, we started talking, and i knew she was the one. We started dating, and she was the perfect one, again. I felt alive, i felt what was love, happiness, joy, i felt preety much everything. When we we were about 8 months together, i started going to treatment. Before that, i was someone that i've only was with my grandpa. She made me alive. 3 days ago she broke up with me, and what she said was that i am different, i no longer treat her as i did, and that she felt small and useless. This happened after the treatment, and i feel worse thant before. I feel that im no longer me. And i don't want to feel again what is like to lose someone. She was my only love, the hole life.

47,"Hello internet stranger, hope you're doing good

Lately, at a very weird and complex time of my life, fundamental changes in my behaviour, attitude, values, morales and principles have kinda, morally developed? I've been in complete social isolation since the new year (and thank god for that actually, what a fuckin weird time).

All that time I have spent in front of my computer - in hindsight that could've gone terribly wrong - just, looking at shit. Documentaries, reddit holes, old world leaders, weird murder cases, classic movies, podcasts, music. All sorts of just surfing on the internet shit.

The thing i am talking about, happened at like.. 10 days ago? If i had to guess, it started march 22nd. I had some kind of migraine i think? Some unbearable headache i've never experienced before. The days following that, is probably the first days i start to become interested in politics, news and the agenda of the society.

I spend a large majority of my time the following days reading about traditional political ideology, psychology and philosophy, and, of course Jordan Peterson (what else lol). I've cut down on Peterson off the last couple of days and started reading into danish politics instead (i am from Denmark). Besides that, I've joined political foras and enjoy discussing politics with the participants.

A side note should be, that I have always done good in school when I wanted to. When we had to make a speech to the class because of new years eve (the queen does a nye speech each year), after the first year we started it, my teacher made it a ""tradition"" the following two years before i jumped schools. The same teacher, thought that my alternative ending to a danish mystery book, was so good that she sent it in to the author. She responded saying it was a nice and abstract ending or something, dont really remember - but my point here is, i am not dumb. Since then, my biggest dream has always been journalism. Biggest dream, life fundament. Every time people asked me, journalist. Through the last couple of years, i know realise that through drugs, a lack of a plan, a lack of trust in self and a lack to fascinate me into something has been the biggest contributing factor to the fact that i know acknowledge - i did not do the things i wouldve liked to have done. I am not where i wont to be right now.

Today, i reflected over all this. From psychedelics, I remember people talking of a ego-death. Ego. Death. I thought about them and realised, my ego probably has fucking died. I thought if thats true, how the fuck?

My hypothesis is that, when you spend this much time alone, and without ANY physical and social contact from other humans, the ego will start to break down. When you dont have anybody to share your thoughts and feelings with, the ego starts to eat itself. The premise for an ego, is that it needs other peoples opinion to survive.

If anybody actually made it here, holy fuck. Thanks man. As much this is a vent, I hope someone views this with critical eyes and knowledge, who can lead me in a direction. Now i am going back to reading about natural ego-death and Jungism. Till an hour ago, i thought it was only obtainable through drugs. It is not, it is obtainable through LIFE, the thing i have come to the conclusion of. Using your life is cool. Spending it isnt. Thanks.

draw a large flower, a small one, draw one with 4 petals or one with 50. it doesn’t matter how good or bad you are at art. you don’t need good supplies, it doesn’t even need to be on its own sheet of paper. draw a flower in a book, a notebook, on your bed frame, wherever you want.

This girl is my best friend and I love her more than anything. We lived together throughout college and for a short stint after. 
5 months ago I moved 3,000 miles away and that really adds difficulty in how I can be there for her.

She's the only comfort I have when a bad episode hits and for a few months I've been thinking ""what if something happened to her?""

She's a fairly young, healthy cat and refuses to have any interaction with the rest of my family. We are glued to each other. I'm hoping she's going to live a long life and I've been taking care of her so that would be possible.

I just got up and had to check for the 10th time if she wanted to come inside because I can't sleep if I don't know for sure that she's alright. It's midnight here and I'm scared that something's happened to her while on a walk.

I've lost cats before. I live on a farm and we always need cats to keep the mice away. But this one is different, I need her.

The reason I'm asking if I should give her away is that I feel like I'm going to go off like a bomb when something bad eventually happens to her. I literally can't take it, and I know I'm going to hurt myself badly or worse

Or is it just selfish to give a pet that's so attached to you to someone else. She'd be crushed thinking that I don't love her and I don't know if I could take that either.
