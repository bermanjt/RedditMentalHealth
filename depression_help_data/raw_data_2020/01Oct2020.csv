1,"I am 28F, my fiance is 36M. We're getting married next month and we just found out I'm pregnant (12 weeks on Friday 10/2). Ive been to therapy, on medication and off, I have a great job, 2 degrees, a house, and someone who truly loves me. None of these things ever work bc I don't do my part. Or I lie. Its destroying me and I'm just wanting to end my miserable existence. But that would be too easy. 

My fiance has an eating disorder, but he spends every second putting his stress and problems aside to make me as comfortable as possible, esp with my growing pregnancy symptoms. He cooks, he cleans, he takes care of the house and our animals while I work a 60-70hr a week job. Hes basically a live-in slave and I hate myself for it. He blew up today because I, once again, came home and made things all about me. I don't want to do this anymore. I need to actually commit to putting myself, my feelings, my needs aside for ONCE in my whole life or I'm going to go insane watching him die in front of me. He's sacrificed every single thing imaginable for me. 

Im the bad guy, and I have true bouts of ""im trying"" but they never last because I get lazy and complacent. I don't want to end up losing him, I want to treat him the way he's treated me for the past 10 years of our relationship. I want that to be his wedding gift.

I don't want to be a bad wife, I don't want to be a bad mother, this needs to stop here. 

Narcissists, ""main character syndromers"", and other selfish assholes... how do I do this? How can I break the cycle for good without eating his, or anyone else's time and resources? If followup questions are needed, ask away. Im writing this before I give up and I will not delete this post even if I want to tomorrow when I wake up. And yes, I have to wake up even if I don't want to anymore.",01Oct2020,1
2,I’ve been alone all my life and I will die alone no one will ever care about me it’s hard to believe if there’s not one person in this world who has ever cared about me a lifetime Of feeling hated,01Oct2020,1
3,"As the title says i tried to kill myself today by asphyxiation. Luckily for me i didnt know what I was doing completely and the thing holding me up gave after i loss conciousness. When I came back to I felt a severe sense of dread from failing and trying to think of another way. Then i noticed my phone had notifications from my bedroom camera (sleep walker). I watched myself choke horribly, and my arms reaching for anything they could grab, all while my face turned colors. It was one of the most horrific things I've seen personally and it made me feel even worse. Ive watched it on repeat so many times now and I'm just lost. I cant say any of this to any of my friends or they would freak out. Kind of came here to vent before my anti depressants kick in and knock me out. I just don't know anymore.",01Oct2020,1
4,"My dad died almost eight years ago (next week is the anniversary). My fiancé and I have been together for five years, and are getting married in November. Throughout the planning process I feel like I’ve done a good job of being practical and planning around his absence (my nephew is walking me down the aisle, I’ll be dancing with my mother at the reception, etc). Now, I think I was just avoiding my feelings. 

Today I ordered a charm to go on my bouquet at the wedding with my dad’s picture on it and I completely lost it. I haven’t been able to stop crying and I’m just so angry. I don’t want a stupid charm, I want my dad there. I just feel so overwhelmed. 

If anyone has advice on how to cope, please share.",01Oct2020,1
5,"Tl;dr at bottom

I struggle with my body.. i feel ugly and disgusting 99% of the time. Another note.. since I had my son 7 years ago my sex drive has been almost nonexistent. This isnt helped by the fact that I've gained a ton of weight and now have way more things to worry abojt and take care of day to day.
My fiancee (also baby daddy) who i love more than anything has never really understood my depression. It feels like he's never known how to help and when i start to shut down he pulls away and blames himself which just makes me feel worse in the end.
Well I've been having a really bad week with my depression so I've been staying up late to try to relax after the boys have gone to bed. 

Yesterday I found 2 charges for onlyfans on our bank statement. It crushed me because I know the model(s) he paid to see don't look like me... they're beautiful and thin.. he's stopped running into the room to playfully smack my butt when I'm changing or kissing me while I cook and i guess its because i went into my shell so he went looking elsewhere..
I tried to reach out to the only person on earth that knows me and understands what to say when I'm depressed and I found out he's getting married Sunday. I knew he was engaged and I'm happy for him but I feel like an intruder in his life now instead of being friends that leaned on each other when times were hard.
So now I'm alone. I feel like I'll never have anyone to talk to ever again and the idea of that is crushing me. 


Tl;dr
My fiancee paid for onlyfans because I have very little sex drive after having our son and gaining weight. He doesn't know how to help my depression so I go into a little bubble to protect myself instead of asking for help. Tried to go to a friend (m) for help but he's getting married and doesn't need my bullshit.",01Oct2020,1
7,"TlDr; I'm almost wholly consumed by anhedonia, have low self-esteem and it's getting worse before its getting better.

I've (22M) been dealing with depression for a long time, I realized I was experiencing things differently when I was 16 but I think it started before then.  I'm currently in college in my 5th year trying to finish my last classes.

I rarely if ever experience pleasure or happiness anymore. If I'm ever in a good mood it's usually only for an hour and it's gotten worse since I've been quarantined at home for 5 months. Over the last couple years I've lost all motivation for and enjoyment of my favorite activities. I can't concentrate enough to read anymore, I'm never motivated to draw/paint and if I do my lack of skill makes me stop, I don't play my instrument anymore either. I spend all day playing games and doing schoolwork, and I never finish the games because I lose enjoyment in those quickly too. I'm not even going to get into my nonexistent love life and horrible self-esteem issues.

I really just don't know what to do. Everything sucks, my life sucks, and I'd rather be gone than live in a gray joyless world. I dont want to die just disappear.",01Oct2020,1
8,"Hi so um, i'm not doing too great right now. I am a high school junior and I have Fs in 3 of my classes, getting back into my habit of reflexively hitting myself, and my appetite is going away again. I'm pretty scared right now cause i can't risk everything i have right now. I am supposed to be getting A's and getting future scholarships, instead im worrying about flunking out of high school. Can someone please just reassure me that I'll be okay?",01Oct2020,1
9,"I have never said anything for 3 years about this now. But I think I have been developing symptoms linking to depression, or I may be depressed, without knowing enough.

Development- I am in America. This all began 3 years ago to this day, the passing of my grandmother. I loved her so dearly and never expected this day to come... especially being this young. Fast forward 10 months, and my grandpa dies. This was very hard to even think of, knowing my 2 of my grandparents died in less than a month? This is when my mental state of mind began to sink down noticeably. 3 months afterwards, their home burns down, with the city it was in, also was my birthplace. It felt like Mother Nature ripped my memories away, that it was targeting me and didn’t want me to have anything good. 
Soon after, around 6 months I want to say, my other grandma passes away. I didn’t cry when any of these happened... I just just, confused most of the time.

Impact on me- If you knew me 3 years ago, I would be described as a happy-go-lucky kid with a very bright personality. Someone who was witty and funny, a joy to be around. 3 years later and I am a mess. I have very low energy and have gained 25lbs from quarantine alone, and it doesn’t help I was overweight before the pandemic began.
I have low energy, many pessimistic thoughts cross my head on a daily basis, ranging from something as little as “fuck you” to something as contemplating the after effects if I committed s**cide
Luckily, I don’t see that day happening for at least 4+ years, as my courage to do it is incredibly low (i’m very afraid if it fails, then i’d have to live in misery for eternity). I have 2 dogs who keep me company daily, they’re my sunshine right now, they’re my reason to live, I love them so dearly and wish they were eternal. Sadly all good things have to come to an end, and they will pass someday. Both dogs are around 5-6 years old.

I am gay. I have to live in constant fear everyday. My parents accepted me, but a good majority of my family is homophobic. I am scared of people finding this out. Sometimes I cry at night just hoping I will become hetero, and even wish I was born like that.

Life sucks. I have an older brother who causes me to live in the shadows, because i’m just not as good as he is. My family loves him more than me. My friends can turn on me very easily due to my anger issues and pessimistic thoughts. My grades have been dropping, I was a straight A and B student, I wasn’t even pressured by my parents to those standards, I was just a good-willed person. Now I am struggling. With Cs and Ds now, my parents are putting intense pressure on me to pass and graduate college... in which if I don’t, I’ll get the boot likely.

My motivation is at an all time low. I don’t have the will to do what I love doing, don’t have the will to improve myself, don’t have the will to make myself happy. I just want to lie in bed. Possibly, I am just tired.

I suck, my parents who do so much don’t deserve me. I am a failure who should’ve never given them any sort of hope in me. 

I don’t think I want to die, I just don’t want to live.",01Oct2020,1
10,"For the first time in a while, I tried to better myself by losing some weight, so I went on a hike a couple days ago. It started well. The wind felt nice. The river was calming. I felt good for once.
However, I saw a bridge and thought it was a good place to take a break. I'm not exactly in shape. Then... well... My depression, anxiety, anger... everything I hate about myself came up really fast. The urge to kill myself came back too. I tried to jump off it just for a split second.
Here's everything that came up in that moment. I lost my mom 5 years ago due to suicide, and I became depressed after she was buried. I wanted to kill myself in college 2 months later and had to stop going to school after that. A few years later, and lost my pt job at a gas station &amp; warehouse job I really liked. A month after losing the warehouse job, my fiancee broke up with me after 6+ years and wants nothing to do with me.
Unfortanelty (or luckily... idfk), something inside made me not jump off that bridge. Now I'm scared to try anymore because this happened.
I need help, but it's like my mind wants me to be alive so I can suffer. I don't have the guts to kill myself or call a doctor. Maybe I don't feel like I deserve help from anyone, or I could be a masochist. Maybe I just don't care anymore! Idfk.

So... I guess I have a question or 2.
How do you reach for help when you don't know how to care about wanting to live or die?
How can I do things without wanting to die?",01Oct2020,1

14,"Last night my boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me out of no where. Said I was amazing, didn't do anything wrong and was a wonderful girlfriend, but he just wanted to be alone. I have bad anxiety at night and it started under the discussion and I couldn't breath. He comforted me for a little while but you could feel he just wanted to go. When my anxiety gets too much I get suicidal thoughts because I just want everything to stop. I told him because I get really scared when it happens and.... He just left me.
He says he still love me, but he left me in a moment I really needed him. I feel so betrayed and it makes me feel like I wasn't even worth saving. I just feel alone and it's the worst feeling I know, so I really want someone to talk to",01Oct2020,1
15,"i'm 24 male and i'm struggling again with my life.
i have a depression and a drug addiction going on for over 8 years and about 4 months ago i realised that the drugs were a part of the depression and stoped taking them. i know that it takes time bevor my life gets any better and drug withdrawal is not easy. 
On Monday I found out that my employer would not take me on after my training(because of corona). To be honest, I don't want to continue working in an office, but I want to finish my training. now I feel empty again and the panic attacks and anxiety are coming back. it feels like the last few years have been in vain. i'm thinking about starting an apprenticeship in nursing next year after my current apprenticeship has ended. The problem is that the thoughts of drugs catch up with me again, I don't want them, but the thoughts don't get out of my head either. I have no one who can understand the problem.
The people around me don't care or can't understand how an addiction works because they never had one themself. My will allone isn't nearly enough to break this thougts. And if i start now with professional help again, i have to distrupt my apprenticeship and will lag behind. i can't focus on the things that are important.
Today i didn't show up in school and said that i'm ill, but i don't want to repeat the circle of not showing up on work because of my fear and anxiety. 
I know i should speak with my boss about my problems but i fear it. 
I don't know why I'm writing here or what I'm expecting.

17,"You ever hold a tiny puppy in your hand and feel an overwhelming amount of protection over it? Buhh then have you also accidentally stepped on that puppy’s tail too much to the point it begins to shake or flinch everytime you try to get near or pet it so you just sit back and watch it grow bcuz its doing so beautifully well without you and hope it comes running back to you..... thats how i feel about this person i fucked over years ago. She has gotten me to turn my fucked up life around. I was always about drugs and hitting licks, but holding her made me feel something so fukkn real and that was love. I never felt so alive in my life so i ache bcuz of the absence of her. She hates tf outa me now bcuz i was such a cold hearted fuck at the time yet over time i build myself to be such a better person to prove that i could be the best person i ever was for her.  Now im living ina state of mind where i actually fukkn fiend for love and affection. Yet nothing feels as real as she have made it. I feel empty once again without her and it kills me. Ik i shouldnt allow a person to make me feel this way but i have no where else to go with these harsh emotions so i break down and cry balling up in the restroom til the sun rises next morning 😕 i wish i could go back in time and not do the things ive done to hurt her bcuz man i never wanna see her go through that pain i put her through, she never deserved any of that and now im here alone asking god (whom i don’t believe in) to bring her back to me bcuz idk wtf to do anymore ☹️",01Oct2020,1
19,"My (now ex) boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me a while ago. Our problems started with me, I had a period where I was really busy and had a hard time at work, I was really down and din’t want to live. Not suicidal, but maybe passive-suicidal if that’s a thing. I just didn’t see the point in anything and I was pushing everyone away. In fact, I can’t remember much from this time in my life. But I probably was not easy to live with, but he still stayed and he supported me. I probably wasn’t easy for him. 

When things got better with me I think he finally could focus on himself, but he had a lot of work, study, family problems etc. When Corona started things gradually got worse. One night I was asking him what was wrong, because I came home from a weeks trip and our house was a mess, he had been playing video games constantly and this really isn’t like him. I don’t remember what he answered, but a few days later he told me he was thinking more critically about our relationship, maybe we were not good for each other. I told him that I was sorry about how I had been treating him and once again explained that things had turned around. After that I started doing all the things that he needed and had been missing from our relationship, because it was also what I wanted. Things got better, and we were happy like we have been before, but at the same time I noticed that he was pulling away more.

He stopped working out, started eating really crappy food, didn’t clean up after himself, started Falling asleep on the couch because he stayed up too late, didn’t do the things he was supposed to for work. We were moving into a new apartment and started renovations in the middle of this, but he barely helped. It was ok, but I gently tried to nudge him in the right directions because I saw what all this did to him. 

Things were getting bad, he was pushing me away more and more. He would go out with his friend and not come home until late, even though we had plans. I tried to find things for us to do together. Every time I brought things up he would get upset and apologize about how he was treating me, genuinely, but he would keep doing it. 

I just wanted to help so bad, that I think I because a neusance to him. 
One day I just met him with a smile and a hug and I saw something break in him. I asked what was wrong and he didn’t answer, eventually asked if we could talk about it later. It’s like I could read his mind and just wanted to take the burden off, because I asked him if he was breaking up with me. He said yes, it’s not what he wants but he thought it was neccesary for him to find himself. He hadn’t planned it, but seeing me doing all the things he thought he needed to be happy not making him happy and making me miserable just makes everything worse. 
He said he was depressed and it was only getting worse. He didn’t feel good about anything and even though he cares about me, he doesn’t have the «right» feelings and for him it was not fair to keep me along when he was not sure about the relationship. I could tell that it was really hard for him and we were on and off for a few days. He was hot and cold, so I moved out and cut contact to give him space. I have not heard from him i a week. 

I really need advice on how to support him as best I can. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Do I just move on with my life or should I show that I care. He wanted space, but we have always been really close and talked every single day, so I am not sure if this is what he actually wants. How does depression work when you’ve pushed people away - do you want them to come back or is that just annoying? Does anyone have any idea given the information over? 
Feel free to ask me about things, I Don’t want misunderstandings. Also this was really long so thank you if you read it all!",01Oct2020,1
20,"Every morning when I wake up I feel tired, hopeless, a weight to the world, an awful person. 

I can't do anything or what I enjoyed before. School doesn't motivate me anymore, I can't read, I can't play, I can't listen to music and watch movies anymore. When I do, I feel like I don't deserve it. 

I try to tell this to my friend and they think I'm kidding, my psychiatrist gave me antidepressants that do nothing and is making me wait for getting a psychotherapist. My teachers only see me tired and bored, but I just can't focus. 

I am a bad person, I feel like a disappointment to those who believed in me and those who put me on this world. I am not even able to look at people in their eyes cause I feel like I don't deserve them. 

I can't listen to the music of my favourite artists because I feel like I can't relate to it anymore, and I feel like they would think of me as a piece of crap, which I am. 

I don't have dreams, wishes and aspirations anymore. I don't know what it means to be happy. I feel empty. 

I want all of this to end, I want some rest. The only time of the day that I enjoy is when I sleep. This whole stuff is just what karma had for me, it's my price to pay. 

I want to go, I wish to not be anything anymore. Right now I'm crying laying in my bed, and that's what I've been doing for months.

I'm starting out quite small but I can't get over the feeling of checking out the change you just made and seeing that after fifteen tries it WORKED. I spend a lot of time just typing things in and seeing if anything happens. Most of the time it either does nothing or looks dumb. BUT I'm getting better!

27,"Hello, I am 21 years old and currently in my 2nd year Animation studies. I have a problem to trying to make it pass.

I was hyped when I learn the Animation until I get in the part of 3D Modelling. Unfortunately, 3D modelling of organic things such as humans/characters/animals are a huge obstacle for me that I feel give up immediately when I try. I do not have problem modelling props or environment but in order to pass this degree, I need to at least model a decent character. I tried but unfortunately, I failed twice in the course (First one is entirely my fault but the second one, I have a good reason why yet my parent didn't know about it because I know they will not believe it. ) I'm really scared that I could fail the subject again now that final submission is approaching and I have to present a character in order to progress my studies.

&amp;#x200B;

However, during my entire time studying animation course, I become passionate with the theory class  which touch on media studies such as 'Medium is the Message' and the Tetrad Model. In fact, during those theory classes, I feels very very energetic and motivated even though the method of teaching by my lecturers are rather...disappointing. I can tell how media studies actually affect daily life more than I ever thought before. I fell in love with media studies and thus I thought about becoming a lecturer in media studies. On second thought, I afraid that becoming a lecturer requires me to pass the current animation course which I am already struggling at. and feel giving up on it.

I once seriously thought about becoming full-time streamer but I do not see that career as a viable path for me at least at my current age and my place / country of living. I thought about being a streamer when I retire or when Im old.

I also once thought of becoming a writer because my imagination is way beyond what I expected. I read a lot of books, I play a lot of games that heavily rely on plot and lore. Yet, if I become a writer, I am scared on how am I going to develop my life.

I also have passion on linguistics and international studies that sometimes I even debated with myself in the shower but I have no experience about what both profession do.

I don't know man, my body starts becoming weak. I don't know what I should do. Should I continue with animation studies in hope I can get better or pursue something else or start a new diploma or something else?",01Oct2020,1
29,"I haven’t even seen most of my friends since quarantine started and I’ve tried to hang out with most of them but they just don’t really seem to want to. And I see them going to parties and breaking social distancing guidelines with other people like every day so I know it’s not that. Tbh I feel like a loser and I left my school because I thought it’d be best to do online school so now I see people like once a week or less and when I do I usually feel like shit. My friends have completely changed and don’t give a fuck about anything that actually matters. Part of me really just wants to just delete all social media and fall off the face of the earth to see if anyone cares but if I’m being honest with myself that will just result in me losing contact with all of my friends because they don’t make an effort to reach out to me by calling/texting me. My best friend is the only one who semi talks to me still but even she is becoming....Idk like honestly at times it’s unbearable to be around her she’s so selfish and self absorbed. And of course I also love my friends but they just don’t care about me like they care about other people. For the past year or so I’ve decided it was my own fault for being sad all the time and pushing people away and I really, really can’t tell if it’s me or them.

30,"that is probably the weirdest post I ever made, but I think I just need to talk to someone or just write it. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 16 for different reasons and today they came back. I feel like I can't do anything: I didn't pass my driving licence twice, my husbands criticize me because the house is not clean (he's not wrong)  so I try my best but if just one day I didn't clean he is mad. I'm not a good housekeeper, not a good mother, not a good wife, I stopped acting because I couldn't get any role so I figured I'm not good at that either, I lost my job ... I cannot find anything good about myself. I know how to end things already everything is ready, I bought the bottle of Helium and everything  but I feel stuck. 
My dad attempted suicide (missed) when I was young and I don't want my son to go through that. I feel like having my son was a bad decision, he is the perfect child, speaks fluent French and English at 4, is very polite ect... but because he is here now , I feel like I will have to leave the rest of my life as nothing, feeling worthless. I try to get my husband to want to separate so he can have custody of our son and so I will be finally free to go I spend my days rolled up in my blanket wanting the day to pass as fast as possible. I feel stuck. I don't know what purpose I have in this world. I encourage and motivate people around me when I feel like life is not worth it. I feel like doing it will at least bring me back to my mom who passed away when we weren't talking anymore.

 I'm stuck. English is my 2nd language but I can only Express those feelings in english so seeing a therapist here is not an option, they speak french not English ( it kinda like it's another personality).

 I feel stuck. I don't even know why I'm writing to strangers, probably because I pushed all my friends away. I contacted a clinic in Switzerland that organise planned suicides because I have been living with those thoughts for more than 10 years now and I know it won't stop. But I am scared to explain to my husband that it is a well thoughted decision. I'm lost. 

Even writing that makes me feel like a complaining little brat. I lost 67 lbs and still not looking good, I have an MBA level and still dumb, I thought all of those changes would make me feel better but I realized... I was born like that, my father probably pass that on to me. If I knew that before having my son, I would've never gave birth because it's unfair to him to have me as mother. I feel stuck.

31,"I hope this is allowed here. For reference, I live in northern Ontario and am 25/f. Every year around this time with the cold weather and shorter days I get feeling a bit down. I used to go to a therapist offered (for free) through my university when I was really struggling and found it helped to have someone to talk to.

This year though has been really tough. I'm really struggling lately, and don't find I am managing things very well right now. I've been crying pretty much every day this month and am struggling with motivating myself to get out of bed and not falling behind with my work. 

I graduated a month ago so I can no longer go to my old therapist (as I am no longer a uni student). I am also on a short-term work contract right now, and don't get benefits or anything through my job. I just have no idea even what to do about this... can I go to a regular doctor? Like at a walk in clinic? Or, do I have any options for therapy if I don't have private insurance? I don't know how much therapy even costs in Ontario, but I am pretty broke right now and don't think I would really be able to afford much.

Thanks so much for any help, I hate feeling this way but I just have no idea who to go to or what to do about it right now.",01Oct2020,1

37,"Alright, 3rd account I've tried posting this on. Wouldn't show up on here with burners and r/stlouis moderators removed it. Busting out my 12 year account.

I am 30 years old, I moved to St. Charles, Missouri from a western state 18 months ago to live with my parents. I moved here because I had absolutely nowhere else to go. A couple of years ago I became injured and unable to work. Abused heroin and sunk into a deep depression. I have been rotting away since. I am severely depressed. I have been clean for 18 months and am not interested in using drugs at the moment. I am not opposed to addiction treatment. I have zero money and zero access to drugs. I do not use alcohol. It is not my main priority currently I want to get started with seeing a doctor and getting enrolled in benefits.

I have zero money. I survive on ramen noodles and dollar menu McDonald's my Mom pays for. I have some serious physical health issues I need to address regarding my lungs. There is a pain in my chest, constantly hacking up dark-colored stuff. Difficulty breathing and talking. I'm a non-smoker. No vaping. No weed. It's likely related to several years of smoking black tar heroin and weed. It has progressively become worse despite not smoking anything for nearly 2 years.

I would rather avoid the ER. I'm aware that's an option but these types of threads often turn into ""Go to the ER right now!"". I will go to the ER if it gets to that point. I want to know what other options there are for welfare, living assistance, food stamps, and health care. I need to get enrolled in state benefits programs. I have developed anxiety and possibly agoraphobia. I'm very nervous about talking to people on the phone. If I am told what to do. I think I can do it though.

I live in my parent's basement. They are mentally ill alcoholics. They are abusive towards me and their pets. They have a history of abuse towards animals, children, and adults. Their mentality is that of stereotypical trailer trash bikers(without motorcycles) who hate everyone and everything.

There's no way to communicate with them without it turning into screaming, violence, kicking me out on the street, and/or calling the police. They WILL kick me out and lie to the police if I try to confront them about their behavior. They have no desire to help me. They don't want me here. I am insulted nearly every single time I walk by them. It's unlike anything I have ever witnessed on a TV show or movie.

I sleep on the floor of a filthy cluttered basement. My bed is a pile of blankets. Bugs and water pour in through the windows. It smells weird. There is an abundance of mold and mildew.

I have no idea where to start with getting assistance. I piss in bottles, wait for them to go to bed so I can empty them in order to avoid them. That is the only way I can minimize interactions with them. I do have a car. It is worth $5000 but I'd rather not sell it as I will have to live in it if I am kicked out. I have a Colorado license. Lost my social security card. I have a birth certificate. No criminal history. Spotty retail resume.

I am just wondering where to start in regards to getting whatever state benefits Missouri has. I imagine getting a social worker is helpful. I have no idea where to begin.

Just looking for guidance and suggestions. Please, tell me what actions I need to take. Be specific with locations/numbers. Thank you very much.",01Oct2020,4
38," 

I am tired of myself , I let a few positive thoughts slip in and after a while it only leads me to a bigger disappointment since I got hope after a very long time.

This year is the last grammar school year for me and I have been struggling more and more each year. I am unable to motivate myself and nothing makes sense. And nothing really mattering or making sense is the only thing that actually makes sense , which I find my only comfort in.

Why should I live this life knowing , I will never have family , never find a good job , or what I fear the most not finishing my final year of grammar school .

Let's say I would actually finish school , uni and get a job , then what ? Everything others have told me is important and must be done in your life would be complete. However , my life wouldn't be , it would be the same meaningless cycle of trying to survive for just a glimpse of luck that will make me feel better for week or two just so depression can hit me harder afterwards.

Why not just end it sooner and save myself countless years of pain .

I have nothing to live for , nothing to look forward to. I feel like my future is going to consist only of my endless fight with depression , until I decide to finally concede.

Right now , I am in a very bad state and need help as soon as possible , it's not only the depression and anxiety , but also hearing a voice in my head telling me to do terrible things to myself or others. This voice is also making me second guess myself every time and I even now makes my writing feel chaotic , switching from one opinion or view to another. I really hate that about myself , since my emotions don't make any sense anymore. But I guess that is normal when you are considering suicide.

I am 18 rn and had problems with mental health since my 12 because of huge (at least for me) family problems. One of the biggest things were my parents getting divorced , me having to fight one of my mums and kick her out of house when I was 15 or 16 when she attacked my biological mum and broke her arm after she found out the stepmom had been cheating on her for a long time. Other than family problems , my ex cheating on me with my best friend just finished me off and I have been happy for only very few days a month at best.

I doubt anyone will read this since it's very long , but at least I calmed down a bit and I am not in immediate danger , at least not for few hours.

If you somehow managed to get to this part , or just read few paragraphs of my rant , any help ,advice or kind words will be very appreciated . I am considering suicide , but I am not able to do it rn. I guess my sanity is still holding on by a thread somewhere inside my head , but I doubt it will last much longer.

PS : sorry for my english , I haven't been getting enough sleep lately and I am also very stupid",01Oct2020,2
39,"I think I might be depressed and have been battling for years without realising it.

Nothing makes me happy. I don’t like my job but don’t know what I want to do. I’ve lost all my friends years ago and they now have families of their own, I do have a parter but always feel they’re going to leave.

I guess I thought when I grow up I’d be someone, but I’m not, and a young me would have laughed at this old me. 

I’m 35 and feel hopelessly lost. I get up in the morning because I can’t be bothered to face the music with my partner and work if I decided not to. 

I don’t see a happy future. On average I google suicide methods a few time’s per week and daydream running away a few times a week too. If I think back, this has gone on as long as I can remember, 15 years ago I was having the same thoughts.

I’m not sure what to do, I’m here out of desperation. The world is not for me, living is just too hard and tiring, but ending it will be messy and painful.",01Oct2020,1
40,"I’ve never talked about this. Mention it or hint it out to anyone and I feel so exposed to say this but I feel that I deserve every bit of it.. I’m in a two year relationship with this guy I absolutely love and adore. But my dumb pathetic ass decided to lie about my “past” and my actual age. I’ve had a rough past that includes self harm and just so much rage within myself. But whenever we met I was a completely different person than how I am now. I’m actually Sixteen but I told him I was nineteen,, I don’t know why I did this. I hate myself for every single bit about it because I feel that if I were to tell him I could possibly ruin this relationship and his own life. I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I did this. I just don’t know. I hate myself so god damn much why did I do this??

41,"Hi I am not sure if I'm in the right forum. Just looking for advice...
Here goes my story...
Two and a half years ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me, a relationship of 5 years, iv tried to make her happy in every way possible which went unnoticed. 2 months after our break up she moved on with another guy. Yes I know most probably had him before our break up. I tried to get answers as to what went wrong, was I the fault? She has never given me answer till date. Feeling of sadness, loneliness, anger, all started to play its role. Searched google, read other reddit posts nothing seemed to help, iv spent alot of time hanging out with my best friend and only friend. After sometime memories or thinking of her started to stop, it felt good no longer hurting just accepting what has happened and moved on with life.

Iv met a girl who I have been crushing on, for 8 months iv been trying my best. On some days she will give in, on other days shes like not interested in me. No she has no one shes seeing I trust that. After awhile now I'm tired and want to give up on her. I no longer have anyone to talk too as my bestfriend has passed on with covid19.

I put on a smile everyday for work. While I'm at work my mind is busy I dont have time to think about life and I'm happy with that. After getting home the reality settles in im constantly thinking her, my friend, life, what I would like my life to be like..speaking of work iv been turned down a position due to my nervousness in the interview. Iv done alot for people and never asked for anything in return. People at my work want to be me, if only they knew how lonely I was and the fake face I put on at work. Iv tried to make new friends put myself out there, doesnt seem to work well.

I dont know what to do anymore...I feel life is unfair towards me. Yes I know there's many out there who have it worse. Trying to stay strong and hoping that one day everything is going to be okay is now turning into believing that nothing will ever work out. I used to think that I would not do anything harmful to my body, well iv just started smoking cigarettes. I sometimes cannot eat and I dont know if it's the thoughts that's going in my head or the cigarettes itself. Heck I cannot even get myself to gym anymore....",01Oct2020,3
42,"Do you ever feel like the most memorable events in your life were defined by trauma and tragedy and getting through them is all you can mark the timeline by?  And memories of the best times creates a sense of loss because they are past tense...  When I think of my life, the negative stands out so much brighter than the positive.  I've had plenty of both, but maybe you have suggestions for how to focus on the positive when I start spiral out?  I have come this far, and yet I feel like who I am is slipping away because of insecurity and my anxiety, dwelling on the negative.  I guess I've been fairly effective at blocking it out and all of this isolating has allowed it to take over my thoughts this year...  Suggestions?",01Oct2020,2
43,"Hello, 

So a little info on us, I’m 21 M and she’s 15 F and as far as brother-sister relationships go, I think we have a solid relationship going. Despite that she is so silent when it comes to her inner troubles. So much so that she was just recently diagnosed with depression after trying to commit suicide when we weren’t home briefly in the beginning of this year. 

She has been seeing a therapist ever since then and I’ve just been hoping and praying that those sessions are helping. 

Ever since then though,  I’ve been so concerned for her, I’ve been trying to look out and take care of her more. I chose to stay home and go to my local state university over other schools I wanted to transfer to this semester just for her. I’ve told her that I’m there for her when she needs someone, that I care for her and love her and that she can lean on me. She just says “ok” with a smile and then nothing. I’m doing my best to show here those things too. But it’s just so hard to do that and be there for her when she hides her inner troubles from me. I even heard her crying the other day and when I asked her what’s  wrong she just lied to me saying she wasn’t crying. 

I don’t understand why she would go as far as to deny me so adamantly. does she not trust me? Is she scared of being vulnerable with me? I don’t know why. Sometimes I feel as though she doesn’t either. 

Is there any way I can support her more when she doesn’t let me in? When she doesn’t tell me what’s wrong and just hides it from me?  

Thank you",01Oct2020,2
44,The title explains it. This semester of college has had me the most depressed I’ve been in years. I’m too anxious and depressed to eat a full meal or to fall asleep at a reasonable time. I’ve reached out to my family but none of them have been helpful. I’m concerned for my safety. How do I get myself to be able to eat again without feeling so sick?,01Oct2020,1
