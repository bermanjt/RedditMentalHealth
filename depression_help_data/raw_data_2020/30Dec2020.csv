2,"It's been a while since the last time I got swallowed into that dark hole of emptiness and depression naps that lasts 18hrs a day..
M spending the holidays alone and after a few months of lockdown (I live alone so the lockdown is harder than when u live with others) things has been taking a wrong turn for a while.. And I finally reached that moment where I cant get myself to get outta my bed.. To shower.. To eat.. Nothing! 
I have exams next week and I literally did nothing during my holidays but what's scary to me is not being able to pull my self out of it..
I go to therapy sessions every two weeks and honnestly nothing much is changing not like I'm depressed 24/7 but when it gets dark there's no way OUT and it FREAKS ME OUT to think about being stuck with MYSELF AND MY THOUGHTS..
I know it's so selfish of me to say that but I feel so disappointed in my ""friends"" I feel left out and I feel like m not important.. In such moments.. All I hope for is to get my phone n find that somebody is trying to reach me.. It somehow makes me feel like they will pull me out of it. I know I shouldn't be expecting that from anybody and I also know everybody has their own struggles they are having on their own THEIR OWN BATTLES I MIGHT NOT KNOW OF.. But Iam also hoping that somebody would care enough to notice me when I'm just a moving body with a dead soul.. When I'm drowning and afraid..
I have no will to live.. I don't even bother to self harm or anything anymore.. It's like I gave up on myself and I'm so tired of fighting. 
My struggles are beyond my efforts of getting out and as much as I know that it's irrational and selfish to want someone to get me out I can't shut the emotion down.
I'm so sad for having nobody in such times.. NOT EVEN MYSELF.",30Dec2020,1
3,"My name is David and I'm 15, but that ultimately doesn't matter. I have been dealing with the feelings of hopelessness and emptiness for the last couple months. 
I have never been diagnosed with depression (don't know if that's how it works, I'm sorry), I'm sorry if the things I have been feeling don't have anything to do with this topic.
I don't think I feel this way because of the quarantine, because I don't really talk to people all that much anyways, plus all of the feelings enabling these new feelings have appeared even before the quarantine. 
I have been dealing with anxiety, especially the social kind. All kinds of social situations stress me out.
I have been recently thinking about these feelings of emptiness and how some people never felt them, which is super interesting for me.
I have been thinking about the concept of death lately. By this I mean the fact that I have to embrace death to live my life fully, and not the suicide aspect of death. I don't plan on taking my own life, and I don't think I ever will, but I can't see the future, so I wouldn't be able to answer the question of ""Will you ever take your life""
I guess I am looking for help, but venting and writing my emotions down like this helps.

With my mental health too, no one cares that I have crippling depression and can barely make it through a work day. The day before Christmas I got bossed around at work cos I didn't put something in its proper place. Im just tired of dealing with people's bullshit.

6,"I'm not sure really where I should even begin to reach out about this but hopefully I'm in the right place.

Over the last half year, I've been struggling to consistently see a doctor in order to get my anxiety meds filled. Part of this is because of my anxiety in and of itself. I have social anxiety which makes it hard for me to call over phones or send messages through portals, much less have the courage to get into my car and make the drive to the office to talk with my doctor. Even with the meds, I'm always finding some excuse to avoid the struggle of dealing with any sense of anxiety. This means that I go weeks at a time without my meds. If it weren't for the fact that I had a mom who at least acknowledged how scary it is for me to make appointments, I wouldnt see a doctor at all and get meds for the next month. 

The issue is that without the medicine, I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions. I end up getting hit incredibly hard by feelings of self loathing and then will spend a whole day in my room crying and wanting to stop existing because being like this is just a waste of air and space. I become overwhelmed with thoughts about how much of a nuisance I surely am to people, how my family deserves so much better that me, and that my boyfriend is probably fed up with me trying to garner some validation from him just so I'm reminded he doesnt absolutely loathe me. I become convinced that the world is better off without me and I just start to spiral out of control. I also become incredibly angry at the stupidest things, wanting nothing more than to act out on my rage(I never do bc the cycle moves back to me not wanting to somehow burden everyone) so I sit and fester and became mean to anyone that tries to talk with me. I assume the worst out of every interaction and basically just get trapped in a dark hole with the thought that I'm not worth a damn and that it'll be easier for everyone to realize if I just off myself. Idk how to process these emotions bc when I'm on the meds, they never get this intense and I'm able to overcome my anxiety and depression enough to shut this shit down.

My big thing is that, even as I sit here post breakdown after having been off my meds /again/ for the last week, I know these thoughts arent correct. I know that people love me, that my boyfriend doesnt hate me, and that my parents would be devastated if they lost me. I sit here and am certain that I am overthinking everything. Yet, that doesn't help?? The prevailing thoughts are still, ""you're a burden, a waste of air, do everyone a favor and off yourself."" I just. Dont understand how I can be so aware that it's just my anxiety and depression and emotions getting the better of me but still somehow loathe every ounce of my existence. I just want to know if there is any way I can actually stop my thoughts, using my self awareness.

I want to start improving myself, especially for this next year and I dont want to have to always rely on medications. I want to seek out a therapist but my social anxiety stops me from doing that and it's hard. However, I can't keep dragging people down with my anxiety attacks and panic attacks anytime I fall into this shitty hole of uncontrolled emotions and intense self hatred. I'm scared I'll one day hurt myself and I dont want to do that. Basically, what I'm asking is, is there anyway I can learn to control my emotions and anxiety long enough for me to get the help I really need? Simple self help tricks or something, anything. I just cant seem to get over the hurdle that follows acknowledging the problem. I'm desperate at this point because I'm growing more and more afraid that I'm going to hurt myself.

If this isnt the right place or something, I'm really really sorry. I'm just scared. Thank you so much for anyone that reads this and I will truly appreciate any words you can offer.",30Dec2020,1

Anyways. I was sitting in the McDonald‚Äôs parking lot with my boyfriend and we were having some pretty heavy conversation (in my eyes). And then I realize as I‚Äôm eating my ice cream cone, staring ahead and listening to him, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm in a film scene again.‚Äù 

And I turn to him and I say ‚Äúdo you ever see life as a movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike life is just one scene after another playing out, like in a movie.‚Äù

His brow is still furrowed, and he looks confused. ‚ÄúNo? But I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs a symptom of ptsd.‚Äù

When probably two or three nights ago I was in a very life-compromising situation, full on arguing and debating with myself OUT LOUD, all while not seeing my life as a tangible thing, and not really accepting that the situation I was in was an actually serious situation, and not just a film to be played in front of my own eyes.

When people said ‚Äúwatching your life through a movie screen‚Äù I never realized that they meant that you were in the movie. I never realized they meant it‚Äôs like you were taken and placed onto a room with invisible cameras filming you, and you‚Äôre acting out a scene. 

I didn‚Äôt realize that it meant conversations were seen more as dialogue.

Exactly 26 days ago, I posted a goodbye letter here.

In those 26 days, people checked up on me, messaged me, added me on discord, played games with me.
In those 26 days, I left the toxic relationship I had, that everyone told me to do but I couldn't.
In those 26 days, I read a book, and made a huge post it wall in my room  with all the reasons  to live and to love this life.
In those 26 days I changed my appearance, that reminded me of who I am.

So thank you.
I'm still trying to figure out a right road on how to love myself, but its possible if you really want it.

If anything helped me, its this subreddit  and everyone commenting .
Some negative situations came back and are still going on, but i guess  I can go thru that as well.

I love you all

14,,30Dec2020,1
15,"I don't need anyone to tell me what to do I just feel like talking into the reddit void. 
I went through a seriously rough few years, I took a shit ton of weed to cope. And I mean A LOT of weed. And I'd smoke ciggerets. And I would hang out with people who didn't really care about me. Then I met someone very very special. A light and bubbly girl named Brittany. She had everything she could possibly want,  her family and extended family are quite wealthy, not that I care or even knew at the time. I was on an online dating app for sex which helped with the pain at the time. It was all i did, just screw for hours, smoke a ton if drugs, move onto the next girl (mainly because they wernt intrested in anything more) anyway back into the story. So this girl Brittany, I met her on the dating app and we talked about a bunch of stuff, she had just gotten out of an unloving relasionship, fuck yeah i thought, now I get to be her rebound. We made plans and she came to stay for a month, she had been living with her family for a short period before she came to stay with me. So she gets to my place and get this, the first thing she does is make me carry her shit inside, and I thought to myself ""this bitch is going to get a really rough fucking for her rudness"" I took her stuff inside and we hung out for a bit did a bit of screwing and the next day I woke up and cooked her breakfast. Then she apologised for being rude and making me bring all her stuff inside. She saw how I lived. (That being a VERY small studio where the bedroom and living room were shared and the kitchen and toilet were just over shoulder length) and she said she didn't realise how good she had it. I told her I lived like that because I was depressed and having cheaper rent meant more weed. She and I often smoked pot during her month stay. During that time I told her about all the horrible shit I went through as a kid, the forster homes, the violence, the bullying, the isoloation, the rape. She said she was sorry. I told her she had nothing to be sorry about and that bad things happen to good people. And then she just hugged me, like my first guineine loving hug. And I cried softly, without a sound. This was the first time i felt a pang of love. At the end of the arranged month she asked me what my plans were. I asked her to stay and that we'd take it on a day to day basis. Which we did. We went through so much shit togeather, like some serious deep shit. And through the whole thing she stuck by me and comforted me. For 2 and a half years. We'd lived in several different homes togeather I met her family who didn't like me at first but grew to care about me and I them. And through it all she kept me going through my depression. Until one day I figured out how to buy drugs online. I did some research on lsd, and I bought it and holy shit can I tell you what it changed my life. I didn't feel depressed at all I stopped smoking ciggies and pot, and I didn't need to take lsd after the first trip. But my partner also took a tab because we did everything togeather. And it fucking destroyed her. She felt horrible. She had a really bad trip and her underlying depression surfaced. A year forward she is getting worse. I've had to call the ambulance for her more then once. Even untie a rope off her neck she strangled herself with after she locked herself in the toilet. I support her every day the way she supported me. Because that's what love is, not just loving someone when things are good, but loving them when things are really rough. She doesn't feel like she will ever feel good again, but her depression let's up sometimes and she has a good day. I feel tremendous guilt, shame , and dishonour, and at the same time i don't feel depressed. Its a little confusing. But so far this boat is still floating, and whoever reads this I hope you keep your boat floating too.

18,"It started in 8th grade. Back then, it was clear that I needed help, but I didn't get any. I decided to try and beat it on my own. Because it made me feel strong. And, I mean, it kinda worked, I actually got a lot better, but it only lasted for so long. After my ""recovery"", I spent the next two years relapsing again and again and again. I never told anyone. It would go away eventually, I always told myself, and I believed it. A few months ago, I actually managed to get clean from self-harm and I was doing so amazingly, I was convinced that it was over.

Well... turns out it wasn't. Depression has many symptoms, but for me, the biggest one has always been self-hatred. And that self-hatred is seeping into my mind again, making me feel worse and worse every day. I'm relapsing again, and I'm scared of it. I don't wanna go back to that dark place. I don't wanna start self-harming again, but the urge is getting unbearable.

It could have been over long time ago, but I recovered so poorly. I never got help because I didn't want to lose the image of the brave, resilient fighter girl which is, and has always been, my main source of confidence. It's kinda stupid, really. I mean, there are so many things I could be proud of, so much success. But all of those rely on talent, innate or learned during early childhood, I never had to put significant effort into anything - except for my resilience.

I had meltdowns, I ruined a great relationship, almost failed exams and had a **concrete suicide plan**.

Two doctors and a psychiatrist suggested to take SSRIs, getting an appointment for psychotherapy would take months. Not a single person recommended to take a **blood test**! When I decided to get one after reading online, it turned out I was strongly deficient on iron and vitamin d (formerly vegan, didn't supplement properly + only ate junk food at uni for 2 weeks straight). I'm now on iron infusions and supplements and start to feel better. But this was **hell on earth**.

 This was my first real relationship, and she was the one that followed in lots of ""first times"" (Not sex, but other things, some naughty). I just can't live alone anymore, I'll end up taking pills like cereal or cut myself until I die...
 Can someone, please help? I don't know how to live anymore",30Dec2020,1
42,"Has anyone here with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder been helped by Dialectical Behavior Therapy?  I‚Äôm particularly interested in hearing from those who do not have BPD, Bipolar Disorder, or other diagnoses that involve the powerful, changeable emotions DBT was originally designed to treat.  I have a near-lifelong low mood, which sometimes inches up toward neutral, and sometimes inches down toward severe depression.  

I have been told that DBT is used to treat MDD now, although this is my second try at this therapy, and I still see nothing I can relate to.  Having me drop out would be a blow to my family, however, because they‚Äôre quite concerned about me, and the belief that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúnext, new thing‚Äù out there that might turn everything around is helping sustain them at a difficult time.  Also, since this is not my first time in the mental health rodeo, I‚Äôm aware that getting quality mental health care (or any care at all), is frequently contingent on professionals‚Äô perception that you are ‚Äútreatment compliant‚Äù or ‚Äúworking,‚Äù which generally means that you are doing what your doctors tell you to do, whether or not there is much evidence that their recommendations will help.  

For multiple reasons, I really want DBT to be a thing that helps me, for all that every time I participate, I wonder, ‚ÄúWhat am I DOING here?‚Äù   Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúnothing to lose by try trying‚Äù situation.  The DBT sessions cost me $90 a week, which I can Ill-afford on my SSDI income.  Participating in DBT also prevents me from seeking out other therapies, because Medicare will not pay for both.   

I would feel less discouraged if someone out there with similar symptoms to mine had benefitted from this therapy.",30Dec2020,1
43,I tell mine ‚ÄúOkay Mike...it‚Äôs nice that you think I‚Äôm *insert random horrible thought about myself or my health* but I know for a fact that you‚Äôre making stuff up. I respect your right to express this but I refuse to listen. If you continue this you can go to your corner and stay there.‚Äù Or a mantra similar to this one :),30Dec2020,1
44,"Y all are so sensitive when smbdy tells a triggering story? I just had a disscusion with my bf about his story before transition( he is trans ). After not a long time we met eachother,  he told me about some stuff he did when he was not feeling okay and I was triggered by it back then. And I tried to explain to him that it idk it made feel a part of his emotion bc that s what I m doing, stupid me absorbing ppl s pain bc maybe I find it fun. Anyway, so I tried to explain him this and he said why bc it wasn t my emotion it was his. WELL I KNOW THAT I WASN'T TRYING TO SAY THAT IT WAS MINE OR SMTH JUST THAT I FELT IT PARTLY TOO BACK THEN AND IT WAS NOT NICE.(disclamer he did sum therapy and he is no longer affected by those stuff). Oh god i just lost my thoughts i wanted to write it down. Anyway, I felt like he was telling me that maybe i m not okay for not knowing to put apart the  pain  of others and just judging it heuewiwiwjiw i k losy and not fine.
At some poinr I jusr realised that at every lil bad thing that happens to me or to someonelse I get so damn senstive. So so sensitive. Like nothing bad should ever happen. It is wrong that i feel like this, isn t it? Why do I feel like this and what should I do.... to stop bein like that bc it only hurts myself... i hate this",30Dec2020,1
