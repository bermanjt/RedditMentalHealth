0,I’m 13. I never like getting up in the morning and have trouble sleeping. A lot of things I used to love doing I don’t really like anymore. I don’t like hanging out with my friends that much and I’m super stressed and have social anxiety.,17Oct2020,1
1,"I’m just so damn sad all the time. I feel like all I do is apologize to my kids for crying all the time. At this point I think they seen me listless and crying, than not. It feels like the sadness is never going away, this dark cloud is always going to be there. I feel like I’m draining the life out of all my relationships. I don’t want to talk to my friends any more, I feel like a burden. If I was them I wouldn’t want to deal with me. I just want to be the mother my kids deserve. They’ve had it rough, they deserve so much more than I can give them.",17Oct2020,1
2,"Hello.

I've been in this community for awhile, and it always warms my heart to see some of the hopeful comments left here. Unfortunately, I myself am in need of some guidance. Hence, this post.

As I look back on my life, I constantly see times where, outside of my control, I have taken the loss. Now I'm in my final year of college, and I feel like I'm losing again. My professors see me as an extra. My friends see me as moody. My own parents don't even understand what I do in school.

I spent the whole summer in therapy, because at the beginning of the summer, I nearly attempted suicide. I got on stronger antidepressants, and was finally getting better. My therapist said that I had finally gotten to the point where I wasn't even depressed, technically. Now that I'm back in the swing of normal, I can't stand it. It's driving me insane. I just feel angry at the world.

Any advice for a stranger?",17Oct2020,1
3,"So about 5 months ago I was at the worst time in my life, anxious, depressed and suicidal with an ED, among other problems. Then I decided to move to a completely different state, when I was preparing and moving all of my problems got a little better. When I was getting moved into my new place and finding a new job, it seemed that I was all better, I didn't feel depressed, anxious, I was eating regularly, now I'm settled in a new state, with a new house, job, and living regular life again. But since I've moved, everything seemed to creep back in slowly, and now I'm starting to feel all those things again. I want to feel like I did 4 months ago, was I just busy and that's why I wasn't depressed? What do I even do",17Oct2020,1
4,"So my ex is really, really depressed and he sounds suicidal. he'll text things like ""I'm going to sleep now and hope I dont wake up"" ""I dont think I care anymore"" he doesnt talk with anyone save for his parents. I dont know much about his situation as we both live in different countries. I know it's against the rules to ask for a private message but I would like if I could chat with someone via PM. 
I'm so worried about him, he wants to do this alone. I know I cant force him to get help but there must be someone I can be there for him.",17Oct2020,1
5,"When does it stop?  Like i thought just make it past 25 and it will all even out.  Here I am 33.  Divorced, parent half the time.  Mother dead.  Father has cancer, in and out of the hospital with 6 months to live.  Tries to work things out with ex wife and she has cancer scare and cuts me out of her life.   I thought the anxiety and depression would ease but theyve only intensified.  I thought the self destructive behavior would stop but it persists.  I can recognize my inbalances but I cant balance them.  I just keep slipping.  Theres no other side of the coin.  Theres no backside of the curve.  15 years between here and 18 and all the same issues.  No roots and no future.  The whole world could end and id be happy to pop some popcorn and watch it all come crashing down.  I hate everything and everyone.  The only thing in my life that even matters is my 5 year old.  After 7 days together I feel nothing bit numb and worthless now that hes gone.  There is no end to this.  Theres no it gets better.   Theres no corner to turn.  This is forever.  I am worthless.  No one will ever love me.  Everyone disappears.  And proximity to death is the only thing that makes me feel alive.",17Oct2020,1

I have some anger issues that I'm trying to work on but it's not easy and I snapped at my gf of 6 months (my longest relationship) and she threatened to end it and now every day I'm afraid I'm going to lose her.

I was raped when i was 17. I went to therapy for unrelated reasons and my therapist sexually harassed me after they knew i was transgender. I told my mom and all she did was laugh in my face, and then threaten to call the police when i said i want to kill myself. My girlfriend and i just broke up a few days ago because she couldn't handle my severe depression, and this is only after she cheated on me and we broke up before. I need friends.

17,"Hey guys, 

Idk if this is even the right forum to post this. This is my first time ever posting on reddit so please excuse me. I’m 20 years old right now and I’m currently at home because of the pandemic. I study abroad in America if that information helps. Anyways I have been dealing with depression for around 3 years now and never really have the guts to take any medications to help my depression. I did go to the school clinic for advising, but honestly it did not help much. I have been feeling extremely anxious and sad lately. I just feel like me depression is eating me alive. Sometimes I even have the thought of going to the kitchen, getting a knife and end my life. I know that there is a problem, and I’m trying to seek help at my home country. However, there are no psychiatrists in my area and it’s an Asian country so people’s opinions on mental health is still pretty bad. People still think that only crazy people have mental heath and the cure to depression is just simply be happier and get over it. I know that Zoloft is a commonly prescribed drug and I actually find a pharmacy that sells Zoloft without prescription (yes pretty illegal but law is kind of wrecked here. The law in my country is pretty relaxed concerning prescribing drugs). My question is that should I buy it and take it without a doctor’s prescription? I know it is really dangerous but I feel so hopeless. I really feel that I am alone fighting this battle.

20,"
I have been through a rough time coming out from my traumatic past. I was harassed and ever since that happened, i was mentally and emotionally affected, suffering from anxiety and depression. I became distant and unsociable. So it takes plenty of time for me to really get comfortable, to even talk to someone. 
Recently i got in touch with my former schoolmate after years, and we met a few times in the last 2 months. He’s been a good friend. As we talk, we shared our experiences and past events. I told him that i was harassed few years back, and he asked me to move on from that. After that day, he stopped texting and calling me, he only replies me when i text him. The way he talk to me has changed- more like a formal conversation. 
This really bothers me so much. I don’t get comfortable with people easily and when i do, i get attached to them. I’m lost on what to do, and i just don’t want to lose a good friend.",17Oct2020,1

There’s just so much stress from school, it’s all piling up and I don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to leave my bed. Many times in a day I just want to grab my meds and overdose. All this work I’m doing, it’s probably all for nothing. My work is garbage compared to others so why should I try. It’s useless. I’ll never get anywhere in life. I can never sleep on time now a days, ever since quarantine hit I haven’t had a good sleep. Maybe once but otherwise I stay up so late to the point I look like a raccoon in the morning. This stress from school really not good when my other problems are getting worse and worse. It’s making everything worse. It’s hard to do anything, to sleep, eat, do work, or even leave my bed. I can’t stay in bed because all I do is think about overdosing. But it’s hard to leave. I just want to grab the stupid meds and die real bad. There’s so many other things that I have bottled up but don’t wanna talk about. It’s just all this is bothering me a lot.",17Oct2020,1
22,"I say that really casually. But it's the truth. I hate him. I've never smiled at him since 9 years old. He always scolds me, swears at me for everything and anything. It's so exhausting. I thought he did it bc he cared, that he wanted the best for me but no. He screams at me all the time. How useless I am, how I'm a disappointment.

It was fine til I was young, 8 or something, I really liked him back then. But then as I grew older, he started making me feel more and more unwanted. He's pretty pedophilistic too. I'll be sleeping and he'll kiss my cheek, right besides my lips and WON'T stop til I wake up and push him away. I wear shorts in my house usually, and he'll make these comments, ""I want to lick you"", ""I'll bite you on your ass"" and it makes me really uncomfortable. When I was 11 something, he said, ""I wanna give you raspberries on your stomach"" and then he scooted right over and did it, I tried to move and push him off but he's way stronger than I'll ever be.

I don't know what to do, who to tell. He makes me want to kill myself. I want to live, but I don't want to live with him, I don't want to be near him. It's been going on for about 8 years now. I really hate this. When I was younger, I had written this letter to my mom saying that I was sorry for all she had to go through, he'd fight with her a lot too. I apologized and said that I should've never been born, that it was my fault for being alive. That man made me regret being alive at 9 years. I want help, I really do. But I can't get it. I want to go away, with my mom but I can't. Everytime an argument starts between whoever, it always ends him bashing me and swearing at me.

I really want to kill myself, at least I won't have to see him again.",17Oct2020,1

It’s like the word got wiped from my memory, and Maybe a day later the word will randomly pop into my head. At first it would happen maybe every once and awhile, so it wasn’t really a concern.

25,"Hi guys, I’m posting as a parter of someone who suffers from depression, anxiety and PTSD. We’re having a bit of trouble in our relationship and I believe her mental health is suppressing her feelings towards me. She recently expressed to me ‘it’s hard to love someone when you can’t even love yourself’.

She started reading recently so I’d like to buy her an enjoyable self care/love book to try and help her love herself again. I don’t know where to start looking for this kind of book so could anyone recommend some good ones ideally suited to a younger mind? She is 24.

Any other tips and tricks would be much welcomed on things I can try to do to help her. I don’t want this to be the cause of the end of our relationship, she thinks I’d be better off without her and it kills me because I feel helpless😢

27,"We want to seek help but dont wanna know how fucked we really are because we think knowing the issue will somehow make it worse instead of providing a sense of security... Or atleast thats what i think. Cant speak for anyone else.

My mom went to the doctors the other day and they told her she has heart issues. The reports dont look good and my relationship with her has always been strained. Ever since that day, she's been trying to leverage these reports against me. And I'm losing hope really fast. 
I always held onto the fact that maybe, somehow I'll be able to fulfill my dreams but now that slim possibility is getting slimmer everyday. My mom has been unemployed for the last decade and now that she's 46, i dont think she's gonna get a job anytime soon. We live off of our grandparents pension and they're really old. I worry that they'll just die.

In these circumstances, one could say that i need to work my ass off even more. Grind till i make it. And till the last few months i did that. I did my best and reached a level. But now I'm just tired. 
Grinding is good yes, but only when you've supporting pillars. People like friends, family maybe your partners... 
My friends have helped me a lot but i guess this is the peak help I'm gonna get. My fam is always fighting amongst themselves and is just... At each others throats. Theres never a quiet moment that i get to live or enjoy. I dont even have a significant other who i can share everything with cause luck doesn't seem to be on my side... i cant just ask my friends to do something they wont be able to do or cant do...

I'm just tired. I need help but i dont wanna know how fucked i am. I wanna drive myself to success but i cant do that. I cant just *reboot* or get over it cause thats what I've always done. I just want (for once)... Yknow what... Idk what i want at this stage...

28,"Scared

The guy i dated, he scares me so much... he became depressed a year ago and i don’t recognize him anymore. He used to be the sweetest, most caring guy I know. He was awkward, afraid of horror movies and he never dared to be late.

But now he is so cold. He doesn’t care about anything anymore. He barely texts me back, he lost many friends and the ‘sparkle’ in his eyes is gone...

I have been texting him every month or so (we agreed he would try to text me back). And he tries to sound interested when he manages to text, but i know that deep down he doesn’t give a shit. He doesn’t want to see me because he doesn’t feel like doing anything and he is ashamed of himself... i also think he believes he isn’t worthy of me and pushes me away because of it. When i asked him to come to theaters with me he said; ‘why, there are so many others great guys you could go with. I am not a nice person to be with’. And i was like; ‘but i want to go with yoú’. And that almost made him cry...

32,"Ok first of, I'm sorry. English is not my native language so this text might be full of mistakes. Also this is probably gonna be a long rant I am sorry for you that you have to read this. I'm gonna talk about suicide and no will to live. I'm new to this community (actually this is my first time posting anything anywhere at all) and I am really sorry if this is the wrong community or just not ok to post at all. 

That being said, I want to tell you about myself. I'm a 20 year old woman, I have a little brother and my parents are still together. I have few, but good friends, I finished school two years ago and since then I've been working with disabled children. One year ago I moved out to live closer to work (a school for severly disabled children with boarding home) and I like my new live with my roommates. So far, so good.
On the outside everything was always perfect at home, but I guess it wasn't. I was never abused or anything like that! It was just that I would have wished for more support and understanding. My first memories are trying to protect my little brother from getting yelled at, having to see and hear all the screaming and arguments between my parents and just making sure he was happy. For as long as I can remember I keep imagining that somebody approches me and asks me, if I would want to die right now if they promise me that it won't hurt. And the answer has never been ""no"". In school I was bullied I guess? I mean it never felt like bullying to me - other kids never like me and were always mean and adults never cared- thats just how it is... But it was never really bad. Just not nice...  

In autum/ winter 2014 I was in a really bad place. I started cutting myself, I cried myself to sleep every night and for the first time I actually made a plan how to kill myself. I promised myself that I would never get 18, never finish school, never move out and never work. So when everyone was thinking about what they wanted to be when they grow up or where they would want to live - I never thought about it because I never thought I would get this old. At this time I told noone. Noone knew. I eventually got better by myself. When the  spring came I hadn't attempted suicide and I had stopped cutting myself. 

Over the next few years I would still hurt myself sometimes but it wouldn't be cutting anymore. And while I got older, got 18 and finished school - I still never thought about what I wanted to be. It still felt like I wouldn't need to... 

I got my currant job kind of accidentaly but I loved it! The first year was the best time of my life. I felt like I could be enough for the first time ever and I actually thought that it might be possible for me to have a future as a special needs teacher. I still wouldn't have said ""no"" if I got the question wether I wanted to die or not, but I just tried not to think about it and everything would be alright. And this time my best friend opend up about her depression and suicidal thoughts and I tried my best to be there for her. And for the first time ever I told someone about myself. She is totally better now! She is so so brave and strong and she'll be alright, I'm sure. 

So when I moved out I also started working in a different group and it was hard. My colleages were really mean sometimes, the work itself was very demanding and physically draining and I had to work crazy hours so that I had nothing besides work. I worked, ate (pretty little because I felt sick often) and slept (poorly I might add). Last christmas I started cutting again and I spirald down since then. I opend up to a few friends since then and one of them made me see a therapist (that was about eight months ago). But it was kind of a bad one I think? He never took my SH or my suicidal thoughts or my disorded eating behaviors serious and a few weeks ago I stopped seeing him. I told him that I want to die, that I don't want to live anymore. That I have nothing I want to achieve, that everything seems useless and nothing holds any value anymore. I'm just so fucking tired of living and I feel like I well passed the point where I would have wanted and profited from help. He then told me that suicide would be my only option then and that he couldn't do anything to help and it wouldn't be his job to so either. That nobody would be able to help me. I felt so alone and lost that day... 

Since then I started to plan. I wrote letters, thought about the how and where and when. I'm just done! I tried so fucking hard and it's still shit! I finished school, started working, tried therapy - and now I sit with suicidal thoughts and SH behavior thats never been worse, according to my GP I'm about to develop an eating disorder, my family knows nothing and all my friends who know, want to see me in a clinic. I cry almost every day at work and the only things that gets me through my day is the promise to myself that I won't have to do this for much longer. Life just feels pointless. It always has! I remember that even as a child I asked my teacher why people stay alive. We're all gonna die! So why suffer through all this shit, all this responabilitys and all this work, if we could just go now? 
The only thing keeping me alive at this point is that planning and commiting suicide seems too exhausting. I have to get my shit together, clean up, wrote all the letters left and organise everything. But I hope so fucking much that I soon will find the courage to do all these things and finally do it. I'm done! I don't plan on living much longer. I even haven't bought a winter jacket yet (although I'm feeling so so cold all the time) because I don't think I'll need it. I would need a new pair of glasses but I don't think it would pay of to get them now.

I'm not as good at my job as everybody thinks/ says I am, actually I'm pretty bad - so they wouldn't miss me at all! My family is used to living without me, now that I moved out. My brother is old and strong enough to defend himself now. My best friend profits nothing from our so called friendship and she'll be able to see how toxic I was, once I'm gone. I'm sorry for all the peolpe I told about my problems because I'm afraid they might feel responsible which they aren't!

I don't even know why I began to type this text or what I hoped to happen anymore. I'm pretty sure that noone is gonna dead this shit anway...

33,"1- so I can't maintain eye contact with anyone .specially my teachers. It feels so uncomfortable.and the reason like I don't know the answers or I don't understand what they are saying or I am sleepy won't apply.i just find it very uncomfortable.
2-i become very anxious when something new happens like the hand shaking can't breathe heavy heart just scary kinda anxious.
3-i can't talk to anyone other than my family and three friends without being anxious or uncomfortable.i also become very uncomfortable when I talk to unknown people....I just can't interact with them .
4-i also feel like I don't understand what I really am feeling or whats going on with me.like I really don't even realize I am hurting due to something and some article on psychology today makes me question if something is hurting me.....but I have been told that it happens to everyone 
5-i feel very uncomfortable when someone talks to me nicely or implies or makes it look like they are fond of me.
6- I just sometimes get triggered and cry but I don't even know why ...but it just hurts and I cry.
7-i find it very uncomfortable if someone touches me...even family...I suddenly became aware of it and I don't like the feeling....and I specially find it uncomfortable when some male touches me...dad and brother are like okay okay but anyone other than that....I flinch or just its bad I hate it.anf no I am not the conservative kind or whatever.

I studied in a coaching institute hostel (NEET chaitanya) and that was pretty bad experience for me.i more or less cried thrive a week at least.
And used to punch walls break mirrors throw plates slam doors and yeah .
I really liked studying before hostel...I wasn't some   scholar kinda person but I was pretty invested in science.....but after I came back from hostel due to lockdown ...I avoided studying like the plague.....i don't know if its an excuse but studying maybe kinda reminded me of all the sad thoughts I had in hostel.
Now I officially screwed up my next (519) and am gonna take drop this year.
I just hope the new coaching institute people wouldn't be barbaric.
I don't mind the 5 and 7 ...I ll live with them but I need help with others .

Do I need a therapist  or lifestyle changes would do.

My parents have threatened to take away my phone if I don’t go sit in a google meet with my teacher even if I don’t have questions. My parents have been arguing a lot. I actually began self-harming because of everything going on, something I’ve never done before now. I hate my life, I’ve hated it sense middle school. My parents aren’t abusive I think. They don’t hit me, they just fight and then yell at me. Saying things like “It’s as if you wanted this to happen,” or “You don’t care, do you?!” And “You would’ve been held back if we never helped you.” I just hate it I feel like I’m a constant failure and I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s gotten to the point where I’m contemplating weather I even want to live anymore. I don’t have any motivation to do my therapy anymore, and my individual therapist outted to my mom, after I begged her not to while having a crisis, that I have online friends and discord. Now my mom is threatened to not let me talk to them if I don’t do stuff for her. I hate this, I hate my life and I honestly don’t know what to even do anymore.",17Oct2020,1

37,"I have been working for a large bookstore chain for six years. I started out as a customer service worker, moved to management, but the stress was too much and I asked to be bumped down to a different job. I told my manager that I would take fill whatever position she needed me to do. So she stuck me in our cafe. Now I hate cafe. I hated doing breaks for cafe when I was a co-manager. But I said I would do what was needed of me, so I tough it out.  

Part of the deal was that I could work longer shifts to have more of the week free because I thought my families small business would be more profitable and make up the difference. Blah blah blah. So to get to the point, I have chronic pain and work 10 hr shifts and sometimes I’ll be so busy I won’t be able to take a break for 2 or 3 hrs. The pain from this makes me depressed and the depression in turn makes me hurt and then put off some of my lesser duties and feel shame for that. Does anyone else have a similar pain problem. And what could you suggest I do about it?",17Oct2020,1
38,"I just want to put my story out there for men who are struggling with depression, anxiety and coping with substance use.  I have big family, 7 member including me and tons of relatives.  I think being in the large family make my illness un-notice for many years, because I don't feel physically alone, yet I still feel distance from them. I grow up lonely, in isolation and vast emptiness and I can never figure out why. Due to social economic and family circumstances and the typical dynamic of asian family, my parent don't interact with my sibling emotionally, mostly just taking care of basic human need. I was somehow critical of my family. After all parents not supposed to be fight and yell infront of their children and supposed to be emotionally encouraging right?

Having witness the episodes over and over again push me further away.  I don't talk much, really afraid of people judging and laughing at me, critical of everything, just going through routines day after day and don't think about future.  Only know I know depression make me have very lows self esteem, negative view about my surrounding and future.  I don't have any goal in life and don't know what i want or value.  I went through 20s, 30s like a zombie, getup, work, home, dinner, t.v, sleep, repeat.  I can't find any joy in anything and feel like work is just to pass time and earn money. I am angary most of the time, and got easily irritated.  This cause my personal interaction with pushy, micro managing and in your face mom and meek dad less than positive.  I am very defensive and often resort to yelling when my personal boundaries are crossed or message was not received.  

I cope my depression with hobbies after hobbies, pets, buying spree, gardening and eating out.  Work was long and little energy i have left, was just for me.  Well this make me a lousy money saver, non-goal oriented and friend to people I know and unproductive at home in helping around the house or taking care of family.  Each year become more empty and lifeless for me as watching sibling get married, nieces growing up and while I am just doing the same routines.  That leave to coping with substance to the point that my life was just work and passing my free time numbing my sadness.  Putting a happy face and pretending someone who is not my true self. Also this is moments I was getting more vocal and verbally abuse to my parents. Long story short, I moved out, family try to warms me about my substance use through indirectly.  I got angry and used more substance to cope with the pain to the point I cut my family tie and quit my job.  After all, my decades of emotional pains and the 'demon' in my head is larger than any pain i have to deal in life.

Only after losing family, identity, dignity and over a year of isolation and replaying the events, I processed all the past events and feel like a new wiser, older me is slowly emerging.  But the damage is done. No more friends. Family occasionally contact me to make sure I feel the pain I caused to family.  They are smiling at me, but in their mind, I am like 'drop dead'.  I am more in control of my finance and interpersonal relationship and dealing with my painful button being push often.   I pay attention to my mental health with medication and through therapy.  I finally have a goal going back to school for a new career and I can't wait to see what come in the future. I am still dealing with my illness and while navigating life daily.  I try to be productive so the long hour of me being sad and lifeless was less painful. I am grieving over all the lost and pain, facing unfamiliar and uncomfortable emotion like, it head on, instead of hiding away.  Someday my brain is so foggy and the pit in the stomach and anxiety I feel was over too much to bear.  Though of ending my life come across a few time.  Once I took full prescription of sleeping, but end up throwing up and feeling lousy.   I stay strong facing social stigma in school and people treating me like either a mental retard or a monster who cause great deal of pain to the family.  I still haven't experience love and deep connection, socially still challenging. Everyday is a struggle and I know its a fight worth fighting.  Love and hugs to all those facing the same challenge daily like me.",17Oct2020,1

40,"19 and I spend most my time at home. My main friends are working full time, leaving me to find some friends online to play with on my extra time. That usually leaves me to hang with my friend kong I've known online for years. I guess I messed up by kicking him from the party when my best friend was talking about some personal stuff. Kong won't let that go and has took it too far. He's been ghosting me, trying to make my friends ditch me by consistently asking them to play games I don't play. He's been poking fun at me more than usual, and as of yesterday he acted like he wasn't getting me invites but left me for an hour trying to figure out how to join on purpose just to text me all this rude stuff saying I'm annoying, and it's karma for kicking him. Honestly he's clearly the child here, but I still apologized and he doesn't care. My best friend called this out a while ago telling me he's obviously toxic but I decided to keep him around now I'm sitting here looking like a fool of a took. This isn't the first time I've lost friends it happens to often tbh and I just hate this feeling of loosing future memories. Hate this feeling of knowing you both said to much to go back to normal. I just wish he'd just take the apology and move past it. Can't blame him completely, I'm definitely not nice when you ghost me but at least I made the leap to move past it, just wish that feeling was mutual. Looks like I need to hunt for more Xbox friends again : (",17Oct2020,1

43,"The title aside, I feel like suicide would be shitty way to help myself. I kill myself and then what? Family cries, friends and colleagues wondering why as they had no idea ( because they never really cared) but I’m still dead. 

I for one have accepted my shitty existence but still hope to see a better world. Killing myself is firstly a disservice to myself. Whatever the future brings is better than an eternity of nothing.",17Oct2020,1
44,"Six months ago, I made an absolutely amazing online friend who happens to be suffering from severe depression and dangerous thoughts. We have been talking to each other almost every day on varying topics from politics to puppies, conversation tends to flow. However, as someone who does not suffer from depression, I do not want to come off as overbearing/clingy by messaging them, but I also do not want to come off as if I forgot about them or that I don't care. How do I manage this fine line? 

I often worry when I do not hear from them, as they have expressed that they are tempted to ""just cut everyone off, and end it."" I have taken steps to learn about depression, and make every effort to support my friend as recommended. However, I am unable to force them to seek professional help, or check on them if they go radio silent. Any advice?",17Oct2020,1
