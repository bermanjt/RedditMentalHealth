1,"This post may make no sense but, sometimes I get envious of the girls in my class who have panic attacks infront of everybody and all of a sudden everyone focuses on them. I'm to ashamed to have panic attacks, or cry or do anything vunerable infront of people. I knew this person who was basically on the same level as me but they would act out about their mental illness and it made it seem like they were more deserving of help than i was and im just faking it. I've had so much self control in my life and have been so good at hiding my pain that i feel like if it comes out people would just think i lost my shit and im insane, even though its all always been there, just locked up in my brain.",29Oct2020,1
2,"I am not myself in depression, but a good friend of mine clearly is. She has family problems, like real hard ones, trouble at school, with friends, u know... I really want to help her, but I am running out of ideas, I have never been trough something similar. She has suicide ideas. She harms herself. I am genuinely scared. Do y'all have any tips, any community you know where she could get help, literally anything will help. Thank you",29Oct2020,1

4,"Hey, guys.

So I guess a little background info. I'm 31 years old, my girlfriend is 33. She's had a bad history of trauma, abuse, and lost her son when he was 3. I myself have a pretty rough past with friends dying from drug overdoses, suicide, childhood neglect from parents, etc.

Anyway, I came here because I can't talk about this with my girlfriend as I don't want to upset her, and I don't really have any friends that I can pour out to, about my side of things, or about how I'm feeling, you know? Keeping it to myself is really destroying me.

Without warning, my girlfriend attempted suicide last Wednesday. Her ex came back into her life and was threatening to rape her niece and kill her family and me one by one unless she killed herself first. She blacked out and did it, almost succeeded, and was found by her sister in time.

When I found out, I was absolutely broken. There was no warning, there was nothing. She was laughing and talking with me on the phone the night before.

I wasn't able to talk to her and had to rely on communication through her sister. I've been shaking bad, really distressed, heart racing, can't sleep, won't eat right, don't go to the gym regularly anymore, etc. So yeah, it's really broken me in ways that I couldn't imagine myself being broke.

I take it personal because my father attempted suicide in my arms while intoxicated over the death of my step mother. I also lost my best friend to a deliberate drug overdose. He was 29 at the time. So I went through every kind of emotion that you can imagine, from rage, anger, confusion, depression, and happiness that she was at least alive.

Her and I are long distance at the moment, but have known each other for years, started dating in August. So I tried to write her poems and leave sweet and encouraging messages to her. Her sister managed to sneak the phone in with her during a visit (she's still at the hospital). So I can talk to her. She's very nonchalant about the whole thing when we speak, and doesn't seem phased at all about the absolute heartbreak she has caused me. I know that this isn't about me, and I'm sorry if that makes me selfish, but it really hurts that I wasn't even considered. Still, I try to offer words of encouragement every day to her.

I found out she was flirting with a guy on one her of social media accounts by accident, while she was in the hospital. It's honestly really destroyed me and I decided to bring it up (I know I shouldn't have) Even though I tried to bring it up as delicate as I could, it caused a big argument with me being made the bad guy about everything. She's extremely defensive because of her past, and it's been tough trying to get around that. 

I guess I'm posting this because I feel absolutely lost, heart broken, crushed, and numb. I'm abusing my anxiety medication and I've given up my sobriety for drinking now. I really love her and I guess I thought she did too. How can something so good get so fucked up so fast?

I guess I just wanted a friend, or even a stranger, just some advice on what to do, how to fix this, how to survive, etc. I want to cry, but there's just nothing left. I'm slowly rotting away in my room.",29Oct2020,1

6,Hi I'm new to reddit and I'm pretty young (12y) and I am currently having depression witch is really affecting my mental health and it has started to get very bad. My self esteem is in the ground and I'm beginning not being able to take it that's how bad it has gotten. Please I really need some help.,29Oct2020,1
7,Apparently im not allowed to have bad mental health days and be tired from pretending to be fine all day at work because today I asked my roommates if I could do my part of cleaning tomorrow instead of today. They asked why and I was honest and said that I was having a bad mental health day and I just wanted to sleep after work because I was mentally exhausted. My roommates threatened to kick me out for “making up excuses” to get out of doing my part if I didn’t clean right then and there because apparently im just lazy.,29Oct2020,1
8,"Thought this may help to inspire. God knows I’m not all the way there yet, but we all gotta keep going. 

In 24 days, I will be twenty nine years old; and much is on my mind. It is heavy in my mind, body, and spirit. I am someone that didn’t think that I would live to 21. I am someone that has suffered day in and day out in mostly silence. I have been suffering from PTSD, anxiety, Schizophrenia, and severe and manic depression since I was about seven years old. Twenty one years later I reflect on the times where I’ve not wanted to live and yet I kept pushing. I want to give up so much of the time, but I refuse to. Why? I’m not a quitter. But I am over feeling this pain inside. Going ahead into this new year in life, I want to do better by me. I want to really treat myself better than I do. The pain that has caused me to be this way, isn’t going to define me. I am who I want to be. And it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, says, or does.

I’m not defined by being abused as a kid, I’m not defined by the suicide attempts, I’m not defined by people calling me a stupid shit because of my Aspergers, I’m not defined by anything. I decide my own lane. 

If anyone on here needs to talk, message me. We’re all in this together.",29Oct2020,1
9,"First of all, I despise that expression: ""overcome depression"" because some people use it to say you are still depressed because you are too weak and you need to ""take responsibility"" or something akin to that. These people are like the pharises on the bible: they preach but don't practice, talk about love and show no mercy.

But even if I despise that expression, I do believe it is true: You DO overcome it.

Anyways, I wanted to give a realistic ilustration how it feels.

First of all, SPOILER ALERT for those who have not seen  the James Bond movie ""Casino Royale""

In this one scene, James Bond crashes during a car chase and is captured by the bad guy, striped naked and tied to a chair with hole in it. Then the bad guy proceeded to grab a rope with a weight at the end(something similar to the medieval weapon called ball and chain)and whip Bond's balls from under the chair.

This guy wants a password from Bond and, after whipping bond a couple of times, asks him to give it or to lose his balls basically. Bond responds: ""I've got an itch down there. Would you mind?""

So this guy won't say no and whips Bond again mercilessly, and Bond says: ""No! To the right!""

Then another whip and the agent yells in pain and laughter: ""Yes! Now the whole world is gonna know that you died scratching my balls!""




So there you go. That is how my bad days feel like right now. There is still pain, of course, but I laugh in the face of my self destructive impulses because there is no way I'm giving them access to my soul.

Cheers and good night.",29Oct2020,1
10,"So just a few months ago i learnt the hardest news I’d have to swallow at the time, that my dad wasnt really my biological father and it was really hard for me to process and to accept and thats where i think my root of depression comes from, and to actually sit myself down and address that thats where my issues of drinking senseless and just making bad decisions was stemming from. I began to acknowledge it and address it as months have gone by but its just this really big weight that’s still on my shoulder and its currently affecting my relationships especially with my boyfriend who knows about it but i cant keep telling him that thats why I’m down sometimes or dont want to talk or communicate at all. Like i just want to be given my space in silence. I really suck at communicating during such times and its been taking a toll not to share and keep it bottled up cause I develop severe ulcers when that happens

Depression is a journey a within journey and it takes time. I’d just not want it to affect my life or my relationships with others. Any advice for anyone going through the same thing?",29Oct2020,1

15,"I've never posted here before, but I have nowhere else to turn. I don't know how to talk about my problems since nobody has ever tried to help me seriously, so I am just going to dump my thoughts out and I hope someone has good advice for me, otherwise I'm headed down a dark path. 

I'm 18 years old, and a University freshman. My entire life I've been prone to depressive episodes but it never hit me too hard, I could just power through it. Recently, in quarantine, my mental health has degraded significantly. I've left the house maybe 5 or 6 times since March. I spend pretty much all day in my room, blinds shut, door closed. I stopped going outside because my parents guilt me for wanting to go outside and see the friends I used to have, since they are considered elderly and are in more danger if they caught coronavirus. I barely eat anymore, maybe 1000 calories on a good day. I'm 6'1 and 103 lbs. As you can imagine, I do not feel good. My appetite has been gone for so long that all food disgusts me, I gag upon trying to eat even the simplest things, and feel like throwing up all day long. I was on medication to help suppress my nausea, but I ran out and can't get my prescription refilled. I'm extremely lethargic since I don't eat much, and its just creating a terrible positive feedback loop, where I get hungrier, then I don't eat, then I can't eat because I'm fucked up in the head, and I feel bad physically from not eating. I play a lot of League of Legends, but it no longer fills me with joy like it did years ago, just anger. I constantly contemplate my own suicide, but I never want to think these thoughts, they are just so invasive and I can't get them out of my head. A couple weeks ago I was seconds from slitting my wrists when I broke through for a second and was able to put down the knife and get it out of access. I feel as though I have no purpose, no ambition, no drive, and no reason to continue my pitiful life. Nobody will remember me for anything significant, once everyone I knew during my life is dead, it will be like I never existed, nobody to remember me. Writing these words down really made me realize it too, I just had to stop writing so I could cry a bit.  

I simply don't know what I can do anymore. I've never tried antidepressants, but I may try them soon. I smoke a lot of weed, but that's not doing much for me. I should probably quit, alongside quitting nicotine too. Please, someone out there give me advice. How do I turn my life around? Grades in school are not an issue, I have always had, and still have, straight A's. This means absolutely nothing to me if I don't make it to my graduation due to suicide. 

I have no reason to be depressed, and that is the issue. I have no idea what the source of my depression is, so I'm unable to tackle it. I just feel ill, both physically and mentally. Is it possible that I just rolled a bad pair of dice with my life? Am I just doomed to be mentally ill? Should I just kill myself now to avoid years of pointless suffering? These are some of the thoughts that invade my head.

I know this post is horribly disorganized and thats honestly because my brain is in shambles. I can barely hear my own thoughts over the voice (my voice?) telling me to kill myself. I'm sorry. If anyone actually took the time to read this, please guide me, I'm at rock bottom. I feel like my real personality, the real me that I used to be when I was younger, is being locked away behind my depression which has taken over completely. I'm just a husk.",29Oct2020,1
16,"Hi, 

My name is JJ, Im 15 and I honestly don't know if I am truly depressed or not. My parents are very against the idea of mental health issues and they haven't gotten me tested, though I've been extremely sad and suicidal since I was about 7. I recently had an alcohol overdose and I was hospitalized for a few days, where the people that I thought were my friends (They were the reason for the alcohol overdose) didn't care enough to visit me. My mom decided to keep me from school for 3 weeks and I have had an overwhelming amount of makeup work. As well as many issues with me having breakdowns in private and blowing up on my GF and my actual friends have made me more depressed and anxious. I also have been projecting a lot on to the people they actually care about me such as my GF and my real friends. I just feel as if I am never really happy. I honestly have thought about and attempted suicide so many times to the point where I feel as if it won't help me in any way.

I just want to feel normal, I want to know what it's like to be truly happy.

If someone could help me with any support or suggestions for my happiness I would appreciate it.",29Oct2020,1

And I fucking ruined it by being overly sensitive and thinking that people were being unfair to me when they weren't. I just don't know what to do. I can't stop hurting. I fucking hate myself so much. Why the hell should I even keep living if I can't do something that I loved so much, that was so improtant to me.",29Oct2020,1

19,"I have been in a chronic deep depression for almost 50 years.  I’ve tried just about everything and made not a dent.  One week or less a year it lifts and I get to see what life could be like, and it’s magical. Then the soul sucking darkness rolls back in. So having finally reached the figurative, last house on the block, I decided to try one last thing, Ketamine Infusion Therapy, and it’s a fucking miracle!

So one of the 5000 things I did before Ketamine was writing and repeating affirmations, “you’re great, you’re wonderful, you can do anything!” But the thing was, in my case, with the depth of my depression, there was a second voice always there, 24/7, so it sounded like  “you’re great at nothing you piece of ahit, you’re wonderful according to no one since everyone thinks you’re an asshole, you can’t do anything, you will fail at everything!”

So after my 6th round of ketamine I tried it again, just to see and...the voice isn’t there! Days, two weeks later, it still wasn’t there.  

Now I waited until I was much older to do this, so I have built up a huge amount of facts to support my old loser view, so it’s going to take a lot more digging to stay out of the hole, but I’ve got a shot.

If you are a lifelong depressive in your 20’s, 30’s or younger, DO THIS TODAY!!!!! And don’t do the bs nasal spray fake one. Spend the money, do the real deal KETAMINE! it’s a life changer.

If you are in your 40’s or 50’s like me, DO THIS TODAY!! The fact we are still alive is a freaking miracle, so do something with it.",29Oct2020,1

21,"At the beginning of this year I would cut myself almost every single day. I would not eat more than 1000 calories a day. I would constantly think about cutting my wrists or scratching them with my nails. But, somehow, I managed to stop. Maybe 2020 indeed sucks. Maybe my mind is still full of self-loathing thoughts. Maybe I still have anxiety attacks and feel awful for literally no reason. But stopping self-harm was my small victory this year. And I want more small victories. My today's small victory is summoning the courage to tell the world about my small victories. And even if I don't actually *feel* it, I know, that deep inside my heart I'm proud of myself.

23,"So I am a freshman in college and it's obviously been really hard for many reasons. I have definitely reached a low point this week. I have entered one of the worse depressive episodes of my life. It doesn't help that I'm living in a half empty room because my roommate didn't come for the semester because of Covid. So it's much easier for me to lie in bed most of the day and not keep up with my hygiene as much (trust me I wish this wasn't the case, I'm not gross lol).

Anyways it's 5:40am and I am procrastinating. I am supposed to present tomorrow for a class and I haven't started the Powerpoint or the paper that goes along with it (I have to send them to the prof by 10). So I'm considering telling the school that I have Covid symptoms, meaning I will not have to go to class and they will bring food to my door etc. I wouldn't have to present bc we don't use zoom in the class and students have missed their day before. 

Do you think that this is a good solution to my current misery, since I can just go back to sleep and not worry about it until Tuesday, or will I just be creating more stress for myself and giving in to my poor mental health?? 

Also I am scheduled to do another presentation for the same class on Tuesday... so I would pretty much be doubling the work for myself. Jesus they really aren't making this shit any easier for us. I've never been so stressed out in my life.

I know that the right answer is to just suck it up and do the work right now, so if anyone can just help me with motivation that would be better than nothing.

26,"I have 2 brothers on the autism spectrum (Aspergers syndrome). Although I have been extremely privileged in my upbringing in the way that my parents have tried to do the right thing by us, encourage us to reach our potential. During my childhood and even now, however, my brothers will often become both physically and verbally aggressive and abusive, they lack empathy, they are manipulative, they will say horrible things and of course being my brothers they know what hurts me. While I will always love them, I was encouraged to seek help for possible impacts that my family life would have on me. Consequently, over the course of my life I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, depression, ADHD and PTSD. My issue is, I am fairly high functioning in the way that I can “push through” my mental illness symptoms, I finished school, I am 2 days from finishing my undergraduate degree and I have been accepted into masters. I have volunteered for 3 years, I work multiple jobs, I have a 5 year relationship. Despite all this, I never seem to be able to get rid of the dreaded feelings of being depressed, suicidal thoughts, I just don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t think I would actually do anything to myself, because I can not deal with the impacts it would have on my parents, but I just feel horrible all. The. Time. since I don’t have the ‘typical’ symptoms of depression that most people see as symptoms people would need help for eg. Staying in bed, crying etc. it seems that when I am really bad, I am just more negative in a general sense and most of my negative thoughts are kept inside my brain. 

So, considering this, although my parents are generally quite supportive, if I’m more negative or intolerant my mum will say things like “you’re so negative, you get me down, you make me sad just stop it”. I don’t need this because if I’m already feeling suicidal, how is meant to make me feel? I feel so guilty already about the burden I probably have on people.  I just don’t know how to feel better. I will seek help and see my professionals and I will feel better, but it’s the chronic depression feeling that I cannot get rid of. I’m on medication, I do meditation, I just don’t know what to do. :( 

Is anyone else have “high functioning depression” and deal with guilt tripping or whatever from this? Sometimes I wish I was just one to stay in bed and do nothing so that I can show how I feel on the inside :/",29Oct2020,1
27,"Throwaway- obvious reason. First post, on mobile. Apologize for any formatting...

Short story- my husband (42M) is depressed. 
He's been on and off feeling sad and empty for the last 10years- we've been together 11 years

He's tried therapy about 9 years ago for 2 weeks and ""didn't like it"". Won't agree to go back to see anyone. Even if I offer to go with with him 

He's not on any meds, doesn't want to be
We eat well and get regular exercise 
He can still function very competently for his work and when around other people is ""normal"". Very funny guy

Lately, at night, its the worst. He can't sleep, is very irrational, angry, calls me horrible names if I try to offer help or talk to him about anything. Lately, he's been banging his head against wall/door... talks about ending it all very frequently.

These last few weeks have been the worst I've experienced with him

I can usually talk to him and question what his thoughts are to offer comfort and can even make him laugh and he slowly breaks away from the very dark headspace but nothing is working this time

I take care of 90% chores, pets, other household stuff to try and keep our space calm and organized... generally if he's not working he's on couch, usually distracted on his phone 

I really need some advice on what else I can do.
I'm terrified I'm going to lose him

We are also living in another country away from immediate family. Due to Covid, haven't been able to be around many friends or take trips away/vacation which I think has compounded everything...

Any advice appreciated!",29Oct2020,1

33,"So I was prescribed Zoloft back in July for depression, anxiety and PTSD. Once I began taking the meds, this is what I experienced:

-muscle tension, twitching, clenching and tightness
-suicidal thoughts 
-worsened depression
-insomnia
-manic episodes 
-racing heartbeat
-diarrhea 


Not to mention, my sister was hospitalized after being on this medication for the same diagnosis. My primary care doctor and psychiatrist knew all of this and insisted that I needed to take MORE Zoloft. Needless to say, the side effects became intensified so I resolved to wean myself off on my own. At the highest, I was taking 100mg a day, so I went down to 50mg for a couple weeks and eventually went off entirely. However, a whole new set of issues has arrived and has persisted for exactly 1 week now:


-EXTREME vertigo. I counted 16 instances of vertigo within a 3 minute time span. This is constant, ongoing, even when I'm in bed. 
-Night sweats. Every night waking up in a pool of my own sweat, despite sleeping with all windows open and the fans on, and it's 45 degrees outside 
-loss of appetite and diarrhea, nausea
-intense sharp headaches


All of this has been extremely disorienting, painful and has done absolutely nothing for my depression or my other conditions. I went to the ER per my doctor's orders the day before yesterday, spent 6 hours there and went through all kinds of testing and they couldn't find anything wrong. They referred me to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist but refused to listen to me about the possibility that this has anything to do with Zoloft. My mom is an RN who has also had bad experiences with Zoloft, and she's extremely concerned because these symptoms are not only highly unusual, but also quite dangerous. According to her. And of course every single doctor in America likes to go on vacation every other week, so the idea of me seeing a doctor anytime soon is out of the question.

I'm currently in University but I'm struggling to keep up with work. I make to do lists and routines but I struggle to follow them or do any work at all. I just have no desire to do work at all and I feel like I have no energy for it at all. I have been on Prozac for a month and I was hoping it would help with this too but it hasn't really. Can anyone recommend any solutions?",29Oct2020,1

If any of you who see this post are in the Los Angeles area, and are willing to share with me and allow me to photograph you, go ahead and respond and I'll make sure your story is told. As I stated in my title I'll share some of my own insecurities:
I've always felt slightly responsible for my parents separating when I was young.
I've always felt less than a lot of people around me.
I've always felt insecure that I've never really had any real friends.",29Oct2020,1
36,"In the last 2 months my life lost all its meaning.It all started with my fathers sudden death.That alone took a big toll on me but everything just started getting worse from there.Shortly after he died me and my mom found out he had a severe gambling addiction that hid from everyone pretty much his whole life and left us in big debt.Soon after that we also found out he was cheating on my mom.In all this chaos I lost my job due to covid and to top it all off we lost our house today because we are not able to pay off the debt.

I feel very lost and dont know what to do anymore.My mom is mentally broken as well and i have to pretty much look after her now wich doesnt make things easier either.

Im trying to hold it all together but it dont know how much longer I can take all of this.Im not able to find a new job even tho im trying very hard.Ill soon be without anything and pretty much homeless if things stay like this.

Dont know where Im going with this but I dont see a way out and am falling down a dark hole deeper every day.",29Oct2020,1
37,"I don’t know how will i able to explain it but i will try my best! 
Well, i can say i have a pretty normal life! But there are times when i become pretty empty and sad and these experiences is something i think i create on my own mind by myself! 
Whenever i am alone with my thoughts ; there is always like a debate going on my head within my mind ! And i have to say that the debate goes pretty long ! One part of mind says one thing and the other part of mind says another and the debate goes on and on and by time i get more and more empty wandering with thoughts arguing with myself! Loosing self confidence more and more ! And most of my arguments ends up at one point and that is every problems are created by one single cause: selfishness or so called desire ! Nobody wants me ! Nobody gets me! Nobody understands me for who i am !

Sometimes i am alone in my room or dinning table just starring at one thing for a long time! 
And most of that time i get the chills on my back 
Like something is piercing straight through my back and i smile hoping maybe someone please stab me and make me free! To be honest i am very afraid of sucide ; i do have sucidal thoughts every often but i am sure i am too weak for that ! 
Thats why i often want someone to stab me in the back and i can actually smile for one moment! 
About my family, my parents live abroad and i live with my aunt! I am little introverted type and every time my parents video called me i just place a fake smile and say i am doing right: 
To be honest i am doing pretty good in my school and i top in my class but I don’t like school that much ! I thought to tell my aunt about it but my aunt is illiterate and have difficulties understand this i think ! Another reason I cannot do sucide because of my aunt! 
I think it is my brain’s fault for doing this ! Even before starting this post i had to guess many times about posting this like one part of my brain tells to write it and another part tells nobody will care to read it ! Idk who will read this all the way here because idk everyone have selfishness in them! I think i will end it here its 12 pm and i think i will end my day here!",29Oct2020,1

39,"I have chronic digestive issues (IBS I suppose) and it seems like 3-7 days a month I am in so much pain that I feel like I can't accomplish anything or even get out of bed for very long. I know that physical and mental health are intertwined, and I also know that some of the things that are the most helpful in managing my depression (yoga, walking, cooking healthy meals, etc.) are impossible to do when I am in pain. I also become a lot more hopeless about my future or my ability to accomplish pretty much anything. I start to doubt that I could ever be a good mother or partner, or that I'd be able to do what is expected of me if I am ever able to create a career for myself. 

Sometimes I feel like I am trapped in this cycle- my physical pain worsens my depression and then my depression worsens my physical pain- and I'm not sure how to break free. My pain isn't constant, of course, and IBS isn't even a serious condition, but it's enough to make me want to give up on myself every time I experience a flare up. My mood usually turns around when my stomach pain subsides but it is always temporary.

Any tips on how to deal with pain or an overall feeling of hopelessness?",29Oct2020,1
40,"I started Lexapro last December. It’s helped a lot. But sometimes I still fall into the same habits I was in when I was depressed even though I’m not depressed. 

I look visibly depressed even though I feel “okay” as in not depressed but still not great. 

I’m just very dissatisfied with life because I’m not learning anything in my classes, it’s all busy work. I’m taking care of my grandmother who drives me insane and triggers me because she’s so rude and reminds me of my abuser (she and my abuser are related). I’m not earning money right now because my family does not want me to work for the fear that I might expose her to COVID by accident. Talking to friends has been helping less and less. The rest of my family is very unsupportive and unsympathetic. 

Right now I have a plan to leave the house. I’m looking at apartments and set up things in motion so I don’t have to rely on staying with her. But it’s incredibly frustrating because there’s nothing I can do but wait till things are set for me to leave. 

It’s a different feeling than depression. It’s like...almost the same except I can go back and forth from wallowing. Whereas when I’m absolutely depressed, I have a hard time not wallowing.",29Oct2020,1

42,In February of this year I moved 1200 miles away from everyone I know to work at a job managing a vineyard at a winery. I have been doing this in my home state for a few years and felt like it was time to move on to the next step up the ladder. I feel like I was scammed into a shitty situation. My boss was not upfront with me about his leadership over me nor was he upfront about workplace conditions or atmosphere. They did very little to foster my passion for the industry and I feel like there is nothing left of my love for this industry. I have been fired as of today and am very depressed about not having the ambition and vision I once had. Anyone else have a similar experience in the past or any advice?,29Oct2020,1
43,"I'm new to Reddit so please don't just take the piss because I'm shit at asking for help and don't know what to do. My parents split up when my mum realised that she's gay so I live with her and her girlfriend during the week and with my dad at the weekend but don't want to add me being depressed on top of all that, but I don't have any friends and people just hate because anybody who knows me hates me within 2 months (if I'm lucky) so I feel like if I talk to my parents then it'll just make their lives worse and if I talk to anybody else, I know I'll just get laughed at since everybody fucking hates me unless they can get something out of me. So what should I do, I genuinely don't know what to do other than just slit my throat and hope it's quick",29Oct2020,1
44,"After reading the guidelines I know it says that people aren't allowed to diagnose, but im just wondering whether i should get checked out or not.

Aight so I'm going to get straight to the point and list the reasons why i think its a possibility that i have it.

My mom died on May 6th 2018, she was a single mom raising 4 children, me being the youngest. I can't explain into words how hard this hit me, I probably cried once a day for two weeks after that and all i had on my mind was the thought of how truly pointless life is, the thought of no matter how hard i try i won't ever truly escape my death.

Its been two years since then and my brother is my legal guardian now, life has changed a lot since then. Especially with myself being so much more ""mature"" as my family describes it (idk whether its a compliment or not but whatever). The rest is just gonna be the symptoms i have, so basically the actual important part

Extreme Sleepiness and Lack of Motivation: this is probably the worst of them all, my grades have taken an absolute nose dive over the past two years, so i'm in a weird spot where im too smart to be in normal classes, but not motivated enough to get anything higher than a 75 in honors classes. Zoom classes have made my grades absolutely horrendous since i don't have the pressure of seeing my teacher face to face and telling them i didn't do work. My highest grade currently is a high 60 and the rest are in the 30s. Sometimes i don't even attend the classes for the sole purpose of sleeping.

Social Anxiety: Its not so bad that i can't talk to people but i hate having to talk to other humans that aren't close family. Butterflies form in my stomach at the thought of big stupid ""family"" meetups where aunties and uncles I've barely seen act like they know me. 

Attachment Issues: I mean this as in i have trouble expressing that i do actually care about people that i care about. I kinda have a singular blanket emotion of either laughing, not caring, or being sarcastic. I always hope that my close family knows how much i care about them with my heart, but i never know whether i actually show it enough.

Lack of Crying: I have extreme trouble crying to something that's actually sad, only times that i can cry is when im laughing too hard.

Wow i wrote way too much. 
If you read it thanks, and if you have had depression tell me whether i should see a therapist about this or not.",29Oct2020,1
45,"When is it my turn to fucking be happy why do i have to make everyone feel happy and loved but in return i get called names or insult about my body living in this world sucks i can not even express myself around others anymore when i feel sad or suicidal or just want to say fuck when i am feeling angry nobody cares about my feelings or the fact that i just want to die my family wants to put me in the mental hospital and i tell them to fuck off i will just go somewhere alone and die in peace my girlfriend doesn't even care about me anymore she tells me to walk on egg shells in front of her family fuck it i am done. You all laugh about MEN'S mental health but guess what we cry we struggle we fucking have emotions to but you all do not care so tell what is the point in fighting anymore if you are just going to be a fucking oblivious cunt towards me.

49,"Hello reddit. I’m 20 years old and at a major rough patch in my life. I want to explain why I have suicidal thoughts so I’m just going to drop a self-talk that I had today:

I’m not trying for anyone I know irl to identify me so please excuse the &lt;words&gt; for actual names and specific things.

I’ve had another terrible day. I think I’m actually depressed. I have no care for doing anything and almost nothing has brought me joy. I have no motivation or initiative and it feels like I’m drowning in stress. Things that are stressing me out are my relationship crumbling with &lt;bestfriend1&gt; and &lt;bestfriend2&gt;, having to find someone to sublease for me next year and dealing with that, the unknown of living with &lt;newkid1&gt; and &lt;newkid2&gt;, this new job I’ve started that will put even more of a dent in my already limited free time, trying to decide which major to choose and feeling like both options might be bad ones, the current state of these extremely hard major classes and getting a bad grade in &lt;important class&gt;, finding an internship for summer 2022, my grade in &lt;other major class&gt;, having no hope in sight of having sex or a relationship, and feeling that I’m slowly going to lose all my friends. These feelings have caused me to think about suicide. I know that I’ll never do it, but that doesn’t mean there are days that I will want everything to magically go away and I know that suicide would do that. I couldn’t do it to my family and friends because I wouldn’t want to ruin their lives as a result. If I had no friends and family I probably would. I feel hopeless and bogged down with many different stressors and I don’t feel like I have any reason to try to improve my situation because of how many different things are bothering or stressing me. This is really unhealthy and I’m extremely bitter jealous and disgusted with &lt;former best friend&gt;, the guy who really caused a ton of problems for me. I have lost motivation in reading the book I was reading. I don’t know what to do, I will never tell my parents that I’m depressed or suicidal because they would freak out and it would negatively impact my life . I don’t know what to do though. I don’t want to fucking deal with all of this shit.

Please help me. I have no one to turn to and have no idea what to do. Feel free to dm me or comment any questions you have.",29Oct2020,1

51,"I'm not writing this because I think anyone cares or it's worth sharing, but sometimes it makes me feel a bit better to write it somewhere. Knowing someone sees it, even if it's just out of obligation or pity. I'm so tired of me. I'm no one. I've tried to hard to get no where. People say they like me but yet no one actually comes to me. I feel invisible, I've tried to participate in things online and make friends but it doesn't work. All my siblings have online friends, even ones who are super introverted like me. I guess I can't blame people - I wouldn't spend time with me if I had a choice. I've given up with trying to make friends. There's nowhere for me to go to meet likeminded people and those on the internet clearly aren't interested. I looked for other artists to try and befriend but no luck. Other like-minded artists who also are struggling to be seen don't want me.

But I'm not really an artist anyway. I like to think I'm decent but nothing I've done has any artistic value. People have said that I'm good yet no one cares to actually look. I'm good, but not good enough to be worth caring about. I don't share my work with anyone anymore. It made feel like garbage whenever I did. No mater the response, I felt like garbage and I hated it. I can barely even draw anymore, so it's not like it maters. When I do I also feel like garbage. I guess I'm just garbage all the time maybe. I had to stop following artists I liked because I was just so ashamed of myself. I don't know why but when I do talk about some of my interests and things, it's so obvious that no one cares, makes me feel like such a dumbass.

Man, I want to be proud of something I've done. I guess that's the whole depression thing, the lack of serotonin or whatever, I'm not a doctor. I start to think and I've never had the feeling of accomplishment or fulfillment. The only close thing I've done worthwhile is graduate from college. (And now I’m in debt for a life I don't want) When I was up on the stage I didn't feel good. I just remembering looking around and wanting to go home. Afterwards everyone was all in groups, so excited and taking pictures. I didn't know anyone. Put on a smile and take a picture because people say that I should be happy. I just wanted to sleep and forget about everything. I was so confused why I didn't feel… anything. A lot of the time I'm not sad or upset or anything. I'm just… nothing. I don't get it, why don't I feel? I don't get excited or happy or proud, I'm just…. Existing.

I'm so lonely. I'm so tired of posting online about how miserable I am. I wish I could do something that people cared about. I wish people actually cared about me for being me, not because I posted something sad online. Every time I look at something I like it just reminds me how I hard I try and fail everyday. I wish I would disappear and no one would have ever known I exist. Everyone says things get better, but it's all just gotten worse. Everyday is a chore. I get so jealous of everything, everywhere I look. People's skill, talent, friends, accomplishments, life. It's getting to the point where things that I used to distract myself with start making me feel like garbage as well. Everything is just a reminder of how garbage I am.

I'm tired of talking. I'm tired of trying. I wish I could stop thinking. I just want to sleep forever.",29Oct2020,1
