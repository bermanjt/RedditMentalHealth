I’ve (16M) been talking to a girl for a couple months and she’ll lead me on and then say she doesn’t want anything but the she comes back and the process just repeats, I’ve never been in a relationship and it this situation is really fucking with my emotions. Besides that my appetite has just been gone, I’ll go days where I don’t eat but I don’t even notice it and when I do eat, it usually feels forced. I spend like 22-23 hours a day in my room and I feel very fatigued and tired but it’s hard to sleep still. Other than that, I play sports, they’re basically my whole life, my college career will be based off of sports, etc. anyways, I have some pretty bad injuries and haven’t been able to play the past few months and idk if it’ll get better but whenever I think about it, I get really sad and I feel like I’m just broken and it’s pointless to even try and do things that make me happy anymore. I lost the urge to workout but I’m losing weight because I don’t eat. If anyone knows how to help with this or if I’m “depressed” please help me.",14Apr2020,2
1,"So basically in 2020 my depression has started to become major, or at least I feel like that's the case. Everyday I've been feeling down, and have felt a lack of motivation and a decrease in energy. I've been feeling huge amounts of guilt and remorse, and I've started to fear the passing of time, and change in general. I find my feelings really hard to explain, as theres quite a lot behind it. I want to see a professional about it, but I can't really because I'd have to tell my parents I want to go, and that wouldn't work out; my mum found out I was slitting my wrist, which I feel awful about because she claims she's worried about me and that makes me see myself as an awful person for causing grief to her, and she told me that whenever I feel down I have to talk to her. But first of all, I don't feel comfortable talking to her about most of the roots of my feelings, and second of all, whenever I do, she doesn't do anything about it, she just tells me to cheer up or something, and generally just doesn't understand how I feel. So basicallly, if I asked my mum to take me to a professional, she'd probably refuse to and tell me to tell her about my emotions. I'm not gonna ask my step dad because I hate him and he hates me. Moreover, I feel pretty crappy wanting to see a professional, as I know that most teens in the world probably feel the stuff I feel, and plus I don't even know if my feelings are a big deal. I might just be overreacting or attention seeking, I don't know. There are billions of people in the world, so my feelings don't have any worth, and there are millions of people who probably feel way worse. I don't think talking to an online person would help as they probably wouldn't be able to provide a diagnosis, and plus I feel that they would understand more if we were in a room together. Plus I emailed childline about my problems and they didn't really help.

What could I do? Is there a way I could see a professional by myself, without anyone knowing? I wanna debunk my insecurities, and I want someone to understand how I feel and explain things to me. 

Also, I know the pandemic at the minute makes it impossible, I'm talking about when it is over.",14Apr2020,2

4,"So here's the deal. I've been involved off and on with this guy for over a year, with a strong falling out ending our ""friends with benefits"" the first time. But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. I've always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. He's very aware of these feelings because I've told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. He's honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if he's read my messages or is online or has posted something. I can't stop thinking about him. 
I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when it's all done... 
What do I do? I want him to show some kind of emotional bond towards me, but I know that's not something I can control. I need help accepting the situation I'm in. 
I honestly think I'm so head over hills for him because I dont think I'm good enough for anything more. I'm overweight, and he's gorgeous and fit. I feel like I dont deserve or can't get more than him.",14Apr2020,80

6,"So I’ve never shared anything like this on here, and I know most people would make a throwaway account to do this but honestly I don’t care and I have nothing up hide.  I’m really struggling and thought I’d reach out because I truly feel I have no one in real life to turn to.  

I met my husband when I was 19. We married and had two boys.  (Oldest boy born w/ Down syndrome).  In 2001, when our boys were 4 and 6, my husband was killed in a hit and run accident on his motorcycle in 2001, making me a widow at 28, left to raise the boys on my own.  Let’s just say unfortunately neither my family nor my husband’s family were really the hands on babysitting type, although I have to admit my MIL has helped me out (when she was able to of course, she works too), by taking my son with DS when I was in desperate need of a break.  But that has since stopped, as she recently went through cancer, God bless her, so I don’t like to ask.  

Anyhoo, after he died, I jumped into working full time (was working only part-time and attending community college part time prior to my husband’s death), and then approx 4 years after his death I started experiencing terrifying episodes of shortness of breath.  No one believed me at first, which made it even worse.  But that was just the beginning of my struggles with anxiety and depression.  I was working for a large bank at the time.  (Worked there for almost 10 years total).  At one point I had to go on a 4 month leave of absence because I had so many tests to try to figure out what was wrong with me, why I couldn’t breathe.  Nothing physical was ever found...except for one test showed “patient hyperventilates at rest.”  So basically the only diagnosis I received was that I had a severe panic disorder.  Eventually, about 3 years later, I went on an antidepressant.  It helped with my anxiety and breathing issues.  Years of me working full time and sole parenting for my boys went on.  

Then life just started getting really hard.  I felt sad.  I was depressed in my job.  Struggles with my son w/DS; behaviors at his school.  There was a suicide on my husband’s side of the family, so my then younger son (typical son, 13 year old) became very depressed.  I felt so overwhelmed.  I had to watch him struggle and that killed me inside more than anything.  My release was swimming and yoga.  Then one night I hurt myself in yoga (long story, different instructor at la fitness) ...hurt my hip really bad.  I was prescribed Percocet.  My hip healed. But one evening after work I was battling with my 13 year old over something and I went in my room and crossed the line.  My hip was better, but I took the Percocet anyway to make me “feel better”.  That was when my struggle with pill addiction began and went on for about 5 years.  Somehow, I came out of that unscathed, but I feel like my now 21 year old resents me for it and for all of my anxiety/depression issues in general.  He’s in college and working, but we don’t have a close relationship, other than the minimal, holidays, etc but he’s so distant and we used to be so close.  Now I live alone with my 24 year old with DS and I’m severely depressed.  I’m on a medication for depression! But I honestly don’t think it’s working.  I feel utterly hopeless and alone.  I feel like a failure.  I’m list countless great jobs and I’m currently helping my friend out in his restaurant, so I’m humiliated about that because I KNOW everyone on my husband family talks about me and how I’ve changed jobs so much and I’m sure the depression, anxiety, and pill thing.  So many people compliment me and treat me like I’m some hero/martyr, because i take excellent care of my son now and raised them both on my own.   I spend all of my time (when I’m not working) getting my (DS) son to his activities and events.  I just want him to be happy and have the best life.  I moved to another are of town do he could attend the very BEST program.  But at the same time I feel I have absolutely no purpose, no future, no happiness, nothing.  I’ve had two relationships since my husband died.   The first was with a military man who was a serial cheater and crushed me because I stayed and let it drag out out of fear and now the second with a guy who has major depression issues himself and has brought me down even further,  but at the same time I’m scared to break it off completely with him because it’s another loss.  (We don’t live together and never have). I want to end it completely, but don’t have the strength.  I’m weak, obviously.  Every day I’m not at work, I sleep late and cry mostly all day.  I do the bare minimum and care for my son but that’s it.  I’m so fucking unhappy.  I don’t even feel like I need to have a life because it’s a waste!? I look forward to nothing.  All I see is everyone else with their families and it just kills me how unfair it all is.  I’m not even including some of the stuff that has taken place because it’s just too much!  It’s why I feel like counseling wouldn’t work for me because there are just too many things, that I wouldn’t even know where to start.  I’ve tried it trust me.  Currently, I don’t believe the medication I’m on is working whatsoever, so I’m just waiting for my telemed appt with my doctor which has been changed to the 27th.  and I guess I will tell him I need to try something different?  

I feel like I seriously need to like go into a facility? But I’ve never had that opportunity, even when I struggled with the pills (was only pills, never graduated to anything worse thank God, but could have) I never could go anywhere because I had no one to care for my son w/ DS.  But now I feel like SOMEHOW I truly need to go into somewhere for depression, like a restart, but I don’t see how I can!  Because there is no one who would care for my son.  I guess my only hope is my doctor will prescribe me something different.  The covid situation has made everything so much worse, which I’m sure it has for everyone. And Believe me I feel guilty even doing this post because I know there are people going through so much worse people that are sick.  Well I know this was a lot and I hope someone will read it... sorry for the bad grammar, typing on my phone.  Thankyou ♥️",14Apr2020,1

14,"Hey all

I know we’re all struggling right now with everything going on. I know I’m not alone, I know I don’t have it the worst.

Things have just been hard. I’m a medical worker. I work exclusively in the ED and because of my profession I interact with every respiratory patient that comes through during my shift. The stress of work and the fear of what’s to come and for my own safety has been weighing on me heavily. Work has not been able to provide the proper safety gear, and so every shift has become a source of anxiety for me.

I started this year thinking it was going to be my year. I started a medication which made me feel like I was on cloud nine. I had so much energy. Started a vegan diet, which had me feeling great. I quit drinking, quit smoking. I had saved a chunk of change and had scheduled dentist and doctors appointments I had been putting off for ages due to financial reasons. I applied for a job I’ve been wanting for the past two years, as the position had finally opened up - and I got it! I felt like I was finally getting my life together.

Then comes the virus. The job that I was about to start informed me that they were going to have to withdraw their offer as they are an outpatient clinic providing therapeutic procedures and the extra help is no longer needed.

Despite the growing pandemic, I’m being downstaffed to 20 hours a week to help distribute hours at my hospital, as non emergent procedures have been pushed to accommodate for the influx of covid patients. So in the past few weeks I’ve been slowly burning through the savings I had worked so hard to accumulate. All of the appointments I’d scheduled, to take care of looming and neglected medical issues have been effectively cancelled.


The stress of everything has me feeling and looking a wreck. I have deep, dark bags under my eyes. My skin has never been worse. My hair is falling out. I’ve started drinking again to cope with the stress. 

After several emotional breakdowns, i decided to try to be proactive and to take advantage of the reduction in hours - I was granted Thursday through Sunday off last week. The loss of hours stung, but I wanted to make the best of it. Me and my boyfriend went out on Wednesday and stocked up on groceries, planning to make a vegan shepherds pie for Easter. I grabbed a few toiletries and planned on using the time off to disconnect from the horrors of the pandemic and work, and practice some self care, have a bath, clean my house, and have a nice warm Easter dinner.

Thursday, the first of my days off, we got hit with almost 2 feet of snow and lost power. It’s now been going on 6 days without power. The $250 dollars of groceries we stocked up on are currently rotting in our fridge. I spent my days off freezing cold, wrapped in blankets on my kitchen floor eating cold soup from the can. My savings are slowly burning away. I’ve never looked worse. I’ve never felt worse. I feel like I’ve aged 5 years in the past 4 weeks. I keep praying for a light at the end of the tunnel but everything keeps going from bad to worse.

I just want to feel human. I want a shower and warm meal. I want reassurance that I’m not going to go broke. I want to feel safe. I miss my family and all the people in my life that I can’t see anymore. I want to see a light at the end of the tunnel but all I see is months of pain and panic and then months of fighting just to get back to square one. The desire to end it all just to escape the pain has been eating away at the back of my mind.

If someone could just give me a positive thought, an encouraging word, an inspiring article, or anything to give me some hope or a little dopamine it would be greatly appreciated.",14Apr2020,1

19,"Hello. I (19F) am struggling with depression and want to open up to my siblings about it. 

My siblings (youngest is 18F and oldest is 25F) and I are incredibly close; they are my entire world and make every day worth living. Of course, we aren't perfect siblings, and have had our fair share of petty arguments and maybe a few childhood tussles here and there, but they're the biggest blessings in my life. They're both incredibly filled with love - even with everything that life has thrown at them - and are very hard-working, smart, beautiful and talented women. I'm not always the best at showing my emotion or affections, but I truly cherish these two wonderful human beings, and I'm sure that they know that. 

My older sister has had depression for as long as I can remember due to childhood issues that I won't go further on about (as it's not my story to tell). She still has a hard time with it now, but she's able to manage it much better than when she was younger. I remember the first time she started to open up to me and my younger sister when I was about 12. We were about to sleep past midnight because we had stayed up late, and she finally told us how she has been feeling since she was a little girl. It was a huge shock to me, and from that point onward, I wanted to be able to help my siblings more than ever. My sisters and I sought refuge in each other's comfort whenever something was on our minds - letting each other know if we needed advice or just needed someone to listen to us. Out of us three, I'm pretty inept when it comes to trying to articulate my feelings out loud. Whatever I say just doesn't come out right, and I'm the type to keep things inside if I have to be honest -- I don't have an issue with listening and venting in general, because I think it's very important, I just cope with things differently to my sisters (who like to get it off their chests).

In the past few years, I have been struggling with depression. I denied it at first, because I didn't think I had anything particularly sad to be upset about at the time and I thought that what I was feeling was nothing compared to what my older sister was and has been going through. I thought if I saw my older sister's depression firsthand, I of all people should be able to identify if I was going through it and manage it easily. I guess that was a silly assumption, because I have had many suicidal thoughts and have made attempts to hurt myself whenever I felt like my mind was somewhere else since. 

This is a huge revelation that I've been wanting to share with my sisters for a long while now, after all, I feel the safest with them and know that they would *never* judge me for something like this. But my biggest concern is that if I admit to them what I have been going through, I might end up hurting or triggering my older sister. She is extremely loving and takes a *lot* of things to heart *because* she has a big heart. But I also know that she is very susceptible to feeling like she has failed or is a failure (due to her childhood) and that is my biggest concern. I know that she cares for me a lot and would want to help me with this, but I'm just scared that if I tell her about my depression, she might feel like she failed as an older sister and all of her hard work in keeping her mental health in check will go to waste because of me. But I'm also scared that if I don't tell her about it, it'll put a strain on the trust in our relationship (if she somehow finds out).

I love my siblings so, so much and feel like this is something I should tell them at *some* point. I really don't like keeping anything as big as this from them, but my fears keep hindering me from letting them, especially my older sister, finally know what has been on my mind all these years.

**TL;DR** \- I (19F) have depression, and I'm scared that if I finally admit it to my sisters, it'll trigger my older sister (25F) who has worked very hard to keep her *own* depression since childhood in check. I'm very close with her and don't want to keep this from her anymore - what should I do?",14Apr2020,1

23,"I've been depressed basically forever, but it comes and goes for how bad it is. Well I say that but even when I look back on happy times I was depressed during them.  I cried for hours after seeing a favorite musician live because I knew I'd never feel that okay ever again.

It's really terrible right now, since things that often trigger it are the news and my mom. I'm not able to just leave the house and distract myself like I've been doing, so I'm stuck with her and the news. She is the whiniest person I know and she can whine all day but if I ever say ANYTHING about how we get it, we already heard this yesterday, suddenly I'm ""attacking"" her for no reason.

Both of us are in therapy, and as of last week it's actually going horribly for me. She's on meds that aren't working (none of us are surprised) and I am on nothing even though I can't function. We both build tolerances to meds super fast if they do work, and/or just get all the side-effects with none of the supposed benefits. I don't even have a psychiatrist right now because the last one literally stacked enough meds on me that I was in Serotonin sickness, sleeping 18 hours a day, and so shaky that it was hard to do things. Very hard to trust again after that happening and constantly being told that place was ""the best"" even though all of us who went there hated it.

I don't really know what to do. Everyone says to meditate or journal or make art and get hobbies, but I can't even make myself do that. I have watched so many youtube videos and I pay attention to like three out of every ten. Then I get mad and try to look at nice pictures until something there inevitably pisses me off.

I forget a lot. I'll forget chores, taking care of the animals (multiple cats and dogs), little things she's mentioned. It adds up and frustrates her. After a while of her being frustrated she can't keep it in anymore, and then after that happens we start arguing. I know it's my fault. I know if I was better at being an actual adult it wouldn't be like this. Honestly we'd probably still be together if I wasn't such an irresponsible ass. But I always end up thinking about how things affect me. During this whole quarantine I've been out of work so I've been doing all the house work.

Before all of this started I was supposed my therapist recommended that I went to see  psychiatrist to start on anti-depressants and it kinda scares me but due to covid-19 I don’t think an apojtment will be possible .It’s been one hell of a year for me ( last year too) everything went to shit even before the whole covid-19 thing . I don’t see any hope for me 
I feel like everyday I grow close to doing it I’m so tired of life and everything going wrong I’m so unhappy  and I can’t enjoy the things I used to. I don’t know if it’s silly but I miss the old me the one that was happy and felt joy and all thoese positive feelings . Now I just feel so dead and empty",14Apr2020,1
40,"I would like to believe I have mild depression because what's really wrong with me is that I am a stressed college student studying something I only kind of care about and am thinking what I could be doing/what's the value of this. The main thing that happens to me is brain fog where I lose interest in doing things (not only things I need to do, even if I ask myself what I'd rather be doing I can't say). My depression comes and goes and when I'm on vacation and stuff obviously I don't get it. 

But sometimes I wonder if how I feel can actually be drastically better. I avoided asking for antidepressants because I already take Vyvanse and I am scared of ""depending"" on medications, which I know is real. But... what if taking antidepressants really helps me? What if I can finally feel brain clarity? What if I feel motivated to work harder for the long term benefits? 

Obviously this is a reddit page but I just want advice on other's experiences and if starting to take them at my age is a good idea or not. I know many people will suggest therapy which I have done when I was younger. I'll be honest... I didn't really feel any better with therapy but I guess after covid-19 I could try again. But the question is about antidepressants: will they help me more than not?",14Apr2020,1
41,"Mine was a typical arrange marriage ( indian) to a joint family ,mine have been a sexless marriage since the beginning, earlier i used to think  by communication and little get to know we will be able to work it out but nothing change over the time . My husband lets call him R is a decent and ambitious human being he belives he can only enjoy when all his worries are over , life is life 10 years on almost all the load is still here, whenever i try to talk to him about the emptiness that i felt it somehow always become my fault, i m severely depressed to which is says depression is not a illness just a mood swing tried to convince him otherwise but of no use. Over the time i realised our way of thinking just dont match he is extremely practical whereas i  m extremely emotional , we just don't agree on anything.


He has a younger brother lets call him A ,he is my age when he saw R's behaviour towards me he told me he is also feeling trapped for so many years , but belives that family is priority no matter how they are.
We talked about it a lot he was able to tell all the details which he claims he hasn't ever before, he was very emotionally supportive of the challenges that i faced by my MIL too.


I guess we both fell in love during the second year of my marriage, both felt it was going to be messy so tried to break it up while i try to work it out with R but none of it happened, we live in a joint family so its not just about sex coz we wait for months and years to have it.

A never wanted to get married but his parents made him do it, so now he is right infront of me not be able to be a proper husband nor he wants to let me go.

I m feeling trapped by the behaviour of my husband ,mother in law ,
Feels like i m maid just to do household chores , i have zero work ex , no self confidence, totally broke, i just dont know how to start my life
So i been thinking of giving it up...

Given myself lokedown period to find a conclusion , if i will be able to make it in life with all the pain inside me or should i just give up now as i have been doing all my life

I am unable to write lots of details about the truma of 10 years ,
I just want you to know that i believe i m the part of problem in everyone life , my expections create a huge burden on them. I have being writing last letters and notes...

42,"I'm feeling very bad recently, I know there are lots of teens saying they are depressed when they are not  and stuff but I'm really confused, everyone is telling me to choose what I'm gonna do cause I'm already 16 , they are telling me to become a doctor , a lawyer or smth , but all I can think of is ,,will it ever matter"" ?, Will anything I will or will not do ever matter? , And like it's not enough feel incredibly alone, is see my friends having fun,going live , chatting , and stuff but I'm all alone idk why I'm not too unsociable but I am really confused and sad,
Will I ever be happy? ( Main thought of the night) and if so will it ever be real? Im afraid hapyness of all kind is like a compromise between reality and desire.",14Apr2020,7
43,"**The problem we’re currently facing can be solved by realizing a new level of awareness**

The fastest way to get there is by letting go of the current identity that we’re attached to

Try to observe during your day the different attachment you experience in the form of thoughts and emotions, simply witness them

True power lies in awareness, awareness acts as a fire to the different impurities that are creating problems in the different areas of our life.

If you’re having experience of the same inner patterns over and over again I guess that is time to realize a new level of awareness where you’ll be able to experience yourself and your reality from a completely different perspective :)

44,"I always hated getting up early in the morning and having to commit the majority of my day to my job. At work all I would ever do is daydream about all the things I could be doing at home with my free time, or stress that I won’t be able to do those things until the weekend. But ever since operations at work have been suspended due to covid-19 and I’ve been at home for almost a months now...I have done nothing productive with my time. I will spend most of my time laying in bed basking in my own self pity and frustration. Even resorted to certain drugs, drinking, eating like shit and hating myself more and more. What the hell is my excuse now? I literally have all this time to myself and I could have done so much with it and yet here I am...I’m just constantly in my head and it’s driving me insane.

God since the end of March I’ve been feeling upset about everything on and off. I can’t get a break.. and it’s not like I’ve been happy before that either, my life has always been difficult. A series of unfortunate events, I’d say. I understand nothing in my life will ever change if I don’t do it but.. god. How do you find hobbies and try and improve your life when you feel absolutely *nothing* towards those things? When doing the simplest things like brushing your teeth is difficult and straining. Hell, I haven’t brushed my teeth in two days now. God I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m getting worse and worse. My antidepressants don’t even work, and I can’t get in contact with my psychiatrist. Nor my therapist who I don’t even want to get into contact with in the first place because she’s bad at her job.

46,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting so I apologize if I miss a flair or something.

First of all, I'm a grad student living at home with family. I have a 16 year old brother that I live with, with my mom and other sibling (father comes by often to visit). My bro has always been the type of teen to spend hours alone in his room, usually in bed, in the dark (lights almost always off). He is usually on his phone and listening to music. Pretty typical teen stuff though the fact he sometimes spends hours in his room in the dark, not particularly doing anything, has always worried me. 

Since quarantining, so for about a month, he has become increasingly lethargic and unmotivated. He doesn't want to go outside for walks or drives. He is doing some of his school work, but missing meetings and other assignments. His sleep schedule is all over the place, I honestly don't know how much he sleeps and how much he just spends laying in bed.

My parents are not the best at handling the situation. It usually results in yelling, sometimes violence, and my brother usually reverts more into his seclusion and silence. I'm basically just looking for any advice. How can I help him? Thanks in advance.",14Apr2020,17
47,"I started a new medication yesterday, Fluoxetine in liquid form to be consumed orally after breakfast, i was drawing as usual but suddenly i got memories of stressful moments of my life, which made me incredibly angry, i reached the desire of screaming and punching stuff, haven't break anything thankfully.

After 5 practice sketches i decided to call it out for the day, now im in the bed eating junk food out of depression.

These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off. 

But this time it was the memory alone that triggered my anger, i don't know if the secondary effects are meant to happen in just the next day of starting the treatment.

I know this isn't the place to ask about medicine but in case this is more in the psychological side then i need a new perspective on the matter.",14Apr2020,2
48,"So posted about this before but one of my friends wanted me to play a FF14 with her so she bought it for me. In the beginning I felt uncomfortable because I was low level and she and her friends are higher leveled so I can’t really do anything with them which kind of defeats the purpose of “playing together” or at the very least being on discord with them. I do try to be involved but I notice I can literally just turn off my mic for an hour without anyone noticing I’m gone. I have brought this up with the girl who invited me to play but now I feel like she’s ignoring me, only really talking to me when it’s just me and her in the group call. Yesterday when we were a full group, they helped me with some dungeons and it was fun. Today I got a call to join the group but she immediately starts talking excitedingly to the other guy on the call and asking him to immediately start playing so they can do some PVP stuff and really it made me question “ why am I in this call” I don’t want to lose friends but I really want to know if she wants to play with me or if he just wants another high leveled player. I really need to know what to do cause I’m really getting mixed signals on this. 

I don’t want to lose a friend over a game...",14Apr2020,1

50,"I stated cutting again yesterday. I’d stopped for 3 months and then it just happened. It’s like an addiction- if you ever go back to it- you can’t stop again straight away. Yesterday I had 25 cuts, today I had 83. I’m not suicidal, but I’m too scared to admit my issues. Last time my mum saw my cuts, she told me I was stupid. Told me I wasn’t depressed while I cried and screamed. She told me I was only crying because I’d been caught. The only reason she found out is because I told my closest friend- she said I couldn’t keep doing this and told her. She thought she would help me. She never does. She threatens to put me in a nutty institute and when she finally promises she’ll take me to a therapist- she never does. I don’t expect her to anymore. All she did was cause more pain, made it easier for me to self harm and allowed my mental state to deteriorate. I don’t know how much longer I can do this for. There’s one phrase that comes to mind which is, “ I don’t want to live, but I’m too scared to die.”
At this point it’s taboo to use it, but there’s no other words for it. I just need advice from someone.",14Apr2020,4
51,"First of all i am 21 years old. I used to be very extrovert when i was around 16-17 and i was like the funny guy in a group of friends. I wont say that if i was ugly or handsome although ppl always say i am handsome but i was well-groomed. It all started when i was 17 i got cheated by the same girl multiple times and friends tried to make fun of it as if it was something to make jokes about, i mean they either did it thinking that i wasnt so upset about it or they were just mocking on purpose. Either way these events broke my self esteem and turned me into an introvert. My introversion increased year by year. Since ive been attending university(thats like 3 years) my life is fucked up. Lost contact with all of my friends. Dont have any friends on university too(just one actually), just going to the classes sleeping during them and going back home. Im away from family during both in autumn and spring terms. I literally have no one. Real anti-social, playing games everyday. Had only 2 relationships in 3 years both of which didnt last more than a week. I havent attended any of my classes this year and havent told my parents about it. I was already in quarantine since the autumn term started, like i was just going out to get cigarettes, alcohol and food. I cant even communicate with people, its like as if ive been living in a cave and forgot how to talk. I eat too much fast food due to my depression and i gained 66 pounds in 5 months. And my 12 year old dog passed away today, i took her when she was 2 months old. I grew up with her and now shes gone. I dont know what do to. I have no purpose on this life. In fact i would have already killed myself if i didnt have a family to leave behind. I just wanted to unburden myself.",14Apr2020,6
52,"So basically in 2020 my depression has started to become major, or at least I feel like that's the case. Everyday I've been feeling down, and have felt a lack of motivation and a decrease in energy. I've been feeling huge amounts of guilt and remorse, and I've started to fear the passing of time, and change in general. I find my feelings really hard to explain, as theres quite a lot behind it. I want to see a professional about it, but I can't really because I'd have to tell my parents I want to go, and that wouldn't work out; my mum found out I was slitting my wrist, which I feel awful about because she claims she's worried about me and that makes me see myself as an awful person for causing grief to her, and she told me that whenever I feel down I have to talk to her. But first of all, I don't feel comfortable talking to her about most of the roots of my feelings, and second of all, whenever I do, she doesn't do anything about it, she just tells me to cheer up or something, and generally just doesn't understand how I feel. So basicallly, if I asked my mum to take me to a professional, she'd probably refuse to and tell me to tell her about my emotions. I'm not gonna ask my step dad because I hate him and he hates me. Moreover, I feel pretty crappy wanting to see a professional, as I know that most teens in the world probably feel the stuff I feel, and plus I don't even know if my feelings are a big deal. I might just be overreacting or attention seeking, I don't know. There are billions of people in the world, so my feelings don't have any worth, and there are millions of people who probably feel way worse. I don't think talking to an online person would help as they probably wouldn't be able to provide a diagnosis, and plus I feel that they would understand more if we were in a room together. Plus I emailed childline about my problems and they didn't really help.

What could I do? Is there a way I could see a professional by myself, without anyone knowing? I wanna debunk my insecurities, and I want someone to understand how I feel and explain things to me.

Also, I know the pandemic at the minute makes it impossible, I'm talking about when it is over.",14Apr2020,9
