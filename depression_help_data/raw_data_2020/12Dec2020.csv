It was very fun fkr the first half but my anxiety got worse, and my depression got way worse. Covid college classes wer making me depressed and I wasnt getting good grades. Now me and my ex broke up (totally mutual we are friends) and i am home for the holidays. Since all this started I noticed I starting having this twitch or shiver that happens when Im anxious or depressed. Is this normal??? Its almost like a tic or something but i dont know alot about this. I also just recently started taking anti-depressants but its only been like a week lol any thoughts???",12Dec2020,1
2,"Hello all,


I apologize for bad grammar or typos. I am a 43m, sober for a little under 2 years, although my substance abuse was/is a problem  i have to this point for the past 2 years white knuckled myself into sobriety. During this time through self reflection and reading a crap ton of self help books I have come to realize that i have been basically self medicating for my depression my entire adult life. I was diagnosed  with it in my early 20s and was medicated until i moved away from my folks.  Than i worked as a bartender for years which is a job that has little to no healthcare and an abundance of temptations. Eventually i started going to meetings (which helped a little but ultimately was  not for me) I learned how to recognizing my triggers and avoid them. I used meditation and working out was able to focus on staying sober. And things seemed to improve. That being said my over all general apathy for life still persisted and concerned me. Now since covid hit ive been out of work and the apathy has been magnified. I am at a point i realize therapy is a must and medication is probably too. Honestly  i do have hope because i have developed a persistence in the face of my apathy to seek treatment. I truly am done wasting time and am ready to smile again. I even made an appointment  to see a psychologist but it was cancelled and rescheduled  to late January,  which seems like a lifetime away. I understand that seeing the doctor is the first step but because of covid its like i have no legs and if i have no legs how do i ever take that step? So If anyone knows of any resources available during covid or has helpful advice, i would really appreciate it.  I am just at a point were i see no help or end in sight and I am trying not to give up but its as if the universe wants me to. And my only option until a vaccine is found is to just waste away in my bed. And im tired of that.",12Dec2020,1
3,I’ve never had a great home life. My sister and I have been at each others throats since we were kids and her constant belittling and meanness took a tole on my mental health from a young age. Outside of my family I always had a strong group of friends. I thought they were good friends until I relished how toxic they were. I was the butt of all of the jokes constantly called fat abd ugly even though they said they were kidding.,12Dec2020,1

7,"Hey guys, my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, and she's been depressed since before I've even met her.

As somebody without depression, I find it extremely difficult to find the correct actions or words that would comfort her during her bad nights. Sometimes I feel as though the things I say might make her feel worse, even though I have the complete opposite intention.

I just need to know from people who are going through it. What are some things you wish the people around you would say or do to make those bad nights a little less bad?

Thank you for reading.",12Dec2020,1

10,"I had a really hard day today. I got mad at about 9 AM and it just ruined my whole day. It led to crying for 6 hours straight, 2 panic attacks, a few last outs. It was a rough one, reasons remain unknown. 

I got discharged by my last therapist for no reason after expressing my suicidal thoughts and ideations. It tore me apart. The story is on my feed if you care to know what happened there. But I’ve been petrified to go back into therapy since. Finally today I reached my breaking point and knew that I needed some real help. After being told by a rude lady that I couldn’t get any help till January 20th - my husband called for me and expressed the urgency of my situation and how I’d been neglected by their behavior health system multiple times in the past. All of sudden there’s emergency appointments available. So I get one for 10PM and gladly take it. 

I really let it all out. I told this lady everything I thought she would need to know. I didn’t hide a wink. I was ready. And she got me straight into an intensive outpatient therapy program- with the promise that if my symptoms got worse over the next 48 hours, I would get myself taken to a hospital for a 24 hour evaluation lockdown. We had talked about this option in the beginning of our conversation and I just didn’t know if I was there YET. I honestly didn’t know what constitutes hospitalization. I felt like I could be there after some of the severe panic attack episodes I have gone through could constitute it because I can’t calm myself down and am reckless. But we decided middle of the road for now bc regular therapy just wouldn’t cut it. 

I felt so accomplished. Just the fact that she kept telling me “we are going to get you the help you need”, was so encouraging. I felt like this is the first step forward to a recovery I have longed for and needed for almost a decade. 

I run to my husband to tell him my good news after a day of complete madness and sorrow. I felt so good about the progress I’d made. Explained him everything and lastly said “she did mention that if the symptoms start to happen again and the suicidal thoughts begin, get yourself hospitalized. Don’t think, just do it.” And do you know what he said ? The one person I trust, depend on, love, and lean on for support most ? 
 
“Okay well next time, I’m calling the cops.” 

I don’t know why but it sent me into a complete rage. I’m very sensitive right now but also I feel like the comment was so insensitive. I’m absolutely terrified of ever having to hospitalized or anything like that and he just played it off like
He was call 911 next time I have a panic attack. Was it supposed to “scare” the panic attacks out of me? What the fuck. I can’t believe that’s the first comment he has for me after everything today. I’m so fucking angry I’m sleeping in the guest room and I don’t want to talk to him at all.. probably all weekend that’s how hurt I am. And the best part is - he’s mad at me now for getting mad because I’ve apparently taken him wrong...? I said I would need to get hospitalized, not that you’d need to call emergency services or police. That’s absolutely terrifying and took all the ease I felt after my appointment and tossed it right out the fuckin window. WHO SAYS THAT!? I can’t think of any other reason to say something like that other than to hurt the other person.",12Dec2020,1

13,"I suspected that I had depression for some time but the time I finally realized it might be a bit more serious than I thought was when I did a questionnaire during my toddler's check up. There was a question asking me if I ever thought about harming myself and I chose sometimes (although it was more than sometimes) thinking it would be in ""normal"" range. Well.. the nurse really tried to convince me to refer me to someone but I insisted I was doing okay.

That was about a month ago and thoughts of death is becoming more and more detailed. I find myself sort of dreaming of it, like.. I don't know how to explain, before I would get very upset and cry after thinking of dying but now I'm thinking of it step by step and what I can do to make it as least ugly as possible. It's becoming a part of my day like planning what to eat for dinner. I'm sort of exhausted living my life, it's not how I planned it and I feel like a failure and want escape. 

I guess I want to get better.. I don't want to leave my kid behind like that at least. I want to stick around for him. I'm also tired of acting like I'm doing great and happy.

14,"The title isn't great, I know.
I also want to warn people that I may say a lot of aggravating things, and I want to apologize in advance if anything I say offends someone by the off chance. 

I have been greatly suicidal over past several months. I have always had depression, for the longest I can remember. I haven't gotten help cause I'm underage (f17) and my mother refuses it.

Here's the short story of my situation right now:
I have been forced to be downstairs in the presence of my mother, my mother sits outside the bathroom when I shower, and sleeps on the floor in my room. I feel like I can barely get a moment of peace now.

This started out by one of my teachers emailing my parents that I will be failing her class. The class I'm failing is Calculus. I don't need to pass it graduate. I've already talked to my counselor about dropping it. I decided that it is in my best interest to not worry about that class, because for the past few months, I have barely been able to find the motivation to even shower, eat, or brush my teeth. I don't know the material. Any of it to even try to turn in any of the work. After sorting it out with my parents, they seem fine about it now, but it was only after my sister had called my mother.

My sister is the only person in my family that I have opened up to at least even half of my feelings to. So when my mother originally started yelling at me, calling me useless, a liar, and a bum, my first instinct was to text my sister. 

What disgusted me was that I felt bitter when this all went down. My mother was sobbing talking about how she was doing it for my sake not for her own, and I have quotes of what she said (She is not speaking to me, but to my father in the room next to me), ""She is so defensive!"" ""Even her sister, she's 26, has never done anything like this!"" ""I might die in the next two years, five years, maybe this year if I get covid!""

This made me want to go to the other room and beat the absolute living shit out of her. I didn't do that, but I felt violent. I am just glad that the entire time she talked to me I didn't say a word. It took great self-restraint.

She's going to say all these things to her child that she doesn't even know is wanting to kill herself? I was honestly starting to think maybe this was the little push I needed to drive to the tall highway 15 minutes away and plunge down into the intersection below. 
What really made me mad is she listed my changes of behavior over the past several months and that I haven't been turning in assignments since that same time. Could she not have realized maybe something is wrong?

My sister called her. I don't know what she said, but she definitely talked over the fact that I have depression and need help. After that, my mother definitely started acting nicer. 
I was afraid of her acting nicer, cause I knew it would just make me feel worse. 
She now asks me questions, saying she's being like the nurse she is to her patients.
""Why are you so unsatisfied with life?""
""When do you feel sad?""
""Are you sad right now?""
She'll tell me she's keeping me company from not being lonely, and I know she's trying her best, but she is driving me mad. 

My mother has never understood mental illness. She has expressed this in the past. I got diagnosed with depression two almost three years ago, and she told me in the car I was the greatest actress in the world. 

On top of that, she still tells me I'm extremely lazy when I just sit around and do nothing, and even points out when I said I'm not very passionate about anything, that I am passionate about books and video games when I talk with my older brother. It almost sounds to me like she's finding EVERY REASON that what I feel and the depression my sister and I are speaking of is fake. 

She's trying her best, but I need her to leave me be. I'll be going to my sister's house tomorrow and talking about this with her.

But aside from that,
I've realized that my failing grade might prevent me from being accepted to colleges and that I just might never be able to recover. I started thinking that I might just be lazy like my mom says I am. I feel like I am the only one who can actually genuinely feel bad for myself, but feeling my bad for myself is so fucking sad and almost conceited. 
I'm easily agitated, unlikeable, unable to do anything but feel like shit, scared of accidentally lashing at someone for something they say that strikes a nerve, failing a class, a terrible influence, and I am here on reddit typing about my ""mental anguish"". It's fucking hilarious, and it just reminds me how disgusting I am.

15,"My life has been a total mess since my childhood. My dad beat my brother and I, raped my sister, while my mother was in a mental hospital.

My foster mother has cancer and my ex cheated on me and is now threatening me. Everything is falling apart. I work 3 fucking jobs to be stuck in some shitty apartment, in a shitty neighborhood. I'm scared to be in public places because some dude shot up a party I was at in highschool and shot a friend of mine who died in my fucking arms. I once shot myself in attempt of killing myself. I'm still here crying 3 times a day, getting drunk every night, only weed and music can calm me down.

17,"At the start of the year I was so fucking confident in myself, I told myself it was finally time to put effort into life and actually start Trying in school and stuff. But than COVID happened, my grades dropped because online school isn’t for me, I had my graduation and all the amazing experiences come with it stolen from me. something just broke in me After that, I can’t stop thinking about the person I could have been and all the wrong choices I’ve made.

Man fuck I wish I could just disappear",12Dec2020,1
18,"Granted I know that may just be part of it. And I assume it's depression I'm dealing with as well. It's just kept me from doing a lot of the things I both need to do like school, and even want to do like say gaming and so on. The reason I maybe believe it isn't severe enough is that all I really deal with is a lack of both motivation, and will ti do much. Some days it's better. Some worse. I often have a sort of existential crisis late at night. And I'm unsure if it's good to clarify or not, but I'm in no way suicidal, I'd honestly feel worse about leaving the ones who care about me then the actual repercussions of the action itself

And a random side note, I'm sure if I've used the correct flair",12Dec2020,1

She told my friend that she has been abused by her cousin multiple times, AND she got raped by a guy in the park.

22,"I started seeing my therapist 3 years ago and after seeing many over the years, I was happy to have finally found one that worked for me.

I told her at the beginning that I absolutely hate CBT and I wont take part. It doesn't work for me. And all the grounding stuff makes me feel worse. It went fine for the last 3 years, I've had my ups and downs and super deep, dark lows.

I've recently come out of one of those lows and started to feel a bit better so at my last session I said I want to work on my anxiety and the paranoia of people watching my every move.

She suggested grounding and mindfulness. I said they don't work. I've tried multiple times over the years, since I started seeing someone. But she wasn't listening. She said I'm the only person that mindfulness and grounding doesn't work for. Which is bullshit.

So, I'm done. I'm not seeing her again. I'm not going to waste my time seeing another psychologist to say the same things. I'm not starting over again.",12Dec2020,1

I hope me telling you all this , you can do the same.
It's easier bottling up all your emotions and anger and such but honestly you gotta be more open about things you know ? Like I've slashed up my arms and such and felt good about it then immediately felt like shit after, self harm doenst do anything at all but make your gorgeous body all gross and scarred up.

24,"I’m not totally sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on but hopefully it is, if not please let me know :)

Today I(18f) came to a realization. The realization that we go through life just for the sole purpose of feeling emotions. You go to college to feel content, you get a partner to feel love, you have kids to feel proud. But what would life be without emotions? You go to college for what? To survive?You wouldn’t even try to survive if you don’t have emotions driving you to do so. You can’t feel love, you can’t feel happiness, you can’t even feel sadness. So what do you have now? What is there to live for? You have nothing but meaningless actions that ultimately serve no purpose. It’s like we put this idea in our heads that we have a purpose, that we’re so important. We do things to make us FEEL like our life is meaningful. But the truth is that there’s no meaning. Without emotions we are nothing but a limp body of flesh and bones. Like a monitor without a computer system. And that is hard for me to cope with. The only reason for living, is to experience emotions. And with that being said, life just seems so boring now. I would’ve hoped there would be a deeper meaning to billions of peoples’ existence, but alas, we are just so simple. 

But I digress, I am just depressed right now so maybe I’m just saying all this due to my depressed mood. Although, I’m posting this because it’s making me feel quite shitty and unmotivated having come to this realization. So now I’m looking for help, I just need some reassurance right now that maybe that’s not all there is to life. Or even just some advice to help me feel motivated to continue through life again.

I don’t have anyone to listen to me, and today I see that people who have heard what I’m going to say… they are simply nothing but online figures who only know how to say things that I should do, things that I can’t do, never something that can maybe help me

I'm tired of these people, so tired that the few who talk to me just seem to be the same person but with different pictures

I never had real friends

I never had a hug, not in greeting, but in affection

I'm tired of being alone

I'm tired of my family which is so incomplete, I never had a father, or a figure and every time my mom tried to give me one of those figures, she got someone worse worse and worse, I had 4 stepfathers   
and today, my mom is divorcing this last one I'm really sorry, I doubt she'll do that I've been through this more than 4 times with this same guy we already went to the police station, he was already arrested my mother has been beaten with a knife several times but only now did she decide to leave, I don't trust my mom I don't trust anyone else

and I know that even if no one here can help me ... I will at least have tried

I've already been betrayed, abandoned, excluded, blocked by virtual friends that I said were the only thing I had, it was all a lie, and I was always alone 

I've been through many crises like this and I always thought that I could get through it all even alone, I think I can still do it, I just need hope

I don't like how things are going there are a lot of people in conflict here, my whole family doesn't help and even if that divorce happens I don't know how things will go 

I know that soon I will have to support my mother and my two brothers but I am very afraid of all this, I didn't want that responsibility but I know that I must comply with it

I want to tell him that I just feel sad. I feel like I'm not important. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of what I'm supposed to do in life and that's it. Is that normal, I don't know? That's what I've always done. He'd tell me ""It's not like we even have it that bad.""

Sometimes I think about not being here. I've thought about what I would write in a letter for him to find after I'm gone, but I can never make it past the first few sentences, which I know is a good thing.

How can I be depressed when I can do so much. I don't sit and cry all day long, lay in bed without wanting to get up, skips showers, or not feed myself. I might want to do those things, but I don't.

35,"Hey guys, so I joined this subreddit with the hope that some of you might have helpful words. (I‘m sorry if I made grammar mistakes, but english isn‘t my first language)

I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 13 years old (I am 19 now), to this day, I still wasn‘t able to get better. I used to see a therapist once a week but I didn‘t really like my therapist so I stopped going there last year.

I now live on my own, with my boyfriend actually, but even tho he cares for me a lot and is very understanding, I cannot calm down my mind. 

I constantly think about suicide, and I cannot get it out of my head. The thought of killing myself is in my head 24/7, it never leaves my mind. It‘s draining my energy so much. 2 years ago I got it under control and I felt better, but since last year it came back again.

I go to nightschool to graduate now, since I quit my old highschool because I got bullied to a point where they even broke my leg. I had to move to a different city because at my parents village, there is no other option than my old highschool. I have a part-time-job now (since I need to pay my rent) and go to school as well. It stresses me out really badly and I am in constant worry for my future, since I don’t know what I should do or if I am able to keep this lifestyle up (I still have 1 1/2 years left in that school, since I failed a grade once). I am scared of hurting my family or my boyfriend by killing myself, so I really need to get my sh*t together.

What I am asking for is if anyone of you has tips or tricks for getting these bad thoughts out of your head or generally have a better positive mindset. I don‘t want to take any medication or something, so I just need a good way to clear my mind.

Thank you very much for taking your time to read this and thanks for the advice in advance!",12Dec2020,1

People are so caught up in looking at the bigger picture that they are wanting to achieve, but are afraid of trying because they believe it's too much work for. People can’t be proud of the small things they accomplished because they want more. 

Do you ever feel proud for getting out of bed? We are not promised tomorrow, so living another day is great itself. There are days too when I absolutely don’t wanna leave my bed, but once I do, I’m ready to take on what lies ahead of me. 

Don’t you ever feel proud for completing another day at work? Some people are all, “eh, work is work.” Yes I get that, but it also means you made another day of salary, and we all know how important income is. Aside from that, don’t you feel proud for taking a step towards helping the people your company serves?

What about doing small chores around the house? Like cleaning, cooking, and laundry. Don’t you think it’s better than living in a dump?

My small victory for today was that I stepped on the scale and was down five pounds, which I’m so proud of! Since Thanksgiving, I’ve been putting on weight due to lack of sleep, nutrition, hydration, and exercise. After returning to those tasks, I’ve finally got back on track!

If you can’t learn to be proud of the little accomplishments you make in life, then how can you expect to achieve something you’ve been dreaming of?",12Dec2020,1

I'm a mental health worker and as part of my job I deliver anxiety management interventions on a 1:1 basis over the phone. These are based in CBT but aren't a proper CBT course (mostly so that if needed, my patients can access further psychological therapies pretty soon after rather than having to wait a year). Althought they're targetted for patients with anxiety, I do a PHQ score (depression scale)  and GAD (anxiety score) before and after and generally, both of them drop by the end of the course so I reckon it could be used for people living with depression too. As I work for a specific NHS trust in a specific team which only takes referrals from specific GP surgeries,, the course is only available to a very select subsection of the local population. Due to covid, other mental health services are massively overloaded and there are huge waiting times for things like anxiety management and depression help courses.

I've been trying to think of ways to make the intervention accessible to more people and I'm considering creating a video series of short videos. These would  go over the theoretical components, techniques and exercises that I cover in the course and would be in a recommended order, alongside recommended homework exercises and stuff. I figure if I do it this way, I can expand the series as I find more exercises and stuff that can be used and as people find exercises that work for them, they can use save the videos they need if they need a reminder.

I'd like to get the opinion of people who are living with depression and anxiety as to whether they think this is something that would work and whether it's something they would access, if it was available? I imagine each video would be no longer than 5-10 minutes so not a huge amount and the only requirement from the watcher would be to do the homework (which is mostly practising the exercises and techniques)

I do not have the strength anymore to push through. My heart is weak and in so much pain. America doesn’t take mental health seriously and treat me a mental health as a joke. The recent ending of a relationship is making it all so much harder. I do not feel strong enough to push through this, I really want to end it.",12Dec2020,1
39,"I have given myself a three year's notice. If I'm not at where I want by then; I will kill myself. Not a fluff or anything, I could've killed myself tonight- decided to give myself more time.

I feel like it will motivate me, for what I fear most is the continuity of my life while I'm experiencing all these feelings. I assume I will be bolder and push myself to be more productive.",12Dec2020,1
