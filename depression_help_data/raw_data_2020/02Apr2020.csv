3,"I’m not sure how to ask for help. I’m a teenager in high school and I’m posting on an alt.

I quit cutting myself two months ago but I feel like I might start again. I feel scared and sleep is really hard. Sometimes I just sleep through the entire day and sometimes I just can’t sleep but I don’t know how to ask for help.

It’s not like I don’t have a family—I live with my mom and she loves me and I can’t get myself to ever tell her that I need help. I feel guilty and scared of telling her. And I have a couple of friends too but it’s really hard for me to talk about anything related to mental health with them. I feel scared to and part of the reason is that I feel like there’s no real reason for me to be sad. Nothing really bad or anything happened to me at any point of my life—there’s no reason for me to feel bad.

So how do you open up about it?",02Apr2020,1
4,"How do I get on with my life everyday. My whole life I've always been trying to help others,and this goes from the fact that I'm adopted, so I feel that my problems could always be worst, and I should just try to suck it up and help others fix there own issues. I always thought that since im adopted I should try to help others as a way to cope with it. I always knew me helping other would not solve my problem but I though I would have time to think about what I was going to do to get over my problems. Now with this coranavirus it just eating at me. I cant help anybody,so now I'm just stuck thinking about my own problems.

I would tell my parents but I don't want to put a burden on there life worrying about me. As far as i can tell they said I was being quite lately but i just told them in feeling a little sick. I feel that sense they already take care of me I should not tell them. I also don't feel like I should tell any other friend or family because it would just be a burden on them to.

8,"Day by day I feel a \~little\~ better, but still hindered by a force. On my drive back to work, I was thinking about how I managed my depression way back when, and how it's morphed as life structures have with age. My currently coping mechanisms are:

* Limited reddit interaction. I can read, but I have to limit interaction with people because my mind starts to stretch. I feel like my time is warped, like everything has it's own speeds, even my thought processes, and it starts to effect my daily life. Things just don't register how they used to. I'm unsure how to divulge in this as it seems to be a newish thing. I don't know if it's burn out or stress or what.
* Gaming. I lose interest in some so I cycle through. Right now I really want to play WoW but can't afford to put down 15$/mo. I mostly solo. I usually get those free games that cycle on Epic Games &amp; sales on Steam. I'd really love an Oculus but again the money thing, as well as time. And repetitive motion injury sucks. Also carpal tunnel. But I don't want to lose interest.
* Tv streaming. This is the first time I've ever needed some type of background noise to drown out the emotions that crowds my mind. Music doesn't help because I attach too much emotion to sounds. I usually do this at work and sleepy time. If I don't do it at work, I'll start crying. 

And of course the whole ""I lost myself"" ""I'm not who I used to be"" or whatever. I don't feel solidified. I don't feel like....I'm thick and porous and malleable when I need to be. I feel like goop with that layer that builds up on the top of pudding. A substance with no form. And the loss was so gradual I can't pinpoint it, I just know certain circumstances that exacerbated it, though the difference is it was easier to surface then. Now I just pull the pudding skin down with me in that muck or abyss or whatever it is. 

One of my biggest concerns seems it's becoming reality: lose of interest in the internet. There's so much to surf, so many ways to connect. I've already lost nearly all my desire of art which is heartbreaking in so many ways. Anyway, maybe one of these days, therapy will actually help.

I wonder if any of this makes sense and if anyone relates.",02Apr2020,1
9,"I don't mean to come off as self centered, I know a lot of people here are genuinely depressed and diagnosed and if it's obvious that im not I apologize in advance. However  I did want to ask. I do enjoy some things, like I find enjoyment in videogames and genuinely laugh when I talk to people. But everyday it feels like I'm living for my family and not for myself. I'm only 15 but I've struggled with religion (my family is Muslim) and school and I've always just been sick of the monotony. I know if I tell my family that I can't accept Islam than that would break their hearts. So I sort of pretend to be Muslim. I like Muslim ideals but I'm not sure if I can believe in a God lots of the stories feel impossible. Honestly I'm not sure about much of what I'm saying. If I simply gave up on school and tried to pursue my writing once again that would kill my family. They want to see me succeed. My flair is requesting advice but really this feels like a rant though really I'd like to know if I am depressed. I've read up on symptoms and Im not sure. If anything I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not depressed. I'm not constantly fatigued, and haven't been tempted by drugs or anything. I've had suicidal thoughts but no attempts.

I got a new job recently (although I'm not working currently because of covid-19), and I'm really satisfied with it. I bought a car that I've wanted for so long, and it makes my commutes enjoyable. I practice good hygiene, and I keep my living space as clean as possible. I may not be eating enough, which is caused by my lost appetite due to depression, but I try my best. Thing is, I still feel just as bad as I ever have. The only thing that's changed since moving out of my parents home is I'm not so anxious all the time anymore.

Sure that's a great outlook but I want to actually be able to go to a high school reunion and not fake my way out of going because I don't want to get to look at classmates who are more successful I don't want to sit in my truck one day and slit my wrists thinking that I peaked in high school and that I'll never wrap up my life with a happy ending.",02Apr2020,1

It's the 2nd of April 2020 and nothing has changed. All this time I always had hope that things will eventually work out but as time passes I'm slowly losing everything ""MY SANITY"" ""MY WILL"". The more I want everything to work out the messier it gets. It gets to the point where I can't stand it. Right now, I'm just done I can't go on like this.  My mind is at its limit. I thought since I don't get frequent breakdowns I might be getting better. BOY, I was wrong! It never left me.

I don't even know what I mean by ""IT"". Not a ghost, I don't have any other words to call what I'm going through.

Now it feels like my life's hitting me with everything it has to drag me down and it's working  I can't go on. I want to die so badly. I want to burst out crying because it hurts, It hurts bad. Music has always been my way to hold me in place whenever I have a breakdown. I have been doing so frequently that I don't think its working how it used to be. It's helping but it's having a huge toll on me my mind a mess, my chest's heavy, becomes harder to breathe. It's at this time I wonder why I'm even alive. I'm currently 21 years of age and what have I done in the past 21 years to call my life worthwhile.

I know that when I say this, People are gonna question me saying "" You're only 21, You have so much to live for to look forward to!"" but let me ask you this. These past 21 years have been absolute hell for me. I  have tried to commit suicide on multiple occasions. The only reason I didn't go through with it was because of my parents and my friends. This is the only reason why I kept going. Why I kept fighting to maintain my sanity for a little while longer. I wonder if I had never been born then the resources that have been spent on me for the past 21 years wouldn't have been wasted rather it could have been put to some good use. So to compensate for that I made a moto for myself to help as many people as I can to compensate for the past 21 years that I have wasted on this worthless life. I'm so worthless that I even screwed that up, There are occasions where I felt genuinely happy because I could help someone. Those are less compared to the number of times I screwed up. I never wanted much from my life I never asked for much, I only wanted one person to genuinely understand me, But NO. Everyone has their own opinions I know that and I'm not saying that they're wrong and I'm correct but at least they can hear me outright but the people around me tend to question everything that I do. Maybe I did it because I wanted to be helpful for someone or maybe I have my reasons for it. I tried talking to my parents about the issues I have, They do listen to what I have to say and a few minutes later they start shoving their opinions and views down my throat. I love my parents they have provided me with everything I ever wanted and I do know that they want the best for me.  


Honestly, I would never let my child go through this if I ever live. I don't know if I'm gonna be alive in the next 5 years.

17,"I've posted here a few times to rant and ask for help. For the purpose of this post all the backstory you need to know is I was severely depressed, I'm now medicated and for the most part heading in the direction of recovery, but I'm not there yet.

I don't know what to think anymore. It seems as though there are 2 people inside me, one is the logical brain, the other is the emotional side. They are perpetually n conflict, where I can see logically I have a decent life, and things aren't that bad, and I should be happy... But I feel like the biggest piece of shit, totally worthless, and like my life is a giant shit-show of opposition at every turn.

For the most part, I've been able to categorize these thoughts into emotional, and logical. Clearly knowing the difference. Lately however, it seems like its getting more and more difficult to do that. I'll have a wave of negativity float over me that I can't tell if its actually logical or emotion speaking. I thought I was totally free of the risk of suicide at this point but I'm starting to see that as my best option again, I'm really disappointed in myself for relapsing like this. I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to get a grip on my life and take control. 

The biggest problem on my mind right now is with women, probably because that's what I have the least amount of control over. I've had a lot of relationships where I was cheated on or broken up with and I just can't view women the same way anymore. My last relationship ended over a year ago, and I'm not really bothered by it specifically anymore, but just by my life experience. I know this can't be true, but it really seems like women only want to take advantage/use men. That they don't even actually care about them, and that all they care about is the utility a man can provide in their life. I feel this way because I keep encountering this again, and again with every woman I date. It MUST mean there's something wrong with me, because sure there are bad apples out there, but what are the chances that every woman I've dated is a bad apple? I don't know whats so wrong about me, and causes women to discard me after getting to know me for a couple years. I can see the contempt in their eyes when it happens. Total shift, like one day you wake up and your partner is a completely different person. It's kind of scary if you think about it, like you've never known the real person until that moment, yet you've lived with this person for years. That's like psychopathic shit right there. 

I can't really date anymore because of this, every time I look at an eligible woman I feel disgusted. I think my body is trying to warn me to stay away because its learned that women = suffering. Have you ever tried to live life with zero motivation to engage with the opposite sex? It's a fucking bizarre feeling, like I'm drifting aimlessly with no purpose whatsoever. Why continue trying to live a life this way at all?",02Apr2020,1

I am from South Carolina, USA. I take Lamictal, Buspar, and Venlafaxine for Bipolar II. 

I am doing surprisingly well mentally during this quarantine, but my medication is running out. Having bipolar, this is very dangerous. Venlafaxine also gives debilitating brain zaps if I don't take it.  My outpatient counseling center was at a hospital, so all patients are temporarily not attending or seeing the psychiatrist there because they are using the hospital for major emergencies only. I have left several voicemails about my medication running out, but they haven't returned any of my calls. Today, I left a voicemail for my old psychiatrist to at least see if I can get my Venlafaxine since my dose hasn't changed since I moved back home (mid January). I get refills through CVS, and these medications have to be refilled with a physical script or by a doctor contacting the pharmacy.

If I am unable to get a refill from these two places, what do I do? I've never had this happen before. Am I able to get that refill by bringing my medication to a doctor's office/urgent care? Or ER? We were given emergency contacts of other offices by my counselors, but most have significant waiting lists (most have 6-12 month waiting lists in South Carolina - our mental healthcare is horrific). I don't know if it'll be timely to triage with another counselor to get a refill...

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for nearly five years now but recently been dealing some stuff I haven't experienced before. I've been having  thoughts that I feel like i can't control - not all the time but a lot. When it happens i feel out of control and like I can't stop thinking. Normally those thoughts are desperate or self loathing and sometimes its suicidal (not active). I feel like someone is injecting thoughts into me and that I'm just kinda there as those thoughts are happening unable to stop it. 

I've also been having weird dazes where I feel like I'm just doing everything on autopilot. I don't really know how to describe it honestly except sometimes I feel like I'm thinking nothing at all, or sometimes it goes hand in hand with those racing thoughts.

Because of my depression my grades started to drop. School systems here are extremely strict and competitive so I looked online for ways to treat it at home since we could't afford therapy at that time. One of the advices I came across frequently was that I should talk about it to my family and friends about it. The most common answers were: Everyone is sad, deal with it. Are you weak? Or other people have it worse, you most thank god for what you have. My mother has depression and whenever I tell her about mine and that I need help, she sometimes gets mad at me and says you should fix it yourself.

I'm currently studying computer science at a 4 year University and have one more semester after this one (which has 3 weeks left). This whole semester I have been badly struggling with my depression and other issues (mostly just body aches and pains, but also coronavirus concerns) and all semester I have been barely completing my assignments for 3/4 classes I am taking. These 3 classes I am either failing or have a low C grade. I have final projects coming up (for a game dev course and mobile dev course, so very involved projects) and don't think I have the willpower or the knowledge to come close to getting a passing grade on these. I have been struggling to focus on anything and spend most of the time crying or staring at a wall when I do try to get work done. It doesn't help that I have been quarantined for the last 3 weeks without a good medication to treat my depression since before all of this coronavirus stuff I was meeting with my doctor regularly to try to find the right one for me. I just started taking a medication again that worked alright for me in high school that I had some extra of, but before this it had been 3-4 weeks since I had last taken any medication besides smoking weed.  


I am strongly considering withdrawing from these courses even though there's only 3 weeks left in the semester and it would mean that I couldn't graduate for another 2 semesters. The other issue with this decision is that my girlfriend and I have a strict schedule for graduation. She will be graduating at the end of this semester and will be going to law school in a different state next year. We had planned for me to finish my school during her first semester and then I would join her and start working to pay bills for us both to live there while she completes her education. We don't have a backup plan for if I am not able to graduate when planned because whenever I bring up my feelings on withdrawing she shuts it down and says that it isn't an option unless I can take summer classes to make them up. For me, summer classes are not an option since I've taken them before and hated every second of it, plus they made it harder for me to keep working for the next school year when I didn't have a break.  


Sorry for the long post, but I could really use some advice for if I should withdraw from my classes this semester or if anybody has suggestions to help me get these projects done. My exact problems with getting these projects done is that I didn't pay as much attention as a should have at the beginning of the semester, and a general lack of desire and motivation that inhibits me from getting anything done.  Thinking about the extent of the projects and how unprepared I am causes me to break down and cry and I just can't see myself getting anything done.

I can't just sit at home, eat, drink until passing out everyday, or I could be fired, and life could become much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have mostly intelectual demons to face.

&amp;#x200B;

No real threat outside of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But If I just let myself be, I'd soon become much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to drink everyday, not having to deal with anyone.

Be forgotten.

&amp;#x200B;

And just die without even I noticing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Dying drunk. Alone. Not feeling anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But I have to get up.

Code.

Study.

Graduate.

Pretend I'm not depressed all the time for my girlfriend.

Because sometimes I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

But I enjoy being like this. It's how I feel since I'm 13.

Bursts of intense happiness and extasy.

And then extreme lows.

&amp;#x200B;

I drank today.

I felt happy for a while.

Drinking makes me not care.

&amp;#x200B;

And not caring is good.

But I can't just not care forever.

&amp;#x200B;

""There is a bluebird in my heart.

Who wants to get out

But I'm too clever for him.""

31,"I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. 
Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. 
But I don’t know, lately it’s gotten so much worse. 

Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and I’ve been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because I’ve been being unmotivated to do anything. 
And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. 
But lately it’s been different. I’ve been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10
Hours daily. I’m always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. 

I looked up what the things I’ve been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. 
But I don’t feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesn’t just want to do anything. My
Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I don’t want to die, but I can’t bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just don’t feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. 
I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things I’m feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the
Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. 

But I guess now I understand. And I hate it. I’m not a weak person, I was so dedicated to soccer, and I was full of motivation like a
Month ago, I don’t know what happened. I decided to just take a step back and figure it all out, where these feelings are coming from. I realized that I have something deep inside of me, but I don’t know what it is. It’s so much i have to keep digging. 
For 2 weeks I’ve stayed up thinking and praying and just trying to figure it out. 

I didn’t know I was hurt, I didn’t know I was lonely, I used to Just say fuck it, fuck feelings, pro athletes make it big because they don’t let their feelings get in the way. And
For a while it worked. Until it didn’t. 

I keep unpacking and unpacking. 

I don’t know what to do. I tell myself I’m going to turn my life around but every morning I fail. I’m on my way to being bed ridden, it’s just a matter of time. I’m losing motivation day by day. 

I don’t know what to do. If I ask my parents to take me to a therapist they’ll just shrug it off because they won’t believe I have depression. I don’t even want to have depression, and I want to believe that I don’t even have it. 

But I don’t know. I guess I just need to let it all out you know?

I feel so alone. I feel lonelier in school and in class with 25 other people in the room than I do in an empty house. I feel lonelier in a crowd than I do just being alone in my bed room. 
I don’t have anyone in my life who will really care about me you know, like take the time to understand me. I know my parents care, but they won’t understand me, and trust me I’ve tried. There’s such a divided of culture and philosophy between us. They’ve come from a poor background and worked their way up to have a stable and happy life with me and my brother. They never felt depressed, they never looked back, they just worked and kept going. And that’s why I’m trying so hard to just be so strong and try to not let depression just get in my way,because they had it worst than I did and they achieved so much. But it’s so hard. Nobody hits my phone up, asking me what’s up, or how I’ve been. And if they do, if I say horrible or try to talk to them, they’re gonna be like “oh sorry man, hope you feel better”. No one is there to understand me, or take the time to really care. Friends? What friends? All of them are horny simps. They would talk behind my back if it meant they could keep the conversation going longer with girls, and trust me it’s happened on more than one occasion. They’re all dicks. I’m supposed to pretend to be fine and happy and chill, or else I’ll be judged for being in my feelings. They’ll say I’m on my man period or something. I don’t have friends, and I’ve been trying to distance myself from the people I hang out with. 

How do they do it? They all loook so happy. Messing around with girls, being happy with their girlfriends. They’re all so happy to have each other man. They’re so tight. And I’m not part of their deep circle. I don’t want to be. I don’t want to be like them. And I have no deep circle of my own. 
I have no one who has my back. A lot of my “friends” just use me to cover for them if they didn’t finish their homework. 


I got the captaincy on my soccer team. I know many of those “friends” who are my teammates have been plotting and feinding behind my back. 

I’ve tried talking to girls, but I lose interest real quick because I know i won’t get anything deep with them, I won’t have a real connection with them, because I feel like I can’t trust them.

I feel like I can’t trust anyone. They can’t understand me. They can’t understand what I’m going through. 

Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I don’t know, for 3 months I really haven’t felt like I’ve been a part of a group, man. I don’t feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. 

The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. 
And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasn’t gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didn’t want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. 
She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didn’t. I guess she just couldn’t take it anymore. 

Everyone tells me they’re going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they aren’t there. 

It’s hard for me to trust. 

Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone.I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I don’t remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didn’t see a reason for living, and I hated everyone.

And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed. But I guess I didn’t because junior year here we are. 

I feel abandoned. I feel alone. I feel lost. 
These things never bothered me before, but why now???? 
WHY IS IT PULLING ME DOWN NOW? I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS THESE PROBLEMS ALL JUNIOR YEAR?! 

You know my ex, got over me so quick. She already found a prom date, and she and her best friend replaced me with another guy. Double replaced. This guy they replaced me with is annoying as hell though, but he’s so much smarter and more athletic than me. I guess they did better than I did. 

I’m just here alone, no one to have my back. I guarantee you, no one would give two fucks about me. No one thinks about me. No one is there to check up on me. I have no one. 

And it’s killing me. I thought loneliness was strenght, cus Kobe was lonely, and he became one of the greatest athletes of all time. So I thought me being lonely was gonna help. But lately, I don’t know, hey I’m sorry for a mess of a story I just told. I just need some help and needed to let it all out.",02Apr2020,1
