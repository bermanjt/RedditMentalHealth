I have trouble helping my girl who is diagnosed with clinical depression, it’s something new to me i never dealt with a mentally ill person or knew how to but i wanna learn and understand her more. First of all i know i cant fix her or make her snap out of it, i don’t know how to motivate her or what to tell her to motivate her if that will work so that’s why i need advice from you maybe you guys understand it better or had dealt with it. At first I’d tell her something like going on a good diet might work out for you or doing something physically but i guess that makes it worse. She doesn’t find a reason and tells me what’s the point of it? 

Any advice will be appreciated thank you alot!",15Mar2020,1

My bf (best friend/boyfriend) is depress and is really good at hiding it. He almost never takes anything seriously and always jokes around. But we have a lot of serious heartfelt talks. We usually see each other every night and spend most of his days off together. Recently there has been a change with his work schedule which made us not see each other for more than a week. During his days off we only saw each other once...he asked me to spend the night when I was leaving but I can’t because of my work schedule and with life at home. After that, he’s been distant for the whole week and kept saying he needs space. And I keep leaving him alone and giving him space but now he can’t give me at least one day to see him and kept saying he wants to be alone...he’s been ignoring my messages and calls as well. I know he was stressed the last time we saw each other.
However, I don’t know if he’s going through something and if I should just leave, because honestly it’s been hurting me too how he’s been treating me this week...


This is my first ever post. I don’t really know how these things work. Please be nice, I just really need help and clarifications...thanks in advance!",15Mar2020,1
2,"Hey guys, I know everyone is in the same boat here, but I really need advice. 

Everything in my country is shutting down. My university now only offers the recordings of previous years' lectures, and there are no actual classes. All my practicums got cancelled. My exams got postponed. My orchestra isn't practicing for the next few weeks, and this yearly event we have that I was really looking forward to is either cancelled or postponed. My dance classes haven't been cancelled yet, but at this point I think they will be soon.

I feel like I'm going mad already. I'm trying to make plans and have decided I will make a day to day schedule tomorrow, but I still feel like I can't handle this. I was just climbing out of a really dark moment and getting my life back together, I'd arranged everything with uni about the classes I missed, and now it's all fucked up again and it isn't even my fault. I really need all these activities to keep me sane and happy, and I'm so so so scared of losing all motivation and becoming really depressed again.

I tried talking to my mum about it, but she's just saying stuff about how we all have the same problems (she works from home, she can still do everything as normal!) and how I just have to accept it. But I'm terrified. Not of the virus at all, but of everything that comes with it. I can't just do nothing, but I need outside help to keep motivated. By myself I'll just drop everything and stay in bed all day!

Sorry, I'm really ranting here. But please, somebody, say something that helps because I'm driving myself crazy here.",15Mar2020,1
4,"That’s really the question, because I don’t know.
I’m gonna end up some loser drug addict in a ditch somewhere, I won’t succeed in anything. I can’t ever get to sleep at night and when I fall asleep in the early hours of the morning I sleep through all my alarms and can’t get up on time. If I’m ever on time to anything in the morning it’s because I haven’t slept at all. I haven’t gone to school barely at all so far this year. This is my second year taking these same classes because I failed everything last year. I begged and begged for one more chance, that I really wanted to try this time. And here I am disappointing everyone including myself. I won’t be able to get a job if I keep doing this! Who on earth would want to hire me. The only thing that made me happy was working close to animals, so I picked a course accordingly. Now I’m in the course (by some miracle, got in on like 4th choice a month after the initial acceptance letters got out) doing something I love and learning interesting things and still I can’t focus and turn in my shit on time. I have really great teachers and opportunities and still I can’t do anything. 

My therapist just? Left me. She was gonna go on summer leave for 5 weeks in June 2019, said I’ll have to go do on my own until then. But then she never contacted me after those 5 weeks. After 10 weeks I emailed the front desk and they said I wasn’t gonna go to her anymore. She just dumped me all by myself. Not that she helped anyway. I’ve been going to different therapists for over 3 years in CBT and NOTHING. I got taught a breathing exercise once. No homework, no grounding exercises, no healthy coping mechanisms. I was just wasting time in that office. I’m so, SO SO sick of this. There IS NOT POINT anymore. I haven’t seen my dad or my brother in a year. My step mum didn’t even send a birthday text. 
I’m so sick of living like this. There are no ups anymore. HOW. HOW DO I FIX IT. I’m gonna go crazy before I find out.",15Mar2020,1

6,"I've been on anti-depressants for almost 16 years. I've tried four times to wean myself off them, but each time the effects caused by my body's need to continue with the AD's was awful. Anxiety attacks, not wanting to leave the house, feeling unsafe in my own home.

10,"I'm losing hope.

I've tried everything to help with my depression, I've seen professionals, taken medication etc. Everyday feels like a nightmare, I'm never happy. I really wish I could appreciate life because it seems so beautiful but I can't and I don't know what to do at this point. I can't live like this anymore it's too painful and I wish I was just ok but I'm not. :(",15Mar2020,1
11,"Hello, I've never tried to seek support on the Internet before, but now I don't really know what to do, so, please, hear me out, any piece of advice helps, I'm really desperate.

(Side note: I'm not a native English speaker, so please excuse my poor grammar)

I (I identify as female) have clinical depression and anxiety. I have recently started having suicidal thoughts. I had depression before, but it's the first time I'm actually thinking about suicide, and it's scary.  


Here's my life situation. I'm currently in the USA on a non-immigrant visa that ends at the end of April, that means I HAVE to leave the country, there's no possibility for me to stay.  
I have a degree in a very ""non-applicable"" STEM field (think astrophysics) and I really wanted to become a professor, but due to my depression and other factors, I failed.   


I have to return to my home country (which is like a third-world country on the European continent). I have no job and no real-life skills. I'm trying to teach myself SQL through online courses at the moment. 

I also have no place to stay in my home country, I don't really have any good friends anymore and I'm estranged from my family.

So, by the end of April I have to: leave the US, find a job in my home country (I haven't lived there in 8 years), ship all my stuff to my home country (by sea, cause I have A LOT of stuff), sell everything I'm not taking with me, find a place to stay. I have \*some\* savings, so it's good, but it's not that much.  


Here's the kicker. I have 2 giant dogs and a clinically depressed husband (also from my home country, he hasn't had a good job in years, so I was the main provider for the family and I guess it will continue like that. So, I'm super anxious about finding a job that'll pay enough for both of us, the rent and the dogs). No-one in my home country wants to rent me a place with my dogs even though they are well-trained. Doesn't matter, people just hate dogs there.  


Husband is throwing tantrum after tantrum and yelling at me all day every day. Every single thing I do he hates. He yelled at me for not saying ""good morning"" to him (as an example). I understand he's depressed and anxious too and I'm doing my best not to upset him, but nothing helps. Today he said that maybe he wants to separate. Last time he said that he just bought a ticket home and disappeared for a month. I fear that if it all continues going downhill, I'll have to move from the US myself with no help.   


I'm also worried about the covid and the possibility that our flight (and basically all flights) might be cancelled and we will have to stay in the USA illegally. (I wonder if our country will somehow evacuate us, but the dogs? and all our belongings?)

I'm trying to stay calm and focused on learning SQL to find a better paying job, but I just can't get to the level of mental stability to effectively study with all this going on.  


Please offer me some advice or support. How do I interact with my husband? Should I just try to avoid interaction at all? I'm at a loss here.",15Mar2020,1
12,"I've been in a fit of depression for about two years now. I cry all the time and cant help but feel worthless. I lay in bed when I'm not at school and even then I put my head down on my desk and cry or feel depressed. 

I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone who's ever known me. I wonder how people could stand to be around me or to look at me. I'm a straight-A student with really supportive freinds and family but nothing brings me fulfillment anymore. 

I turned to cutting and scratching to help my overwhelming constant feeling of self doubt and self loathing, looking at it as a punishment for my wrongdoings. Especially in classes like Gym, where I'm clumsy and cant find motivation to try in the first place. 

I've been gaining weight like crazy. I'm still in the healthy range but before I was below becuase I was so self critical. My grades are fine but I never feel satisfied in them or anything I do. I feel like I'm annoying to my freinds because I'm not as peppy or exciting as I was before the depression hit. 

The worst part is that I dont feel like I deserve any help for anything I'm going through. I'm still a teenager, so most of my issues could probably be boiled down to hormones and everyone is really supportive of me. I've never tried to kill myself and my life is still in a pretty good place, so why do I deserve help if someone in an even worse place doesnt get it?

I dont even know why I'm asking here. You guys probably have your own life issues and now I'm asking for sympathy. It took me a really long time to post on here becuase I've been afraid of worrying anyone. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for. Some advice or encouragement I suppose? Any thing would be really helpful. Thanks everyone.",15Mar2020,1
13,"I am at the bottom of the hole.

Anyway, I was reading reviews for citalopram and some of the bad reviews are REALLY scary. But I also saw that the majority of reviews are positive. Now I don’t know what to believe or if I should even take these meds for something that will resolve itself by May most likely.

Today I share methods for dealing with our fears and worries because of the Corona Virus (Covid19). As NEWS media outlets across the world show us the problems and suffering as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic we need to protect the mind and ensure that we are not creating more problems that arise from certain uncontrolled minds. In this video, I share 6 practical methods to help us and our loved ones during this difficult time…These methods I share can also be applied to other worries we may be experiencing too!

22,"My dad is a boomer so you know where this is going. Due to mainstream media giving coronavirus constant attention with each news station either saying don't panic and just wash your hands and ""stock up on everything you can from your local stores"" my dad side's with the ladder.

Don't get me wrong I am not underestimating the coronavirus and the harm it can do to me or my dad or the damage it has done to thousands of elderly people of people with underlying illness.

I think people should stock up A BIT in case your community gets quarintined. We live about an hour away from hundreds of cases. It seems inevitable that it will reach our community eventually.

But my dad has spent god knows how much money on food and toilet paper (even when we have enough even if we we're quarintined) bread, canned foods, sandwhiches etc. He has made 3 trips buying this much stuff in like this past week or 2 weeks.

I'm worried about the coronavirus even if I am young and according to my doctor, healthy as any average teenager. But I'm worried what are we gonna do with the food we have if we have left overs, how much my dad is spending on all this. 

My dad also believes in some conspiracy theory I'm not even sure where he got, he believes the coronavirus was made in Canada and the Chinese government the stole information and made the coronavirus in the lab near Wuhan to use it as biological warfare in the form of a missile.

I tried many times to say it's most likely that a strain of it just appeared in the Wuhan live stock market. He says I'm being misinformed, whenever he buys this much stuff I tell him he is panicking even if he doesn't think he is and he just says, ""Okay stop it, think what you want Im just being prepared."" We are running out if room to put food in the fridge and freezer and cuboards.

I understand he's at a greater risk of danger of the coronavirus than I am but I'm worried on how much he's spending because everyone I ask he tells me not to worry about it.",15Mar2020,1

27,"Throwaway account. Background: I'm 16 and have struggled with moderate to severe depression for about a year now. It came out of the blue, although I've had anxiety for a while. Depression runs strongly in my family so not altogether surprised.  I've struggled so much with lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, imposter syndrome and feeling like people think I'm better than I am, and generally feeling like a useless human. I still love myself and always will, but I've started to really doubt my capabilities and I'm not sure how much of what my brain tells me are actually lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, last night I had a breakdown and was really struggling to communicate how I was feeling to my parents. I know they love me, but I don't think they entirely understand what's going on for me. My mom was trying to get me to exercise to combat the depression but my body felt like a bag of rocks and I just didn't have any willpower left so I just refused. So my mom got super angry and eventually I just collapsed in the bathroom. I don't know what made me do it, but I ran to my room with these really sharp tweezers and cut up my legs and made them bleed. I counted and it seems there are about 40 scratches that bled, plus a zillion more before it got more intense

&amp;#x200B;

That's the first time I've ever hurt myself on purpose, and now I'm scared that I might do it again. Because the pain felt good, it burned and the adrenaline rush felt like a drug and I didn't feel so passive anymore. But now that I have my thinking/feeling brain back I feel guilty and I'm afraid that having done it once means I could easily do it again. Because I don't feel like it was really me that did it, it was like my depression monster climbed out and possessed me, and that could happen again. What should I do? Has anyone else experienced this and have advice? I'm honestly kind of scared, now that I know what I'm capable of. I never thought I'd be the kind of person to self harm",15Mar2020,1
