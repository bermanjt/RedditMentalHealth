0,"Since coming home from one of the best vacations I‚Äôve ever had with my hubby. I‚Äôve been crazy depressed. Yeah I talk to him. But I still feel lost. I feel like a new job, or something new would help me out. But I don‚Äôt know what would help me. I miss him all the time when he‚Äôs gone. He‚Äôs the only thing that makes me truly happy anymore. I just don‚Äôt have motivation to do any thing either. I was ok before vacation but not now. I‚Äôm just stuck. I can‚Äôt get outta my head. I wanna cry when I‚Äôm alone. I beat my self up. I need help and no one in my family ever wants to reach out. Only a few people. I feel like a burden to.. I always have..",05Oct2020,1
1,"My work isn't doing well for more than a year now, i get up everyday deciding to build it better but as the day goes on i just lose hope piece by piece until i feel I'm just standing there not doing any better not taking a step forward.. tried to go abroad my visa was rejected,
The person who i finally found that i could be the real me around and loved with everything i have, actually understood me with every good n bad told me that he doesn't see a future with me because he found things he dislikes about me and gave excuses.. the 2 times i actually loved someone both made me feel like im unlovable ..
Im finally on medications for my depression and severe anxiety but no effect until now

I just feel so alone and heart broken for a long time now cant belong here nor there. I can't even focus long enough to try and get my work done which pulls me down even more, my birthday is in few days and even that i can't be happy about.. nothing is working or helping anymore..",05Oct2020,1
2,"I know this may fall onto the ears of people who aren‚Äôt really listening or care but I‚Äôm used to that. Recently I feel like I have a boulder pulling me down and I can‚Äôt do anything to try to get back up. I get discouraged by anything and everything. Today I finally worked up the energy to try to do some school work. Well, that didn‚Äôt seem to help. I felt like an idiot. I was stumped by basic math that I know I did during my sophomore year of high school, and yet here I was, a college freshman, fucking up. Not to mention my mother is always pissed at me and mad at me, whether it‚Äôs because of my past performance in school or my choice of college because I don‚Äôt want to go broke. I‚Äôve also been doing things I‚Äôm not proud of to make money and I just feel like a horrible person who should die immediately",05Oct2020,1

4,"Chances are no one will see this but that‚Äôs okay. My names Ashley and I‚Äôm 17. My dad has on and off anger issues and my mom is a raging bipolar. My brother/sister I‚Äôm not even sure anymore because I don‚Äôt think they understand either, Treat me like shit. I haven‚Äôt talked inside of my house for 2 days now because literally every time i talk I either get yelled at or cut off and ignored. I only had 2 friends but now they both have boyfriends and spend all their time with them. Well call them Apple and orange. Apple has been my best friend since middle school and started dating her bf and making new best friends last year. Every time I talk about how I feel the convo always turns to her which I didn‚Äôt used to mind because I like helping people but when I‚Äôm talking about wanting to end my life and then the reply is ‚Äúdude Ik but my bf did this..‚Äù it feels like they don‚Äôt care. Orange has only been my best friend for about 3 years now but we clicked instantly. I‚Äôm quiet and shy and caring and she‚Äôs loud and unfiltered and unbothered. She hated this one girl for something unforgivable but this last year got really really close and became best friends with her without ever really telling me. They live together now and I haven‚Äôt been invited over in months. Orange has struggles but nothing too bad (dad won‚Äôt give her money to go shopping mom won‚Äôt buy the brand of cookies she likes etc), she is really good with words and makes it seem like she cares but ever since new best friend came around she barely answers my texts. I post subtle hints on my private story about how I feel since I have a hard time with words and she just ignores them. Idk guys I just feel like I have no one. Even my cat doesn‚Äôt really like me anymore. She was my best friend and slept on my head ever night and followed me wherever I went. Last month she barely survived a surgery and I stayed home with her for weeks to make sure she got better and now she doesn‚Äôt follow me or even come into my room anymore. Sorry this is dumb but I don‚Äôt really have anyone to rant to.",05Oct2020,1

10,"I'm falling behind on school work. My mom is on my back about it. We're yelling and arguing at each other every day and it's hell

One of my closest friends is contemplating suicide and I'm trying my best to help him, but I have daily suicidal thoughts of my own I'm trying to deal with and I don't know how to get rid of them 

I crave social interactions, but any time I'm in social situations I get really high anxiety that prevents me from actually doing anything. I feel like everyone hates me, that nobody wants me there, that everything I say is stupid and people just ignore me and talk over me. 

Either way, nobody cares enough about me to actually invite me to friend groups or social events. I have like 2 or three people that I actually talk to and even then, we're pretty distant

And on top of all that my depression prevents me from actually enjoying the few good times I have. Like I'm actually having fun and then my brain reminds me that it will be over soon. That after this fun moment I'm going to return home to my boring sad life without gaining anything. The last time I felt real happyness was months ago. For months I have been going to bed feeling empty and meaningless, regardless of how the day went.

I feel numb. The days are blurred together. Yesterday is no different from today and today is no different from tomorrow. Rarely does a day go by where I don't have some argument. When I don't contemplate suicide. When I don't hate myself and regret everything I have done in my life so far. My life is a fucking living hell and I just want things to change, but they're not.

So I'm just curious if Depression is different for everyone or there's a range. Just wanted to be more informed is all. I'm getting help from services and support from family and friends who understand.",05Oct2020,1
12,"For most of my life I‚Äôve felt kind of lost and alone, and I don‚Äôt feel any kind of drive or desire to do anything in life. Growing up I was allowed next to no time to socialize with my peers outside of school, and I moved frequently on top of that, so losing friends became a part of life for me. My parents were often cold and cruel on top of that, hurting me physically and with their words for the crime of existing as I am. They often humiliated me and belittled me, but were nice when they wanted me to do something. 

I stopped moving for the most part once I reached middle school, and things started to get better. I was friendly with my classmates, and talked with them outside of school as well, but after middle school ended, many of us went to different schools, and I lost touch with them not long after. When I reached high school I felt so disillusioned with life that I felt if more of this was all I had to look forward to, then I would rather have no part of it. And so began the most self-destructive part of my life.

Despite my reservations, I knew that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt healthy, and I wanted help. I knew I couldn‚Äôt rely on my few remaining friends since we were friends mostly nominally, and I couldn‚Äôt rely on my parents either. If it still isn‚Äôt clear why I couldn‚Äôt rely on my parents, they couldn‚Äôt have cared less about my mental health, and as far as they were concerned, there was no such thing. 

I initially tried reaching out at school, to my guidance counselor. I was performing poorly in a subject my first semester, and she requested a meeting with me, which I thought would be the perfect time. Due to fear of the school reaching out to my parents if I admitted anything directly, I decided to ‚Äúcry out for help‚Äù using doublespeak and body language. I know this may make it seem like it‚Äôs my own fault, but I sincerely hoped she would understand that SOMETHING was wrong and ask more about it, at which point I would‚Äôve elaborated. Unfortunately, she reacted in the worst way possible, in a way I never expected. She essentially laughed at me and looked at me like I was some miserable creature unfit to live, and this attitude would continue through all of my dealings with her until I ended up transferring schools.

Before I transferred schools, found someone else at my school who I could talk to. They acquired a therapist to work in the building in my sophomore year, and I started talking to her after I found out about her in my junior year. She soon had me hospitalized for suicidal ideation and I spent almost one month there. I was scared at first, but it really did help, and I felt so good by the time I was released. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt last. Despite ongoing outpatient therapy and varying medications for a little over 6 months, I spiraled down into a hell I never even imagined before my hospitalization. I genuinely believed it would‚Äôve been better to have died than suffer like that, but I could barely pull myself out of bed most mornings.

As for what triggered it? Returning to my old life. I still felt good on the first day back. My parents pretended to be nice to me, but my mom snapped back to her usual self almost immediately, yelling at me and cursing at me, asking what the hell was wrong with me and calling me selfish and useless, as she always has. I then realized that my actual life would never match the fantasy I was shown in that hospital. I soon started cutting all of my classes at school, instead taking a nap in a quiet corner of the school. Eventually I stopped going all together. I had no friends who would go out of their way for me there, as up to then, I preferred crying in a corner feeling sorry for myself over socializing. My parents did not take this well as you can imagine, but I won‚Äôt get into that. 

I don‚Äôt know what triggered it exactly, but the following summer, I decided that I would start working hard for my future, not to be happy, but so that I can be free of my parents like I‚Äôd always wanted, and so that I can suffer alone in comfort, rather homelessness. After all, money doesn‚Äôt solve all your problems, but it‚Äôs better to cry in a Mercedes than in a cardboard box on the street. Any similar shitty quote works too. I got into a decent college not long after, majoring in engineering, mostly off of my SAT scores, but my grades my senior year were the highest they ever were. I managed to get lucky and nailed enough scholarships to get myself a mostly free ride. If I hadn‚Äôt managed that, I would genuinely rather have killed myself than bother taking on that much debt, in fact I had planned to if I couldn‚Äôt manage a workaround.

Despite their flaws, my parents have been rather supportive of me in college. I don‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôve changed their ways, but they are supporting me financially. As far as their attitudes go, instead of trying to change them, I‚Äôve finally settled for manipulating them to serve my interests. I‚Äôve realized that they will never be the parents I needed, certainly not ones I wanted, but I only have to suffer them a little longer, then I can cut them off when I no longer need them. If you think this makes me as bad as them, it may, but in a different way, and I probably will end up maintaining some kind of relationship with them anyway.

Right now, I‚Äôm in my second year of college, and I‚Äôm doing well academically, and fine with my extracurriculars, but more and more I‚Äôm struggling to get myself to be productive. More and more, i‚Äôm sleeping in and sleeping late, and spend hours everyday binge watching anime (which I love, and is one of the few good things in my life, the others being sleep and music, mainly).

Despite everything, I still only work hard because I want a relatively comfortable life, working a decent job until I die. I‚Äôve pretty much given up on friendships and dating at this point, and all I want is a quite life where I can be healthy, comfortable, and do the things I enjoy (like watch anime) outside of work. A part of me still wants to die and in my mind I don‚Äôt see myself living past my late 20s-early 30s and have no desire to. But I‚Äôm ok with that. I tried counseling services at school before COVID, but it wasn‚Äôt doing much for me. I can‚Äôt afford any other kind of care right now, but I doubt it‚Äôll help anyway tbh.

Sorry if it seems a little incoherent or if the majority of this post seems unnecessary, I just wanted to give a little context to make it a little more clear how I got here.

19,"I'm not really depressed as such, at least not right now (although I have been severely depressed before). If I am depressed, then I'm extremely functional.

What I do know is, deep down I really hate myself. I don't know why, there doesn't seem to be any specific reason for it. I just have some deep-seated self-loathing that just hangs around me and that occasionally pops up when I get stressed or upset.

I've kind of just had to accept it and try to live with it, but it doesn't really go away. I'm starting to doubt whether it even can go away. When I talk to other people about it they either try to tell me all the reasons why I'm a great person (which does nothing), or they say something like ""you need to learn to love yourself"", which to me just sounds like another way of saying ""just don't be depressed lol.""

Just to show you that I know how to build habits :)

I also let go of a couple of negative habits such as unhealthy nutrition and overly procrastinating.

29,"So reddit is new territory for me and i get this is the depression help subreddit but anyway: Trigger Warning for self harm here. 

So i have been struggeling with self harm for a while now. When I was younger i woulld self harm regularly. I stopped for almost 5 years.  And generally ""got a grip"" on my life again. 

I just started my final semester of uni and am supposed to start my bachelor's thesis. I don't know if it is the stress from uni or the pandemic or both but today was the first time in years that I hurt myself again. I have been unable to work on my thesis for weeks now, because I get weird anxiety attacks everytime I even think about working on anything to do with uni (not just the thesis but general stuff too). I am in bed most day, even though i know i shouldn't be and try to fight it. Basically i am really bad again. 

Therapy is going to be hard to come by since I am not entirely sure where to find it at my current location and how to pay for it.  

I don't know... A good friend of mine found good advice on how to get help or little things to get better on here and i thought i would try it. 

I just feel like I don't have the power to fight it right now, but that is not an option since it will make me fail my thesis.  So I thought I try and ask for advice here....",05Oct2020,1
30,"I just cancelled my camping trip. I was supposed to go up north today, and spend 5 days by myself hiking, reading, cooking, and stargazing. I started camping in the beginning of summer because it was the only activity that I could do during quarantine. I took a real liking to it, and I found many of my mental health struggles quiet when I was out in nature. 

Today I was going to be going to my dream park, the finale of a great season of camping. But I woke up, and all I could think was ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù I told my family I cancelled it because the weather looked bad, but truthfully, I just felt like there was no point in going through all this trouble just to get one tiny crumb of serotonin. 

The rest of the day I‚Äôve been spiralling, and the urge to self harm has been stronger than I‚Äôve felt in months. My mom yelled at me for sleeping in until noon yesterday, I admitted to my dad I was on antidepressants last week, and he straight up ignored what I said and changed the subject. Same with my mom. 3 months ago I admitted for the first time ever that I self harmed, and she‚Äôs never brought it up since. 

I‚Äôm trying so hard to find something to live for, some sort of ray of light. But I get the impression that people look at my issues as excuses, and have given up on me. No one checks up on me, no one has even asked me ‚Äúhows your day‚Äù or ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù in god knows how long.

He did it anyway, thinking it was hilarious and I was hurt. I had a concussion and haven‚Äôt recovered as i am suffering post concussion syndrome. 
I am also a sexual assault survivor. So the fact that yet another man has gone against my consent to be touched in any way has triggered so much in me. Everyone telling me the accident was my fault as I should have fought harder or screamed louder. I feel as though I have PTSD again.. I can‚Äôt think about it without having a panic attack.

I'm really tired off keeping it inside and the only thing chaining it down is that piece of trash i have left of my injured heart,i cannoy let anyone help me anymore the only person i ever let in just walked and threw hate at me which worked like a damn fuel to enrage the abomination that lives inside my subconcious.
