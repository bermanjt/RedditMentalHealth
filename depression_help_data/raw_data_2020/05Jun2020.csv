0,"I graduated in comp sci with bachelors in fall. I haven't been able to find a job. I have a family with two kids that I can't support. I fell into what I believe is depression back in April. I stopped looking for jobs and stopped studying. I'm trying to get back on my feet to apply but I don't even know where to begin anymore. My peers who recently graduated found jobs. I feel like I'm hopeless. I tried to get back to programming but I can't last more than 5 mines without being distracted by my inner thoughts. I feel like I forgot everything I've learned in the last several months. I also feel useless in my family. I don't believe I've been the best father. I've felt impatient with my kids and I isolate myself from my family trying to better myself, but in reality I've been falling more and more into depression. I feel hopeless and I can't pick myself up. What made me feel the need to post this is when I just considered running away. I know I can't because of whats happening out there and the curfew. But I feel like my family doesn't need me and would be better off without me. I don't know what to do",05Jun2020,1
1,"I am having suicidal fantasies and thinking of hurting myself. Anything to make this pain inside me stop. I think about ways I could go when I have downtime from work. This is a first for me. I've always taken my family's distain for me in stride but Im tired and I can't do it anymore. 

I'm tired of feeling rejected and unloved my family and so called friends. Several of my siblings have betrayed me and that hurts so much more. My bf is trans and they couldn't have reacted worse or said nastier things about us, upon finding out we were dating.
I can't make a friend that isn't in love with me and then leaves when they realize I really just wanted a friend. It's happened so often I just don't want to make friends anymore. I don't get it bc I'm so transparent about it. I feel so used and alone. My bf is great at making friends and I want to be happy for him but it hurts to see him make friends with real loyal people right off the bat. 

I want someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay but there isn't anyone out there looking for a psuedo daughter. 

It hurts bc I know I'm worth so much but what does that matter if people are going to treat me like shit? I keep thinking of how much my parents will regret treating me once I've died. That's the only way they'll learn or have any respect for me.",05Jun2020,1
2,"I’m an absolute fuck up of a human being 23f
Hello you guys. I’m already an anxiety-ridden pos, so please spare me the comments on how wrong I am for getting to this point in my life. I am not joking when I say I’m a fuck up. I was always good in school, but come junior year of high school I just let go of all ambitions to get good grades. I come from a middle-eastern family so the shame still follows me to this day. 90% of not getting good grades was completely my fault. 10% my dad being verbally abusive on a daily basis, if not with me then my mom or sister, and the occasional physical abuse. I had very low self-esteem from bullying ing middle school and my grandmother calling me ugly a lot of the time. My mom is still hard on me for my body even though I’m a 125lb 5’3’’ woman. It’s very hard for me to gage how difficult my life was at the time because I don’t really have an idea what “normal” is. No ones family is, so I feel bad saying I had a difficult time especially when my family is upper middle class and they afforded me whatever I wanted. I just didn’t apply to schools because I knew that I wasn’t going to get in, so my plan was to go to a regional college (I don’t know if it’s a community college it has a med school attached to it. I tell myself it’s not to make myself feel better) and then transfer to this university’s sister school’s main campus. Anyways, I ended up doing that, my grades weren’t phenomenal, but I got As in all the classes that pertained to my major. The summer after I had 2 internships. I got accepted to this school, and when I went I basically flunked my entire first year at the school. My parents don’t know about it and I never plan on telling them. At the time I lost my best friend, the closest friend I’ve ever had at the time, by loss I mean like a break-up, and we “broke u” in a cruel manner. During this time I gained 30 pounds and was very obviously depressed. I tried different medications until I just stopped. The summer before my next year I gassed myself up to go very hard because I wanted to get good enough grades to study abroad the next summer. I did. It was really weird thinking about it now that I’m in the state that I’m in now. I got a membership at orange theory and would go basically every day to work out and then go to my classes, and I didn’t necessarily ace them, but I got above B-’s in all of them. I come back from my study abroad trip in the best shape I was ever in throughout my life, mentally and physically. I got all As in my classes abroad, walked everyday, made new friends, etc. the natural serotonin was amazing. Now coming into my senior year, my first semester was good as well. I signed up for next years classes and took everything I needed to graduate, despite basically being a complete failure my sophomore year. The beginning of the semester I am doing tremendously. I am on top of the world. And suddenly, I just stopped. Stopped going to class, stoped giving a shit, stopped doing anything. The shame of walking into a room with people who knew I missed even three classes was so disappointing I would literally tremble from anxiety thinking about going into class the next day. So I didn’t. My parents think I graduated. I planned on making up for it by taking classes the summer after. I didn’t do that as well. I slept all day, I would take two benedryl a night just so I can sleep as long as I could so I wouldnt have to face anyone or anything. I come home from school. I find a job as a paralegal. I do that. I take the LSAT, get a pretty low score. The summer is here, I’m taking online classes to finish my degree, and I’m not doing too well in that either. My parents think I’ve applied to so many law schools, and I actually tried to but because I have a tuition I cannot pay off my university refuses to send my transcripts to apply. I tried applying for a student loan but my credit is too low and need a cosigner and don’t have anyone in my life that would do that for me to be honest. I’m writing all this and it seems like I’m nonchalant about this please know I cry on a daily fucking basis, I resent myself, the amount of times in the middle of the night I think about just jumping off a balcony makes me cry as I write this but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to do that too. I feel like I’m just a sentient being occupying too much space for the Earth and don’t deserve that. What really made me crack though is yesterday my boyfriend (doesn’t know much of this but he knows I’m depressed) invited me to his house for a barbecue. His dad asked me what my favorite memory from high school and college were. I answered, but in the moment I almost felt like ditching and just crying. My bf is way too overqualified to be attracted to anyone like me. He’s a graduate of uc Berkeley, I’ll just leave that there. Thinking about what my favorite memory was so heart wrenching. I know people always say, “ fuck high school, I want to peak later in life” yeah that for me is heightened ten fold. I don’t have a good memory from high school. I just don’t. I regret so much that the word instantly just brings tears to my eyes. I didn’t go to football, basketball, or any games in high school or college. Both of them were athletic schools. I didn’t join a sorority in college, and I didn’t have many friends, honestly I don’t know gif they’re really my friends they haven’t talked to me this year. I’m a loser. The worst part about this shit, the shit that keeps me up at night, the shit that I crave the answer to so much is WHY DID I JUST STOP GOING TO CLASSES LAST SEMESTER OF MY SENIOR YEAR? Why did I do that? I had it going so well. It feels like I’m not in control of my fucking body. I’m so ashamed of myself I’m scared to let anyone know of this. I come off as a very intelligent person, I can carry intellectual conversations, I read, I can speak 4 different languages, I’m not stupid. I use to refuse that I was stupid, but I’m getting to the point of where I think I am. Anyways, I just wanted practical advice. I just wanted to know why I suddenly dropped all of my priorities out of nowhere especially during a time when for me, life was good. Is there a disorder or something? I want to fix it, I am so disgusted with myself I’m doing so many weird things. I want to break up with my perfect boyfriend because I feel like he could do so much better it feels like a joke that he chooses to be with me. He doesn’t know about not graduating but he knows that about past struggles. I can’t even use my dad as an excuse anymore, he’s mostly good to me now. He has some hiccups, but in general he’s good at this point. So this is me. It is all me. And I need to fix myself. Please help.",05Jun2020,1
5,"Dear reddit, I am reaching out to you because I am unsure of what to do at this moment. My brother is currently in his final year of university, and has trouble trying to finish the year. It's not because he is bad at studies (he was good to the point of securing a scholarship) but my family members and I are aware that he lacks motivation. For the past few weeks, my brother has been going on about his lack of interest to continue studying and wants to work. He has minimal work experience and has the qualifications at the community college level only at this point. We've tried talking to him and all he says is he wont continue his studies and wants to work solely to pay bills and the tuition fees owed due to scholarship forfeiture (he has no plans of starting a family, owning property,etc). I know his life plan isn't feasible, and that he may not view life very meaningfully. I'm a few thousand miles away from home and cant see him right now. He is currently living with my other brother, away from my parents. What can we do at this point? Thank you for your time reading this, may god bless us in this difficult time.

Ps. I know counselling is a good idea, but it is expensive and we aren't able to afford many sessions. There's no free counselling in my community either. I'm open to any ideas because I am desperate. I fear for his life and future.",05Jun2020,1

I don't know why am I sharing this, in reality ‘Who the fuck cares?’ no one really and it's okay, but I just felt the need to to share part of my experience and how to make a short note about it but...I'm in my late twenties, I have been suffering from depression, stress and anxiety I guess since my teenage years and over the years it got worse, I was ‘diagnosed” with it I think five years ago by a lovely psychologist I miss so much but made me change to another one who told me that a psychiatrist shouñd be the one to diagnosed me, and like a half a year ago I had to asked to the dickhead of my psychiatrist that I attended to to what exactly I had and told me I have some sort of ‘major depressive disorder’ and right now I'm scared because I feel there's no hope for me I can feel like this for all the years I will, I have done nothing with my life, I'm scared of people, I'm obese, miserable can't communicate with my father I can't look at that miserable piece….I'm almost like him but I  a female version, I treat my mom like shit, I'm obsessed with junk and comfort food, I have an eating disorder, can't stop of wasting my parents money with trash food I will hide from them (we are not rich, not poor, not even in the middle) I haven't eaten this past few days like barely nothing because of the numbness, which is a good and bad thing for my health, Im freaked out, I'm a weird person whose aware at the same time in denial, I started to do or “practice” a hobbie I always wanted to do but I feel like I'm dying, then I just watched a new Radio TTS about ‘How not to give a f’ which was wonderful but in the end I'm a nothing piece of shit, just a waste of space, my medication scares me too, I feel lonely can't stop having fantasies about someone loving me, holding me while being a better person that I will never be, I cry everyday, I have IBS, maybe some type of colon cancer now,  don't want to live more years feeling like this, but if I killed myself my parents will suffer too because they are used to me living with them or being part of their life, I'm one of the worst people I have ever met.",05Jun2020,1
7,"Hi, so if you go to my profile and you go to my first post you would noticed that I had a boyfriend 2 years ago(we now talk as friends). 

He has severe depression, he did something that he really regrets to me, that leave him with a lot of regret and guilt, and he was depressed about it for a lot of time, maybe that leaving him severly depressed(sorry if I sound ignorant or if i'm wrong). I'm supporting him at the moment, he tells me how difficult and horrible is to feel like that(I think that I also have depression but moderate, but I've never went to therapy for it). I feel that he deserves to be happy and i'm the one deserving to feel like that. Sometimes I search for ways to make myself feel miserable, once I tried to not sleep at all because it's difficult to him to sleep because of depression, a few weeks ago I tried starving myself, but it didn't work, and other times I just wish death to myself.",05Jun2020,1
8,"13f and everything is a struggle. I don't feel like I can reach out to anyone at the risk of burdening them or seeming vulnerable with my problems. I expect the worst in that people who expressedly care about me and will willingly listen to me will see my them as obsolete and judge me for being knocked down by such insignificant matters.

My mother has pretty much never tried to emotionally support me for my entire life; I think she cares about me and isn't comfortable with actually talking so she uses quick fixes and small gifts as a replacement whenever I ask for help. I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone in my family and I have so much anxiety when I try to reach out to friends or an online therapist.

10,"So, last year I was diagnosed with depression, however I kinda knew I had it ever since middle school. My issue isn't that I have depression, I've delt with it so long it's just a part of life for me, but rather how I talk about it. I've always been picked on for being short and not being well versed when it comes to talking to people, and so instead of admitting to others that I've been struggling lately I pretend I'm doing better than everyone.

15,"I just had maybe one of the weirdest and scariest experiences in a while. Had a full-on meltdown for hours straight because of a situation that was very stressful to me.

Almost as if I was slurring and stuttering at the same time, had trouble forming sentences or saying one word not very slowly. After I calmed down it got better.

I am losing 10,000 a year because of the amount of work I miss. I cannot afford this. I just bought a house, i cannot afford to be doing this. I bought this new construction house so I wouldn't have to worry about unforeseen problems coming up, and low maintenance. That completely backfired.

A lot of serious stress. First marriage and first baby first of all, re-planning the wedding for only a month away and with covid, family dying, family with... issues that directly affect us on a daily basis, family pushing boundaries, creepy/crazy landlords while watching infidelity and not feeling safe, life long pets getting old and hard to care for, lost not one but two jobs.

21,"Ok. So this is probably going to be a long post.

There has only ever been 1 girl i fell completely and utterly in love with. She was absolutely perfect for me. In literally every single way. She was gorgeous, she was kinky, adventurous, she was fun, a bit nerdy, such a kind heart, head strong, always there. But then one day she wasn't. Full disclosure, this happened almost 10 years ago. (I was 19 at the time). And i have been trying all this time to move on. But i can't. 

I feel my thoughts getting darker on a constant level. I have tried being with other people, but i feel completely disconnected with everyone and everything and the relationships never last long. As, I've never found anyone that makes me feel the same as her. I've grown incredibly good at pretending to be happy because I hate people doting on me. 

The fact that i feel so disconnected from everything has pushed me into exploring darker and more extreme things just to feel something or a connection with someone. Don't get me wrong, i dont go around killing puppies or anything. But currently I am considered a very controlling Dom/sadist. Nobody has been able to make me orgasm for 10 years. Because when i do initiate anything sexual, i start feeling guilty that i cant be with the girl i still want now. And then that makes me feel stupid. How could i not be over someone after 10 years? Especially when i was still young when it happened. But i can't deny the feelings i have. I still think about her. 

I am now approaching 30. And after spending so much time in lockdown with my own thoughts. I am finding it incredibly hard to find a reason to stick around for the long haul. I guess i don't really see the point. There's very little i take genuine joy from and almost everything i do is just passing the time. 

I have spoken to many doctors over the years but all they have done is prescribe me the same anti depressant over and over again that doesn't work. None seem to want to send me to a therapist or anything. 

It took me 7 years before i even started talking about it to people i know. And those i do tell then see me for the damaged person i actually am. Which makes me feel worse.

I've tried being with people, tried polyamory,  tried living alone, tried D/s relationships, tried talking to people, tried pretending I'm fine and getting on with things. But doing so means i have been with quite a few people and unfortunately ended up breaking a few hearts myself when they realise I cant give them emotionally what they need. Which in turn puts me on a spiral. Maybe after hurting people from not recovering as quickly as any normal person would have, then maybe i don't deserve to find someone that makes me feel the same.

I have tried anti depressants (for years), I've had 11 different jobs, I've wrote more songs than i can count, i try drawing, i try playing instruments, gaming, reading, walking, cooking, cycling, giving people advice,  anything i can think of. But nothing seems to actually make me happy or give me an escape from myself for long. I just feel like I'm existing.

The only thing i have is that i don't want to give up. I keep trying to find something, anything that can help me. I want to live my life. I want to enjoy it. But I don't seem to be able to. Everything (and everyone) simply disappoints me. I also know there are people who care for me. And i would never want to somehow send anyone else into the same spiral i have been going through. But i find the older i get, the worse my mindset is, as opposed to ""getting better over time"". 

I know there are people out there suffering far more than me. And this post probably reads like ramblings of a mad man.

If anything it makes me feel a little better to put it all into words. Get it off my chest once in a while and what not. 

I'm not expecting anyone to comment. I'm not expecting anyone to read. If you have managed to get through all of this post. Then thank you. 

I have considered posting my story somewhere for a long long time. And this is the first time i have. 

I guess after everything, i just need to know is it normal to still not be over something that happened so long ago?",05Jun2020,1

23,"Hi, I'm F and under age

I've been dealing with abuse from my parents for years now, I've tried to call the emergency number in my country a few times but I was constantly refused help because I was told that my situation wasn't serious.

My parents did the following:
-harm me using fire
-threaten my life
-block my air flow

I have told the person on the other side of the line about these things, I was always met with something along the lines of ""parents would never do such a thing to their child"". I've tried to explain how serious it has gotten but again, I was denied help.

I've tried to inform the school which resulted in my mother to find out and harm me a bit more. I've tried to tell my friends but all they could give are words of support which I highly appreciate, but I want help. I've tried to set boundaries but they're always crossed. I tried to open up to my parents and siblings multiple times about how much pain I'm in but the only response I get is ""you're too sensitive"". I've tried everything I could think of and I don't know what to do anymore. Life has turned so dull colourless over the years of the pain and I have absolutely nothing to look forward to...

I wish I could just finish school with great grades and get out of the house but I just can't. Doing anything keeps reminding me of the pain from my home life and my grades are slipping, I simply can't do anything to stop this cycle. My life is on repeat and I feel like I'm in a game where I reset my progress over and over again.

I have a history of attempted suicide but no one cares enough to try and intervene.

29,"I'm not constantly depressed, but everytime i'm getting pulled towards it I want to commit suicide because I don't ever want to go through that pain ever again. 

I had been super depressed last year for 8 months, it was like living hell. Favorite part of my day was finally being able to sleep but I would even be depressed in my dreams and at most I would be sleeping for a couple hours. Then the second I wake up I would start balling, feeling so alone and I felt like I couldnt breathe. I tried going to school but on a daily I would break down crying because I thought I was nothing. Couldnt eat, because I hadnt been eating, caused by nausea. Lost a shit ton of weight, I used to be decently curvy and now I have self image issues on being too skinny. Skipped school and work, going broke because I hated myself. I had so much work and bills built up I just thought I needed to end it. I was so depressed already and then acne came on my face, causing me to endure more shame full of ugly marks on my face. Everyone told me they understood, but they went home to a happy family. I went home to my cat and a mom that despised me. My mother said I'm not shit and she would beat me sometimes. She is very mentally devastating because it seems like everything she says to me is trying to put me down.

I recently got into a new relationship and he is so amazing to me, brought me flowers yesterday and surprised me. He brought light into my life and I'm so thankful for it; however, I constantly think about my past relationships and how they had just left me when I never did anything wrong. I'm afraid he would do the same with me. He tells me how beautiful I am on a daily, I don't show that I don't think so but deep down I think I'm the most ugly piece of shit ever. I thought at one point maybe I need to work on myself first, but I know I will fall apart completely when he's gone. I fear so much for my future, I'm not the prettiest or the smartest. I fear that he's going to leave me because he is the only one I have. It drives me crazy because I came from a super fucked up family and I'm constantly trying to pay off debt or bills and my money could never seem to grow. It feels like life just isnt doing me any good and it never will. I fear that I could not catch up to society and I don't want to go through that pain of actually going through it. I fear so much everyday and I'm so tired, maybe a better word would be exhausted. I'm so exhausted of fearing failure that I want to commit suicide and just end it all. I'm in so much fear that if one day my current boyfriend leaves me again it would be because he's found someone more beautiful and smart than I am. Then that's going to leave me with self destruction, constantly thinking that I would never be good enough. Again, I don't say any of this to him. If I did I did it jokingly because I know this is a huge turn off.

It just feels like I should... have some kind of reason to be? But I keep thinking and there is no reason. My death is like the death of a flower: lost in the sea of the meadow. I have no reason to be and that makes me feel like the world is crushing me. 

I write stuff. Everything I try to make just feels so disposable. I think to ever human who wrote down this stuff and I an plagued by my lack of reason. Of there is no purpose, why continue? 

I really hate this but it feels like I shouldn't give up. If not only of my own fear but because of the mess it would cause. It's funny how my death would just be a problem for someone else to wipe up. 

I want help but I never know how to express this. I have friends with depression but asking them feels rude. I'm suppose to make them not want to kill themsleves, not use them as a therapist. So I ask reddit like a real zoomer.",05Jun2020,1
34,"I’m a complete loser and I’m going to amount to nothing. I keep having mood swings and panic attacks. I thought this shutdown/quarantine would slow things down and make me relax a little and for a month or so it did, but a couple of weeks ago I started getting anxiety, and this past week I’ve been angry and miserable because I can’t stop thinking about all the problems I have. Sometimes I feel if I had a gun I would blow my brains out to stop it all.

I was supposed to graduate college this year but missed it because of one class which I have to take again, but I’m not good at it so i don’t think I’ll pass. And all 4 years of college might do to waste just because of this one class.

On the social side I’m an even worse failure. I’m 22 and a virgin (been kissed but never had a girlfriend nor been in love) and it’s eating me up. I’m scared to ask girls out now because I’ll be embarrassed when I have to tell them I’m a virgin at this age and it looks like I’ll stay one for the rest of my life. Even when women show interest in me I can flirt but can’t go any further from there. College is a time when people have fun and sleep around and date but my anxiety prevented me from having the confidence to get into romantic relationships and now it’s all been wasted. People in high school used to make fun of me and call me a retard and loser and said I will never get girls. And now in this quarantine there’s no chance of getting with anyone. I can’t even make a tinder since I don’t have any good pictures of myself or with friends. 

Even with friends I don’t see them very often, since they live in different cities and there’s only two which I consistently keep in touch with. I have partied in college and done drugs but I rarely had fun. I never get to travel like other people do because I don’t have much money. I don’t even have a car. 

My parents were super strict before college and rarely let me go out with friends in middle and high school which stunted my confidence. I have never gotten along with my parents, and when I have tried to talk to them about my problems they just yell at me and tell me to get over myself. They use to hit me when I was younger according to their “disciplinary action” and used to insult me a lot and put me down. They kept me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do. When I joined a sports team I’m high school and actually started getting good at the sport they refused to let me do it the next year because according to them my grades were slipping. The only thing that seems to matter to them is my grades. I don’t love them and have no intention of seeing them again once I have a job and place to stay. 

I thought I had some chance of getting a job before this shutdown and now I don’t think that will happen. I will probably be wage slaving for the rest of my life. If I don’t pass this last college course that most likely will happen. Most of my friends have jobs lined up after graduation or are in relationships and I have neither of those, putting me behind in life in comparison to everyone else.

I keep having mood swings that take a while to go away and there are moments where I feel a bleak despair for the future. I have never been happy once in my life, not since I was a small child.",05Jun2020,1
