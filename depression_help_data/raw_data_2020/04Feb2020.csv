0,My dad coded yesterday and he's in ICU basically just laying there staring at a ceiling on a vent. Yesterday I cried non stop for probably 24 hours straight. Today I'm doing better and not as upset but I'm really sick to my stomach. I can't really find anything about what might work well to help with the sick stomach feeling from being upset so it'll be easier for me to do things that need to be done right now. Does anybody have any suggestions? Thanks.,04Feb2020,1
1,"Hey, 19 yo M. As the title says I have no clue who I am anymore. This has been a long time coming, I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, and through all that I could feel myself slipping away. I no longer know what I believe, what I'm interested in, who my friends are, or who to trust. I'm finding it extremely difficult to keep moving forward because how could I? 

I have no motivation to do anything because I have nothing to look forward to. I used to have dreams and goals, but lately none of that matters and none of it interests me. It's been like this for months now.

I Don't know if any of this makes sense or if someone can relate, but I just need some advice on how to get past this. 

This is my first post on here and probably not the last, but I hope I'm doing this right. 😬",04Feb2020,1
2,"Well, today was the first time in college where I slept through a quiz. I've been trying to convince myself that I don't have depression and it's just temporary, but I can't kid myself anymore. I forget things right after I hear them, I can't pay attention, my hygiene is starting to decline, my sleep is terrible, and I have no motivation to do literally anything. I started a game development club at my college last semester, but even that is starting to fail and I feel like I'm letting everyone in the club down. I feel like I have nothing going for me, and even if I do get through college, what's on the other end? I have no skills. No redeeming qualities. I have no girlfriend, no close friends that I can easily talk to, and my life just feels like a long waiting game. I don't want to die, but even just sitting here doing nothing is exhausting to me. I don't know what to do.",04Feb2020,1
3,"Yeah, I know, cliche', but I'm having a hard time waking up every morning and seeing the point. the ONLY thing keeping me going right now is my 12 year old son (my ex is not his bio mom).

I'm in the Seattle, WA area. I have been married twice and now divorced twice. My most recent divorce was finalized just a week or so ago. Here's the thing.

I married this woman because I loved her. I loved her and her family. In the end, she was diagnosed with a disability and took it hard. She lost her mom to cancer, she has a special needs child (adult now) and took it really hard. The last 2-3 years of our marriage were hell. I was doing everything I can to be there for her, to help, to be understanding and being who she needed. She finally broke and admitted herself into a mental hospital for inpatient treatment. It was what she thought she needed, and that is what she did. I was there, EVERY DAY to visit, talk to her and be there whenever she needed. She seemed like she was getting better. Then, nothing inside was working. The strangest situations were coming up and she was scared. We got her out of there and I thought things were going to get better. Nope, she met someone on the inside and asked if he could crash with us as he is homeless.

Nice enough guy, I was hesitant, but she talked me into it. I was hoping it would help.

Nope, everything went to hell. She pushed me away, she spent more and more time with this other guy, but nothing romantic happened. Nothing of that nature. No, this is not a ""she cheated on me"" story.

I went to work every day. I provided all financial support and now I had another guy living under my roof coming up with every excuse as to why he can't get a job, fin work or go somewhere else to stay. She got mad at me for trying to put out house right. I wasn't being a dick or anything, but I was just asking if there was anything I could do to help him get a job. They took that as an attack.

Finally, after almost a year of this, I decided I was tired of being used as an emotional punching bag and I told her that we needed to split up.

She took it hard, at first, but then spend me up out of the room and I moved into the office. After a few more months of being a punching bag and ATM, I move out with my son.

As soon as we moved out, I filed for divorce and that is when the REAL hell started. She took me to court and was able to get a $2700/mo support check from me until our court date for our divorce trial.

We were married a total of 9 years.

As the court dates came and went, I filed all of the paperwork that I was required to provide, however, she provided NO PAPERWORK AT ALL except her initial financial declaration, which the judge commented was ""pretty sparse"". Regardless, she managed to get the support from me and I paid it. I never missed a payment and always paid on-time.

Here comes our court date.

We arrive to find that the judge, who we have been working with for over a year now and knows our case really well, was in the middle of a criminal trial. Oh, yeah, neither of us had lawyers, I do not know how anyone can afford them as every one of them wanted a MINIMUM of $10k retainers and even more on top of all that!! 

I digress... We were moved to another judge's calendar. She asked us of we had printouts of all of our paperwork, we did not. She spend less than 15 minutes ""reviewing"" the case files, of which there are hundreds of pages, and then talked to us for less than 20 minutes.

Next thing you know... She tells me that I am ordered to pay this... person... $4000/mo for 15 years. She claimed disability, yet NO medical records were provided. She claims Social Security denied her and her son disability, with NO paperwork provided. She claims that she cannot work, but has NO documentation proving this. Of course, she starts crying and goes into sobs and the judge bought it all. Every last crocodile tear and looked at me like I was the biggest ass-hole in the world for leaving her and then made that decision.

Now, I make good money, however, $4000/mo is almost 50% of my NET income. I live in the Seattle area with my son. It's NOT cheap to lie here. I live in a crappy 30 year old apartment complex that I could afford, but now, with $4000/mo going to... her... I can't afford to live here. I cant afford to keep the roof over my head and my son and I are soon to be out on the streets.

I have filed an appeal. I am trying to have papers served to her so the appeal can move forward, but right now, I am stuck paying her and I, simply, cannot afford it.

I have already pulled the plug on pretty much everything I can to survive paying her the $2700/mo, now I have to come up with $1300 MORE? From WHERE?

I LOVE my job. I LOVE the company I work for, but right now, I have migraines EVERY NIGHT because of the Anxiety of having to wake up in the morning. Then, when I do wake up, I have to convince myself that it's going to be worth getting out of bed.

I drive myself to the bus station and wonder why. Why should I not stop on the train tracks and let the train finish me off. Why should I not just jump in front of a bus and end it now. What's the point in going to work when my son and I are going to end up on the streets anyway? HOW AM I GOING TO PAY RENT?!?! I have worked all my life to get to where I am now and for what? So she can live off all my money and hard work for NOTHING? I honestly don't now why I am writing all of this and posting it. I don't hardly see the point anymore.

I just wish to not wake up tomorrow...",04Feb2020,1
4,"**Considerations:**

1. I am not a native english speaker, please excuse my grammatical errors.  
2. This is my first time using Reddit, please pardon me if there is anything out of place in my post.

**Post:**

Hello, Reddit users, please, help me. My friend sent me a text message saying the following:

*I feel very bad, I don't know what happened to me but I've never felt this way, so desperate. It hasn't been once or twice, the thought is recurring, day after day ideas come to my mind that shouldn't be and they overwhelm me, they consume my energy and leave me exhausted, I don't want to continue this way and I really don't know how much longer I can take it. I feel weak, broken and empty. I have lost my way, every day it becomes more blurry, will it always be like this?*

*If my life will be like this, then I don't want it anymore. I'm already tired, I can't take this, I don't have the strength. I want to run away, I want to leave all this behind, I can't find these feelings. I don't see myself capable, I don't visualize myself in the future. There is no future.*

*It's like being an old rag doll, sometimes someone takes it and plays with it after a long time, they have fun and enjoy it, but then it gets bored and abandons it again because it's not in good condition, its filling has come out, its seams have been damaged, its body is dirty and there's no point in having it if there are a thousand other dolls, that look radiant and beautiful, then she stays there, lying on the floor of an old cellar, because it would be cruel to throw her away after she has been yours for so long, so you just keep her like you keep all the useless junk you think will serve you one day, it's a cellar for a reason*

*I don't want to live, I don't have the strength to do it, it's cruel, I don't want to stay like this*

*Can't I just quit?*

*I don't want any more encouraging things, I don't want any more hope, I don't want anything that makes me hold on to the ephemeral life.*

I deal with thoughts like the ones she describes, I know how it is; I just want her to know that I support her, that I appreciate her a lot, that she is a valuable person, that I am by her side. I don't know what to do.

I offered to go visit her tomorrow, but she said she's busy. I thought about going anyway, at least to let her know that I care about her, but I know that she's coming out of the course she's in very late. I can't go at that hour, because it's dangerous. What can I do?

What would you say to her? I really have a lot of trouble communicating when I want ""the words to flow"". I'm blank.

She needs the right words, does anyone know what those words are?

Besides, I want to draw her a picture, but I don't know what I could draw. I thought about a rag doll, but how do I transform her self-destructive metaphor into something empowering? I know she's not a rag doll, she's a wonderful person, who has a lot to give to the world. How can I lend her my eyes so she can see herself as the amazing person she is, through a drawing?

She also said: I'm fine, sorry to worry you, I shouldn't have done it.

That's not true! You're not guilty of anything, you didn't do anything wrong. You are wrong, so you deserve help; there is nothing wrong with getting attention. How can I let her know this?

She said we could meet on Sunday, then. Any ideas on how to make her have a good time and feel cared for?

I don't know what else to say, I just want my friend to know that I'm here for her and to feel better.

If you help me, I'd be very grateful to you.",04Feb2020,1
5,"     Hello I have lurked on reddit for a month and I see this as a good place to tell my story. I am a 18 year old male and have been battling depression for years and last year was bad but this year is already looking the same I was born as a accident in the Deep Southern     U.S. to a mother who always believed in the church and my father who was a Constable. I was a sheltered child my mother didn’t allow me to experience a lot when I was younger and it was kind of a bad thing. Fast forward I was 8 years old when my dad died and this started it all. When I was 12 I raped by my older male cousin. And years after I lost more people in my life that really meant a lot to me as father figures. You think my two older half brothers would help me but, I was abandoned by my fathers side of the family. I was a social out cast in middle school and was bullied mentally. When I started high school I met a girl who I liked very much but she rejected me and I left it alone I tried texting her as friend my senior year but she just tried to get her boy friend to beat me up. This is messed up because he was also my cousin. I find it hard to trust people even though I have friends. 
     I have no father figure or mentors because either they are dead or no one wants anything to do with me. Growing up in the Deep South of the United States only way I see to have a mentor is to be good at sports and I’m not I was a band member. I have experienced racism being that I am black from white people and black , yes there are real black racists. I only like one thing in the dark place and that is helping people that is why I am a usher and do it two sundays every month. I walk around with a fake smile everyday and pretend I actually enjoy living. I graduated top 10 in my class and people who didn’t even attempt to graduate my age have far better lives then I do. Because of this box my mother put me in everyday feels like the movie ground hog day just sadder. I wonder why I get to live sometimes and every morning I wake up I get sadder. Music was also a thing I love and it doesn’t even help anymore. Attempted suicide once but stopped my self out of fear for what’s next. I love everyone in the world I meet I have no bad intentions to anyone that hurt but I just don’t want to exist anymore I feel alone even though I have friends I want be free.",04Feb2020,1

9,"I don't even feel sad, I've just noticed I genuinely don't feel any joy or satisfaction out of doing anything. I've tried mindfulness meditation to help with the restlessness but nothing has helped with the general apathetic feeling all the time.

I'm debating trying medication. There's a lot of stigma around it but I genuinely feel like I need help. I haven't been able to shake this apathetic feeling ever. I can't do the whole ""fake it til you make it"" thing.

10,"I think my friend might have killed herself. We met in the hospital about a year or so ago, and stayed close and supported one another, her phone has been off since Thursday which is strange for her. My mind immediately goes to thinking she is gone, I check the local obituaries every couple of hours. I do hope she is back in the hospital, but she usually calls me when she gets admitted. I have a whirlwind of emotions about this situation and I think it's the uncertainty of it that bothers me most.",04Feb2020,1
11,"I go to a good grad school, I think my work is so cool, my advisor is so great and supportive, I have a loving family, I have made amazing friends since starting here, I have started some fun hobbies, I have a loving boyfriend... but I still constantly feel like I don’t want to keep living anymore and I am frustrated that I can’t control this feeling. Does anyone else ever feel this way for no apparent reason?",04Feb2020,1
12,"Every once in awhile I’ll punch myself in the face when a very intense bout of depression sets in. Usually it’s when someone starts talking in depth about sex and relationships, and the magic surrounding it. It’s therapeutic and part of myself thinks I should be punished. I guess I can’t really express my emotions either because people will find it too dramatic and silly, as I have been told before. No one takes my emotions seriously. 

I’m too afraid to cut my wrists and the endorphin rush from the punches feels so good afterwards, but it hurts and my face swells up. I make sure not to hit my jaw. I feel like it’s the only way I can calm down. Everything feels so smooth after I’m done. 

I’ll only do this every so often though, it’s not consistent but I think I might start doing it again. 

Does anyone else self harm in this way? Have you found an outlet to stop self harming?",04Feb2020,1

No one taught me before and I loved it it was a little like being free from every one when I rode it then I went on the Williamsburg bridge in ny I didn’t have my glasses on and was distracted by the view and I noticed my bike getting too close to the railing on the side but instead of stopping I kept going faster and faster then my Handel bar got sticking in the railing throwing me a couple feet in the air doing a flip landing on my head tumbling on my arm and to me landing on my stomach I woke up I seen my bone sticking out of my arm my tooth lose and blood gushing from my mouth I couldn’t move and yelled for help and some other people riding there bike came and called my mom and sent me away the hospital said it was one of the worst breaks they have seen and I needed 3 surgeries one to put on medal rides in each bone to keep them straight another to remove them when my bone healed and another cause I was missing bone in my arm so they needed bone marrow out my hip and put in my arm to grow a new bone and put metal bolts and a whole bunch of stuff in my arm then when I was all healed I got into some trouble with a gang opposing the one my fiends were in “not me “ I had to transfer school and always carry a knife that’s when I would get crazy panic attacks every day for one month straight I didn’t go to a doctor instead I smoked more weed and started sippin lean but then I was chilling on my friends block chillin and I got my foot stuck in a whole while walking and ended up falling and heard a loud pop with a while bunch of pain my fitness had to carry me to my house and I went to the hospital the next morning and I found out I have a torn acl WTFF I was done with everything and got scared to be out side I always think something bad is going to happen so a year later no friends no social life  no education and no job I’m lost",04Feb2020,1
14,"Just another warning, I am referencing a form of self harm here, so if that’s triggering for you, you may not want to read. I’m just looking for a bit of advice. 

I have depression and anxiety (and a possibly bipolar disorder but that’s still up for debate), and I’ve been on antidepressants for more than a year now. My medication actually works fairly well, I’m able to function with becoming too overwhelmed, I’m able to handle my things better and enjoy life a bit more. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely better. 

I used to self harm —not cutting or anything, I would just punish myself by not eating or taking care of myself. I’ve grown more aware of that now, so I’m able to curb that behavior and work at it. I also used to scratch and pick at my skin (as both a self harming thing and as a comfort thing). 

I get these weird urges sometimes, in my head, like things are crawling around, and I get the urge to scratch that away. It’s frustrating because I can’t pinpoint the reason why my brain is like this, and I feel the urge to scratch and harm myself, as if it will get rid of it somehow. I’m not sure if it’s a form of anxiety, my brain reacting negatively to something or what. It’s confusing because for the most part my meds work, and I’m happier than I’ve been in a while. Does anyone else have this problem? You get random urges to self harm even if you’re fine?",04Feb2020,1
15,"I’m sorry if this is vague, but I can’t really put it in to words. I feel like an old tree being gnawed away slowly by insects. I hate everything and I’ve become highly irritable. 

I’m immensely awkward around people and it’s impossible for me to make friends in person, 

I’m not the same person I used to be, and I’ve managed to convince myself of some pretty erroneous things. At work today I was so frustrated with my coworkers, and my own awkwardness around them that I managed to convince myself that the entire universe is just my mental projection, and that my mind is in fact the only thing that exists. 

I get so lost in my daydreams that when I snap out of them I have to take a moment to convince myself of what’s real. And I imagine the weirdest things. Today I spent most of the day daydreaming that I was a deep sea creature like an angler fish or viper fish - quite obsessively really. The scenario was just so fascinating. I’d be awkward and eccentric but so would everyone else. And if you goof up then no one can see you do it down there in the dark, and everyone just sticks to themselves anyway.

I’ve gotten to where I hurt myself a lot when I’m distressed or angry with myself. I’ll beat my head really hard with my fists. I’ll scratch and claw at my own face. I’ll hit my leg with something hard. And I’m convinced that people think I’m insane when they notice my mannerisms. 

I have one foot in reality and the other somewhere out there in the ether. I’m just so unbearably sad some days. I want to feel normal but I can’t.

16,"Every day is just bleh. I have no purpose, no reason to live, so every day ends up feeling empty. I dissociate heavily all the time, so it feels like my life isn’t even mine anymore, in the passenger seat of my own body, as if my strange hands and floating disembodied voice don’t belong to me. I don’t recognize the stranger in the mirror. 

I want to cry with every ounce of my being, but I just can’t, no matter how hard I try. There is no release. Basic personal hygiene requires so much mental energy that it just ends up getting neglected entirely. How can I think about brushing my teeth when I don’t even want to get out of bed? Hell, when I don’t even want to wake up?

19,"Background: I am a migrant, depressed and with cripling endometriosis, so unable to work. I have been on my period and constant pain since the begining of december. I live with my male partner.

I am feeling really bad (suicidal) the last month because of everything that its happening to me. I dont seem to get any better from the endo, I am in constant pain and bleeding and I am so fatiged that folding the laundry makes me pant. I cant work and honestly I need to acept that I wasted my entire youth studing and doing free internships to become a crippled house wife.

Yesterday I went to try a yoga class, to try to improve my body and combat depression. I was feeling quite positive about my life, for the first time in a long time, despite the strong pain.

In the afternoon I was looking at the possibility of becoming a freelancer to be able to work from home. Its difficult because I am not yet fluent in the local language  so it isnt easy for me to read about rules and laws in Belgium (were I live).

I was in the computer talking with my partner about this, about maybe giving Spanish classes online or find some other online jobs that I could do. Also talking about the problems with being a freelancer and how I need to see if the small money that I would earn could compensate the taxes and changes in insurance, less pension, no unemployment etc.

He was playing a stupid zombie game and was obviously not interested in what I had to say. At the end I got hurt and stoped talking to him. I am just trying to find a job that allows me to live with him and helps me not kill myself after years of feeling a waste of space.

He got angry because ""I always want to talk about this things when he is busy"" (playing a videogame).  I told him that its because in the mornings he is away working and as soon as he gets home he wants to eat and watch TV. I am not allowed to talk then 'because he cant follow the series'. I told him that, he got angry and he isnt talking to me.

I am trying my best to not give up and kill myself and he still thinks that its more important his stupid series or videogames than helping me rebuild my life...  Why some men need to be so egocentric? Last week he was three days talking about a fucking package that got lost in the post and was late. Three fucking days.

But hey,me talking about my depression, sickness or uenployement is me ""anoying him when he is busy'.

I hate my life. I was very motivated yesterday despite all the pain and now I just want to take all my pills and die.

I try to follow the three day rule. If you are suicidal you need to wait for three days to do it. Usually after a day or so I am still depressed and I want to die but I am not willing to kill myself. 

But I am just so tired of everything. Of being disabled and sick, of the pain, the fatige, of being completely alone in this world, of my partner not caring... The only reason why I didnt kill myself yet is because I dont want him to become depressed. But when he acts like this he makes me think that I should do it and free myself from my missery.",04Feb2020,1

22,"Hey everyone,

Not sure if this is the spot I should be posting but here it goes. My girlfriend and I have been through a lot in the past year and a half. She has always struggled with depression, usually un medicated as well. She confided this to me along with suicidal thoughts she was having. I rushed into action, I was able to find her a therapist that also worked with a psychiatrist. We both agreed this tandem would probably be the best for her. After meeting with the psychiatrist we learn she is also suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. It explains so much of her behavior. So she been taking medication and seemingly doing well. However she texted me this morning about her feeling down and the usual depression stuff (sorry if I sound callused, I'm getting frustrated with the situation). I tried to be there for her but I'm always at a loss of what to say or do. Does anyone have any suggestions as for ways to support her? I can't leave work every time she is feeling bad to sit on the couch and watch TV with her. That's not the sort of life I care to live either. I'm struggling and looking for any advice that might be a better support for her",04Feb2020,1

I'm (23f) at the end of my wits here. I just don't know what to do, where to go. My partner is lovely, wonderful. They're always trying to be good enough for me I think, and... I just can't make my mind work correctly.  
I feel as if they don't love me, they no longer desire me sexually. I feel they don't want my company or my opinions, and every little time they have free, goes to someone else. 

All because we live together. I really feel that ever since we moved in together they take me for granted, they no longer appreciate me. And I just can't see myself breaking up with them... I just need an outlet to my frustration, I need someone to tell me I'm beautiful, I feel like I should go on tinder, get some side sex and validation and maybe that'll let me come home at night.. and not feel frustrated and sad and self loathing.  


I'm almost convinced they're cheating on me too anyway... I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm scratching the bottom of the barrel for solutions to these impulses. I feel like I'm about to kill myself every morning, every night...  I don't know what to do. I love them.",04Feb2020,1
24,"I always struggled to get along with myself. I see myself from an outsider point of view, and I got to the point where I can’t have a normal conversation because I bully myself constantly for anything I say. 
Last year I was able to use this criticism to improve myself, but this past few months have been hell. I just don’t feel like fighting anymore, I’m so tired. Now I just let my brain crush my heart with insults and I keep blaming myself for everything. I just want the people around me to be happy and I want to make them smile but every time I open my mouth and I say something I feel like I’m saying something wrong and that I just ruined everyone’s day. I never considered depression because I don’t like to analyse myself but a few weeks ago it hit me when I was outside with friends and I was unable to smile, I just wanted to disappear, to end it all. I felt so alone. 
I am self aware of everything I do but I feel like even though I see things clearly, I can’t change them. I didn’t really eat much the past days, I believe I’m punishing myself by eating less because I’m also struggling with weight loss... but I can’t stop myself. I’m too tired to do so. 
I don’t have the strength to fight, I just hope someone will notice and ask me what’s wrong. I don’t have anyone to talk to because I’m in a foreign country and I’m not close to anyone, also, I don’t want to ask anyone because I don’t want to bother them and I don’t want to be judged.

I have an appt with my doc to discuss my meds again in a couple of weeks but need relief now. Any ideas or recommendations on how to function until then?",04Feb2020,1
26,"I'm going to go do it,become a statistic. My life is miserable and I can't take it. I've had dreams of becoming a game developer,programmer,artist,and animator but these are all done. I wanted to become my role models,Like elon musk or Walt Disney,or heck an manga artist or Stan lee,but it's over. My life is over. I can't keep living on like this,no friends,a bad reputation for jerking off in the bleachers of my gym,I can't take it. I don't know why I do these things, I don't have good grades,I'm not like the other kids who're smart,funny,athletic I guess,and have friends that are the same thing. I'm not happy,everyone else is,I'm just a burden to everyone else that tries to help me. Cobra#2289 is my discord,send me some last comforting messages before my peaceful end.",04Feb2020,1
28,"So, just under a year ago I dropped out of college/sixth form because my depression and anxiety become literally unbearable. I was having panic attacks in the bathroom, skipping lessons because I was afraid everyone hated me and I was scared and a lot of the time was just too depressed to actually go into college itself. 

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-harm since 2014, when I was 12 (18 now). 

I spent four months in an inpatient mental health hospital after trying to take my own life and have tried several medications, and I'm currently on Citalopram. I struggle so much speaking to my CAMHS worker and I'm transitioning to Adult Services very soon anyway. I literally can't open up, I just sit there shaking, zoning out and I'm too afraid to write down my thoughts/feelings and give it to them because then it all seems too real and they will take it as gospel. 

I know I'm not helping myself by not being honest with them, but it's just so difficult. A lot of the time I just feel like I don't exist anymore, like I'm obviously alive etc but I'm on autopilot and feel so indiiferent and numb. I don't even self-harm anymore because I don't have the energy or care enough if that makes sense. 

Currently I'm NEET until I can start college in September. I don't think I could handle a job at the minute and there aren't any short courses or anything.

In September I'll be studying health and social care because I want to become a nurse. But in school I absolutely loved English Literature, and was studying it in my first college before I quit. My grades were goddamn awful in college honestly. 

I just can't help but want to go back to that specific teacher and try again, because he was a fab teacher and really cared for everyone in the class, even though it's not really a relevant subject to nursing which I want to study in uni. The college English teacher used to pull me aside and ask if everyone was okay cos I'd fall asleep in lessons and was visably miserable pretty much.

I hate myself for quitting and giving up, when if I'd have just been honest with the college about what I was going through and why my grades were so bad, then maybe it wouldn't have come to me quitting. 

I'm two years behind all my friends and they'll be off to uni before I know it. I know this is a silly thing to be bothered about because people go into education at so many ages and that's completely fine.

Recently I've been more bothered by it all, and I had a nightmare last night which included my college teacher telling me to start again (weird I know). Now I keep crying when I think about it all and I don't know what I should do.

I'd feel ashamed even applying back to that college, and studying English Lit again when I don't need it for nursing would put more stress on me, but the thought's there in the back of my mind. 

I've secured my place in another college which is more tailored to nursing and has a better programme for students, so I know this would be better for me and a fresh start would be good too. 

But I just can't forgive myself for quitting and being such a pathetic failure.

I'm so depressed and my anxiety is so bad still. So far, Citalopram hasn't been helpful because I guess I need to give it more time. I have nightmares literally every single night. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Logically I completely understand why I needed to leave college and everything, but deep down I hate myself for being so weak, even though I'd encourage anyone in my situation to put their mental health first before their grades. 

I hate myself so much.",04Feb2020,1
29,"I have a habit, a habit of getting into fights and getting problems thrown at me. On the outside, I act all tough, but on the inside, I'm crying and dying. Every day I feel like the walls are closing in. I can't breathe. My anxiety overtakes me and I'm forced to remember all the wrong I've done. I just wanna change, I wanna break the habit. I want to be remembered as a kind and caring person, not this fighter.

Someone please, help me break the habit",04Feb2020,1
30,"Hello.

My boyfriend is on antidepressants and hes been diagnosed with depression. For a while I didnt even know about it, but I asked the other day because I was worried. He hasn't been himself. Both his grandparents are in the hospital. His grandfather is dying, but his grandmother should be okay with time. His parents dont really unconditionally love him. He is gay and they dont really approve, but his grandparents didnt care. I think hes just afraid to lose the only people that have unconditionally loved him his entire life. I know I cant cure his depression, but I absolutely hate seeing him like this. Here is a quick exchange from the other day:

Me: How are you doing with everything going on?
Him: I'm alive.
Me: Good. I prefer you that way.
Him: I don't.
Me: Do not say that.
Him: Okay.

This scared me. I'm 500 miles away going to school right now, and I cant be there physically for him, but I want to help. I asked how I could help and he just said I can't. I know I'm not going to make him all better, but I want to help him and I dont know how.

Thanks guys.",04Feb2020,1
31,"I have a pretty ok life (caring husband, good kid, well paying job) and I have a hard time talking to others about my depression because they think I have nothing to be depressed about (I've had people, including a doctor, tell me this). But I spend most of my days feeling numb and detached, faking that I'm fine.

About 3 years ago, I nursed my husband through cancer treatment, and ever since I don't feel like I fit in my life anymore. It's like that experience made everything I am and do seem pointless. My job pays very well but it's stressful and I hate it. All my former interests and hobbies feel frivolous and empty. My daughter is amazing, but she's going to college this fall. I'm terrified for her to leave because I fear I don't have a personality anymore outside of being a mom, worker and wife.

I have casual friends, but no one I can talk to about this. A few times I've tried to mention it to my family but there's always someone else going through worse (they're sure to tell me about it). I've told my husband, but he doesn't know that I feel like this literally all the time and it feels wrong to burden him too much. And I can't justify spending $85/hr for therapy. I feel so alone.

Does anyone have some advice to share, or just encouragement?",04Feb2020,1
32,I don’t belong here. I’m stuck in this shitty school where everyone is a racist asshole and the teachers are scrambling to keep it together. And I just have to sit and watch. I wanted that perfect HS experience but my fucking “friends” threw me in the dirt. Everyday I feel more alone and isolated. I just want to lie down and cry at the end of each day. People tell me college will be better but I don’t know for sure anymore,04Feb2020,1
33,"So I've finally hit the point where I think I might need to get help professionally, in the form of seeing a psychiatrist or therapist or whatever. My issue is that I'm paranoid of having any sort of mental health diagnosis on my medical record. What are the pros and cons of this? The first thing I can think of is the fact that I own a decent amount of guns (I'm not suicidal, there's no reason it would be unsafe for me to own them) and I'm worried they may take them (please leave personal politics out of that issue). Other than that it's mainly just being scared of whatever, if anything, I'm diagnosed with following me around on my record. Any one offer any insight? I'm torn between wanting to get better and just leaving well enough alone.",04Feb2020,1
35,"I’m 25 and for the most part everything in my life is going ok. However, Ive been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been taking medicine/ going to therapy on and off for the past 7 years. I am pretty sure it’s genetic or something because I can’t point to a specific thing that is making me upset anymore. I’ve tried a couple of different antidepressants and therapy but I am desperate to find something or anything that helps. Does tms therapy work or is it a waste of money?

36,So for a while I’ve been happy and stuff. I’ve loved my job and I’m loving my life. Now I hate my job and I don’t like my life anymore.

37,"Backstory: 

I'm pretty certain that i suffer from depression since around 2016, but never went out of my way to get help. Naturally I ruined friendships, relationship and my university degree over the last years. I was able to fake living a happy and normal uni life for my parents until recently I turned 25. I live in Germany where u basically get financially fucked over the moment u turn 25 without a job/ still studying. So I had to ask my dad for money and eventually told him that I am about to kill myself and that I might suffer from depression. He took it way better than I thought and he helped me find a place in a nearby psychiatry.

Psychiatry: 

I've lived in this hospital for 4 weeks now. I'm taking antidepressants, participate in courses, wake up at 7 am every day, changed my diet and go for additional runs whenever I feel like dying. 

2nd week: 

I told the doctor that I don't feel any better and feel extremely tired as in I struggle to keep my eyes open, ""Sekundenschlaf"" (sleep that only lasts a second or two) and I feel like I'm going insane. Doctors' answer was that we will double my dose?! 

3rd week:

I struggled to take part in therapy session and staff here made me feel like I didn't belong here. I was even told that they got the impression I would decline therapy offers. Therapy offers = drawing by myself, a course to learn about depression and a morning walk group. I took part in all of them and only wanted to drop the morning walk group beause I hate slow walks and needed that one hour of extra sleep per day desperately.

Also doctor told me I have to wait for meds to work. 

4th week:

Still nothing. I feel like shit. I tell my doc about my doubts and that I still want to end it all. Her response: you are free to go if u want to leave.

Despite of me giving my best, suicide thoughts and overall numbness is getting worse every day.

Today: 

I thought about it for a long time but I came to the conclusion that I will leave tomorrow. I just can't believe that they'll just send me home knowing I might end myself. Sleep deprivation is killing me and I am left by myself with the feeling of being alone/ untreatable. Plus I still have no information about possible side effects of my meds. When I asked if I'm so tired because of the meds the answer was 'uh... maybe'. 

I know I'll sleep for 1-2 days when I arrive home and fall into a deep hole of depression and isolation. I'm actually scared to kill myself.

Why did I write this thread: 

I basically have no one left to tell. I made some friends here but they are here for a reason as well and I feel like I'd drag them down. Staff doesn't listen or tells me it's my fault. 
Also: how can I make sure to not fall into that hole I can see so clearly awaiting me?

Tl;dr: Hospital time made things worse, and I'm scared of going back home and harming myself.",04Feb2020,1
39,"So for whatever reason, i've been depressed all my life. Idk if its biological or just cause i had a really bad childhood but its been interfering with my whole life and i've been sick of it but it took my a long time to try and do anything. I want to break the cycle and actually make an attempt at having a happy life

Those of you that have gone through or are going through something similar, what did you do? Did you turn things around? Is that even possible",04Feb2020,1
40,"Whenever I’ve tried to eat more it never lasts and I end up undoing the progress that I made (even still the progress is relatively minuscule). I can’t gain weight, it takes way too much effort even though I feel like shit being underweight and skinny, with no confidence whatsoever. I can’t get out of this hole and honestly I wonder how my friends manage to stay at a healthy weight.",04Feb2020,1
41,"I'm long-term unemployed due to disabilities (autism and ADHD), this is the cause of my depression because it's meant I've no money to do anything, no friends or social life, no routine or way to feel constructive, and I also feel like I've wasted my life PLUS that at 36 I've missed out on having kids etc. so it makes me wonder what the point of life is as I just see the rest of my life as being no better than it is now. 

At the moment I'm going through a bad phase - I don't feel down, but I'm struggling to go to bed and to get out of bed. I think it's ultimately down to my ASD and ADHD but depression is likely making it worse - it's a problem with executive dysfunction and just lacking motivation. 

I'm literally doing nothing, going to bed anywhere between 4am-11am and then not waking up until around 5pm - once up its too late to do much so I'm just sitting on my phone or watching TV. I do have a volunteer job but I've not been to it since before Christmas... volunteering does help me a little, but right now I can't even think about booking time in work because I can't guarantee I'd be able to get myself up, let alone ready and in the right headspace to do the job.

I don't know how to improve things. 

I've no job, no friends or hobbies, there's little to do locally and at this time of year it's too cold even to just go for a little walk, I've no money to do anything like go for coffee and besides while my sleeping pattern is off I can't even go grocery shopping as it's too late by the time I get up. 

The only thing I've done for months is seen my boyfriend, we'll see each other maybe once a week, and literally I've done nothing else. 

How the hell do I get out of this inertia?",04Feb2020,1
