0,I feel like I need to cry but I can’t. Crying helps me release tension and helps me sleep but I can’t seem to cry. It’s been a couple of day’s that I feel like I’m sort of „out of tears“. How do I get myself to cry?,25Jul2020,1

2,"Come February, my SAD had hit an all time high, I hadn’t been able to find employment for over year, I’m living at my parents house to save up with my husband in our first year of marriage. And the COVID hits and I’m stuck inside. It was an all around shitty time as most of you I’m sure can relate. 

My psychiatrist and husband both told me I needed to get back into therapy to work out some issues that had reappeared. So I found a new therapist through my HMO ( this is important- she can see all of my health issues and medical records bc they’re all available to every doctor I see in my plan). The first appt went okay. I did see her check her Iwatch about 2 times which kind of made my feel uncomfortable- it’s my time im paying for after all. I chalked it up to her checking the time for my appt. Later on after I hadn’t made an appt in a few weeks due to offices being shutdown for COVID- she sent me a message letting me know she was available for phone calls and video visits if I needed to make an appt. So I did bc my mental state had gone from bad to worse not only bc of the pandemic but bc I was put on Wellbutrin and it made my symptoms go through the roof and caused me to feel suicidal. 

I made an emergency appt with her bc I was having an extremely hard time and told her everything I had been going through. Family issues mixed with medication issues that had caused me to self harm for the first time in almost 14 years. I thought we were finally starting to make a break through during the conversations and let my previous doubts about our patient/doctor relationship slide out of mind. 

About 2 months ago now, right around the time my psych had switched me to a completely different medication for about a week at that time, I missed an appointment with my therapist. It was a late night appt over the phone and it was the first week of my switching meds and I can honestly say I was having brain zaps. I was transitioning off Zoloft after a year. I didn’t even realize I missed the appointment until about 3 weeks later when I checked my HMO app and saw an email about it. And then the next email in my inbox shocked me. It was a discharge letter from the therapist ! It came the day after I had missed the appointment. 

I have been with this HMO for quite some time now. The only other therapist I have been discharged from was one that I didn’t make an appt with for 4 months bc we had gotten me to a good point. I understand that I missed an appointment but I’m honestly angered and confused as to why an educated therapy specialist would discharge a patient in the middle of personal crisis? I told her the appointment before that I had self harmed and was having passive suicidal thoughts and had been on the phone with a suicide hotline. And this is where the HMO part comes into play- she could obviously she that I had just gone off a new medication bc of increased anxiety and depression with passive suicidal thoughts (in the notes from my psych in my chart) and that i had just transitioned from a medication I had been on for over a year to something completely different, which can be a trying and difficult time in it’s own right and a fact she should most definitely know as a mental health professional. 

On top of it all, during an unprecedented pandemic that has left us all mentally rocked. I have let this sit in the back of my mind for 2 months now. Am I wrong to be upset? Am I wrong to feel so angry and neglected by her? Another important detail I want to throw out is that I worked in medical offices for awhile
I completely understand the importance of a doctor’s time and skills. I know there are other patients who could have used my appt time that I missed and I hate myself for doing that and will not use the circumstances of my mental health at the time as an excuse. However, 2 weeks before this happened, I had cleared out my afternoon and taken off an hour early for an appointment she had scheduled with me only for her to message me and hour before and say she accidentally double booked and would have to reschedule. My time is important too and how did she know that that appointment she cancelled on me could have been very important  for me. 

I’m now at the point where I’d like to email her and ask her why and how she thinks that’s an acceptable practice? I have even thought about reporting her over this bc it honestly angers me so much. I feel like it was completely unprofessional, rude, and almost petty. Petty bc she discharged me the day after I missed an appointment and the letter said “you are being discharged bc you have no future appointments set.” Like ... what ?

9,"My boyfriend has Dysthymia and is undergoing medication for a couple of years. Last night we were talking bout random things and I just remembered that I haven't told him about my illness called CSFL (Cerebrospinal fluid leak) that happened 2 years ago. I'm fully healed but my legs (waist down) are feeling the same pain I had before which doesn't bother me that much so I blatantly said ""What if I can't walk anymore? What if I get meningitis?"" (if CSFL is not treated with urgency, it can impair you or get meningitis) and laughed. He went silent and messaged me that he wants to break up with me. Telling me that it's not a laughing matter, that he can't take care of another person when he can't even take care of himself.

What should I do? It's my first time to be with a person who is battling their inner demons on a daily basis. Should I continue messaging him? I love him so much and I'm willing to give up everything I have for him. He said that when he met me, I gave him another reason to live and to continue his battle. I'm worried about him and I feel really bad for what I did. Please help me.

10,"I work from 7 am to 3 pm, with a 30 minute commute, so I have to get up at 5:45 am every day. And I have to take my girlfriend to and from work most days, and she works until 11 pm. I only need to make this work for a bit over a month more, but I dread each day. I am someone that really needs 7-8 hours at least to function properly, and every night I end up getting 5-6. So when I get home around 3:30, I have no motivation to do anything but sleep or watch TV. Is this what adult life is? I have more money now than I ever have before, but it feels useless. Every day is such a struggle. My job is mind-numbingly boring, and I get rude customers multiple times a day, and I feel pressure from my boss. I well up with tears on my morning commute, as well as each night before bed, and even if I have the energy to do things, it is plagued by the thought of going back to hell the next day. I'm so scared that this is just normal life. I hate it. I hate it so much. I've gotten rid of all my vices; I don't drink, I don't smoke weed, I don't juul. But I really really want to. I'm not going to, I know it would make things worse, but I crave an escape from my existence.

Tomorrow will be my girlfriend and I's 1.5 year anniversary. We were going to do something special, but we both know I'll be too tired when I get home to do anything more than have a home cooked meal. It'll be nice, but I'll be thinking about work.

14,"god i have a lot to rant about.

im (f20) dealing with so much trauma right now and i'm trying not to let it get to me so i've been trying to literally just shut my emotions down and be completely apathetic instead. i've suffered a lot of genuinely severe mental/emotional ab\*se from my father (havent spoken to my mother since i was 14) and my depression has gotten so much worse this past year (i've had depression for 9 years and it's been mostly subtle for the past 4 but now it's like...horrific again). last month i got kicked out by my father and for 3 weeks i was living on my cousin's couch up until about a week ago. now i'm suffering nightmares about my father every time i try to sleep and i have panic attacks if my dad so much as changes his tone with me and i'm constantly depressed and feeling so fucking awful.

i'm faking for everyone because i've tried opening up to people and tried utilizing the people who i love and who love me, but i've recently been told that it's causing a lot more issues for a friend than i realized because sometimes other people are dealing with things too and they can't help me and it just drains them. i do want to say that i totally respect that and i've always made sure i'm never throwing too much on just one person at a time. that's why i've never really opened up to people until recently, and i only started doing it because keeping it bottled up wasn't good in the past and i know my therapist has been telling me to open up more to my friends. it just sucks because now i have it in my head that i'm not allowed to reach out to anyone ever because it's just me hurting them in some way.

i also live an hour drive away from all of my friends and i can only see all of them maybe twice a month due to covid. it's breaking me because i love my friends with my whole heart and soul. they are the reason i am who i am. they are the reason i'm here. but they live so far away and i need them and i can't be around them. and it sucks so much more because my boyfriend sees his entire friend group literally every single day because he lives in the same like 10 block radius as all of them and it makes me so envious and so depressed because it reminds me i'm just alone and i don't have anyone near me. i feel like i start to resent him whenever he hangs out with his friends because i am so envious of him that it makes me resent him and that makes me hate myself more because i love my boyfriend and i hate making him seeing his friends as something bad.

i've been either drinking or smoking weed every night since march (aka, quarantine) to try and fix some of the issues and it helps me but it is so unhealthy and i am still severely depressed. i have a therapist who i love and i'm on medication that has made things insanely better than they were before. i'm just so alone still. i can't see my friends. i'm living with my abuser. i have to see my boyfriend always be around his friends.

i just don't know what i have to look forward to. things are breaking my heart every day. and i was hospitalized in october for su\*cidal ideation and everyone told me to look forward to the future and have hope. then everything got worse. and i can't trust it anymore. i can't trust anything. i don't believe things get better.

i'm just so bad right now and i'm so sad and so horribly depressed. i need to rant. i need someone to hear me. i don't know who to tell. i don't know anything anymore. i'm just...so awful now. and i don't know how i can believe in anything ever getting better when i have felt this way since i was 11 years old.

15,"I've been depressed for quite a while now (diagnosed almost 8 years ago but it manifested way back but my parents didn't know much about depression and mental illnesses). Not only that, I am suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks. 
My girlfriend whom I wanted to marry (she wanted it too) at some point of time, she left me two weeks ago, all of a sudden. There was no day that we wouldn't talk about something, and I loved her with all my heart. I still do but I respect her decision. I'm so heartbroken and with each day I feel like I'm spiralling  down this dark, endless hole. I cannot sleep properly anymore. I dream of her only to wake up with a panic attack and feeling very distressed and upset. I usually go to bed around 11pm or midnight  and then I keep waking up from around 4am onwards with these panic episodes. 
She was the only real friend I got and now shes gone for good, she was my first love and I'm still in love with her. I'm all alone, I am 26, I worked a couple of jobs but couldn't stick with any for longer than few months because of my problems. I literally have nothing left. I am exercising (running and walking at least 15km per day). I tried reading books but I cannot focus whatsoever, I tried contacting some of my old friends but they moved on with their lives and have no time for me and my whining. None of it helps. Broader family members are avoiding me, while my family sees me as a lazy and unmotivated time waster, even though they tried to understand but they simply cannot comprehend the scale of it. I live in a small town and social activities aren't that common, even if they were I know my anxiety would kick in. I tried numerous therapies and medications and nothing worked. Medications only made me feel numb and tired all the time, and that's not the way to live. I feel like there is an elephant sitting on my chest. I feel like I have no options left whatsoever. This is not what life should look like, it's like living in hell.",25Jul2020,1
16,"I'm very sorry if I'm in the wrong place. I want to share my small in picture, but HUGE to me success story, and maybe it could help anyone of you guys. 

TL;DR It's good to put yourself out there and the time will come that you will see something. Not big at first, but something to keep you going.

I come from a background where anything creatively different was shot down. My parents were stereotypes. Would listen to country type music and condemned rap, rock, anything you could think of that wasn't ""easy listening"" which is not bad and I don't hate any of the music I heard, but damn.

Many memories of my dad, who I looked up to the most because he had the ""musical gene"" that I ended up getting, shooting real low with my talent. One of the most prominent memory that I'm scarred with is us being at the dinner table and somehow got to me producing and him telling me dead face ""your music sucks. You won't go anywhere because you're not like these top people"" meaning like pop music artists and shit.

There were many things that I've tried recently, such as making YouTube videos, but nothing stuck to me or if felt like a brick wall hit me just before I do it and it's painful. So much emotionally it almost gets physical (not bad my brain just hurting) and it seems like the only thing I can do from start to finish is make music. 

So one day while unemployed because of Covid and really bad anxiety, if I could've ever felt a bulb flash from an idea it was that from another childhood memory I have.
I was in a shop that my stepmom worked at and one of the customers was talking to me about myself. We ended up on the question ""what do you wanna be when you grow up?"" I didn't know so she asked what I liked. I told her I liked playing video games. My stepmom interrupted her before she could finish her sentence, but she asked ""well, why don't you work on video games?"" I never really got that until this past month.

So I posted myself once a while ago, had some really positive responses but mainly were ""on this day hopefully I'll have something"" and the first one didn't come through. I'm still waiting on the second person that asked.

I get real anxious asking posts for the same job, it feels spammy but it's not if it's every couple weeks, which has been longer than that since this last time I posted once more. 

One day I get a message asking for a commission and I accept. He gives me half before and half after and he started on a second job for me. I wouldn't call it a breakthrough, but I know I can't go back now. 

I'm so proud of myself for what I've accomplished. I've managed to do my toes in the waters of a new life that I've been reaching for for years. I hope someday I land a job big enough to sustain myself and live comfortably.

17,"It feels like I can't be happy for long without thinking of things that make me incredibly upset, depressed, or even angry. It hurts a lot and I'm tired of having no agency over any of my feelings just because a bad memory or thought could throw me into a angry haze at anytime. I want to see a therapist but I'm really intimidated by the process of finding the right person to talk to. I have barely any way to cope with these random bursts of awful feelings.

18,"so a bit ago a guy who hurt me a lot texted me apologizing for what he did. this person lied to me, cheated, ignored me, played with my emotions, made me feel worthless and body shamed me a lot. I got to a point where I would wake up with migraines bc of how much stress and pain he caused me. I was fucking depressed. And I felt so ugly inside and out bc he made me feel that way. I woke up every morning feeling like crying. I had to block him on all social media and also his phone number bc he always came back even tho I ignored him and tried to stay away from him. Anyways I started to heal, it took me a lot of time but i found things that kept me super busy and I started forgetting about him. I accepted what happened and promised myself it would never happen again, and that I would never do what he did to me to any person I date in the future.

Anyways it’s been like a year since I stopped talking to him and he texted me from another number to apologize. The thing is he did this so many times and I never felt any sincerity from his apologies. It was always something like I’m sorry I acted that way I’m stupid and never think things thru. Or I have the brain of a 12 years old and I was a bad person. Dumb shit like that... and he never addressed the things that he actually did. 

So in summary, this triggered again my depression and my migraines. Like my brain literally hurts so bad and I wanna cry all the time. I told him that it was okay that I forgive him and I do forgive him but I don’t wanna make conversation with him, I don’t want him in my life, I don’t wanna know anything about him. And he sent me a picture of a gift I gave him and idk what that’s even supposed to mean. But I just told him to go on with his life and that I had forgiven him and that he find peace and growth and to take care.

How do you build a resume that way? I feel like there's no real way for my depression to not show up in my face during an interview. I don't know if I'd be able to handle the hours without getting extremely depleted. I only work limited hours at home as it is and I barely have the willpower to push through.

20,"Doing a little writing during quarantine. Maybe you can help round out this concept I have for describing how feeling stuck and incapable of making a decision to move forward is related to this obligation you relentlessly feel to save someone close to you from their own depression because nothing in life is worth enjoying anymore if they can't enjoy it too. This is just my perspective of what this person's depression is also doing to me.

What comes first, the ghost or the last beat of a heart?

You're like a ghost from my past. Thinking of ways to bring you back to me has engulfed everything. It's all I think about. The way your lifeless presence haunts me leaves me drowning in memories gasping for breaths of fresh air that I can only seem to find when I think of the person that I know you still are but that I feel like I've lost. I wanna play our old games, but would you catch a ball if I threw it your way? Most thoughts end up eating me alive and are like sharks ripping me apart. Wondering if you will show up or answer a phone call has gradually become like a locked door that I just don't have the energy to keep trying to find a key to. Maybe it's at the bottom of this ocean I find myself descending into surrounded by those sharks waiting to consume what's left of the fight I have in me to keep us both above the water. Will I find you here or are you in some other ocean? You must be here somewhere, I can feel you breathing and you're staring straight at me and your hair is the same length it was three summers ago when we were hiking up mountains instead of down here where it seems like I've almost forgotten how to walk because I've been fighting the waves for so long. I know I told you that you can't let things get to you but I didn't know that you didn't have any ground to stand on to even get away from them. Lay on me if you have too to rest, I'm right here.

23,"for context [???] I have ptsd, mdp, anxiety, and autism. And all of them together makes life an insane struggle at all times. And stuff just keeps piling up and piling up and I feel like I'm slowly losing it. 😬

A couple months ago my friend died. Shortly after[recently] my best friend went from love bombing me to... just... hating me and everything that has to do with me; they turned other people in my life against me and had me kicked out of a group of mine. 
Surrounding this, work life has been horrible for over a year,  but it keeps getting worse somehow. My physical health is suffering, so in turn,  I'm always in pain at work. I work retail,  and being both autistic and traumatized in an environment where I'm surrounded by strangers who treat me like crap is emotionally and physically painful for me, and I'm coming to the point where I'm slowly losing my ability to just bite the bullet and keep working through it. 
I'm so paranoid. I'm typically in a state of unbridled animalistic fear of the world at all times unless I'm under the influence,  and that affects every aspect of my life heavily,  especially my social, romantic, and work life. 
Lately it feels like 90 percent of what I hear from people is always ""here's how you fucked up"" or ""here's how you're a piece of shit"" in one way or another. That energy is slowing down a tad, now that I'm away from friends I just cut ties with, but it's taking a toll. 
I'm ugly. Seriously, genuinely ugly-- I can't even be that ""ahaha I'm cute but I'm gonna tell everyone I'm ugly because I'm innocently self conscious!!🌈✨🧚‍♀️"" sorta guy anymore, because this has moved past that territory and into the realm of, wow I'm actually ugly as hell!
I avoid looking at myself at all costs. I see my reflection so rarely that when I do see myself, it's like taking a look at someone other than myself. 

The idea of going back to work seriously,  deeply makes me sick to my stomach with anxiety and depression and I still have no clue if I'm just being a ""snowflake"" or if my emotional turmoil towards it is serious and actually needs attention. When I'm there lately,  everything is so fast to push me so far into the deep dark corners of my brain until I start acting out,  blowing up,  and having awful, borderline or sometimes completely violent thoughts about myself or the world. 
My therapist, along with numerous people in my life, think I should quit my job.  And I really want to. I just can't deal with all of it anymore. I need time away for a bit; but there's so many what ifs when it comes to being unemployed in the US, especially since I live in the boonies and job opportunities don't exist here whatsoever. 

I'm nobody special to anyone, other than my girlfriend. And I know my girlfriend counts for something, of course--i love her more than anything-- but I wish my support system consisted of more.  I have nowhere to turn. I'm nobody's best friend. I'm not someone people want to check in on,  or seek out personally. Every time I get close to someone, they break my heart, and I keep thinking it's all me but no matter what I do to ""fix"" what other people find wrong with me over the years,  nothing is good enough. I haven't just been good enough for anyone platonically in so long. I feel as if people go out of their way for me only if they want in my pants. Sometimes I feel like that's all I'm good for. 

I've been in recovery from ptsd for a few years now and I feel like out of nowhere I've taken 50 steps back and regressed into a state similar to the one I was in before I started seeking professional help-- which is a dangerous state to be in. 
I'm so lonely all the time but I'm too scared, angry, guilty, and paranoid at all times to ever actively reach out to people more than once a week. I recognize that I actively sabotage myself at all times, and the crap thing is that even though I recognize that,  I can't stop it.  My body is on shut down while my brain goes on a complete bender.

I'm tired of being scared and I just wish for once I could feel okay for a while.

There's nowhere I'm really going with this. Feel free to take this down, or move it if need be; I wasn't too sure which flair to use.  It's 5am and I haven't slept because I'm too sick with anxiety to make any progress on sleeping,  so i really just needed a place to dump a fraction of my shit into the void. ✌",25Jul2020,1

27,"I am not trying to diagnose myself or get a diagnosis off this sub. I just want to understand different symptoms of depression. A bit of a backstory, my mother has bipolar disorder and due to her bipolar disorder, I’ve been living with my dad since 13 years old, I’m 25F years old now. But, it has always felt like I wasn’t normal. 

Ever since elementary school, I remember always being by myself and not having friends, my old childhood best friend came up and talk to me. We were friends ever since until she humiliated and joked about me. I’ve always seen life as that no one likes me or if they try that they’ll end up leaving later. So, I tend to isolate myself from anyone. 

At one point growing up, I was a very happy person and loved life. It has changed ever since I’ve been bullied, laughed at and taunted through grade school and even now by people whether it’s people I’ve never met before, coworkers family members or “friends” that I have overheard mainly made rude comments about my appearance or how much of a failure or lazy I am and how crazy I look or act like.

Hearing and caring about what others are thinking about me have caused me to quit jobs or what I set my mind on has made me feel like I’ll never achieve or accomplish anything in life. 


I have had suicidal idealizations during high school and thought people were “lucky or brave” by committing suicide. Now I have been trying to get back on track with my life. I’m an online university student and hope to leave my home state and move to a different state.  I have notice that I have developed more of a “fuck everything, I hate it here. No one truly understands me even if they wanted to” or “I feel trapped in the life I’m in and won’t make it out” mentality.

28,"I am not trying to diagnose myself or get a diagnosis off this sub. I just want to understand different symptoms of depression. A bit of a backstory, my mother has bipolar disorder and due to her bipolar disorder, I’ve been living with my dad since 13 years old, I’m 25F years old now. I thought I could have bipolar disorder like my mother. But I don’t know, I just have always felt like I wasn’t normal. 

Ever since elementary school, I remember always being by myself and not having friends, my old childhood best friend came up and talk to me. We were friends ever since until she humiliated and joked about me. I’ve always seen life as that no one likes me or if they try that they’ll end up leaving later. So, I tend to isolate myself from anyone. 

At one point growing up, I was a very happy person and loved life. It has changed ever since I’ve been bullied, laughed at and taunted through grade school and even now by people whether it’s people I’ve never met before, coworkers family members or “friends” that I have overheard mainly made rude comments about my appearance or how much of a failure or lazy I am and how crazy I look or act like. It has caused me to truly despise other people, myself and my overall view of life and the world.

My dad has called me a carbon copy of my mother and says I have mental problems when my moods tend to change on my time of the month.

33,"Hey. I’ve been having a real hard time lately. I’ve always been like this. I know I need to go to a doctor. But it’s just so hard for me to talk to someone about how I’ve been feeling. 
I’ve always thought about death. And how everyone would feel after, and I’d get so sad. And very anxious. I always feel like everybody hates me and I think about every negative thing in my life. And it feels like everything’s been catching up to me. 
This morning I actually thought about dying. And it really scared me because I’ve never thought about it so intensely before. 
By no means do I want to die!! I just feel like I’d just be better off. But I know that’s not the truth. I just get so anxious thinking that nobody wants me.
And the situation with my boyfriend isn’t helping either. He’s in a really rough spot as well, yet while I’m anxious and sad, he’s angry. And it’s hard because I want to help so bad. 
Any comments or advice would help greatly.  And a way for me to get help would be great. (It’s not like I haven’t tried, it’s so hard, everytime I do research I feel like I’m taking away from others) Thank you!",25Jul2020,1
34," I'm sorry that this is a bit long, but I could really use some help with this one.

Full disclaimer: my parents are NOT abusive in any way, shape, or form. They've been total champions for me and my siblings all our lives, and want only the best for us. Not once have they ever been neglectful, narcissistic, or spiteful. They are NOT the enemy here.

For years, I've been struggling with problems like depression, food addiction, and trouble with social interaction, partially due to Asperger Syndrome. My parents, therapists, doctors, and countless other professionals have given me the advice and tools I need to make changes, but I just never feel like doing it. It's gotten to the point where I'm completely dependent on my parents emotionally and financially.

This week, my parents have finally put their foot down. Since I'm not willing to make the changes I need to get better, they're going to force me to make changes. I'm currently visiting over the weekend, and they've made me be more physically active, like going on walks and bike rides, despite me being obese and terrified of bugs. We've also entertained the idea of me moving back in with my parents, and they made it clear that they aren't going to enable the self-destructive behavior I do in my apartment. They're going to have me go outside more, eat healthier, and participate in more family activities, even if it's not my first choice.

The problem is NOT that my folks are trying to help me. My parents are not the bad guys. It's that every time these sort of pushes happen, I always want to mentally run away, whether through sleeping, being on the internet, or playing video games. Now that my parents are really pushing me, part of me wants to tune out reality for good. I know I don't have the gall to end my life; I've tried multiple times, and always back out because I'm too scared. I just feel like there's really nothing left to enjoy about real life anymore. No goals I look forward to reaching; no fun events or plans to get excited about (most of them were cancelled from the pandemic.) Whatever I DO enjoy I end up overdoing, like sugar and video games. Much of life is still very restricted due to the pandemic, and all my friends are either too busy or too far away to ever hang out with anymore. It's like I'm in a video game, and I've exhausted all the actions and dialogue. Now, I just wish I could live in some sort of fantasy land forever, which is a big reason why I sleep so much. Dreams are more pleasant than reality.

What should I do? Are my concerns legitimate, or do I just need to get over myself?

TL;DR: I'm stuck in bad habits, and my parents are going to force me to make changes while I'm visiting, and eventually, live with them. Instead of thinking these changes will help me, part of me just wants to tune out reality forever.",25Jul2020,1

37,"Hello, we live in the Philippines and my friend told me he told me this 

 ""Hi, sorry I don't check my messages lately. I don't think I am in the capacity to talk to more people. I've been too occupied in my own thoughts. I'm having ""episodes"" because of thoughts like, what will happen to Philippines in two years? The fucked up governing of poeple amidst this pandemic doesn't sit well with me, at all, and it's causing my mental health to deteriorate. If you're not bothered about the current events in our country then shame on you. People are dying left and right and all these tyrants still wish to pursue their ideals only for their own welfare. People are protesting while following regulations and yet they're dying because of the police only serving the higher-ups when they should serve for the public. 

I want to help him about this, what should I do? 

I do not support the administration,
but i do not support his ideals either.
 
I want to tell him, he shouldn't burden himself too much with this kind of thinking but I think that would be wrong",25Jul2020,1

39,"I sound really high-pitched often and my voice wobbles a lot too. Often times I don’t know what to say or am too hesitant to speak or show any real emotion. I look really awkward when smiling, it makes me physically uncomfortable and it feels like I’m forcing it. Yes, I know I’m over-analysing myself and it’s bad to do that and I know that people don’t care or notice as much as I think they do... but I still get really self-conscious about how I look and present myself. And due to my depression, I struggle with basic personal hygiene too. I have showers when I absolutely need them, but certainly not every day or two like most because often I just stay in bed and that’s all I feel like doing.

But anyways my voice varies a lot because sometimes my voice sounds fine. Maybe it’s just that I forget to breathe in before speaking. Is that something people always do consciously?

In general I just don’t feel like I fit in. I’m so skinny and all my friends are all so much more grown out than me, we’re the exact same age. I fucking hate my life, it makes me want to cry. 

Gaining weight is difficult for me... people say “just eat more” but if only they knew the true reason why it’s so difficult, it’s just hard to explain.. it’s anxiety related, let’s just say that. I’d eat food if I had access to it. Ideally I’d be eating once every 2 hours or so.",25Jul2020,1

I have fun with my girlfriend but my hobbies all seem uninteresting and boring now and I'm afraid that I'm at a stage where this neutral feeling is making me unhappy, and very frustrated. I don't feel like doing anything and the best thing I can do is lay in bed and try new things for 5 minutes before deciding they are just as trash as old hobbies, and I can't find any source taking my interest or making me happy. I'm starting to think life isn't made for me. I don't know what to do, and if this is starting depression or just an extended dip in my mood. Please share advice/experiences if you can.

48,"I lost my sister in 2017 2 days before my birthday. She had a genetic lung disease and several other things she was dealing with, so it made for a difficult childhood, not bad just difficult. I was homeless living with various friends and relatives for about 8 months with my fam in 2016. Over that time I grew overweight due to having to eat fast food pretty much every meal because it was cheap, and due to me leaning on food as a sort of coping mechanism. I went to a counselor who helped me work through a lot of my issues. I decided to be a concept artist for a game company so that I had something I was working towards. After about a year of that and being accepted to a college, I lost all drive and motivation for art. I was also still overweight. Also the idea of student debt loomed over me. For about 3 years I have been doing TaeKwonDo and today was my black belt test. I did well on my forms and did well in practice sparring but couldn’t break both boards in a row. I did break boards but just not on the same attempt. I blame this on myself but also on COVID-19, 3 months ago when I was originally going to take my test, I felt extremely confident. But overtime I grew rusty, which led to such an embarrassing moment. I don’t know that I will be getting my black belt, this is a massive blow. It was incredibly embarrassing as well because for some reason everyone in the room was watching even though they hadn’t been for the first 2 people. I’ve been very excited to have a black belt and to be able to say that I accomplished getting it, but now I’m not so sure. I feel like I’m drifting with no goal in sight. I believe God has good things for me, but right now I’m just really really depressed. My plan is to get a job and work for a year to reassess my situation and find something I like to do. Honestly, the only thing keeping me going is because I know that I need to be here for my future wife, and my family. If I were to give up on life, which to an extent sounds pretty good right now, I would be abandoning the one I’m supposed to be with, the one I have been praying for. I know it sounds incredibly cheesy but to me it’s serious. I’m still overweight, which bugs me everyday. The simple solution, “work out, eat healthier.”, but I just have no motivation to do so. That’s why I’m planning on getting a job that requires manual labor, that way I don’t have an excuse. I don’t know, I’m just not in a good place right now. Really....I didn’t even want to post this. But I figure that I better do something about my emotions rather than just bottle them up. I guess this is more of a release of pent up emotions rather than an actual cry for help.",25Jul2020,1
