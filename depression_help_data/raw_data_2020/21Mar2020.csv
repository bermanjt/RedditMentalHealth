0,Having no friends to talk to is starting to put me in a depressive blackhole where I'm stuck in my house all day just contemplating life.I have no one to talk to when I get back from school or in school.I always have dissociation and anxiety.I've been trying to solve my issues but I think I'm just gonna give up trying to get better I sometimes feel like I'm never going to have friends again and I'm about to graduate high school in a year.I'm fighting this alone and I'm just going to accept that it's always gonna be like this but I would never kms.,21Mar2020,1
1,"One of my acquaintances seemed completely void and lost all happiness all of a sudden from one moment to the next. 100% a different person was in shape then all of a sudden started losing weight and becoming detached/isolated from everything. Ghosted everyone, and changed his smile and character- just everything. All of sudden he reappears a couple of months later as a complete ahole. I suspect some sort of trauma happened?",21Mar2020,1
2,"I want to start off by saying I haven’t been officially diagnosed but I’m pretty sure I have some sort of mental illness because I haven’t felt any consistency in my life for years. The first couple years was tolerable and I was able to graduate high school with A’s but I think moving into a dorm and being on campus with close to no friends really did it. 

I’ve essentially failed my first semester (2.4 gpa) and am currently in my second one with grades ranging from A’s to F’s. I can’t get myself out of bed to go to class, I can’t focus on anything, I would stare at a blank screen for hours, I would sleep 12+ hours one week and 4 hours the next, I cry randomly, I have a constant longing to detach from my friends and isolate myself completely. 
Assuming there is something wrong with my mental health, I know this second semester, especially with quarantine and online classes, will be hell for me. I doubt I will be able to even raise my gpa, I will probably lower it. I want to withdraw and try to seek help so I can regain some control over my life. However, my parents are extremely strict about school and grades so I’m not sure how to even approach this with them. My parents are fine with me seeking therapy and such, but they will most likely laugh in my face and call me a lazy disappointment if I brought up withdrawing from school. 
Can you give me any advice?",21Mar2020,1
3,"I live in the UK and I am being quarantined  my college closed down earlier this week and were having to do all out work at home with bo supplies or programs basically making it impossible.

So all my extra work I did was for nothing and I may as well burn my sketchbook instead of continuing to work on it.

Also I'm stuck inside with my mum she is emotionally abusive and all around a horrible person and my collahe may not open till next term so I have 6 months with her",21Mar2020,1

10,"I’ve been depressed for about a decade 
Of course never clinically diagnosed 
But I’ve have more suicidal attempts than I can count so that’s something right? 


Maybe this is selfish..not it is selfish but I’m happy about Covid-19. I finally get to die if it gets me. 

If I get it I’ll be the happiest person. Of course I’ll stay away from everyone. I’ll quarantine myself but I won’t get no $30,000 of medical bills cuz I’ll be happy and dead finally",21Mar2020,1
11,"I have been having a hell of a time trying to get a therapist after I moved to a new city, the wait lists are months long and now that this pandemic is going on I know it will be next to impossible to try a few different people to see who I would want to work with. Are there any certified online therapists sites that anyone has had a positive experience from? My mental health has been on the decline over the last few months and I really do need to speak with a professional as soon as possible, thanks!",21Mar2020,1
12,"Those Instagram filters have made it easy for us to hide our emotions. And we practice it more than often, mostly just to hide our imperfections and please others around us. However, hiding your emotions is not a good option and those filters are doing an exceptionally sloppy job.

Our feelings pile up and sooner or later we get stuck in a weird situation, a situation that makes our heart beat faster than Husain Bolt, we sweat for no reason and sometimes it even becomes hard to breathe.

This weird situation is called anxiety, our body’s natural response to stress and other uncomfortable situations but it is not just this. Anxiety is a physical state that has mental side effects (this is what people failed to understand) and as a result, 90% of people don’t know how to deal with anxiety.

1. Anxiety is a physical, biological problem. Treat it as such and don’t worry about the psychological effects.
2. Re-read point one. And then do that again.
3. You are not taking any stimulants from now on.
4. Pay attention to what you eat.
5. Exercise. Daily, until you’re tired.
6. Make good-sleep your utmost priority.
7. Learn the breathing techniques, meditation is one way to go.
8. And this one is not added in the main points but see the doc if you still haven’t found

I've found this article [7 Things you need to know and understand to avoid anxiety](https://www.wanderingpen.com/anxiety-symptoms/), that taught me these tricks. I found them useful, the article also explained the topic of anxiety in a different way. Some new lessons to learn, I never knew about the physical aspect of anxiety, until reading this one. You can also give it a read, which might help you to overcome your anxiety faster.",21Mar2020,1
14,"I know that my brother(16) is struggling right now and I want to help him more than anything. I love him so much and it absolutely breaks my heart to know that he is hurting. The thing is.. I am not supposed to know how he feels. He’s generally a private person and doesn’t really share his emotions, but I was in his room to get some shampoo (currently visiting home from university) and I saw his open journal. I admit it was extremely shitty of me to look at it but what I saw was...concerning. He’s clearly depressed. I looked at one more page before stopping myself but he referred to death as being his “preferred physical state” and just mentions being sad, lonely, and unhappy with himself so so much. 

I am ashamed that I violated his privacy like that but I can’t just ignore what I saw. My brother is amazing - he’s a goofy, kind, brilliant kid. He works very hard in school (has never gotten less than an A in his life) and is super nerdy. He unfortunately doesn’t have very many friends since he was always the nerdy kid. He was super excited to go to a science camp with a bunch of nerdy kids like him this summer but that’s been cancelled because of coronavirus so he’s devastated about that. I’m worried since right now he’s staying home (school has been cancelled) and is getting no social contact except from family and has just had something he was looking forward to get cancelled. That, along with the concerning things and the suspicion I’ve had for a while that he’s depressed, really concerns me, but I have no idea how to approach this. I would greatly appreciate any advice, more than anything I just want to help my little brother stop hurting.",21Mar2020,1
15,"I don’t know if this seems weird. I’ve got so much stress right now. My body hurts, nose keeps running, I feel my depression rising in my chest, but I keep feeling this wall build up higher and stronger as it grows.

I keep trying to get myself to at least cry but I haven’t been able to for a few years now. The most I can get myself to do is heavy breathing and a chin quiver but then my body pushes it back so I don’t. 

My brain keeps telling the rest of me to just stay strong but I need to make it understand I need the release. 

Does anyone know how to force yourself to cry or break down?",21Mar2020,1
16,"I don't like myself recently. So uncharacteristically resentful and jealous. I don't think I know myself right now and I feel like my circumstances have been sly quicksand - just sinking deeper down, getting locked into somewhere that doesn't feel like home. 

I feel like I haven't been living my own life for a long time. I'm so angry at my circumstances.. At myself... I feel like if I don't type this out and put this somewhere I'm literally never going tell a soul that I need help. People know I need help but...fuck it's lonely...i live in a different city than most of the people I love. I feel so disconnected from everyone I know. 

It's funny, being around people is such a big coping strategy for me but social distancing is really important in this time so I will have to hold out.

I can't think as well. I'm very irritable. My poor partner...i feel really bad that I can't be cheerful and helpful. If I were alone I would be in truly terrible condition. 

I can't make art...i want to make art but I can't bring myself to do it most of the time.

I feel like I've rambled a lot. I don't really know what I want from this. Maybe acknowledgement? I didn't get to talk to my family for Nowrooz. Maybe a 'happy new year'? One person wished me Happy New Year today. That made me really happy",21Mar2020,1
17," 

I am obsessing over so much things even though the virus does not directly affect my lifestyle.

I have always been an isolator at home beside going to the mall every few weeks alone or going to the pub/club once-twice a year and getting close with someone or getting a bro hug from some dude.

It is destroying me mentally and psychically that people would no longer help in a time of crisis or give me a hug, it feels like all of these things are restricted. Even though i rarely get a hug or pat on the back from a stranger i meet when out, i am obsessing over something that has never impacted me.

I am creating scenarios in my head where i picture myself being stranded on a road or somewhere and i start to think ''Would a person still come to my aid and hug me? would a person still hug me tightly if i broke down and cried, would a person still rush to help me if i was on the floor dying'', despite these new restrictions. and i have just been obsessing over this.

It now feels that all contact is prohibited, even if it means helping someone you see who needs help. my mind has latched onto this ''social distancing'' concept and is driving me insane. I have also felt like my mental health does not matter, and that nothing matters because everyone cares about COVID now and nothing else.

Would people still hug or would people still do basic human things? many times during this pandemic i have started experiencing homicidal thoughts and suicidal thoughts, and how i would go about committing suicide. I haven't taken my valium in months but last night i had 4, and it's sorts of helped me soothe. It feels like i will be in this nightmare forever and society will never recover. I need help, warmth, and love, please don't leave me ):",21Mar2020,1
18,"I feel unmotivated to do anything right now. I can only look for ways to pass time that just don’t even give satisfaction to me. I can’t even bring myself to practice my cello and I feel like I’m the worst version of myself I could possibly be right now. I don’t look good, I’m uncharismatic, I’m unfunny, and I can’t add to a conversation to make it even the slightest bit interesting. I just feel like I bring everybody’s mood to the ground. I also feel like I am the worst person at my passion, the cello, even though I know I’m average. Since I can’t bring myself to practice because of my lack of motivation to do anything, I feel like I have no purpose anymore than to just lie around all day and get nothing done. No help from COVID-19, since I’m trapped in my own house, catching cabin fever. This mass panic have canceled all my orchestra shows and trips that my family didn’t even get to experience and I feel as if the world hates me, like I would change nothing if I’m gone. Of course I don’t want to die, but I just know in the back of my mind that the world will keep spinning if I’m gone. I just wanted to rant because I don’t plan to seek any help from anybody, because I feel like I can push through out of this sort of depression on my own terms and since I’m religious, I can’t bring myself to suicide either. This rant is kinda helping me push through, just expressing my thoughts and feeling, so if you read this, congratulations for reading this far and thanks for taking time out of your day to read my rant.",21Mar2020,1
19,I realized now that we just live in this dystopia that never allows the being happy if you don't meet the standard they keep pressuring you until you die for the stress or by killing youself or you become one of them continuing this everyone just acts like this while i'm slowly suffering silently while keeping a happy face but inside i'm empthy while i'm getting colder and even more edgy...,21Mar2020,1
21,"Don’t know if I’m the only one who feels this way, and that I noticed that it’s not really talked about. I feel like the people closest to me are projecting this pressure on me to just recover from depression faster as if my illness was some joke I made up and expect me to get better in the span of a few months. I have many things to work through so that’s definitely not gonna happen. They tell me that I’m ‘using my mental illness as some excuse for not doing things’ and just being a difficult person to deal with. If I wasn’t so dead inside I would feel sad but I’m beyond feeling sad now. I find it annoying that some people pressure mentally ill people into getting better faster so that they don’t have to deal with the symptoms rather than encouraging them to recover at their own pace. Anyone else feel this?",21Mar2020,1
22,"So I was talking with a friend and the topic of what we're interested in and what we want to do in the future was brought up, and I realized that I really don't know what to do with my life. I've been going to the gym, taking watercolor classes, and before the COVID-19 situation, was trying my best at school, but for what? In the end I don't know what I actually want to do with my life, my mind is just an incoherent mess. I feel jealous of him, he's two years younger than me and knows so much about lots of topics, while I just barely grasp the surface of a lot of them; I'm almost 18 and I still feel like a kid who can't even keep herself standing for too long. I've done so much to try to feel happy, fullfil my life, to learn more, but in the end I feel like a fool, a pathetic fool. Sometimes I  don't even feel like not even trying anymore, because it leads me nowhere, I can't progress as much as I fucking want. I'm just feeling really down rn, I was planning to do so much today, but now I don't wanna even move, I feel so useless.",21Mar2020,1
25,"I feel like my depression is affecting my relationship. I feel like my bf doesn’t understand my depression and just thinks that I’m sad and that I can help my mind set. I get it. It makes no sense to those who don’t have it, I don’t even know why I’m depressed, I’m just unhappy all the time and have to act happy a lot. But I don’t want my bf to stop talking to me because I would probably be over it if my girlfriend was always negative and depressed. I guess I just don’t know what to do. How do you all who have depression cope with your depression while not letting it impact your relationship? I am also aware that my bf cannot fix my depression and don’t expect that at all.",21Mar2020,1

30,"My partner and I both suffer from depression. I recently have gone through a long bought of depression that Ive just started to feel a biiit better from. My depressive, intrusive thoughts are less frequent (like I no longer consistently cry over pretend scenarios while driving in the car) however every once in a while I’ll have a week or so where it hits me again. This has been my week, and has also been my boyfriend’s. For me a lot of it was brought on by a feeling of helplessness with everything going on in the world right now and a disappointment with how some of those around me (especially my family) are behaving inconsiderately. Thats just what put me in a funk, but it’s also paired with me feeling worthless to everyone and lately Ive found myself feeling jealous of whenever my boyfriend helps out a friend or family member with anything (which he does a lot) while I feel like I have to beg for any help. 

I was having an awful last couple of days and wanted to do nothing but spend some quality time with him. However, for days he has been coming home from work and just sitting on his phone for hours, won’t talk to me, those nights he will rarely even make eye contact with me (thats what really gets me) and I know this is a sign that he is going through an episode. He helped a friend put up a fence on one of these days and came home and sat on his phone. This really put me in the dumps, as I have had multiple, small home improvement things I have brought up to him not for a week, or month, but a year. It’s just simple stuff like mounting things on the wall or using his truck to take some large items to the dump, I would do it myself if I didn’t leave large holes in the wall every time I tried to use a drill. I try not to nag but when stuff hurts me it eventually leads to me crying and him asking what’s wrong. I don’t try to be accusatory, so when I had calmed down I told him exactly what I had just typed, “Ive just been kind of feeling worthless lately and when I ask for favors and they’re ignored but a friend does and you jump at it, it kind of makes me feel jealous. I know you care about me, and the feelings of not mattering to you are in my head, but that’s how I feel.”

He is considerate about it and I love that. He canceled plans with his family the other night so we could stay home, cuddle up, watch a movie together and stuff, but his depression has gotten worse. He’s cut himself a couple of times since I talked to him. Now I feel guilty for making him feel guilty by even bringing it up. I just needed to rant a little and ask, how do you deal with feelings of guilt as the spouse of someone with depression, especially as someone who goes through it yourself?",21Mar2020,1
31,"there’s this person in my life that i just need. i like being around them so much. i could be with them all day everyday.

but they don’t love me. i know that they don’t feel the same way and it’s tearing me apart from the inside out. it hurts so much. more than any words of any language could describe. even if this person did feel the same way, it wouldn’t work because i would never say anything about it. i keep my mouth shut and i don’t show any kind of affection towards anyone because of my overwhelmingly heavy trust issues. 

i can’t sleep at night because of this person. i think about them every day. i love talking to them and i love the way they smile and i love the sound of their voice. i like them so much it hurts. 

i did this to someone else. i didn’t mean to. we’ve been friends since first grade and they love me.  i don’t feel the same way and i feel like such an asshole for putting someone else through the pain i’m going through.",21Mar2020,1
