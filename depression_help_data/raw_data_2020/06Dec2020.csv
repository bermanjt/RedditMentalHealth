0,"I'm not sure if I'm actually depressed or it's just some kind of phase that I'm going through.  
This year has been hard. I had some ups &amp; downs. But mostly downs. Two-person that I knew personally from childhood, died. My kittens died. (I slowly got over those incidents). Someone I secretly love who used to be a close friend of mine is not interested in me at all anymore. I'm somewhat an introvert. So, I don't have many friends. I consider 1 or 2 people like my close ones. I had contact with them over texts, as a result, I didn't have to feel much lonely. But I lost contact with them for months now. I thought maybe they're going some hard shit or just busy. So, I tried texting asking what's going on. But I didn't get a reply 2 to 3 times consecutively. As a result, I thought if someone doesn't want to talk then why should I bother and be the annoying one.  
The best thing this whole year was a get-together with some friends including the girl whom I like. We had fun and I was happy for a while. I thought maybe everything will return to normal now. Our friendship will be alive again. But then when I texted her, I didn't get any reply. So, it's clear that she's not at all interested to talk.   
As of now, I don't text anybody anymore. I don't wanna be clingy.

  
In reality, I'm feeling down, empty and lonely, and somewhat hopeless. I have no idea if I'm feeling sad; if I want to cry. It's just emptiness and numbness. Most of the day I feel no energy. I don't do the things I like (Gaming, art, etc.) My procrastination increased by a lot. I spend almost all day on youtube. Smoking habit returned after 5-6 months of managing not to smoke. Then I managed to not smoke for 2 weeks only to relapse again. Now, I don't even have the motivation to quit. (I don't smoke a lot now, like 1 in one or two days). I stay up the whole night. Sleep a lot. Having nightmares from time to time. When I wake up I check my phone in the mere hope that someone texted me. A new day isn't exciting to me anymore. It's something like ah, another (boring) day. I have no suicidal thoughts currently like I'm not even interested in doing a thing. I'm not having much trouble eating.   
Recently I joined online chat groups to distract myself from loneliness. And I saw myself overreacting and being sensitive to people being mean to me. I turned angry and toxic easily. Which is very unlikely of me. I generally tend to stay peaceful and kind to others. I usually avoid fights. Anyway, after a while of losing my shit, I feel sorry for my action.  
Some people suggested to me that I make new friends online. Which I tried to do. But there's something about that, I can't manage to stay connected to them. I start to procrastinate to reply and lose interest eventually. IRL it takes time for me to make friends.   


  
One thing that I guess I learned is people don't want to deal with a troubled soul. They like the better version of him. The confident, cheerful, and happy one. If you're troubled, you're most likely to be isolated, by yourself.  


TL;DR this year wasn't easy for me. I lost connection with friends. I feel lonely, empty, and numb and can't manage to keep my shit together. I don't know if I'm depressed.",06Dec2020,1
1,"I'm a melancholic person by nature, but usually am able to live day to day and do my things. Had a rough spot earlier in the year, since then especially my work has suffered, and I've embarrassed myself with poor performances / failure to complete tasks to a good / acceptable standard in both my professional and private lives.

Depression does not absolve one of all responsibilities, so I must take responsibility for my failings, some of which, those more due to laziness than poor mental health, ought be within my capabilities to change more easily. The problem is, I don't know which are which. Tips appreciated.",06Dec2020,1

3,"Hi I’m 17 and I had been dealing with depression for 10 years of my life. At first I thought I could get better, feel better in no time but days turns to months and months turn to years. Now I’m slowly failing and falling. Every day is a losing battle for me. I know people say to hold on and I am but I’m slowly slipping on the rope, slowly losing my energy. I don’t know how much longer I could hold on. If there is this so called “ light” at the end then that light is getting dimmer and dimmer........... I’m getting tired and if I hold on a bit more then i would lose and fall this time. I’m running out of energy and now I don’t know how much longer I could hold.....",06Dec2020,1

I do get to go into the office every once and a while since there is a physical aspect to my job.. which helps a lot...  but when I'm at home for weeks at a time I get really depressed. I've been trying to exercise during my lunch break every day.. been working on things around the house.. but it's the lack of human contact which is really getting to me.

6,"Hello,

I'm a 37 m who recently ended a 5 year toxic relationship.   I have been struggling the last few days even though I'm confident that I am making the right decision, but my heart is having trouble letting go.

This is more so for me, but I hope it reaches one of you currently struggling.  

Some things to remember when you're feeling this way:

You deserve respect.  If your significant other puts their needs and desires before yours consistently, you deserve better.

Make a list of pros and cons.  You would be surprised at how much this will help you determine if the juice is worth the squeeze.

They should enrich your life.  In my situation, my ex took and took from me until there was nothing left.  I can't describe the elation I would have felt if she had even made the tiniest gesture of kindness to me when I needed a little boost.  The balance of give and take is such an important factor in a healthy relationship and unfortunately some people are just selfish.

Abuse, mental or physical, is an absolute no go.  My ex flirted with both of these on multiple occasions.  A lot of you might think, ""no shit I wouldn't put up with that.""  I agree, but being in that situation and talking about it are two completely different things.  She broke me down and there were multiple times that I felt worthless.  On a level,  I felt like I deserved it.  I didn't deserve it and it took me way too long to recognize it as an issue and stand up for myself.

If you feel like you are trapped in a situation, don't give up.  Family, friends, coworker and shelters will help you in your time of need.  Don't be afraid or too proud to ask for help if you need it.  

You're a good person and you deserve to be happy.  Don't let codependency rule your life.  If anyone here is struggling with any of this and needs to talk it out, feel free to reach out to me.  This is a condensed list of just a few things I have been trying to work on.  If anyone has anything to add, please do.  I'm trying to add some more tools to my belt to give myself the strength the persevere. 

Thanks and be good to yourself!",06Dec2020,1
7,"For the past 6 months and maybe even beyond, I’ve realized how hollow and boring my life is, I’ve never taken anytime to hang out with others mostly and have purely focused on school, working, etc. so I could “provide for my future self” never taking the time to enjoy the moment, thus pushing everyone away. 

I’m still in high school and nearing the end of it, my parents are split, whenever I’m at my fathers when end up doing stuff together, but at my mothers we are constant apart and never really talk, and I just sit in my room in our basement away from everyone with almost no light haha, where my days are go to school, move through boring classes, get home, workout slightly, then sit in a dark room, I’m so tired and bored of it. 

My town is decently (big?) 24k population so not a whole lot to do, but there is something, but with COVID as well it just seems like finding stuff to do is tough.

I have some online friends to talk to, but you can only go so far, I wish we could do things other then talk over the internet, but what can you do. I have one singular friend that I know in person, but they almost never talk to me outside of classes and refuse to hang out. It seems like everyone at least has one friend to hangout with, but I have no one. My sister is constantly gone every single day hanging it with friends and it just makes me feel so alone.

I’ve tried for months to make more friends online and even people in my area, I’ve met up with so many others, but nothing has worked, it’s just drained the energy out of me. I’ve tried to take up new projects like learning to code, cooking, etc. but nothing is making me feel better. I’ve started working out three times a week, joining clubs, but nothing is working. Biggest of all is that I don’t have any motivation.



I guess what I am asking for is advice, has anyone been In a similar situation? How did you get it out of it? I appreciate any and all help, thank you all",06Dec2020,1

I can understand a few people being jerks and shunning ugly people but when it's everyone you've ever met I think that's when we ought to be questioning whether or not society has a problem.

9,"so i play sports and musical instruments, which i enjoy, but i still find it so hard to make myself practice on my own due to lack of motivation. for example, i will have my piano lesson and then won’t practice all week, which means i so badly at the next lesson, etc. plus my piano teacher is really strict, so that just makes it worse. and my favorite sport is basketball, but i rarely have the motivation to practice on my own, which means i so badly compared to my teammates in games. how can i change/what can i do? i wanna be able to practice and get better at my hobbies, but i just... can’t 😔

12,"My husband (27M) and I (24F) have been together for 4 years, married for almost 2. Over the last 3 years, my husband started developing more signs of depression, with the biggest ""symptoms"" being excessive play of videogames (this one I'm fine with, we're both gamers), extreme lack of intimacy (we've gone up to a month without sex, which is extremely difficult as I have an exfremely active sex drive), and impulse buying (the most notable one being about a year ago when he purchased another woman's nudes [a LOT of them] because he followed her on Instagram and wanted to ""support"" her page since there was a sale). I would say about a year ago is when the trust issues started since I found those nude sets he bought, right after I had send him many of my own while we were temporarily in different states for a few weeks.  It upset me because I try so hard to be enough for him, and all I want is to make him happy. I noticed my biggest sign of depression is having week long bouts of losing complete interest on anything I enjoyed. I'm a creative and love drawing, writing, crochet, making spreadsheets, doing my makeup, etc. But when I'm not doing good none of that interests me and I end up sitting alone with these horrible intrusive thoughts that I know are overkill, but I have nothing better to do than to listen. Now whenever he's in his negative state, it triggers mine, and if I try to do what I think will help me, like seek out affirmation that I'm enough or just crave physical touch, its the opposite of what he needs so it can never balance out. I find myself sacrificing my needs and comfort for him more than I feel he does for me, so every time I feel like I'm losing more of myself to become what he needs.  How can I learn to balance our needs to benefit us both? He refuses to try therapy, as he said he's tried it before and it doesn't ""work"" for him, but I'm considering more and more convincing him to try couples therapy.  I'm at such a loss for what to do, and since I lost my job dues to vivid I don't have the money to pay for therapy rn.

13,"First, let me be clear in that I’m not writing a sob story but rather I litterally feel what the title says. 

Backstory: I’m a 21 year old male, in college for my 4th year now, from 1-17 I was the good son/what my parents always wanted. I go off to college, shit hits the fan, socially, academically, mentally. Back in school now, graduating whenever tf that is, though I like my new major more than my last so theres that. But TLDR, Life was fine and I was happy up until right after High School graduation, since then I haven’t been able to be happy without weed, and even then it isn’t really happiness rather Im just not sad and enjoying a buzz.

I just miss being a teenager, where did it all go?? All the time I had, I didn’t have to worry about what my full time job will be, when I’m gonna raise a family, insurance, car, and rent payments and what ever else is coming.... i am a depressed, anxious, post-traumatically stressed (all diagnosed) mess that is behind on college, never had a girlfriend, have already suffered through a drug addiction, and a year ago I nearly failed out of college. Any girl I ever had in that way wound up hating me, one falsely spread a rumor that I raped her. Women alone make want to throw in the towel. My PTSD diagnosis actually came from that one girl.

It’s all the things I never saw happening to myself. I never thought I would fail so many courses, become a

why is it that a few years ago my life was great and I wanted it no other way, to now suicide is a regular passive thought, not that I am suicidal, I hope i never die, but I just think about what if I did it, would it put me out of my misery of knowing I can never return to those days when I was happy? Its when I put it that way to myself that it ever seems slightly appealing but my family and friends are whats keeping me alive.

I have felt this way for a while now. As if a different version of myself was left behind in those past years and I can never go back to it. I feel like what I know of about the world around me contributed to it. I used to have hope in the world but now I know it for the dark dystopian society it really is, so having the happy go lucky attitude of “nothing is wrong and will ever go wrong” is nit something I can see myself returning to as I know better now, I just wish it didnt make me depressed too

15,"Hi,

Throughout my life, I have only really had two goals: 1. live a happy (and fulfilling) life and 2. help others. Unfortunately, because of depression, I have run into lots of issues with this because I am often very emotionally dulled and apathetic or sad/etc. When this happens so much, I cannot seem to rely on “I’ll be happier later” for motivation.

Instead, I get extremely cynical and think that there is no point to doing anything. I have lost interest in almost all of my hobbies (at times, all of them) and find little interest in much aside from talking to friends and one or two creative/fun things. Even then, I tend to feel like nothing is truly meaningful in my life anymore, even if it makes me temporarily happy, it seems to have no real importance or substance. It’s not fulfilling.

If anyone has advice for how to deal with this, that would be very much appreciated. I think that a good course of action for me would be to find something else that gives meaning to me — such as how some desire to excel in a particular skill or gain power or explore the world. If I could find some reason that is NOT directly related to happiness to have meaning in my life, I think that would be very helpful. It is also worth noting that I am an atheist (well, agnostic with heavy atheistic tendencies, especially when in a depressive mood) with no spiritual beliefs, so nothing in that category could provide meaning to me.

How can I find meaning in something that isn’t directly related to my happiness or that of others? Ideally, something I could act on in quarantine and at home. If I should add more detail to my issues, let me know and I can edit this.

Thank you so much for any advice. ❤️",06Dec2020,1
16,"I’m 23, non-binary, for anyone needing context to reply or comment. 

This is a long one. I retyped it a handful of times. I have trouble being concise. 

Firstly, I am safe; I am not suicidal, I overcame that need about two years ago. 

I am a total mess though. I don’t have anyone to talk to, and I can’t afford a therapist. I stopped taking my medications last year, which was kinda terrifying but, I couldn’t afford them.

My routine keeps me alive, but that’s about it. I don’t have words to describe the anxiety I feel about leaving my house and interacting with the world (especially this year), or the inescapable thought that I’m repulsive in everything I do, from my appearance to my thoughts to the version of me that exists in perception. I know it’s not rational, but that doesn’t stop me from feeling it with every ounce of my being. Please note I am vastly understating the severity of my issues. I tend to get incoherent if I try to add emotional description. 

I freeze up when I talk to my friends because it feels inappropriate to open up about irrational feelings and spread negativity. Ive been told I’m disturbing when I open up. 

Unfortunately, my family doesn’t accept me for who I am, so I don’t try to reach out to them anymore. 

I need help. How can I feel normal? How do I stop my anxiety without medication? How can I talk with my mom without feeling like she hates me even though I know for a fact that she doesn’t? It’s not logical, and I keep unraveling at that fact. I believe with all my heart I’m doing everything wrong and that everyone hates me, but I know that’s not the case. 

It just goes back and fourth, and it never stops. Every time I try to make sense of it, I come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter, and I don’t matter, and existence is meaningless. 

I have a cat though. She’s perfect. I love her, and I make sure she’s well-fed. She purrs when she’s happy and let’s me know when she wants to be alone. 

But I’m not living for my own good. I have no ambition, and I can’t remember what it’s like to feel any drive at all. I need to take the love for my cat and apply it to everything, I guess, but I’m addicted to my anxieties. It’s like I need to feel that fight or flight to get out of my depression but then I spiral until I can’t rationalize anything and I’m back at hating myself. Everything I do to try and get a little dopamine - cooking, playing my guitar, writing... they don’t have meaning anymore. I’m utterly empty, save for the constant incoherent pile of unrelated thoughts that somehow spell the end of the world every night till I pass out from exhaustion just so I can sleep in till my cat wakes me up to feed her and I get to start the whole process over again because it’s been March for the past 10 months and 

I was just, so close, to being okay, back in February 

Then, fasting for 3 days at a time became financially beneficial

Context: I've suspected I am suffering from depression for a couple months now, and I currently am deciding whether I should get diagnosed for depression. I am currently on school counselling (sucks lmao) and have to follow up with a psychiatrist every few months to check up on me.

Now here is the thing: if I do go and get a proper diagnosis, I likely will have to be placed on even more counselling (which i absolutely hate) and my mom would def force me to do stuff which makes me feel absolutely miserable (I've tried telling her I hate it and it she calls me all sorts of stuff for not liking it)

Because of all of this bs I'm really hesitant to get a proper diagnosis, especially after how I've frequently lied about being mentally stable (which I am not sadly)

23,"A few years ago I was severely depressed. I was suicidal, a lot of my friends abandoned me. It was a shocker for a lot of people since I was always Mr. Positive. I am always reminded of a photo I saw on Reddit which had a number of smiling celebrities, such as Robin Williams, and it said ""this is what depression looks like"". One friend, who also abandoned me during this, told me my honesty and openness about being depressed helped him realize he never beat his depression. My best friend came through for me, really helped me through it, I got into therapy, and I got better, ended up in a relationship with a girl who I loved.

About two months back I started feeling down again, and I realized I was depressed again. Things started going badly. My work started looking bleak and it's essentially come to a halt. I'm in a foreign country and I have been for months because someone needs to look after my family during COVID. I started falling sick, and 40+ days later the doctors still have no idea what is wrong, but I'm on a lot of meds and oxygen and I'm going for more tests this week, but I tested negative for COVID...4 times this month. I had to travel to try and get some work going two days after I feel sick and for three weeks I was bed ridden in another country with no friends or family. The girl I mentioned above and I tried to stay friends after we broke up earlier this year and after always being there for her, when I told her I was sick she vanished, when I told I was depressed she vanished, and when I tried to talk to her about why she just abandoned me we got into a massive fight and aren't speaking now, I told her I needed space (I've posted the whole story in a different forum). I've gotten into arguments with a lot of family members. We had a COVID scare in the house. I even tried buying myself something rare and expensive to cheer myself up, and it broke in half. The list goes on and on, just today my gran who can barely move's nurse maid quit because she doesn't believe in COVID and refused to wear a mask, and my gran fell on the bathroom floor and hurt herself.

None of this is helping me recover. Things just keep seeming bleaker and bleaker and I've started having thoughts again about things are meaningless. I'm just sick for over a month now, lying in bed, watching shows and browsing reddit to pass the time because I'm too medicate and weak to do anything.

Therapy isn't easy to come by in this country. And with a massive wave of COVID hitting even the doctors said stop coming to the hospital, they're trying to treat me at home.

So I don't know what to do to fight the depression off this time. Things are really, really bad. And I tried and tried to be positive but everyday I wake up short of breath, vomiting, unable to digest anything, and something has happened in the house that just makes things worse. I haven't heard any good news in my personal life in weeks. I miss my friends, I miss my home. I miss my ex. I miss even getting up and working out in the mornings.

25,"Hello everyone.

So the quick question is: 
I am not diagnosed, but I know what I feel, and I feel depressed and anxious all the time. Some more complicated feelings too, but I am not comfortable saying what I feel since I'm an not a professional nor was I diagnosed by one.
I am in a situation where it's impossible for me to leave my house, get money, or invite anyone over. Not do any phone calls or smg like that.
I do not have anyone supportive around me. I am an adult.
Please how do I cope? How do I go on? If there is no way please tell me so I can try to swallow that truth.

Long version/explanation:
I am a 21 year old adult. I am living with my family, they are taking care of me as long as I am still studying in uni.
I don't really remember what was even first, but I do know that low self esteem was one of the first problems I faced. Then came those moments of dullness and sadness. Those days where I just wanted for the day to go by and I just wanted to go back to bed. I remember I watched a crazy amount of TV as a kid. I don't even know what I was watching and I honestly didn't like any shows. I think I just used it to distract myself until the night came.
Then next thing I ""tried"" to kill myself at 9. It was honestly a shitty attempt and nothing even happened to me except I cried alot.
Well, this kinda is how my life went by year by year. I got a bit worse every year, tried to kill myself, had a tiny moment of ""this isn't really good"" and repeat. Some years I tried multiple times, some years I fell into some kind of self-harm to cope. 

Through these years, I always seeked help from my parents. Never once would they even accept the fact something like depression even exists. Maybe I should now mention that it's not completely unjustified, they are both immigrants from war countries. They have seen people fight for their bare lives, I assume me saying I want to kill myself for no reason seems ridiculous to them. Nevertheless, there is nothing more I can do anymore. I have been asking them for help for 12 years straight. It always ended up with them yelling at me, telling me things that hurt me so much I don't want to even try again. But I still tried and they hurt me back. Even laughing at my face once because I said I feel suicidal.

Please, help me. Some advice of what I could do by myself in my situation. What can I even do? How can I help myself? How can I cope with this? 

Please don't tell me to move out, this is still my family and if I move out as an unwed person, I will as sure be disowned. I have sibling I cannot lose and my parents still are my parents. I love them, but I also need help which they won't allow me.",06Dec2020,1
26,"I recently watched Back To The Future 1. The movie is amazing, but it brought with it the feeling of how much better the '50s were compared to nowadays. I just can't stop imagining seeing myself in a small town with those old-style shops and neons on the corner of streets, those classic cars, people on the streets wearing those old-style clothes everyone knowing everyone, like a big family. I keep thinking of how amazing were those moments when people weren't digging after money, but after how his partner is feeling about the other and how he acts generally. A perfect life, in my imagination. 

Part of me feels very sad that I will never have the chance to live that life, to not run after money, but after experiences with those close to you. 

Now, don't get me wrong, some might think this is stupid and not a serious situation, that I'm joking. I'm just writing what I feel right now. I can blame part of this to the fact that I'm not really interacting with anyone, as I'm living alone in an abroad country, not knowing the language and not really having who to talk to, as I'm a University student.

If someone has some suggestions for my problem, please comment. I really don't know what to do..Writing this made me feel even worse.",06Dec2020,1
27,"When I was growing up talking to people was easy, sometimes you didn't even have to say anything. But since I've moved away from my old elementary school making friends has been very hard. The few friends I did have since were girls, I don't know it has always been easier for me to understand and get along with them than men. But regardless, being so lonely for the last like decade has been really hard and scary, about the time my depression started (13-ish) was when people started disappearing from my life and I haven't had a proper friend since.

I don't really know what the point of this was, maybe just to vent, I would never ask anyone to waste their time trying to be my friend, so I guess what I'm asking is how do I get over my shyness towards people and make friends? I'm not in college right now, I don't go out much, now that I'm thinking about it it kinda sounds impossible but any advice is appreciated.",06Dec2020,1
28,"Hi, 

I saw a post recently (I can’t remember where) about a therapist who told his client to run the dishwasher twice, because the process of rinsing all of the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher was too much to handle. 

There was then a line describing how the therapist said that there are no rules to things like that and you should just do what you need to do to look after yourself/ get things done. 

On that thought, does anyone have any ‘depression life hacks’ of their own? I’ve been in a depressive episode for a while and I’m struggling to look after myself. I can’t stand to cook because I don’t want to clean the kitchen first (a family member always leaves it a mess). And I also don’t want to cook because I don’t want to clean up after. I’m saying ‘don’t want’ - it’s more like I can’t do those things. 

One thing I’ve realised is that pot noodles are very helpful because you don’t have to ‘cook’ and also you can eat it in its container so there’s no washing up other than a fork. 

I’m just looking for as many of these life hacks as possible as a way of getting through. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.",06Dec2020,1
29,"15M. depressed, sh twice. I know if i keep cutting, it will end up in an awful cycle. and yes, i crave the relief that cuts give, but im aware that is very bad for my health. i just feel like i should put myself in that cycle. I should make my health worse. and i want to get better yes, but i feel as if the need i have to get worse is just overpowering. Idk why i feel such a need. maybe because its the only part of myself that i actually deserve or cuz i have nothing to be depressed about and maybe this will validate it, but it might also just make me more guilty. I felt good for maybe two days. the first two in a while. I had  forgot how it felt, and it is honestly frightening to live a life iwthout this part of me. i feel like its necessary to make myself in a worse state. is this normal? what do i do?",06Dec2020,1

I'm 26 and have been through a lot of depressive episodes, i have not been diagnosed and do not take medication. This advise comes from experience of going through my big sad weeks/months which i generally crawl out in my own time.

This is not end all be all advise, however adapting can help by finding new solutions to problems you face.

This isn't exactly an offer to advise PtP or through PM, however this is some advise for adapting when depression hits hard.
Find alternatives to things you ""don't have the energy for"" or make you anxious.
Ex:
- not enough energy to shower? Use some wet wipes or do a sponge bath
- don't feel like interacting or hanging out? Inform them that you have something that you need to do in your life but you'll get back to them. DO NOT write off a supporting family member or friend, they can be their but do understand what real support is (when I hit my slumps my sister and mom tend to check up on me more or ask if I've done homework etc.)
- can't get motivated enough to do laundry? Spread it out a bit, do smaller loads as needed like socks and underwear, shirts, pants, etc. Set the washer to smaller loads as well to conserve water.
- can't brush your teeth? Swish some mouthwash instead

Gratitude and ingenuity can't help immensely, there is no one way to overcome a specific problem. 

If you have more helpful advise, feel free to drop it. Things are tough this year, but we can get through this by reaching out and adapting.",06Dec2020,1
31,"The title says it all really. 

I have all of the signs of lack of motivation and lack of focus. Which leads me to believe I am still depressed. But I am in a really good mood. Just bummed out I can't do anything. 

Before anyone asks, I actually want to and enjoy working out/learning new things. But I still can't bring myself to focus on that or anything else.

Please help.",06Dec2020,1
32,"I've been feeling like this for a few months now... my mind is cloudy and hazy, I feel unmotivated, unable to eat or do anything at all. I don't remember when I genuinely felt happy -- it just feels monotonous, unfeeling and just lost, and I force myself around friends and family. Id love to go and see a mental health doctor but there hasn't been any availability in months. Anyone have tips and/or supplements or other methods to feel better on the meanwhile? I've been reading up on 5htp and joyfilled but I can't find clear answers. I just want this weight lifted off my head and actually feel something other than blankness and sadness.",06Dec2020,1

34,"I’m in the worst episode I’ve had in 20 years. In bed-for-weeks, lost-my-job bad. I noticed that I really need  and rely on physical comfort to get through the day. Like a warm house, hot baths, good smelling candles, cleanliness, hot tea, and hot food. Fluffy and warm blankets. Comfy clothes and socks. Silence or soothing music. All of these things feel absolutely necessary. I feel like I reverted to being a baby. Why are these patterns present? Is this normal for people suffering such intense episodes?",06Dec2020,1

37,"Hi redditors, first time posting so please bear with me. I work as a nurse practitioner and although not treating covid patients face to face (I practice primary care) I am to the point of giving up because it feels fruitless. Many people do not socially distance or wear masks, not to mention the “covid is fake news” crowd. In the US I feel our political world is crumbling down around us and it makes me hopeless. Not to mention, both of my parents are dead, I’m essentially estranged from my brother and my sister lives out of state. I have a great husband and 2 kids but they do not understand depression and I really don’t have many close friends. I’m wondering what the point to all of this is? I actually looked at a butcher knife this morning and was imaging myself slitting my wrists. I don’t think I would do this but I fell down this hole fast... There isn’t much to turn to right now. Any words of hope or encouragement you can give?",06Dec2020,1
