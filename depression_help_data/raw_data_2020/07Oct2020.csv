0,"I’m in my final semester in college and I am taking a field class thats supposed to be in person, but I convinced my professor to let me do it online from a different country, which turned out to be extremely difficult. I want to pass and graduate but I can never find the motivation or energy to study or do anything for the class. I’m already weeks behind on readings, and my grades and terrible and all the deadlines are approaching fast. I failed this class before because I hated how it was taught and decided to flunk myself out so I could take an alt class in the summer which was canceled.

Depression, however, is kinda in the way. I forget quick so reading is extremely frustrating but essential for the class, I’m embarrassed of asking for help b/c of how I acted the last time I took it. As well as a 9 hours difference in time zone and I’m clueless of how to study in my hometown.

It sounds like I’m making up excuses but I tried to pull it together and do my shit but it fails everyfreakintime",07Oct2020,1
1,"This is really long so I know probably no one will read it, but maybe it'll help me to just get it out, cuz I really don't have anyone I feel like I can vent to right now. If you want the short version, skip to the last paragraph. 

This year is kind of kicking my ass. For a while I thought I was doing better last fall, I even stopped going to therapy because I felt confident handling things on my own. I got into the peace corps, and was super excited to move to Zambia this August. Then I got medically disqualified due to my mental health history (even though I got a signed letter from my therapist saying I was fit to serve!). So then I was kind of thinking I would re-apply in the fall because they just wanted a certain amount of time without any mental health symptoms. I thought about staying where I'm at until I could re-apply, but then the pandemic happened and I thought I would probably have to move back with my parents because my summer job I had lined up fell through due to everything being closed. Then as I was packing up to move, stuff started opening up a bit and I got the job back, so I unpacked everything and decided to stay. Then I got a remote internship in my degree field and planned to move to Denver to be closer for convenience if I got the full time job after, but wasn't really sure if/when that would happen so I didn't have a chance to find a replacement roommate for my current place in time. So now I'm still here, my plan was to move in December, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a replacement then either (especiallt considering my other roommate is also trying to move out early). 

So I'll likely be stuck here until May, which is fine i guess. It's just been a wild year of not knowing what's next or where I'll be. And now I'm really questioning if I'm even in the right career field. I love my bosses and the company I work for, and I sometimes enjoy the work, but I find myself struggling to get through a work day and by the end of Friday, I'm already preoccupied with dreading Monday. I have a hard time motivating myself to get stuff done while working from home, which then makes me feel guilty because I feel like a lazy employee. I'm anxious all the time and having a hard time functioning and sleeping, plus I've been having some medical issues and I'm just exhausted with it all. 

On top of that, everything happening in the world (especially here in the U.S.) seems like everything is headed towards massive disaster. It's just so hard to find the motivation to go on when every area of life is kind of fucked. I'm lonely, but I can't do anything about it because there's a pandemic and I work from home so I don't even get the bare minimum of interacting with coworkers or customers. I'm tired, but I can't sleep because I'm constantly anxious. I'm unhappy at my job but I can't do what I actually want to do because of a ton of different reasons.

I have to talk myself into existing every day, and it's getting harder and harder to do that. What the fuck am I actually here for? My social life is non-existent, work kind of sucks right now, I'm having trouble eating because of my health issues, I'm tired all the time, and nothing is helping. I started doing yoga and learning Spanish just to give myself something to focus on, but that isn't helping either. At this point, I'm alive because I feel strongly that suicide would be a selfish act because I know my parents would never get over it. But it's just so hard to live every day without really wanting to and without knowing where I'm headed because I have no clue what to do with my life. I feel more isolated than I've ever been and have never had to deal with this kind of thing without having someone I could talk to about it... can't afford therapy now that I've graduated and can't use the resources at the university.",07Oct2020,1
2,"I stopped taking medicine 2 weeks or so because of ED and not wanting to be addicted anymore. Lately, I’ve been fantasizing about shooting myself in the head all day. I’m not going to do it obviously but it’s effecting my school work. Does anyone else have a similar withdrawal story? If so, when do these effects wear off. Also, I don’t want to talk about my feelings it just makes it worse.",07Oct2020,1
3,"I've never been diagnosed with depression and unfortunately, when I had brought it up in therapy sessions in my past, my therapists tend to say things like, ""you're pretty happy most of the time. i don't think you are depressed"". Which becomes not helpful and makes me want to continue that persona of the happy person who doesn't have problems because it's a nice thought to think I'm not broken. But, the feeling never lasts and eventually I fall back into a slump which can be extremely depressing and my motivation in life tumbles. 

I have a hard time finding a way out from my slump sometimes and it feels like it lasts for a week at times. Then, it can flip flop and feel like I can really do things well and I get stuff done. But other times, it can feel really intense and I feel completely and utterly hopeless sometimes for days. 

I'm smart enough to know that things like meditation or exercising or (insert thing you enjoy doing) can have stave off depression, but when I'm in these slumps, I have absolutely no desire to do them at all. If I even think about doing something, I get a feeling of anxiety and resistance. I end up avoiding the task at all (even when it's something simple like doing the dishes or meditate). The resistance I think comes from some level of arrogance in that I don't feel like I should need to rely on activities in order to feel better. Or, that I'm worried about how other will think of me if I do anything. I constantly think about how people would react to the things I do or say. It doesn't show on the outside though because people tell me that I'm always happy. It's rather annoying to hear that to be frank... 

Anyways, really struggling here and could use another perspective on this. Thanks.",07Oct2020,1

5,"Sorry for the LONG post ahead, i just need someone to hear me.


For a good part of my life, my father only expects one thing of me, graduate. Like any other parent, he wants to see his kid do better than him, and thats understanable, considering my parents both grew up in poverty and forced to drop out due to external factors. 

The only problem is, he mocks and degrades me for some reason, most likely in a twisted way of supporting me. He has insulted me about my weight,  said my depresaion was just a ""mindset i jeed to get out of,"" has gaslighted me on matters Im 60% sure DID in fact happen, emotionally abused me for 15 years, was not afriad of forcing a 7 year old sit in -20 degree weather, yelled into a 5 year olds face that ""they are just a pig waiting to get fatted up,"" repeatedly threaten with violence if end were not met, gets down right PISSED at my younger siblings, who are 4 and 5 for making a common accident, and those are the ones i can remember off the top of my head. 


Theres a lot to unpack, and oh boy, its going to get worse.


So..... did you know 13 pubescent kids are surprisingly horny around a 5 year old, cause i sure as hell didnt. Yeah that was something that happend, and i cant belive im saying this, but i thought it was normal. Parents didnt give a shit who i hung out with apparently, or care enough to actually ask or question. 


Ill just leave it at that and move on, im getting dangerously close and i honestly cant bother to stop it. Oh dont mistake it as me completely giving up, theres still a part that wants to live surprisingly, but the other 95% really wants to see which afterlife was correct. And i end up in hell, hey, ypu wont see me complaining. Problem is the only reason i want to live is because my family needs me, self appointed butler, and they are fortunetly not treating me like a slave.


Right the guilt part, Ive done some horrible things, some more so than others, and i fully acept the blame. I was a horrible piece of shit as a kid and still am unfortunately. Ive insulted people, got into physical fights with my autistic brother, said some nasty things about people who didnt like me, ruined relationships with both loblved ones and dear friends, wished some truley horrible stuff on others as a kid, being annoying as hell to my classmates, being a general nusiance tp everyone, and just being a stupid bastard.

Ive run out steam, heres to hoping this old dog gets put down soon.",07Oct2020,1
6,"Hey reddit, I'm 20 years old. I have my two parents that  were divorced when i was about 10. My dad cheated on my mom with this older wealthy lady and he ended up leaving my mother and my mom, brother, and I had to move to a more poverty struck area. I feel like my depression era started a little after these events (I really started to feel it at age 13). I still got to see my dad on weekends and stuff but its just so weird being with him and the woman he cheated on my mom with. I grew a sense of not confiding in my parents for anything. I desperately want to talk to both of my parents but I just cant seem to find the heart, and I always get struck with this sense of guilt because I predict when I do build up the courage to speak till be too late.. and those types of thoughts have been on my mind for EVER! I honestly don't know why I cant find the heart to tell my mom I'm hurt, she's literally the nicest woman ever and I have no reason not to trust her, its just some weird mental block or my pride that makes me unwilling to speak up. If anyone has any advice or would like to talk about it please feel free to hit me up any way because its been just me for about 10 years. As always if any of you have anything you'd like to discuss with me you're more then welcomed!",07Oct2020,1
7,"So my body, or maybe it's my brain, is weird. I'm allergic to ALL antidepressants. There's something in them that turns me homicidal and in the past I have acted on those impulses because they are STRONG. And apparently whatever it is that I'm allergic to is also in percocet. So yeah.

My therapist ended therapy a year ago as did my psychiatrist because they said after 5 years there was no more help to give. My psychiatrist said I need to come back once a year for a new medication prescription every year.

With covid, being a single mom of 3 teenagers, all 4 of us living in a small hotel room since March and until at least next March until we move out, having no support system, having a daughter with her own mental health issues that turn her into a monster regularly, and being a full time college student it has all just been overwhelming. And if all that wasn't bad enough, let's throw in my Bipolar Type 1 with Psychotic Features, PTSD, and ""extreme off the charts ADHD"" diagnosis on top of it all. 

Also, we can't treat the ADHD because I'm allergic to THOSE meds too!

And now my depression is back. And bad. Not suicidal bad yet, but an increase of debilitating migraines, lack of empathy, lack of fucks to give, appetite is mostly gone, and just want to sleep 24/7. And no matter how much sleep I get I'm relying on energy drinks because I'm exhausted.

 So yeah, my depression has come back. The depression we can't treat. Yay.

I've already told my kids that the depression is back and what they need to watch for in case I miss it. They were amazed at what I'm going through and said that I seemed happy so they had no clue. I told them that was called pretending. But I want to be able to actually cope, not just pretend.

I was looking into coping skills and therapies I can do solo since I'm new to this area. I kept hearing and reading about therapy dolls.

Does anyone have one? Has having one helped at all?

Thank you all! If you have questions feel free to ask and I'll answer. No question is off limits.

TLDR: bad depression in an already crazy person. Do therapy/reborn dolls actually work for depression?",07Oct2020,1
8,"I was obsessed with this girl for a very long time, almost 2 years. I have attempted suicide because of my feelings for her twice and have had some stalkerish behavior concerning her. Even had the police called bc of my suicidal behavior. It was a very toxic obsession for me. I’m aware that the situation with her really lowered my reputation. That stuff doesn’t really matter anymore because I’m not in hs anymore. All summer I spent fantasizing and wishing that one day I could have my chance again. Just one moment to say I’m sorry and to ask for forgiveness, but I soon realized that was unachievable. I’ve been trying to get over her for a while, but a week or two ago I deleted most of her social media, except her Instagram. Today, she went live on Instagram. I just watched for a bit, but then my dumbass decided to make comments and junk. I got called gay, pedo, emo, all those things by some of her guy friends (I’m almost 19, she’s 16, but I was 17 when we first met). I got told to off myself, all that. Someone even said “how does it feel that you can’t have her but I can.” I tried to shake it off but I don’t even know what kind of response to make. I wanted to say that I’m over her, but I couldn’t. If I was over her, I wouldn’t have watched it in the first place. Now I’m feeling something that I haven’t in a while: heartache. I just want to curl up and die. I’m convinced that no girl will ever love me and that I should just keep my expectations the lowest they can be. I think it’s better just to not risk the hurt than to take a chance at happiness while risking the possibility of getting hurt. I don’t really have anything else to look forward to in life, but I know I can’t bring myself to kill myself. So I’m here. Posting a big Reddit essay no one will read. :(",07Oct2020,1
9,"I hate myself. I'll have to start with that right off the bat.

I feel as if I'm already dead inside. I feel as if I don't like being around people but I wish I was friendly and outgoing. But conversations bore me or tire me out.

I'm a single (by choice) woman in her 30s, the lock downs made me lose a job I had kind of adored and I was forced to move back with my parents and where my brothers (also in their 30s) live because they're also facing hardship. I was living alone before and enjoying the peace but hating the solitude. Now I'm not alone but I miss the quiet. The house is too noisy.

When I'm around them, I don't feel anything. I mean I was close with them but now they have their lives and wives. They try to include me but I sometimes don't feel like it because of my wishing to be left alone. But I also wish to be included. I do love my family though and I want them to be happy.

I want to live in my own apartment but rent here in expensive. And I'd have to find a better job than the one I managed to get. 

My main thing is I want to be left alone but I also want to join in. I dont know why I'm like this. I barely smile and laugh now and I hate chatting. I just want to do art and enjoy youtube. I want to travel again.

But sometimes I feel like I just want to die. If it weren't for the shows I watch, I might have just ended it. Wishing to see how the stories i like end might be my only reason to stay. And that's slightly sad.",07Oct2020,1
10,"Here are some tips and apps I found useful for helping me in my depression/anxiety. It's hard to stay on top of things when you struggle with mental health and your mind is also unreliable, so I think it's best to outsource the heavy organization lifting to your electronics. Pretty much all of these options I use are free, even if some have extended options if you pay for them. Likely, you won't be able to implement all of them at once, for me it took months to get this system to be reliable for me, but I think that maybe it would help someone else too (also don't attempt do do this is you are currently in a bad episode or you should be going to bed- I see you out there trying to put your whole life together with ducktape at 4 am. Save this post, take a rest, try it when you have the energy to).

1. OneNote: I think when you have issues with mental health, your mind can be very unreliable. So I found that keeping important info about dates or requirements for my degree and similar stuff in onenote helps me feel more organized and calmer when I don't have to look stuff up all the time. Because i can use it on my phone too, I have the info with me no matter where I am. I do advise putting important dates in a calendar app tho.
2. Habitica: if you need more motivation and like the feeling of having a gamey life, I think habitica is a good option for giving yourself some rewards for effort. You can set what you have to do and how hard that is for you. it's also divided into habits, dailies and to do lists. Plus you can join a party for extra social support.
3. Focus To-do: it's kinda a pomodoro method app. It doesn't really have to be this one, but I really recommend using at least one. It's so much easier to motivate yourself to say you'll work on a task for a set amount of time than just saying you'll do it till it's finished. Even if you are feeling horrible. it'll help a lot. Clean the whole room? Nah, just put on 25 minutes of room cleaning and see how much you manage in the time. Finish the whole book? 25 minutes is a lot more doable than that. 
4. \#selfcare: it's a little virtual space for you to relax in.
5. Organizing emails: I really recommend this if you are receiving a lot of them. Most likely no matter what email program or app you use, they let you make separate folders for specific categories. If you combine this with onenote, calendar app and habitica, you'll feel really good about being organized. Put maybe 25 minutes on pomodoro, sit down with your organized email system. Check the email, delete useless spam or task you have completed. If you want to keep the email because of a pending task, important info or you are just not sure if you'll need it later, chuck it in the right folder so it doesn't clog up your inbox and you can easily find it again. If there are tasks you are supposed to do, but just don't feel like at this moment, put it on the habitica to do with a set deadline and if you have a widget on your phone screen you won't forget about it.",07Oct2020,1

14,"Hi guys, I'm new to reddit, so apologies if I do anything wrong! This account will probably be a throwaway :/


TL;DR:

Life is the same processes repeating over and over, which I'm tired of dealing with 



Get comfortable guys, this one is a doozy.

So I (18f) recently moved into my college dorm in a new town. Not surprisingly, I've been a bit lonely. I'm a fairly shy and awkward person who has way too many insecurities to count, and while I haven't been properly diagnosed, I exhibit many symptoms of depression and anxiety. So, meeting new people and trying new things really drains me emotionally/mentally. But I know however overwhelming things seem at the moment, I'll get through it. I've done it before and I'll do it again. Except...that's the problem.

I can't get past the thoughts that this is all life is. Because so far, these processes HAVE defined my life. 

It goes like this:

1. I need to learn something/meet someone/go somewhere new

2. I feel like shit because I spend all my energy worrying about how I act/look/etc and constantly think I'm not good enough

3. I eventually do make friends/learn how to live in the new situation, but still constantly worry

3. Repeat for any/all stages of life (school, work, hobbies, etc)


I'm so exhausted of overthinking every single thing every single day. I can't even imagine a single life path I want to take that would actually satisfy me, because it's all overshadowed by my insecurities. I'm  not living, I'm just existing on a day-to-day basis. 

The little moments everyone says to live for and the ""don't worry, it gets better"" phrases don't work because I ALREADY know it will get better and I ALREADY have little moments I appreciate. It's just I don't feel like they're worth all the effort; they're not enough to live for.

And so every time I think about suicide, it seems to get a little more realistic and I seem to feel...less.
I can now vividly imagine the steps I'd take and the thoughts I'd think while doing it, and I can imagine how people will find me and how they'll react. ...But I don't react. I've been desensitized to my own death. Suicide doesn't seem like a big deal anymore. It just seems like it's better to end it now instead of spending the next 50+ years living such a dull, predictable life. 

I'm tired.

I've downplay the role of luck in it for so long but it's slowly become undeniable. I have worked my hardest and not only do I have nothing of material value to show for it, I also don't have any meaningful relationships left, it feels.

Im still young though (19) and I know I could try to work on it but there's no reasonable guarantee that it'll work out. I would take my own life but there's too much I don't know to be confident enough to do that.

TLDR - can you compare your pain with someone else and expect them to feel less hurt? Am I depressed or am I actually selfish? 

I don’t know what’s going on anymore. It all started a few months ago when my boyfriend said he was extremely depressed. He felt suicidal. I tried to be there for him but he has a habit of pushing me away. Eventually he went ahead and told my friend that I didn’t care enough for him. 

He’s been depressed for a while. He has a lot of issues and no matter how hard I’ve tired he won’t open up to me. Most of the times he’s had a bad day I know we’re gonna end up fighting. Most of our fights are not even because I’ve done something. Sometimes they are as simple as me not calling him. 
This kept me low for the longest of time. Trying to figure out how to pull him out of his low. Though I never succeeded. 


Meanwhile all of this time I have been facing a very hard time in my workspace where I’m constantly being  humiliated and showed down. It’s made me so low and so painful that for days I don’t speak to people. I stay within my self. I have uncontrollable outbursts of anger and tears. But I can’t do anything about it or talk to my boyfriend because he’s already facing a lot of issues. 

Finally I tried. I told him I have been in a bad state. And I haven’t been able to get in touch with my counsellor and to which he told me all sorts of things about how my problems aren’t problems in comparison and I should be grateful for what I have and made me feel like an absolute asshole for not caring about him and being self absorbed. 


I don’t know how to feel any longer. Are my feelings wrong? Is there a degree to pain? Am I not supposed to be in pain because his wounds are more painful than mine? Or am I actually selfish.",07Oct2020,1
33,"I've dragged myself out of the pit this last year, with a lot of help from family. But I'm constantly feeling the pull back in. It feels like a full time job resisting falling back into depression.    
Does that get better? I don't know if I can do this forever. I'm trying to get a job but I just don't know if I can keep this up.",07Oct2020,1

35," Sometimes I have somewhat decent weeks were I'm able to function, but those weeks are often proceeded by week-long (sometimes more) ""depression benders"" where I just rot.

How do you recover?? I'm falling behind and feeling overwhelmed. I have a mountain of things I need to do that I should have done weeks prior... This always just snowballs for me and just causes so much stress. 

It gets so bad that the traditional advice doesn't even help. Start with small things- all the small things need to take a backseat because i have a thousand other bigger tasks that need to be completed ASAP.

Idk.. I just need help.",07Oct2020,1
