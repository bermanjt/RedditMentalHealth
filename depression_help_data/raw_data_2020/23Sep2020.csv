0,"I’m fourteen and although I haven’t been diagnosed, I’m pretty sure I have depression. I hate my life and wake up every morning with a feeling of dread pulling me back into my bed. I hear voices telling me to just “let go”. I know I’m not exactly mentally stable but I can’t find words to voice it. I have a therapist and he’s super nice but I just can’t explain what is happening all the time. I keep concealed from my parents because my Dad and Stepmom are not helping me at all, if anything making it worse. It’s so bad that today during school, I legit wanted to take the police officer’s gun and blow my brains out. I just really need help and I have no friends at school. I feel like I’m invisible, worthless, people would forget my existence if I ended up grabbing the gun. Voices are always telling me that I’m pathetic and that I don’t matter to anyone. I used to be able to fight these thoughts and voices off, but I’m losing control. I start wanting to die more and more, as if I’m getting worse. If anyone knows what I’m feeling, please reach out. And if not, still just maybe try to put yourself into my shoes and say what you would do.",23Sep2020,1

I'm 16 and my dad died a few years ago when exactly I don't really remember because I forget things really easily, because of that I really hate my self.
Even though I say this another part of me doesn't really care because even though I know that my dad loved me I always felt like an outcast from my own family. The reason being is that my family so it's really loud, but I'm both quiet and the middle child so I was never interested in what my older and younger siblings liked. Not only that but my dad is a strong person physically just like my brothers while I on the other hand am very weak so he would always tell me to man up and be strong so I started to hate him for that. Another thing I hated him for was that he didn't liked that I played an instrument (tuba) in like my brothers who played American football which he accepted. 
So now that he is gone I never felt like he loved me and never felt like I made him proud.",23Sep2020,1
5,"My brother has had severe depression/suicidal thoughts for the past 10 years. He's super smart but thinks of himself as worthless and is really depressed. Around 7pm every night, he'll go to his room and drink himself to sleep.

A few weeks ago, he mentioned to me the idea of taking a psychedlic while I watch over him to help cure his depression. I am aware that he has to be in a good mindset with the thoughts of wanting to improve himself as he is taking the high and that he also has to be in a good setting. I was simply wondering if any of you had an experience with psychedelics that really changed you for the better and was looking for advice on this matter, and if there was anything else I can do to help him?

Thank you so much",23Sep2020,1
6,"My [21f] dad [65] has been stuck in a very depressed state the past 10 months and I am desperate for any advice on how to help him get better. In the beginning of December he was great. He was socializing, doing projects around the house, and he was healthy. At the end of the month something completely switched. He went into the hospital for stomach pain and they ran every test possible but found nothing wrong with him physically. After he came home he started to deteriorate mentally. He stopped bathing, showering, eating, shaving, socializing, mowing the lawn, doing his bills, and he doesn’t even sleep in his room. It’s as if he’s dead inside and it’s torture to see him like this and I can’t imagine how he is feeling. He has said things to me like “I feel like I failed you, I should have been there more”. In 2016 my mom died suddenly from stage 4 cancer and at the time my parents were not in a good place. My mom struggled with mental health issues for years and my dad just wasn’t there for her emotionally. They fought a lot and my moms  condition was extremely hard to tolerate and it put a strain on their marriage. I know my dad has guilt and regret. He worked so hard his whole life so our family could be comfortable. My mom would complain how she was lonely but my dad always promised that when he retired they would travel. Well, now he is retired and his wife who he met at 16 is gone. His kids are grown and I’m all he has left. He won’t sleep in his room because it reminds him of her. I think he’s going through a later life crisis and I want to help him.. I want him to be happy so bad. He’s been on different antidepressants the past 5 months but none of them are helping. He had a depressive episode years ago and Effexor helped him bounce back but now it makes him severely anxious. It’s now been 2 months of him being on lexapro and the only change I notice is that he’s been watching sports which was always his favorite thing to do and he has been eating more. But he still is severely depressed and nothing else has improved. His mother committed suicide so depression runs in his family. He promised me he would tell me if he got that low but he doesn’t open up to me. He doesn’t express his thoughts and feelings and never has been that type of person. But I know the thoughts that are going through his head and I just wish he knew how much of an amazing person he is. I want him to live the rest of his years happy and hopeful. Can this type of severe depression be cured? Can I get my dad back? Any input or advice would be so greatly appreciated.",23Sep2020,1

I tried to kill myself a few months back then I went to the hospital and got prescribed some antidepressants and they are working but god damn nothing is better i just don't have the fucking balls to do anything now. I'm more scared that I can't leave when I want to. I still can't sleep but I'm more tired than ever and the only way I can get any sleep is using huge doses of drowsy OTC medications that I pick up on a weekly basis as i work a shitty job at a pharmacy as an assistant. My job only makes me worst because of the constant reminder that other people have it worse than me and I should stop complaining because hey that guy has to take 10 medications every day so I have it easy don't I? Sorry for taking up your time reader but sometimes I just need to ramble, even know I know I'll never change anything I still dream that I will be good at something or be loved truly by someone other than my mother. Now I just spend my days getting through my final classes of my grad year, I should be happy that I've done well enough this far but i still feel just nothing, if this is what the rest of my life is like I don't want to live it. I legit just want to do nothing all the time, but then I take huge dosses of random pills that say may cause drowsiness and I don't feel bad or good, I finally just sleep. I don't care what its doing to my liver and other organs it makes me not feel empty or angry so I will keep doing it till it kills me I guess.",23Sep2020,1
9,"Hi reddit,
I need your help, because I can't talk to friends and family about my issue. 
Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker. 
So me (27f) and my boyfriend (25m) have been in a relationship for about 1,5 years. Generally speaking I'm very happy with him and we're often  discussing our future together (moving in together, kids names, wedding ideas etc.). 
To make you understand the following, I have to give some background information: my boyfriend got severe depression, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. In very stressful times he sometimes faints, throws up, looses his short term memory and gets totally disorientated, can't speak, whole body cramps up. Had to witness it myself a few times, it was awful. The depression comes from a few different things, I don't even know everything, he's not ready to speak about it all yet, but what I know is already bad enough: when he was 10 his father died in front of his eyes by saving a little girl in the ocean. He basically raised himself after that, because his mom had to work 3 jobs. He couldn't make many real connections as a child/teen, because his way of thinking (progressive, liberal, philosophical) wasn't the norm in his culture. He is a war refugee, left when he was about 20 all by himself with no support and not much money. He almost died on the way here (europe). Treatment in the refugee camp was awful, the little hope he had got crushed there. He was in an emotionally abusive relationship. Ever since he got to europe, it's been problematic for him to move forward in education and career because of bureaucracy (but ngl the depression doesn't make it easy for him to go after stuff...). Regardless, I firmly believe he will do great things, if he'll learn to work with his mental illness. He is really smart and motivated (when he isn't a depression phase) and knows what he wants and it hurts me so much that life is so difficult for him.
So anyways, he started psychological treatment beginning of the year, once a week, I feel like it helps him a little, but the Doc said he should consider a clinic, which I fully supported (saw great accomplishments for my cousin this way), but he didn't want to. I asked him to try meditation and yoga, because I read many reports of the positive side effects and also tried myself, because I have depression too (yea I know, we're such a great combo!) and I've learned to handle it better. Now I know what he went through is million times worse and it will take a long time for him to learn how to handle everything, but he just refuses to try anything else but the weekly appointment. 
Coming to my question.... he is in a low point again, hopeless, but yet ""doesn't feel anything"" (fellow depression peers will understand) and is basically telling me to let him go. Not to break up. No, he is asking me to let him take his own life. 
He actually told me before he doesn't want to live anymore. He also asked me to kill him so he doesn't have to suffer anymore. After that I cried out and just blurted out how it'll affect me and what he means to me basically. Then I asked him to promise me not to hurt himself. I know that was selfish but I was desperate and very emotional. But I guess that is the reason why he is asking me ""for permission"".
I still think he could get better if he'd try something else (clinic, medication), but he won't, so he'll have this mindset forever. And I don't want this for him. But I also don't want to be without him.",23Sep2020,1

19,"I seriously don't know what to write,

I don't know if I'm depressed or not but I can tell you that I can't remember a day I was glad to be alive, I hate my life since I was born, beaten with a cable as a child, when I got beaten my father always told me not to cry or he won't stop beating me, today is the first time I've cried at a age of 26 after over 13 years. I fucking hate my life so much, I seriously don't know if this is my last message so anyone remember that I have existed. I have no friends and the only friend I have is my dog.

I never had any support and when someone helped me with anything, i got reminded of that forever.

I paid a debt of 3500euros because my father stopped paying my insurance. I wasn't happy, i felt like a big stone felt of my shoulder, 1 month after I paid it off, there was a second bill of 1070euros and about 1570euros and it continues.

My father did some mistakes and is about 80k in debt and he asked me to help them and to take the company on my name.

After I've done it, he kept saying I can go find another job if I don't like it.  
I almost lost my driver license because he drove the companies car and I just made my driver license few years ago, I couldn't drive for a year and he never said sorry.  
Now they don't want to give me work to do so i can't pay off anything, I know I'm not dumb but no one values it anymore.

Once someone send me a PM on facebook asking for help and a gym to go to, we became friends and it was fun, i thought we were friends but he just left and went to another country with his GF, not saying anything, I was standing on the street waiting for him to pull up with his car because if was before I had my driver license. I was waiting there and send him a message where he is, he replied XYcountry. I was dumb enough to think that we were friends, because a real firend would at least have a last beer.

You had this feeling where you're afraid to enjoy anything because the more you enjoy it the more sad you get in the future? It's like with force, it doesn't disolve or disappear, it gets transfaired, so the happier you feel, the bigger shit will happen in the future.

My dream was to create a website about computers to help people and all gamers, I had so many ideas but this life is just sad, I'm thinking about getting drunk right now.

Crying actually helped a lot, didn't fix any of my problems but i don't know what to do.

Even if I paid off the 2600euros what will happen next? Next bill out of my ass to pay off? Why can other people enjoy friends and life but I fucking can't? What the fuck have I done to anyone to fucking hate me this much.

Can I use ""Requesting Happiness"" flair?",23Sep2020,1
20,"I don't really know how to put into words how I feel, I feel heavy and sad and hurt. My biggest concern is that my best friend's father past away and I'm being a horrible friend to her. She messaged me two days ago and I answered only to be ignored by her. Yesterday she sent me a message completely unrelated to what I said, I answered and she didn't reply until midnight, when I was already sleeping. Then today she spammed me with random pictures and saying what she did the day before. All I could bring up to say was ""okay"".   

I get that she's grieving, but does that excuse her asshole behaviour? She knows I don't do well with being ignored. I was actually really worried about her, but turns out she was just hanging out with friends... She didn't even care to apologise, but spammed stupid cute pics as if that will make it better.  

I've been trying really effing hard to be there for her the past few months, while still dealing with all of own mental problems and not have anyone to talk to myself. I couldn't and still can't talk to her because her dad was ill and now passed away, so she's grieving and I don't want to burden her. But I have no one else to talk to and honestly I'm tired of being her friend, it takes a lot of energy to be positive for her and motivate her while not getting that energy back. She's my best friend, but I just can't deal with her behaviour anymore and I'm not sure what to do about it.

22,"Today at 1PM EST i am going for the first of 6 ketamine Infusion therapy sessions.  I am  hopefully going to document my story and any progress here for the benefit of you and so I can see if there is any change in me.

My expectation for the therapy is not that it will “cure” me, but that it will give me an opening to help myself.  Once a year or two for a week or less my depression lifts and it’s f’ing amazing!  I feel like I can be or do anything! I’m naturally kind to people, make good choices and feel connected to god.  My hope is that this therapy is going to hold that window open for a longer period so I can make some progress.  It’ll be up to me to seal therapy, listen to motivating stuff, work the steps, etc from there, but if I can get that Window, I will do my side of the work.

However, at this point I have taken every course, exercises or not, lost weight, lifted weights, taken tons of different anti-depressants (none work, except Wellbutrin which works for exactly 1 day, no joke), gone to retreats (I got humiliated by the STAR staff because I acted out just as I am), done wilderness survival, 30 different kinds of therapy, and everything else you can try.  So if this doesn’t work, I’m done.
.  

I am 55 years old. I have suffered from acute depression as long as I can remember.  Yes I had bad things happen to me, but I believe that has nothing to do with depression, that’s sadness.  I am depressed if I get the girl, lose the girl, win the lotto, lose everything I have, it doesn’t make a difference.  If getting those things makes you happy, then good news, you’re not depressed, just sad, so take some pills, get the girl, make some money and help someone else and you’ll be fine.  None of that would make a difference for me.

I describe my depression as a constant weight hanging around my soul.  It is also a second person who is with me 24hrs a day to keep a nonstop running dialog to remind me, “you are a piece of shit, waste of life, pathetic, a loser, an asshole, nobody likes you, your a failure at everything, your hopeless, your even too much of a pussy to kill yourself.”

My emotions range from disconnected, to angry to abject sadness. I don’t have anyone who loves me because I can’t love anyone.  And because I am so disconnected, I am mean to people, most often, without even knowing it.

I have no friends except people who live far away and prefer me at a distance. I have been all over and done tons of stuff and not enjoyed a minute of it. I’ve lost all interest in having sex, but I will do a lackluster spank of the baloney as an addiction as opposed to enjoyment.  

I quit smoking, but think constantly about smoking. I’ve been clean and sober for ten years without anyone wanting me to sponsor them, or making any progress, having no friends, no spiritual awakening, and I could pick up tomorrow no problem.

The best choice I made in my life was not having kids so I didn’t pass my genes on, the worst was getting married. My wife is an amazing tolerant person, the mistake was not her. The mistake was that I knew what I am and for all these years I have been dragging her down lower and lower. I knew I shouldn’t burden anyone with me and I did it anyway. If this doesn’t work I have to find a set of balls to do what I should have done years ago, so she at least profits in some way from being drug through the mud with me.  

So, I’ll try to post and let you know how it goes. Either I will have great news to share three weeks from now or I’ll no longer be posting shortly thereafter.

My birthday is in a few days, and my friend just had hers. We’re 10 days apart (and a year). Me and eight other people went to her party, and it was actually a great time.

Then I text. I didn’t advertise some big party, just asked them if they wanted to come over and hang out near my birthday.

I texted 10 other people. Two responded vaguely, and it’s been a day. These are almost all the same people. One asked about the group chat personally but didn’t answer the question. I’ve always been a little anxious about what my friends think of me, but I don’t think I’ve ever been more upset. I don’t want this to be *real*. I hope so badly that they all text saying they just didn’t see the message, but I know that won’t happen. I don’t want to answer my mom on my birthday about why I didn’t invite anyone over. It’s so small and stupid, but I’m just so hurt. What did I do wrong? I’m always afraid I’m annoying, maybe I really am. I had finally stopped doubting people’s opinions of me too.

I moved around so much and two years ago I finally settled in a highschool and made *friends*. I’m so attached to these people — we always have so much fun together. I get invited all the time by my one friend that hosts everything. What did I *do*???

28,"I've been on this ride for 10 years, went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with depression years ago, got a recommendation to a therapist and some meds, never went to the therapist. Because I also happen to have anxiety and calling/scheduling appointments is a task that's way too much for my skittish brain. It's too much.

I've been doing better last year, moved in to a new place, found a good paying job, but as the time went on and we hit the brick wall in a form of a worldwide pandemic, my mental health has started plummeting, I've also had a breakup 6 months ago with a partner but that doesn't matter in the long run, really. I just feel like it was one of the bigger catalysts of a downward spiral I've been on for a few months, even if at first it didn't seem like a big deal. And while I do not want to come back to that person, I don't even keep in touch with them anymore, all I have left is this feeling of wanting to be loved? But anxiety doesn't help at all. I can't make connections. 

I've been laid off from a job in March and started working in the same place again mid July. It was fine at first until people started to no longer want to work there, now we're critically understaffed and we're being forced to do two 12 hr shifts a week, while a normal shift is 8hrs long. I also have to commute for 2 hours one way. I won't get into detail as to why, but basically, the perspective of being forced to stay away from home for 17 hours total (I also have to get to the bus stop first...) and having to just... shower, eat and sleep... It's a no. Nobody should be forced to do this. 

I have a perspective of a new job but I can't even force myself to update my resume. It's too much of a mental toll. Everything is too much of a mental toll right now. I live in a limbo, every day, every week is the same, I can't get out of bed in the morning, I dream of being home all day that I spend at work, I dream of a weekend off but then I am too exhausted to do anything for myself. Rinse and repeat. I don't go out. I wanna cry but I can't. I feel so angry. Every little thing gets me aggravated.

32,"ways to feel better when you're feeling low or suicidal: 

&amp;#x200B;

* **See a photograph of yourself as a baby.** Think of how tiny you were, soft arms and pink cheeks. Your wide eyes. *The moment you hurt yourself, you’re hurting that baby*. And you don’t want to hurt them, don’t you? You’d destroy all their effort to live. Give yourself one more chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Books**! This isn’t the first thing which comes to your mind if you’re feeling suicidal, but why waste a chance to read? My grandpa once told me: «Books gave me the will to live.» Needless to say, that sentence saved my life. Maybe your daily life sucks, but you can chat with every single author through (e)paper. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Nature**. We’re the lucky ones. We can still admire nature and trees, flowers, ladybugs (ladybirds for my lovely uk citizens.)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Art.** Vent! Scream your feelings! Take a pen and write it all out, it draw nonsense. But please vent through art and *keep yourself busy*.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, these work for me.

It’s worth it. Good news will come and they will make you smile. I’m not going through an easy phase of my life, but I can assure you the good days are worth any sufferings and are better than the bad days (I call them D-Days).

Arrived, filled out paperwork and then was led into a private room with a lounger and some medical equipment.  They warn of a bit of a dissociative experience, then plug the IV in.  I was monitored on video cam.  Felt very safe and secure.

Today was the lowest dose they offered, which was good because I TRIPPED BALLS.  I mean full bore out of body, different planes of existence, untethered from reality stuff!  As someone who has done drugs in the past, I knew to ride with it, but someone who hasn’t ever had the experience, I think they might be overwhelmed. Here is the interesting thing, the whole experience I summarized at the end when they asked me as, “kind.” Yeah I was seeing and feeling all kinds of weird stuff, but it seemed like it was impossible to think about anything but pleasant stuff. 

After, I was still tripping a 1/2 hr after the IV was out and I definitely would not have been able to drive; walking may have been daunting.  It’s about 1 1/2 hours later and I’m still a bit tired, as if I had just pulled a college final all-nighter. 

My friend (as of this writing I have almost no friends, so I had to use my AA sponsor...I’ve got 10 yrs and ran this through him before signing up... to give me a lift).  He has two particularly irritating traits. He is really pokey, constantly touching, grabbing and poking.  The second is that he is super political and thinks his guy walks on water.  Normally when someone rants political I’m furious in seconds. On the way home from treatment I noticed that none of it mage me angry or sad, I just gave him shit back. Typically two comments in I’m angry, plus feel sad and stupid and want to punch somebody, not today.  Second, first when he was being handsy instead of yelling at him I just said, “hey I really don’t like that stop.”  Then the second time, when I would have gone nuclear, I just moved far away, and I told him why. I didn’t have to take it or over react.  Now keep in mind this is just temporary and is just something I noticed.

I’ll check in again on Friday.",23Sep2020,1

35," my cat is dead, She pressed down. I find it hard to breathe when I think about my cat... I have obsessive compulsive disorder and I feel like I have obsessions again.. The electricity in my house is broken, and i can't even charge my phone...",23Sep2020,1
36,The only reason I'm alive is because I cant do that to my mom but it's so hard to live for other people. My life is going nowhere I have a ton of mental health issues and I want to give up. What is the point of trying to get out of the hole. I even abuse the meds they put me on because I'm a piece of garbage. Fuck everything it's not worth it the struggle. I'm thinking about taking all my pills and seeing if that works cause I give up.,23Sep2020,1
37,"Hello, I just wanted to talk to someone about this.

I know that it's not unusual that you can sleep forever and still be tired but it's so annoying. Because I also want to get stuff done at home, like cleaning the dishes or clean my room. But I can't because I'm so exhausted. I'm working 5,6 days a wweek and when I come home all the stress falls off of me and I just want to lay somewhere. Today I wanted to take a nap at 6pm and now it's  nearly 1am here. The nap escalated hahah.
I really don't know why I post this here. Maybe I just wanted to rent a little.
It's annoying that depression makes me so weak and tired, exhausted and so on. I just want to have enough energy to get trough a day man :(",23Sep2020,1
38,"For the past 2-3 weeks to a month I’ve been feeling really emotionally.. uncomfortable to say the least, empty even, and if I’m not empty I’m sad. I feel kind of hopeless about life even though I’m only 16 and I’ve lost interest in music (which was a huge passion of mine before). 

I don’t have energy to do much of anything anymore; my friend invited me to the mall and I was also invited out to a birthday dinner but I didn’t go to either since I just didn’t want to be around people and didn’t have the motivation to get ready. I’ve stopped playing the violin, guitar and I’ve stopped songwriting because it just frustrates me now. I’ve been crying a lot recently, I just feel like sh*t inside, and I feel like I’m going to go nowhere in life. I just wish I could disappear into thin air, or go into a coma maybe, that’d probably be nice. 

At the same time though I feel like I’m faking these feelings, I feel like subconsciously I want the label of depression to excuse the fact that I’m just a lazy*ss who sits in her room all day and never makes plans to go see friends. But the thing is I’ve always been a pretty lazy person, so maybe that’s just who I am. I feel guilty when I’m happy or laughing because it makes me feel like there’s nothing actually wrong with me. 

Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to tell me parents I want to get help because what if it’s just PMS or my period making me feel this way? Maybe I’m actually fine but in a way I don’t want to be fine, in some weird way I like being sad. Advice, anyone?",23Sep2020,1

40,"The only real relationship I've had in my life ended like 6 months ago. We were with each other for 7 years. Im such an anxious mess and never do anything but she would get me outside and actually do things with me that made me feel alive. Now im alone and I just do the same shit all the time and I don't feel productive, I'm so depressed and anxious all the time that I dont have the energy or urge to try and do those things that made me feel alive. Part of it is her, I know everyone can find someone else eventually but I really feel like she understood me and I don't think anyone else would the same. I just feel lost, I try tinder and shit but I can't even talk to strangers without getting anxious let alone a girl im trying to get to know. I feel like im just here, kind of a burden for others but they would be sad if I was gone. Idk this is really all over the place I just dont know how to exist anymore.",23Sep2020,1
