0,Every day this week I've been called fat or nasty looking. I'm a sensitive person so I'm having trouble letting it roll off my back because it's constant. Getting exercise is how I've been losing weight anyway so it's like I can't win against the shitheap called humanity. It seems the more I lose the ruder people are?

1,"Hope everyone is okay.

Ugh, I feel so lonely and anxious. I know I should message one of my friends, but I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like a burden. Always messaging and moping about. Never messaging them happy, cause I haven't been happy in a while. I feel like a nuisance. And it doesn't help there isn't anything to talk about. 
Most of all I feel like a bad friend. 
They never reach out to me, so that really makes me feel like I'm bugging them. 

Idk why I posted this I guess I just needed to vent, feel heard. I feel like I don't have anyone and it sucks. My partner has be too busy to even message me ""have a nice day"". I don't feel like a priority in their life rn and it really feels shity. Cause when we are together in person and not long distance it's fine. But I'm the only one putting in effort rn. 

I'm sorry if this post is annoying, just had to vent.",16Apr2020,2
2,"i lost all my friends

I had my friend group, and i liked this one girl( well i thought i liked her but it was just because everyone was telling me to move on from this other girl)in my friend group for a while and she liked me. one day i was skateboarding and i was near my friends house so i met up with her and i was doing some dumb stuff that i shouldn’t have been doing with her. i stopped liking this girl that i thought i liked because of it. and i told the girl that i didn’t like her anymore and it was fine. i told my one guy friend in the group abt what i did with the other girl in our group, because we were tight way before we became friends with these girls. he then goes on to tell the girl that i used to ‘like’ what i did and she got really mad at me and everyone get really mad at me and now they all hate me. i know it was my fault but now i literally have like no friends anymore. i used to be known as the really sweet guy and now i’ve came to realize i’m an asshole i really am and i can’t really make new friends because of quarantine.",16Apr2020,1

Not only the situation makes me anxiouts and depressed, but the fact that I have to work from home everyday fucks me up.

Yes, I am thankfull that I have work even during this pandemic but I don't feel any joy doing it, and it's been like this since months ago.

Everyday that passes, when it's around 10 pm and I try to get myself asleep, only work comes to my mind and I fucking hate it.

Not only that, my parents are 60+ y/o so if they catch this shit, they're probably done. I'm an only child so idk what could ever happen to me.

None of this is new by any means, but its increased these last few months. This has especially been effecting my work and school life, which is even worse considering everything going on.

In conclusion:
I am afraid of my company kicking me out, because I've been sick a lot the past 4 years. 
I just dont know what to do anymore. Work isn't fun for me anymore. I fight with my coworkers a lot. I can barely get out of my bed before work. I am depressed almost 24/7, I have panic attacks almost everyday. I feel unworthy, alone, helpless, sick. 
I am in therapy since 2 years, I am on Sertraline 75mg per day &amp; I take valerian tablets to relax and for my sleep. I just got a prescription for melatonine 2mg because I almost can't sleep since a month and longer.

I have extreme depression , anxiety , suicidal thoughts 24/7 and I know one day I am going to end my own life . But I want to have some fun before it.

I want to get high , drunk with friends , go to a club , have sex , travel and have a real fancy meal in a fine restaurant. My life goals aren't complex , but those memories will be everything I will have while looking back at my shitty ""life"" ready to end it.

I just hope this terrible times with corona will pass as soon as possible , so I can get out of my home prison and try to feel alive and not dead and hollow inside.

Fuck school and terrible abusive parents who don't understand grades aren't important if just not committing suicide or self-harming takes the majority of your energy and focus.

It’s all in your head. 

You haven’t been diagnosed with depression so it doesn’t count. 

Really? You think you’re depressed? Let me tell you about my childhood and emotions. 

Everybody has it way worse than you, so stop being a selfish little brat and think about others. 

Everybody has it better, so stop focusing on everyone else. 

Saying that you’re depressed with a condescending attitude. 
(So you’re DePrEsSeD and all? Is that right?)

Why would you be depressed? You have absolutely no right to think that. You do NOTHING!!! I have to do everything for you, i make you dinner like I’m your chef, i drive you around like your personal shoufer, I clean up around this house like I’m your maid!!!

You’re tired? Well i get up at 5am and go to bed at 11pm. 

Why don’t you want to talk to me? (Then when I do, they take it, twist it around and throw it back in my face to use against me).

Why don’t you want to hang out with us? (While getting upset with me over the smallest things).

Why don’t you get out of the house more? Alls you do is sit around. I can take you to your friends house. (Then gets upset that I’m always out and not doing enough).

Oh ladi da da look at me I’m DePrEsSeD!

The only reason you’re “depressed” is because you want to be. 

There are people who actually have a reason to be depressed, yet they aren’t. 

The reason you are “depressed” is because your always lazy, you dont get out or socialize, you dont take care of yourself because you’re “tired”, and you never want to talk to us or hang out.",16Apr2020,2

17,"(Throwaway account) 

It started years ago when my (21F) boyfriend (23M) mentioned to me that he’s never actually happy. He will laugh and have fun but he’s never actually happy. Since then, I’ve encouraged him to go to a doctor. He decided to see one and was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and sleep deprivation. However, he never went back to get medication, nor did he seek therapy or receive any kind of professional help. It constantly affects our relationship and so I asked him to get therapy. After much delay, he decided to go and from an outsiders perspective, it seems as though the therapy was slowly starting to help him manage his depression. Since the coronavirus pandemic sent us home from college, he’s been getting worse. Not showing up to online classes and missing assignments. He’s also been distant and I have no idea what he’s thinking or doing. 

I just want to make sure he’s okay but don’t know how to help since we can’t see each other. We recently got into an argument because his depression has made it hard for me because it feels like I’ve been carrying the relationship for a long time. I have never had depression before so I have no idea what the experience is like. All I can do is sympathize and try to understand as much as I can from an outside perspective. And this isn’t about me but his depression has deeply affected our relationship. I wanted to break things off but immediately regretted saying that. I think that really hurt him and he hasn’t spoken to me in over a week but said he will reach out when he’s thought about things more. I don’t know what to do. I want to help him. I want to be there for him. Do I reach out? When should I reach out? Would trying to talk to him when he isn’t ready going to make things worse? 

I want to ask those of you who know what it’s like to experience depression about what helps you the most. I care so much about him and I just want to do what’s best for him, his mental health, and our relationship.",16Apr2020,2

21,"I’ve been taking sertraline for about 6+ months and I am currently feeling the lowest I’ve felt since before I started talk therapy and medication. I’ve recently gone through a breakup in which I was repeatedly cheated on right before everything with COVID-19 got bad in my state so I’m feeling extremely anxious and alone and haven’t been unable to shake this overwhelming sadness. I haven’t been able to stop crying for days and the days that I don’t cry I’m extremely numb to anything and everything. I’m not sure how much of this is circumstantial or if im dealing with side effects of my medication or if my dosage isn’t the right amount for me. I’ve discussed with my therapist my history with passive suicidal ideation but this is the first time I would say that I’ve caught myself thinking alarming thoughts of ending things just so I don’t have to feel these overwhelming amounts of emotion anymore, even though I know and understand that this will pass. I’m feeling a little discouraged I guess that my process of overcoming this isn’t enough, and I’m a little bit afraid that I will forever have to medicate myself just to feel some type of normalcy. I have plans to reach out to my therapist and talk this out with a professional but i’ve just been feeling really discouraged that I’ve hit this bump in my treatment and it feels like I never made any improvement at all. Is it normal to go through these extreme lows while getting treatment? I am consciously trying to seek out support from my friends and family as well but this feeling is so overwhelming that I haven’t been able to find comfort in anything anyone has said to me and I just feel like i’m doing nothing but worrying everyone I love by opening up to them about how I’ve been feeling lately.

I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle just to begin being productive. Every time I finally get to that point where I feel like I might be able to do something, I either A) neglect to do it and instead waste my time on pointless entertainment or B) do it and it just makes me feel more depressed because again, it's like fighting an uphill battle. 

I guess there's a bit of missing context. I'm a person who tries to learn things. Many things. It never really works out for me, but there's so many things I'd love to do with my life that have never worked out for me. I'm not very smart, so there's not a lot I can comprehend easily. I'm also very unmotivated, which means that I can't really do anything with my life.

I'd love to accomplish something. Just anything. I've tried so many times and it feels like when I do, there's a heavy weight on me that makes it impossible to get anything done. What happens if I get better and more motivated, though? Nothing, because that doesn't address the other issue: I'm too stupid to actually accomplish any of my dreams.

I will never mean anything to anyone, ever. I will never know what success is like. I will never be consistently happy, and all my coping methods are awful. I just want someone to save me, but I'm learning that even those who care can't help me to the degree that I'm wanting.

I just want to feel better. I just want to be somebody. I'm just a useless dreamer, though. I've flaired this as a rant, I guess. Because even though I want help, I think I'm beyond that point. I just want to scream this out loud.",16Apr2020,1

In the realm of self confidence/esteem and the like, I don't particularly like the way I look. But for the most part that doesn't hinder anything; I smile quite frequently when outside and am interacting with people. This is quite easy for me, and often happens without even thinking.

However for pictures I just can't... This is a really big issue for me as so, **so** many things these days require profile pictures. My linkedin picture is a photo someone took of me laughing, without me knowing, some 6/7 years ago. My whatsapp photo is of me leaning against a window sleeping on a train, also taken without me realising some years back.

I'm finding it extremely difficult to try socialise through apps because I can't meet the basic requirement of having a picture of myself - additionally I've exited from a number of job interviews because I couldn't handle doing a video (non-interactive) interview.

Once I turned 16 he started asking me for rent, and told me that he won't be feeding me anymore too, so I had to drop out of school, and find a job that pays.

Once I turned 20 I moved out, I couldn't take the beating any longer, I also went to military, served three years, and I've been living alone ever since.

Now I work as a customer service representative, but I loathe this job for many reason, but mainly because I don't like talking to people, but I don't have any other options because of my educational level.

That's okay, though, it's never too late and all of that, but I can't take it in this job another minute, let alone three years.

I thought about working on a talent or something, I have a wide imagination and I like writing stories, though I didn't actually write one down before, usually I just record my ideas or say the stories out loud to myself.
I like drawing and would love to learn digital art or graphic designing.
I would love to learn how to play violin.
I would love to learn coding and develop an Android Role Playing game or something.

But any of these will require time and money to invest in it, learn it, nurture it, until I can finally use it to make a living, and I already hate what I do now, I already been through a lot, and I just don't think life is worth fighting this stupid hard fight anymore.

I don't mind fighting, I don't mind being tired and exhausted as f*ck, but why can't I be happy? Why do I have to suffer and be unhappy too? Why do I have to be miserable all the time?

40,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 25 year old female, bachelor's and master's degree, just married last year, unemployed, and I couldn't feel worse about myself if I tried.

My story is way too long, but I really need some help beginning to trust my own intuition again and get back on some kind of path that feels good to me.

I definitely ""found myself"" during my undergrad 4 years ago. I went to a different school than my now husband and I really flourished. While most of my friends loved school for the social aspect, I loved it for the way it mentally challenged me and forced me to think different about the world (humanities major). I became very close with my professors and still meet with them to this day. Enrolled in graduate school a year later and really enjoyed the coursework, mental stimulation, and relationships with professors. I was driven, motivated, and had big goals. 

I graduated with my M.A. in December 2019 and I'm feeling the isolation creep back in from not being in a mentally stimulating environment. Because of the virus, my husband and I are quarantining at my parents house and I often feel like I can't fully express myself because my home self is very different from my academic self. I feel out of place.

The other element here is location. Upon graduating with our bachelor's degrees, my husband earned a job in his field a few states away in Michigan (he was a mech engineering major wanting to work in the auto industry). I tried to move up there with him twice and while I liked the area, my mom often guilt triped me about living far away. This was her first ""empty nest"" experience so I understand why it was difficult for her, but it really influenced me. 

While taking grad school classes online in Michigan with my now husband, I couldn't bring myself to really ""start my life"" there because I knew it would prevent us from moving back home. Fast forward to today, my husband lives in Michigan and I live with my parents because my mom makes every fiber of my being feel guilty for wanting to live where my husband is. During the duration of grad school, I bounced back and forth between home and Michigan, never staying one place for too long a time.

The event that really set off my self doubt and depression was that I was applying to jobs after I graduated in December in my home state and I ended up getting a dream job offer. But my mind ended up twisting everything and telling me I would be a bad partner if I uprooted my husband from his job in Michigan just for my job. I can't believe it, but I declined the offer, thinking that choosing my family (husband) was a noble thing to do, but I ended up deeply regretting it for about a month. Now, I'm completely trigger shy. I don't trust any move I make. I have no idea how to make decisions that I feel happy about because my mind switches back later.

I'm sorry for this long post. Any advice would be so, so appreciated as I feel totally at my wits end 😔 thank you.",16Apr2020,2

I cannot stop you from the days where it feels like no one loves you. one day you will be happy. and you will look back on this. i promise. talk to a friend, get some sleep, drink some water, have some of your favorite candy, play some videogames, go for a walk around the block. do what makes you happy. 

someone out there cares for you. 

it might not be that girl you've been crushing on since freshman year. it might not be someone you feel sad over right now. 

but someone cares. 

Even I care and I don’t even know you.

you just need to look for that person, and I promise you will find that person. 

just remember
everything you've ever done has led you to this comment. you've made it this far.

43,"I can’t be a female, I can’t get treated like a female, I have no female friends to sit back and girl chat with. I want to be myself and I can’t, I’m fucking trapped in my own body and I need someone to help me with this. It sucks but it’s true. Amongst other things as well but that is a big one. I can’t get out of my own heads and thoughts with this. I just want someone to fit once say “Hey girl!, what’s up” or something of the sort.",16Apr2020,6
44,"I have almost no friends, I'm failing in all my school subjects, and I've fallen so deep in love with someone I can't have that I don't think my life is worth living.

I've thought of killing myself many times before, but I've never gone through with it because of the impact it would have on my family and the people I care for.

My best friend is a girl who I've fallen in love with so hard that I would literally give anything just to see her happy. But she doesn't feel the same way towards me and I don't want to leave her as I'm the person she turns to whenever she has a depressive episode.

If I ended my life she would be left with nobody and I'm scared for what would happen to her, but I know she won't ever need me the way I need her and that thought itself is one of the reasons why I feel so down. I don't think I'm ever going to love anyone to the extent I love her so what's the point of living if I'm never going to be able to feel emotion to that same level.

I'm sorry if this im just another stupid kid rambling about their problems but I just want to go to sleep and never wake up to face another day of loneliness",16Apr2020,2
45,"I need some help or advice, I've never been an especially active or social person which does bug me but that's only part of the problem, since lockdown I've just been lost. At first, I thought ""great! I don't have to leave the house anymore and I can just sit and play video games all day"" then the novelty wore off, after about a week I thought ""this is kind of boring"" and ended up only playing games for the sake of them or getting worthless achievements, after two weeks I stopped playing all together and I haven't played any games since. Then I though I'll make a list of everything I wanted to do before lockdown ended i.e. I have a reading list, film list and tv list as well as a task list like ""lose weight"", you get the idea, I was at least trying to occupy myself but now I just don't have the motivation, I just put it off till tomorrow and tomorrow comes and its the same thing, sometimes I prefer the dreams that I have instead of waking up to reality, I'm not going to kill myself or self-harm or anything like that, but sometimes I just end up mindlessly scrolling though facebook or IG for hours not achieving anything then I just feel stupid for wasting the whole day. Not to mention the panic about the virus that's also stressing me out. I just need some direction or someone to talk too. There's 5 other people in lockdown with me in a small house 3 of those are children aged 1, 4 and 10 and my mom is already preoccupied with them so it's difficult. Does anyone have any advice?",16Apr2020,2
46,"I’m straight up just tired and feel kind of bitter because for a little over 2 years, I finally decided to face my depression and anxiety and get help for it. But I’m still wanting to die, have low motivation, want to sleep all the time, so is this just how the dice rolled for my life? I’ve been trying to stay ~positive~ but fuck you can only stay positive for so long while switching from medication to med while wearing a bubbly and talkative mask all while not being hungry ever and not able to stop thinking about your own depression. 

lol this post sounds more emotional than it is, im kinda just empty and dont know what to. I always thought that I’d die young from either an accident or suicide, which I realize now its a pretty dark thought to have in middle school, but I can’t do that to my family. It’s just getting more difficult each day, and I have no explanation for it. 

I can’t remember a time where I wasn’t like this, so maybe I’m just lazy or a bad person who knows. I just want to feel like I’m not drowning all the time. I’m on the path to medical school to help people with depression and anxiety but damn if the last 10 years predict the rest of my life, i don’t think i can do it",16Apr2020,1
47,"today i'm here writing because i feel like i have tried everything i can in my power to help myself get better. i have taken prescriptions, tried writing down my thoughts and feelings, even tried exercise for a little over two weeks. i have tried confiding in family. i've tried expressing my emotions through music. and at first it feels like it does help. but that feeling goes away after a few days. and even when i stick to those it doesn't help.

i was supposed to go to a facility but then the virus happened and it was shut down. it felt like my last hope was completely shattered in arms reach. years before the way i coped with things was self harming. i have been somewhat clean of that for a few months and i really don't want to go back to that. but lately, more than ever, that urge has been very strong. i attempted to cut myself with a pin, i even tried breaking open razors but those attempts failed. 

today i tried taking a walk and jogged a bit but nothing will help.

i don't want to die but i would rather die than continue feeling this way. my mom told me that if i took my own life she would take hers. she said she is all i have left to live for. i don't want to feel responsible for her death. but i can't live like this anymore.

i feel so miserable and helpless and angry, because of all these feelings and urges i have. i don't know what to do anymore.

i lost my job so i can't afford to see a doctor again. i'm honestly scared of trying prescriptions again anyway... are the other ways to cope that i don't know?",16Apr2020,3
48,"Sorry if this is against the rules, but especially during the quarantine, I’ve been needing to talk to someone. I figured that I could find an online therapist that accepts insurance, but I’m having some trouble. Does anyone have any experience with online therapy? Do any accept insurance?",16Apr2020,2
49,"Hello. A bit of a back story: I(19NB) have been in a relationship with the man I love (21M) for 3 months now. I have had two previous abusive relationships, one from the age of 15 to 17, and the other at 18 years old that only lasted a month, which i still get flashbacks from.

Even though I am in a serious, happy, and healthy relationship, I keep getting the urge to just run away from everyone or just disappear from life. Is this normal?

I don't really know what a healthy relationship is like, and this one is still fairly new. My mental health just seems to be getting worse and I'm not sure what to do, I don't want him to blame himself.",16Apr2020,1
50,"Please no negative comments like: ""You don't need him anyways"" ""You deserve better"" shit like that is going to make it worse.
My BF of six months just broke up with  me. He's the only place I've found hapiness since we met and im not going to keep trying anymore. He broke with me over something stupid. I love him. I have BPD so my mood swings get bad. I get upset over little things. I'm done trying. Im dropping out and just stopping. It's not worth trying anymore. This is the day of us getting together 6 months.",16Apr2020,3
51,"I'm not really asking for help or support, my depression is seen both by me and professionals, but that's the question I've been trying to solve for a while.
So I have all kinds of self-destructive behaviors, and acknowledge them, but every time someone offers help, I discard it, and I had no idea why, but recently I've thought that it might be because if I get rid of the ""obvious"" things that indicate my condition, noone will ever take me seriously. Like if I set alarms for 6 and actually get up at about 8, after contiplating for hours if it makes a difference, everyone will say ""you wake up normally, you're not depressed, it's just for attention"".. and it's just the one thing.
But all the senseless talking away, the question is, do I throw away all this help to feel validated by others and myself?
