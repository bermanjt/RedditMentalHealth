5,"Now I'm only 13 and been dealing depression ever since I was 7-8 an I don't really know how to tell my parent. Mainly cause I don't want my family to look at me in a different way and I'm scare of changes like how they talk to me and treat me ect. Now I love my family dearly but I still can't bring myself to tell them. I wanted help cause as you know depression is not really easy to deal with. (I been dealing with struggles but I never tell my family so this will be new to them) 

What should I do?",23Jul2020,1
6,"I have been considering going back on medication. I mean, I clearly need it. I've been depressed for years. I've tried four or five different medications for depression, including Zoloft, Prozac and Lexapro, along with seeing many different therapists over the years. I was told if the medication worked, I would know. Nothing substantially made an impact, or if it did I didn't notice. Eventually I gave up and stopped taking meds, and then stopped seeing a therapist. I've been intermittently suicidal all that time, but I never told anyone such.

Recently I've tried to do things that would better my life. Drink more water. Get more sunlight. Start a journal. Pick up a hobby. Though that's no cure.

 Is it possible medication will never work, or should I bother trying?",23Jul2020,1

8,"I’m not fine.
I’m bulimic, I’m depressed out of my mind, and I spend my days doing nothing but staring at my laptop, praying that someone is gonna magically notice that I am the furthest thing from fine.  I found out that I can’t have kids, I lost my job, and my husband got a new job that he loves - so he’s always working late...and I don’t want to bother him with something like this...

So, to the general universe and the people who could give less of a flying fuck:
I’m not okay.  I wish I could tell someone, but I can’t. 
I’m just gonna send this out into the world for my own piece of mind.",23Jul2020,15
9,"I have been struggling with self worth issues. My wife isn't there for me anymore. She doesn't even hide the fact that she's cheating on me. I work a lot of hours with my job (some 60 - 98 hour weeks) and over the last couple of years I have noticed all of my friends are no longer around. I told her I was depressed and having suicidal thoughts and she told me how upset that makes her but nothing else. I have some past dependency issues after the Army. I told her today that I am officially 4 years clean and she immediately killed the one moment of joy I have felt in so long. I'm just tired of feeling so worthless...

11,"I’ve been battling since I was 8, I was feeling preeeettty good and finally starting to live again when covid came around. Mostly unrelated to isolation and stuff I got hit pretty fucking hard like 3 months ago or something, I talk about that a little in my post history. 

This last week has been the worst. It’s like every burned bridge is trying to rebuild at the same time. I talked someone I shouldn’t have through an abortion (like the mental stress that comes with it and seeing it in the toilet, waking up in blood and stuff) I was not equipped to handle that but I did my best to be helpful. I didn’t tell them to do it or anything I just kinda emotionally supported the aftermath. 

I fucking KNOW it’s me but I feel like I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. My friends are all either like BRO bro’s or in a terrible place themselves and couldn’t handle me too. I gotta be strong for them. My family can’t know I’m down like this cause they’ll overreact, I’ve gotta be strong for them. 

I’ve lost a couple people to the virus. Some people have committed suicide because the state of the world is hitting too hard on them.

The light at the tunnel was my ex, in thought. We ended weirdly, and it’d been some time and I thought we could work things back out. Boyfriend, apparently. Serious boyfriend. I know she’s hiding something about it too cause she’s being suspicious bout it, I hope I don’t know him. 

That last little kick really got me. 

This is really infringing on my motivation to try to handle the colossal falling through of all my plans pre-rona. I can’t think straight and it’s been like this for months. I just want to run away but cause of the terrible mismanagement of our fucking country I can’t even do that. Fuck Trump, if y’all couldn’t tell what country I’m from. 

I don’t even know why I’m posting this, maybe I just needed to see it in writing. 

Thanks for listening.",23Jul2020,1
12,"I’ve always tried to be a modest, down to earth, realistic guy. What that means is that I try to be humble and aware of the things I do so that I’m not an asshole to people. What this also means is that I’m so deathly afraid of being an asshole that I overthink just about everything and am so excessively critical of myself. In the attempt to make myself feel loved by being nice I also constricted myself into a position where I never feel worthy enough of anything.

This also ties in with my uncertainty about the intentions of others. Ever since I tried my hand at asking people out I’ve become doubtful that the way I interpret things is even remotely close to the way that they do making me unconfident in anything, and in the moments where I could have used confidence I was afraid to out of fear of being an asshole or being a creep or being overbearing.

I had my birthday celebration this past weekend and my family hung around for dinner and it was very relaxed, but the entire time I thought to myself, “This isn’t necessary.” Why is this celebration so important? What did I do to warrant it? Even if it’s just a small gathering I didn’t feel worthy of it. I didn’t feel I did enough to make everyone want to come over and hang out. To me it felt like an obligation to them - like they said that “Oh, it’s his birthday. Guess we have to do this thing.”

Whenever I do anything, share my hopes or desires on anything, people validating those or encouraging me always feels hollow since I don’t feel worthy of the things that I want. Them saying these things just come across as obligations, things they have to say to be social. They don’t mean any of it. I’ve done nothing to deserve any of the things that I want. Of course my friends and family would say otherwise - they’re either biased or not in the loop on what I’ve been dealing with or going through.

Even typing this post out I struggled with the idea of deserving to be heard and talked to. What have I done to try and help myself? I’ve made no efforts, I’m probably not gonna learn anything, people will point out my flaws and I’ll become defensive so why bother, etc.

So I don’t know how to be proud of myself or to feel worthy of anything, and I’m afraid my brain will look at anything here and say that it’s all a lie trying to deceive me. It’s hard to really value what I have and to feel like the things that I want are possible, but not with such a cynical view that I’ve developed over the years.",23Jul2020,2
13,"
I’ve been struggling with panic attacks everyday and as a result I am angry all the time. Why is this happening to me? Can I just get a damn break? I’m so frustrated because all I want is just ONE day of peace. One day without a heart rate that feels like I ran a marathon. I want to watch a movie without stopping it to google some symptom I can’t stop thinking about. I want to go to the grocery store without feeling like I had just drunk a bottle of whiskey as the world sways beneath my feet. A day where I can just be completely mindful with my children. A day where I can give my boyfriend space from me, without letting my anxiety make me believe that he doesn’t leave me because he’s scared I will hurt myself. Idfk man I know this shit is worse in my head or maybe even completely untrue. But the stress of it, the physical symptoms are so real and it depletes my energy and it’s hard to just be still and calm. I just want to feel good. No amount of wishing will make my anxiety or depression disappear, not until I fully understand it, and figure out why it’s manifesting my life. I know it’s probably just cortisone and adrenaline flooding my veins... but this is real shit and it’s fucking scary. I don’t know how to explain it to make someone who doesn’t suffer from this illness to understand. otherwise it’s just “relax you’re fine” or I get eyes rolled at me. I get it. It’s hard to love someone who seems to be so negative and toxic. Well no shit, why do you think it’s so hard to even love myself. I feel like my trauma has defined me for so long and as a result from that it’s all I know. My mind is obsessed with trying to AVOID any and EVERY trigger from my childhood.. literally! Even the silliest thing can cause me to panic. Sometimes I can calm myself down but most days i can’t control it.  For more than 15 years i thought i wouldn’t even live past 30. I had this plan, a REAL fucking plan for my life. to make sure my parents and brothers were okay before I killed myself. I couldn’t do it as a child because I was scared to go to hell, it was a sin. I was so confused but honestly it saved my life. At 12 years old, I had my first attempt. I took an entire bottle of pain killers. I just remember waking up in the hospital to the doctors pumping my stomach. then I had to go to a mental hospital for suicide watch. TWICE. After I experienced that, I figured I would at least TRY to get through high school.... at 13, I was taken advantage of and lost my virginity, it was my first time being drunk, which led to that a awful experience. I could never ever focus in school, and it didn’t help that I had boyfriends all through high school. Older ones, i wouldn’t have sex with them though. I didn’t trust them. For a few years I didn’t even want to think of sex or letting a man touch me. I was supposed to be focusing on school and my future. But I gave up on myself when I was a kid. I didn’t care about myself only my dad and brothers.
I made myself almost 400lbs because I didn’t want any man to try to rape me again or even be attracted to me. I was sick in my head. Video games were my escape. Even though I was smart and tested well academically ... I just stopped showing up to school. my parents didn’t know.. mom to busy being with a new guy every week and always working idk and dad too busy with church... he was always there for me but I was so broken. I didn’t want to hurt my dad since he was already hurting from my mom.But I felt that I had to take care of my brothers, so I made sure they ate and I made sure the dishes were washed since my mom wasn’t around or when she was she would be asleep for days having withdrawals from OXY. Which she got me addicted to at 16, and I don’t even know what kind of damage that did to me. As soon as I could I started working, I had to keep myself busy. I didn’t know what PTSD was or Anxiety. I thought it was only for people who were in the war or something.... but experiencing many years of actual rape so young for so long will definitely give someone PTSD.

I have become obsessed with it, just trying to be normal is so exhausting. People say “I’ve seen you happy, I’ve seen you normal” but what they don’t know is that most of those days I was on a pill, or drinking, or smoking. Some days I am truly happy, but those days are rare. certain things definitely bring me peace and make me feel like I am worthy enough to love. when my kids tell me that I’m a good mom, or when my baby looks into my eyes and smiles... especially when my bf is next to me (not angry or irritated by me being so anxious)
When he puts his arm around me I feel safe, I feel happy in that moment. When I get a kiss from him...I feel that he loves me. I know he loves me because of everything he does for us it’s just my mind fucks with me and wonders why it’s so hard for him to say it. Like if he only knew how much it means to me just hearing him. 

It all comes back to how low I feel about myself. My whole life I felt I was not good enough. I was always fat and made fun of, boys only wanted me for sex and I thought that was all I was good for. My mom didn’t love me enough, she wasn’t there. my dad taught me about Christianity at an age where I was too young to understand, too young to make my own choices on what I choose to believe. I was mad that “god” protects his children... blah blah well why wasn’t I protected??! 
That’s what’s I would think for the longest time. 
I hated god I hated church I thought church was for all the people who hated themselves and their lives and had no where else to go because “GOD FORGIVES AND GOD DOES NOT JUDGE” and if u become saved then you will go to heaven. That’s bullshit. Some people never deserve to go to heaven! That’s what I would think at the age of 9.
was so scared to speak up for myself all the time that I kept so many horrific secrets from my parents. It’s so sad that all was normal to me I guess. I thought it was normal for girls to be molested and raped.. I thought most girls went through it. 
Now that I am a grown woman, a mother I realize how my life has been impacted, my family, my kids, my man... all because of this fucking trauma.
So here I am now, trying to unfold everything so I can work through it and heal from it. I see many people that have overcome this PTSD from sexual abuse. I just want to be happy. if I can be happy, then my family can be happy. 

Being happy to me means, no panic attacks when I go somewhere alone, not getting a sick feeling in my stomach every time he takes his phone to the restroom. (PORN IS MY BIGGEST TRIGGER, I used to have to watch it while being raped) Not feeling my chest pound and having trouble breathing as soon as I see my stupid brother with his stupid haircut from my abuser. (My brother is my roommate, he was there most times I was raped and my abuser owns a barbershop)

What kind of brother is he???!! Nvm. Idc anymore

I can only focus on my kids and my man. 
I’m done with this shit. I can’t let it ruin me over and over again. It will ruin my relationship for sure. I will be alone and my kids will be broken. 

I can’t let that happen. I will do whatever it takes.",23Jul2020,1
14,"It's coming up on a year since my ex left me. But I can't stop thinking about her every day. It brings me down every day. I've cut connections to everything. I had custom hoodies I designed and got made and that logo ended up being the logo for my detailing company. I cut that out of my company and am currently getting a new one in the works. I sold my car to cut the connections to the brand (were we're both huge car enthusiasts specifically Subaru). I deleted every picture. Disassociated with people we were close with. Trashed everything she ever gave me. Even went and removes songs from my Spotify that we listened to all the time. Deted photos for all the events we went to just so I don't have the opportunity to think about her. But she always pops in my head. I can't stop thinking of her smile. Her laugh, her eyes, her energy. Everything. It's at the point where I can be out with friends and be having fun. And something will happen where I'll think ""she would have loved this"" and then my mood is ruined for the rest of the night. And then I usually end up going home early and missing the big car meet. Or miss out on all the fun. I still love her so much. Even after her and her new boyfriend decided to shit talk me on my stream. Completely degrade me infront of the biggest audience I've ever had. And then laugh about it after. Like I'm nothing. But I just can't move on. I want her back so bad. She was literally perfect. But I have to find out how to start over. I feel incapable of loving someone else so I don't even look. I don't even try to shoot my shot. And if someone comes on to me I friend zone them cause I'm just not interested. I don't know what to do. And if you read this far I love you and please help. Not to mention the outside things making this worse or outside thinks triggering anxiety attacks and then making me think of her and how she'd take care of me when. I was panicking. Or just my general depression messing me up making it worse. I need help. Alot of help. I just want to forget her. Is fate real? And if so is fate keeping me on her for a reason that she may come back. Or for a reason that I deserve this pain of everything falling down around me? Please help. I'm begging you. I can do this anymore. I can't take the heartache. I cant take the pain anymore. I can't keep scarring myself the blade is getting dull.

15,"My boyfriend asks if Im ok but he has his own issues and cant always be my rock. I lie, I tell him Im fine. 

Im a CSA survivor and Im drowning. I feel like I have no voice, I cant speak. I feel like Im wearing a gag but nothings there. Like my voice is trapped. 

I am so tired all the time and my body just aches. I just sit on the couch and wait till the day is over or go to work and come home amd sleep. My life is meaningless. 

I managed to do the dishes today, twice, I did three loads of laundry and made dinner. Thays a big deal when you can barely summon the energy to move. My boyfriend tells me its the ""bare minimum"" when he does that I just feel so defeated. If thats the bare minimum am I just a complete failure 90% of the time??

Im a ghost inhabiting this overweight starving frame. I dont remember to eat, I cant find the energy to shower. If breathing were a concious effort Id forget to do that too. 

I space out. I blank while washing my hands then suddenly Ive burned them because the water got too hot. I miss entire conversations because I just stop thinking. Everything else gets muted and harder to hear and I just dont hear people. 

I feel like Im wasting my life. I feel like I have no purpose. 

Right now I want to scream and cry I want to slit my wrists just to feel something even though Id ruin 5 years of sobriety to do so. I do not want to die. I just want to feel alive. 

I was normal once, I remember feeling happy as a young child. I remember making genuine friends. I remember being able to be touched without fear. Its so hard to be this way.

19,"I’ve had to move back in with my parents because of losing my job due to covid. Up until the end of March, I had been completely NC with my mom, and very LC with my dad, for about a year. There’s too much to get into about that, so I’ll just summarize: my mom was pretty abusive throughout my childhood and when I went to college I had a huge mental breakdown, dropped out, moved in with a friend, and essentially tried to cut all ties. I had completely given up on ever having a relationship with my parents, and I blamed my mom for all my mental health problems. I made her out to be this cold hearted villain who never cared about me. 

But since we’ve been forced together for so long with nowhere to go, we’ve begun talking in a way we never could before. And more and more I’m realizing that my mom isn’t the villain I thought she was. She’s a person who had her own mental health issues, that went completely unaddressed. She has so much internalized ableism surrounding mental illness that she’s only recently started to unpack. I’ve realized that for most of my childhood, my mom was depressed and anxious, and she had no help. It doesn’t excuse her behavior to me, but I can’t hate her anymore. I just feel sadder than ever, and angry that so much trauma and drama could have been avoided if my mom had gotten some therapy and possibly medication after having kids. I’ve learned that she had post-natal depression, that she had a miscarriage a few years after having me, she’s admitted to feeling incredibly stressed out and out of control during most of my life. A few days ago she broke down crying in front of me saying she felt “overwhelming sad” and she didn’t know why. 

It’s just been...really weird, and hard to come to terms with. Idk. If anyone’s had realizations like this, I’d appreciate insight/advice if you have any.",23Jul2020,5

23,"So since last November I’ve been taking an SSRI to help and things have gotten better overall. Unfortunately it kinda feels like it boils everything down to a few horrible days every now and then, which most recently led to my first panic attack.  

I also have been smoking pot for the past year or so almost daily, and Of course that can cause paranoia and make panic even worse sometimes. My NP at first suggested a Xanax/benzo prescription just for the panic attacks as needed, but due to some experience in college of seeing what they can do if not used correctly(friends who abused them recreationally), I’m terrified of them. 

I want to stop smoking for two reasons: 

1. I need to to get a new job eventually/stress about a random test at work (incredibly unlikely)

2. I think it may help with the anxiety. 

I know it all comes down to me being responsible with them, but the prospect of losing my job due to pot scares me just as much as using legal medication to help. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had this experience, also just a rant too.",23Jul2020,1

25,"My best furry buddy died in April at 14. Very sudden and traumatic. I had nightmares for weeks and I still can't think about his final moments without losing it.  

I waited a few months and contacted a website and Facebook page for a breeder that is well-known in the area (we travelled 12 hours roundtrip). They had a 10 month old, all health stuff, and his bio seemed to really fit with us.  

Long story short, the dog had so many health and behavioural issues. I had panic attacks daily. I had to rehome him because they refused to take him back and he's with a very good friend of mine and happy.  

Thought I was good... Then I had to end things with my long-term bf. He was taking advantage of me, gaming 8+ hours a day, eating my food, not spending time with me etc. Hardest thing I ever did was ask him to leave.

Something inside me craves for harmony and meaningful things.

I believe happy people are ignorant, selfish, dumb and hypocrite. There's no other way to be happy but being those things. Sometimes I try to be like this only to enjoy some happiness but soon enough I feel sick for doing it.

I'm full of contradictory energies which drives me crazy and keeps me in place. Having no guide or direction to where to go or how to live.

He also started fighting with me if I hung out with people. He convinced me they were in abusive relationships and I couldn't help them/ not to talk to them. I quietly left my friend group and didn't say why. He began threatening after that and I feared for my life. 

The threatened to rape me because I stopped sleeping with him and he knew I was abused in the past. He started sleeping with a weapon at night. He was highly manipulative but still a proud person in our community. His friends that knew though were afraid for my life/safety. He molested children (with proof) that was how I got out, because other people started believing me and them. 

My friends say that if I believed they were in abusive relationships I should have stepped in and warned them like they did for me. I feel ashamed and traumatized but also I feel like a shit friend. Someone please give me an outside view/advice or just tell me the harsh truth.

I'm currently doing college and we are with online classes. I managed to finish 2 classes (one I even have my grade, so with that one I truly don't need to worry about anymore), but there are still 4 more classes and they are making me exhausted.

This week my depression decided to get worse, I had to leave my bf's house and come back to my place bc my senior dog is getting worse and I needed to look after him. Everything is overwhelming here, but at least I was doing some of my college assignments and could text and call my boyfriend, who makes me really happy.

Today I was rather productive in the morning, but now I came back to the computer to finish some of the tasks I've already started, but I just didn't feel motivated. Went for my bf, trying to have a nice conversation and maybe get motivated, but he only said ""if I could resolve your problems I wouldn't be lying in bed by myself"". I know he said it jokingly, but I really am not in the mood for those jokes, and now I feel even worse.

That's why I came here, I would really appreciate if someone could say nice things about what I have already done, say I can do what I need to do or give me tips to get motivated again. I have a deadline and I *really* need to get things done by Sunday max.


Thank you in advance.",23Jul2020,3
42,"I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. 

For the past two years, I have been considering quitting my job and going into my creative business full-time. This sounds great, but I have little money saved up. My husband has a nice savings, and has said he’ll help me a little, but that still makes me nervous. (We recently got married, so we’re still figuring out the best way to combine finances, as he invests and such).

Recently, I have been stuck in a huge depressive episode. This has gone on for at least six months. All of which I’ve had the urge to quit my job. The feeling is overwhelming. 

I love my job, I truly do, but I can’t shake the thought of quitting. It’s to the point that I absolutely dread the thought of going to work. On days that I work, I get knots in my stomach and nearly force myself to have a panic attack. I’m starting to spiral, I feel it.

I have a creative business, and it makes okay money, but not enough to live on. My “perfect scenario” thinking is that I’ll be able to put more time and effort into it to help it grow. I also know myself too well though, because I know how hard it is for me to stay motivated and productive. It’s a never ending cycle.

I’m currently on a waitlist to see a therapist, but it’ll be a few weeks, and I’m almost at a breaking point. I am so conflicted on what to do.",23Jul2020,2
43,"For the past 5 years I’ve (23M) gone deeper and deeper into a state of anxiety and depression. It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to not care anymore. Ive always been pretty shy but once i left home to go to uni i started developing a worsening anxiety of social situations and isolated myself because of it (which I now know was not the best action to take). I now feel completely disconnected from everyone and what’s going on around me. I wouldn’t go as far to say I want to kill myself but I definitely have thought about it. I couldn’t do that to my family and if I’m being honest with myself, when I do think about it, in the back of my mind I know I would never do it, even if I said I wanted to. 

Around two years ago I was put on anti-depressants and I had moments where it seemed like they were working but for the most part I think they did more harm than good (I understand that different medications affect people differently, but regardless, I want to stay away from meds now). 

My external life isn’t perfect but it’s pretty good and there’s not much that I’d want to change. The vast majority of my issues stem from my own mind. 

So to get to my question. What is it like to come out of a deep depression? Was there a sudden change in perspective for you? Did things get better over a few weeks, months or years? And what do you think was the ‘key’ that helped you get better?",23Jul2020,5

People in my life just tell me to stop feeling this way and to try and focus on the good. Am I ungrateful?",23Jul2020,5
45,If read my posts you might understand why I what to die lately I have just been feeling blank die to that fact that whenever I get into fights with my friends because of my irritability they call me annoying I know this doesn't sound as a serious insult but whenever they say that to me I just feel like crying and I don't know why I feel like its because instead of insulting the action made its targeting the actual persona feeling it's a small insult that can leave a huge impact since then I've just been distancing from my friends online and just being depressed alone when school starts I'm going to get bullied again so I just want to die before then but I can't bring myself to do it,23Jul2020,1
