1,"A useful technique for me, through decades of varying degrees of depression, has been to use a routine and checklist.

The way I have done it is to make the checklist to get each day started. It‚Äôs formatted like a daily habit tracker, so there is embedded room to expand, for those times you may feel a little better. The routine, even though I have it memorized from sheer repetition, is the basics that help me to get just a little momentum. I check each task, every day. After that, I still deal with whatever pops up, but I have a checklist showing that I got something done, even if it just taking care of myself.  I make a new checklist every week.

For example, put brushing your teeth on there. Put using the restroom on there, at least for a few months. If stripping buck naked helps you, do it, and put it on the checklist. 

\- Drink a few glasses of water

\- Make the bed

\- Take your meds

\- Shower

\- Get dressed

\- Water your plants

\- Walk the dog

\- Be on time to work

These are all very basic tasks in life that you are likely doing anyhow, although without regularity.  So taking credit, with a simple written checklist (not an app), provides me a stable footing to climb out of the most crushing depressions, every day, through a known routine.

I hope this helps some of you.",01Mar2020,1
2,"Imagine this, I open my eyes as soon as I wake up. 
think of Teenage Dirtbag starts playing the background üé∂ 
I lay in the bed for just a second. I think about everything I‚Äôm about to do for the day. 

I start getting ready, hot shower, trim up, pick out my fresh clothes (ironing them as well) , brush my teeth twice, throw on some really smell good cologne &amp;deodorant while doing my hair up perfectly. 

Grab all my stuff, running outside to start up car.

Driving to school with a big smile on my face while singing ( windows down).

Pull up, walk in with my one strap bag. 
I spot my friends, I walk in and one hand shake them with hugs!!ü§ó  saying what‚Äôs up to all of them.

Make my rounds around the school saying to hi to others. I see a pretty girl at the corner of my eye, and all of a sudden I lock up some due to being shy. I get a big grin on my face, then I wave at her from a distance. She grins &amp; waves back üëã.

I write her not real quickly (saying I really like you, wana go skating with me?‚Äù I then walk up close to her and drop it in bag nonchalantly. My heart beats fast, my heart beats fast and I day dream of us all day. 

I then plan weekend plans with my friends to do multiple things. Everything seems okay. 
Music stops and fades. I start to fade. My older self appears all of sudden. No smiles or friends and or music. 

I‚Äôm nothing like that anymore??? What happened? Wtf?",01Mar2020,1

4,"My fianc√© has always suffered from depression but as of late he said it‚Äôs gotten worse. I‚Äôve also taken noticed because he‚Äôs been getting especially aggressive lately. He can be hurtful and when I try to point it out to him the mean things he‚Äôs said to me that I don‚Äôt appreciate, he goes on the defensive and feels like i‚Äôm attacking him and deflects the issue. This has cause multiple arguments that have really put a strain on our relationship but I refuse to give up on him. Overall he‚Äôs become more irritable, angrier, and his mood changes quickly. How can I navigate around his anger while also have him recognize the consequences of his outbursts? 

I‚Äôm also unsure of how to help him in terms of making him feel better. Our mutual friend has told me that he confided in her that he feels unworthy of love. I try my best to make him feel loved everyday but maybe there is something I‚Äôm missing. What are some ideas your SO‚Äôs have come up with that have made you feel better or what is something you would like for yourself? or something that you yourself have done that helped you in the past that I can recommend to him?",01Mar2020,1

15,"I've been having trouble with this for a really long time and I just need to let out all my feelings. I'm not that great a writer so I hope it's not too much. Also thank you for hearing me out if you take the time to read.

As a child I always felt different, unworthy and very alone. A part of me felt broken and I dont know why. I dont have much of a relationship with my mother because she was unable to care for me after divorcing my father when I was an infant. I remember the excitement I felt when I heard her voice when she'd come to visit. I guess I longed for her love and wanted her near but she had her own life and I became too attached to leave my caregivers. Even after she had another child when I was 6 (I begged for a brother) I still felt very much out of place and alone. 
I dont believe I have experienced any traumatizing events to trigger the feelings I experience. I feel like a part of me was always dragging me down. I constantly felt (and still do) like I ruin everything good in my life. I feel responsible for things that go wrong or moods of the people around me. 
When I was a teenager I lost someone who I adored. He raised me and loved me wholeheartedly and unconditionally. He was my grandfather but so much more. That broke me to pieces and I became very lost. I stopped eating and purged when I had no choice but to eat. I also began cutting myself to cope with my feelings and I guess because I was already having trouble as a teenager finding myself this pushed me further downhill. 
My mother came back into the picture to help support my grandmother and noticed I was I guess ""rebeling"" although I was a good kid and very responsible I fell for a boy in the wrong crowd. She didnt know how to keep me ""safe"" other than transferring me to another school mid semester. I had felt more out of place and alone than ever before. I became suicidal and couldn't find any solution to climbing out of this dark hole I fell into.
I found a friend, or I should say a friend found me. I had my guard up and wasn't interested in socializing but my classmate was very pushy to get to know me. She is now my best and only friend of 12 years, and my saviour. Without her in my life I was headed down a dark path and may not be here today. 
I wanted to have my life back and return to my school so I convinced my mother to let me go back. My friend and I stayed close. When I returned and tried to pick up where I left off, things had changed. My friends were distant. I felt like I didnt belong again. The negative feelings came back and I felt very alone.
I met someone special a few months later who is now my husband and father to our 3 children. He is everything I need to make me complete and I love him from the bottom of my heart. I am afraid I will ruin what I have with him. I constantly feel insecure about our relationship because I feel unworthy of him. I feel like someone else could love him better and he would be happier. I'm a burden and I suck the life out of him. Hes a great father, works hard and long hours but still helps around the house. Hes perfect but I'm not.

Our surprise baby will be 3 months old soon and midway through the pregnancy I was feeling very low. Very broken inside. This is a part of me he doesnt understand. He tries hard to make me happy and do little things to pamper me but it doesnt make me better in the sense that the feelings would go away. After giving birth I felt very disconnected from the baby. I couldn't bond with him the way I did with my other two and I felt worse than ever. The darkness was numbing. I became very snappy and cried for no reason but the sadness and broken pieces of me that fell into this deep dark hole.
I am now attending counseling sessions, have met with a psychiatrist and begun taking medication (sertraline). I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Since I've begun the steps toward helping myself there was a small window where I did start feeling a little bit better but I am now feeling helpless. I have no motivation, I'm irritable, uninterested in everything around me and I feel like I'm dragging. I haven't felt like this before and I feel completely useless and guilty for not being responsible enough to do anything other than provide care to our children and meeting their needs.
I feel like I need an escape I want to get out of myself and breathe. I want to be free and clear my mind. I need to feel. I don't want to be broken.",01Mar2020,1
16,"I started on a train of self hate starting sophomore year of high school and I have continued down the track and am now in my junior year of college.

I‚Äôm telling myself that if there‚Äôs something wrong that we can fix it but I just find myself drifting away. When I‚Äôm with my partner I always enjoy it and they make me laugh.

I have 27 and trough a series of bad choices managed to acomplished nothing in my life, In the last few years i started to have anxiety and suicidal thoughts, on the last few weeks/months i started to have self-harming thoughts (on 2 occasions i harmed myself). I try to stay hopeful and somehow positive, distract myself, but in the end these thoughts are always present. i feel so ashamed of what i've become that i'm isolating myself from friends and family even more everyday. I try to see some road that i can take to get out of this, but in any direction i look‚Ä¶i see nothing. I always thought that i wouldn't kill myself while my parente were alive, they are excelent parents, ir would be so unfair to make them pass throught something like this, but It gets harder everyday, i think now the reason that i keep going is my GF. We both love each other so much, but seeing me like this is also giving her anxiety .

32,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a number of years. This year has been the worst it's been and I am not sure how much I can keep going on. The future seems empty and painful. 

I don't want to write much and bore everyone. I've lost a lot of friends recently due to various reasons (Growing apart, moving away, disagreements). I've not been in a relationship or dated anyone a year or so. I have two close friends but find it hard to feel connected to them when we spend time together. I don't feel a connection to anyone anymore, my family even feel like strangers.  
I don't feel like myself or ever feel happy. I've tried to speak to my family about how I feel but they get really annoyed at me and tell me I am angry and need to be happier because there are worse things happening to other people. This makes me feel guilty and even more alone than before. 

I work a stressful job with long hours during the week, but I enjoy it because I have interaction with a lot of people. When I am working it's the only time I feel like my ""old self"", it's as if I put on a costume and then step straight out of it when I get home. 

I look forward to the weekend as I am tired and want a break from working hard, but come Saturday mid morning the loneliness and painful sadness washes over me. I try to make plans with people and they often cancel at last minute. I try to make plan my weekends with plans that don't involve others (Swimming, Walks, plant shopping, museums) so I don't end up alone with no plans when other cancel. However doing this makes the loneliness so much more apparent and I look at couples and friends and wish I could be like that again. 

A few weekends back my mum made some comments about how it's not the family's fault my life is sad  now and I was so angry and upset. Because I try my best to be nice and fake happy to everyone. I booked into a hotel and sat in the hotel room alone for two days because I didn't know what else I could do, I didn't want to exist anymore. This was the closest I could get to that.

My sister and I used to be very close and the last year she has got into a serious relationship. She barely talks to me and spends all her time with her boyfriend. I told her I missed her and feel like she's forgotten me and doesn't want to spend time with me anymore and she says it's not true and I only feel that way because I am depressed. It makes me feel really angry that now she is happy she has forgotten all about it.

I deleted all my social media because I found it too hard to see everyone enjoying their lives when i felt so alone, most weekends I spend a long time on dating apps  hoping I could get into a relationship like my sister and not be lonely anymore. (Although I know I couldn't be in a relationship right now with my mental health this way). 

This weekend has been very hard and all I can think about is that I will need to have a million more weekend like this. I honestly can't face it. How can I get back to being my old self, how can I get out of this cycle of loneliness?  Or any other general advice? Does anyone else feel like a different ""normal"" person at work? Why can I be this way at work but not anywhere else.",01Mar2020,1

I can't even vocalize this feeling to him its painful. its been 5 days since i first felt it. its getting worse and worse. last night i slept 3 hours then cried all night in his arms. i felt like I wanted to die and that there was no purpose in life anymore my head was just telling me ""why are you even alive?"" and thoughts like that its been a long time since i last felt and thought those things. I have ptsd and im still trying to heal from all my traumas. I love my husband more than anything he's been my gem and the only person that helped me through this journey to now. I get a sad feeling as if he will leave me (i have a fear of abandonment. I have this feeling often but it was so intense) my mind often tells me things like. ""he will probably just divorce you"",
""there's no way you'll be together forever"". it hurts. I've never been able to change these thoughts I am scared ways i will end up alone and lose all I love. its like a feeling where I feel like I'll be alone like theres distance between us and it made my body feel so awful I couldn't walk and i felt shaky. i can't describe it or what it means. I've been trying to think of a way to describe into him but i just can't. how can i cope with these feelings? im taking a medicine that may have caused this bout of depression and quit it last night after all this happened.

42,"I am not that old to be depressed or even die inside, only 17 yrs old, but I recently understood that I am doing it.
Until December everything was going smoothly, I was studying, and that's kinda all. But in that month I decided to open my heart to my crush, in who I was in love for more than 2 years. And I wasn't just staring at her from the back of the classroom, she was the closest person to me so I was to her, and I thought she was into me. As you might have guessed I got declined. Two weeks I was out of the world: couldn't study, couldn't speak with friends or relatives, couldn't even think, because I was thinking only about that day, when I got declined. Later on, I was starting to get back into my life. After New Year holidays I even thought that I am better now than I was before december.
How wrong I was. 
In past two weeks i understood that i am getting easily annoyed, I hate everything at school, my mood is unpredictable and everybody annoys me. Not only that, my crush still thinks that we are friends and tries to speak with me like nothing happened. Like what the fuck? She knows my feelings to her and completely ignores them.
I am in my last year of school, I have exams in summer and have to get in university somehow. Every relative I know put pressure on me as they dont think I will pass exams. Because of this I lost any motivation to study. Any motivation to do something. I lost every hobby and now I do nothing from day to day. I try to study, but on the next day I wake up with no knowledge inside my head. 
In the last 3 months I got very close with a friend of mine, she is a girl though, and we were sharing everything in our lives. I was supporting her and she was supporting me. Now she is going through a break-up and I am doing anything I can to help her, so she doesn't turn into depressed piece of meat like me. The problem is that by helping her I leave myself emptied. I spend all the energy i have to support her. And i can't share my problems with her as it will make thinks only worse.
Yesterday i was completely lost. 
I was lying on my couch doing nothing. Closer to the night I blasted into tears. For no reason at all. I was trying to understand myself, to understand who I can trust, who I love and who I hate, but I couldn't. My brain wasn't working at all. 
Today I wake up with no feelings at all. I can joke but I dont even smile, nothing on my face. 
And the fact that I am only 17 yrs old and already lost depresses me even more.
I just dont know what to do",01Mar2020,1
43,"I am so tired of all. I dont know how long I can keep fighting. Sorry for the vent but i have nobody to talk to.

Background: I am a 30yo woman with diagnosed endometriosis, adenomyosis and possible chronic fatigue sindrom. I always had period problems, I had a lot of problems and fatigue the last two years but the last six months the pain and fatigue have skyrocketed making me unable to work or study outside home. 

I am a Spanish migrant living in Belgium with my partner, struggling to learn flemish and to feel that I belong here. I cant rely on my parents (abusive father + mum that wont defend me). I still habe a couple of friends but they are tired of hearing my complaints.

...

I got depressed three years ago after a lot of bad luck with jobs/studies. With some therapy and antidepressants I finally got better. Last year i was feeling much better to the point where I improved a lot in my flemish skills and found a job gardening. 

Then my other diseases hitted hard and I needed to quit the job because I was to weak to do it. I went back to school to learn more flemish. I managed to pass a course despite all the pain and fatigue and missing a lot of clases. My teacher cant stand that I do well without going to all the clases and she told me that she wanted to fail me but as I had a 7/10 the secretary didnt allowed it. The next course she had a easy solution. She refused to let me do the last exams. As technically I 'failed' the course not doing the last exams she could finally fail me. The secretary didnt help me at all.

Now I sit at home in daily pain seeing how all my hopes for the future are going down the drain. 

...

My GP didnt believe in my symptoms and was two years ignoring them. I just changed to a new one. She (the new GP) knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because 'just a paracetamol should be enough'. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort.

I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back...

Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job (except the few months gardening) in three years I barely have any money left (I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium). I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years (when my status is reviewed) I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I ""just"" need to work 12 months....

And then there is the issue with my partner. He 'loves' me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores (walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage...). He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.In normal circumptances I would leave such a sexist man but like I said I dont have money anymore and I would be homeless.

...

I am struggling so bad with suicidal toughts. They are there in my brain every day, either wishing to kill myself (like today) or just fantasizing about a car or another disease killing me.

I cant kill myself because 'my boyfrirnd loves me so much'. I dont want to risk him getting depressed.

But I am completely alone. Nobody (partner, therapist not even my GP) cares about me or my wellbeing. Why should I stay in daily agony and missery just to not hurt others?

How can I get used to the idea that from now on I will just be a crippled house wife with no future, no job, no friends, no proper medical care and no suport.

Please help me. Either finding a way to live with my disease or to find the courage to eutanize myself.

Also does anybody know any suport/therapy apps like 7 cups? I tried that one but O cant get it to work in my phone. I really need to talk to somebody who cares for me.",01Mar2020,1
