0,"I'm in my second last semester of university and I'm an anxious perfectionist, so my average is really good. I have exams in less than a week and I've fallen into a depressive slump, I've been extremely unmotivated, doing just the bare minimum for my classes this past month. Now I know I need to study for exams but I can't bring myself to do anything, I sit at my desk all day listening to podcasts. At this point I'm really just petrified of my average dropping but I can't make myself do anything!!!!! Does anyone have any advice, even if it's the smallest thing, I know it shouldn't be this hard to just read my fucking notes but I ... can't. I'm sure most people will relate to this lack of motivation any tips right now would be really helpful.",02Dec2020,1

2,"My husband is upset bc I told him how I feel and he keeps asking me why and idk how to answer. I feel so bad for wanting to leave. All I've felt recently is this crushing sadness that gives me physical pain. I don't know how to live like this. All the things doctors, therapists and even my friends have told me to do to ""feel better"" havent worked. The first time I tried i was 15, that was half my life ago and I have gotten nowhere. I think about it all the time and I am one crazy self-destructive event away from a psych ward right now. Idk what to do anymore. Ive worked so hard and im still back at square one.",02Dec2020,1
3,"I’m not sure if anyone read my other post a few weeks back. But I’ve been having a really tough time dealing with my break up and have had severe depression most of my life. 

It’s been three months since the break up and I’ve been getting back into the things I enjoy. Got a job working part time so that I can try and focus on my hobbies. It’s been going ok, although it’s been lonely and at times my depression sways me towards isolating myself. I sadly mostly spend my free time sitting in my car either drawing or smoking. 

But today, just two hours before this post I decide to log into my Twitter and seen my ex’s new profile pop up in recommended. It was my mistake I know, I had an old number of hers saves under nameless. I obviously clicked it and seen the absolute worst. Basically she was out looking to hook up and fuck. 

I know I shouldn’t care, it’s been three months, but for me to see it for myself that she’s already moved on, and or didn’t ever care, just makes me feel so broken. Like everything’s a lie. I honestly feel like the person I am isn’t even me. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m afraid I’ll up killing my self or putting myself in a bad situation where I’ll end up dead. 

I don’t want to use medication, I’ve tried therapy most my life and don’t find it helpful to talk to someone where there’s no possible interest or connection. My family hasn’t been really supportive, I have issues with both my mother and father. Friends have been mia for the past theee weeks. I need advice please more than anything right now.",02Dec2020,1

7,"I'm in my late 20's. Off late, I've noticed that I'm not really seeking enjoyment......at all. Any kind of stimulation or enjoyment. It's like I have no drive for it. 

I don't feel like playing video games. I used to like playing video games because they'd give me a rush of dopamine (especially online games, whenever I won). But I don't feel like playing them anymore. It's like I have no interest. 

I don't even have interest in food. I used to love to occasionally binge on ice cream, pizza, cake, steak, brownies, all of it. For the taste factor. But now, I don't. I only eat for sustenance. I don't care about what the taste is like. 

And I remember when I was 16, I'd sometimes come across a really good song and it would blow my mind. And then I'd discover other songs from the same band and it would feel amazing. Like I discovered a new world. But now I don't feel anything. If I came across a new song now, I just wouldn't care. I just listen to my usual songs.

And earlier, I'd get really taken aback my natural scenery. Like if I was walking through the country side and I saw mountains, rivers, or get a really good view, I'd get taken aback and go '' WOW! ''. But now.....nothing. I'm indifferent to all of it. I don't care. 

My lifestyle itself is pretty busy. I'm a college student and I'm studying constantly. I get very little free time. Is that why? Or is this depression? I don't feel depressed, I've just lost the drive to seek out pleasure. What is wrong with me!?",02Dec2020,1

14,"I'm trying my best to be rational. Your help would be much appreciated.

After reflecting for a few weeks, I realized that my biggest reason for wanting to die is my disgusting face.

But the thing is: my problem isn't nearly as serious as some I've read here — and in theory it is treatable, although I'm too poor to do so.

Furthermore, there are a lot people in the Middle East and in Africa that would give everything to be in my shoes right now.

So, I should be grateful that my biggest concern is my face... but I can't.

With this in mind, I created two lists: one with reasons to be grateful and one with reasons to hate myself...

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons to be grateful:**

* **I have a home and a bed to sleep every day.** I don't have to worry about sleeping on the street on being killed in the middle of a war.
* **I can eat every day.** I usually eat just once a day because, as I said, I'm poor and because I'm too (mentally) weak even to get out of bed.
* **I have access to the internet, in my home — I don't even need to leave my bedroom.** It gives me a lot of possibilities and a great privilege compared to those who are poorer than me — I'm learning English without going to a school thanks to this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons to hate myself:**

* **My parents hate me.** As a kid, I did everything to get their attention. I just wanted to hear a compliment come out their mouths back then, though I only heard them cursing and threatening me. They just cared about my younger sisters — and never gave a shit about me. I guess this is why I'm so insecure nowadays.
* **My face is fucked by acne.** I don't recognize myself anymore. I hate getting outside my room. Now I hate myself much more than my parents do. I feel like I'm naturally inferior to everyone else, and this burning desire to hang myself is just the calling of nature — the survival of the fittest.
* **I'm a massive procrastinator.** The only thing capable of making me do something is a real threat to my life. For instance, the last thing I finished was a paper for school (I graduated last year), because I would be in trouble otherwise. In terms of career, I wanted to work as a writer. It doesn't matter the subject or the company; writing is the only semi-ability I have, but this leads me to another point.
* **I'm too weak to study and practice my craft.** I'm lucky enough to live in a country that have free education (if you're curious, I'm Brazilian), but we have to study really hard to enter in a public university here. And this is where I'm fucked: (1) I have to study a lot to enter in a university and (2) I have to read and write a lot to be a good writer — to be fair, it doesn't have to be a lot, just have to be consistently everyday —, but I can't do either of them. The main reason is: every time I try to get out of my comfort zone and study, I have to stop because I get to the point where I'm almost crying on my desk, so I have to go listen to music or sleep. Why does it happen? I also have two reasons: (1) I compare myself to other people, like my family and my friends that have those clear skins that make me feel like I'm the most worthless piece of garbage on this planet and (2) since I'm gonna be dead very soon (if I follow my plans), why should I even bother studying?
* **I'm so lonely.** This is sort of a teenager problem, but regardless, I feel so, so sad for being lonely. And to make things worse, I compare myself to the people around my age living happily beside their partners. I'm feeling so stupid as I type this, because it's such a generic complaint. But it's real. And probably 10 years from now and I'll be posting a rant on r/ForeverAlone.

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that part of the problem is me, and this is kind of terrifying. I never did anything to be like this, and it is not my fault to be born in this family and have this shitty genetics. But nonetheless, I have to figure out my way out of this shithole.

Acne is treatable, sure, but what am I gonna do after getting rid of this?

The wounds in my mind will stay here forever. I won't ever be normal again.

The future scares the hell out of me. I don't want to live with this inner emptiness, but I can't help it.

At the moment, I'm just applying to job offers that don't require experience to try to gain momentum and create a routine of getting up early and studying before going to work.

I'm confused. I'm so sick and tired of living this meaningless life every day. And the future looks no diferent...

**The answer I'm trying to find is: Am I just playing the victim? If so, what should I do?**

Thank you very, very much for reading it this far. If you don't mind, your thoughts on my post would mean a lot to me. I'll reply as soon as I wake up.

18,"I really don’t know who I am, I just know i don’t want to be me and I don’t want to be alive.

Grew up in an aggressive alcoholic family, where I once flew with my mother for a few months, just to get back to my tyrannical father. There even was once an in incident where he touched me. Shit didn’t get better over the years, I’m 20 and still can’t say a thing.

School just went as usual, typical bullied person, with 1 friend that atleast stayed with me. Bad grades, low attendance, but good enough to get through anything. 

Of course started with cutting and alcohol when i was 16. Drugs started with 18, but managed to mostly get rid of this habit.

Met a girl a year ago, we got really close, like to the point, where I started to talk about how I fell, how I don’t want to be alive, how I don’t enjoy anything in life. Soon she got the one positive to hold on to in live. She just changed Who I am. Suddenly I am not this lost boy, who wants to kill himself when turning 21 anymore. I was catching feelings. She wasn’t. 

All the bad things I always told myself suddenly turned true. The one thing that gave me joy, the will to live, it’s  just gone. 8 more months till I’m 21 to finally have an end to everything. This really calms me because I know soon shit will be over. I don’t see myself being happy or meeting a girl like her again, or this girl catching feeling for me. I’m just done with this world.

20,Boredom is a big part of depression. At least that's how it is for me. Overthinking is also a nightmare. Another reason why I'm here is because I can't seem to get along with a lot of people these days. Everything seems not as fun as it should be these days. So much reduced fun in activities.,02Dec2020,1
21,"Just an update from this previous post that I made a few days ago:

[I should have grown up. Now I am 30 years old with no direction in life and no clear decisions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/k1ig5z/i_should_have_grown_up_now_i_am_30_years_old_with/)

So to summarize: I was supposed to be an Electrical Engineer. Since I sucked at my job, I went freelance. It was good at first but then when COVID came, and I lost all my clients, I got into the dark side of freelancing that it is not a stable job and then worry, panic, anxiety and depression followed through. And with the pandemic on the rise, the job market gets harsher and more difficult.

What caused me to have this feeling is because of:

**Regrets:**

* Me not growing up, basically from what I was when I was a child, I still have the same mindset
* I don’t have any basic house skills, my mom always looks after me
* Me playing video games all day and not upgrading my social skills, and took me long to finish college.
* Me being lazy all my life.
* I should have worked harder at my previous company so that I could have been absorbed from a contract employee, to a regular employee.

**Worries:**

* Since I have no skills and am only good at computers, I might not get any job and then would later be homeless for the rest of my life.
* Since I am old, I might not get any job as younger more capable applicants will be better than me.
* If I am old and of no use to society, I might die of hunger.
* What is worse, I might die because of this heartbreak or all of this happening to me.
* I would slowly see my money dwindle and see my parents age by the minute, when they die, no one will be there for me anymore.
* Me seeing my peers that they are now having stable jobs, stable careers and a good direction in life.
* Me remembering our supervisor from our previous company saying: *If you don’t work, you will die and you will die hungry.*

**Action:**

So I talked with my psychiatrist and told him about my symptoms. He told me that what I was experiencing was a panic attack which is why I am experiencing:

* heartbreak
* palpitation of the heart
* cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation
* loss of appetite
* slight chills

He told me to take Prodin which is an antidepressant for depression and anxiety. Since I also have trouble sleeping because of all the pain, the heartbreak and heart palpitations, He also made me take Rivotril which reduces anxiety or to help induce sleep.

I have been taking the meds for 5 days now, but the heartbreak is still there. The heart palpitations are still there as well and my loss of appetite… and not to mention my slight chills. I always thought that once I would be taking the meds, I would be okay. 

But it's still the same. The same hurt that I feel, the worry, me being unable to enjoy life and not being able to eat. Because of all this worry, all this anxiety and this depression, there are times when I feel like I would faint or collapse because of all the overthinking and all of the regrets and worries that I am feeling.

And just now, I start to burp a lot possibly because of the anxiety. It still feels the same… it didn’t feel like the meds didn’t do any good. Or maybe it really is up to me to cure all this heartbreak, overthinking.

I need someone to talk to. Just to get rid of the pain. Anything.",02Dec2020,1

I really want to like it. I love the holidays and the decorations. I love warm drinks, big blankets, and fuzzy socks. But I hate feeling cold, I hate how my nose gets runny, and its fucking dark all the time. I hate that if I step in the snow my whole leg is cold and wet for hours. 

My depression kicks into overdrive in winter. I even get grumpy about it. I try to focus on the things I love about this time of the year. But  Inevitably it catches up with me.

30,"Hello everyone, before I tell you what I have accomplished yesterday, I would like to provide you some information about me. 
So basically I am a student at a Highschool in Germany. And I am in Junior year I guess- The year before you graduate xD 
And this year everything is sort of important. Your grades and all that, so as you might guess this could cause a lot of pressure on students. Especially during this whole Covid situation, students can feel really pressured and this is an issue which schools should support their students. 

As an option to help students, we've got a more or less ""club"" where a teacher gives you tips on what you could do, to losen up a little bit. Which I think is a really good idea, since we don't have something like school psychologists. 
What we have are teachers you can go to if you need to talk. You are actually gettin' informed who those teachers will be. So basically they are the ""professionals"" you can go to. 
[Side fact: we call them ""Vertrauenslehrer"" translated as Trust-teachers?] 

But actually you can go to every teacher you'd like. They can help you. Maybe they are going to need teachers who are the ""professionals "" at schools, to help you. The point of these ""professionals"" are, if you need support from the teachers side, they'll help you. Even if you feel to much pressured by your school work they'll talk to your class teacher and inform them. What they also offer is, trying to help you find a psychiatrist or maybe give you useful information where you could go. 
(I am writing it very detailed in hope students, go to teachers and talk with them.) 

Day before yesterday, Monday, I had a total burnout, I just layed in my bed crying. Next day Tuesday, everything was normal, until we had Religion classes (it's a normal class you can attend to). 
And I knew we were watching a movie or documentary (more or less) but I didn't know what kind of movie. It was about suicide aid and if it is okay. 

At first I tried to avoid it, we were allowed to leave the room if it gets too much. But I tried to push myself through which did not work. So I left the room with a friend and sat outside of the room and just started crying. Since I didn't want to keep watching I stayed there till the second period was over. 

Since the day before that I've decided to seek help. Since my art teacher was a trust teacher thing- someone- (oof), and I liked her as my teacher I wanted to talk to her. Apparently we didn't had her on Tuesday since she's never there on Tuesdays... so I decided to wait until friday and talk to her after an art lesson. But the movie was really hard to watch and then i talked to her. Because I felt the urge to talk and to seek help. 

She gave me some helpful tips and I am very grateful for that. Tomorrow Imma just go and see a casual doctor to make sure, there is no hormone problem or something like that and just talk to him. 

The reason why I haven't talked to my parents is because I am afraid of how they'd react. Since I am already 16 years old I can seek a councillor by myself. And if I want them to know, I'm going to talk to them. 

What I want to say with this story is, if you feel, that you want to talk to someone do so. It doesn't have to be your parents, even though this would be good to do. But you can also seek help in school. 

And if you need someone to talk to first, a good friend would also be an option. Besides that, if you need someone to talk to right now you can come to me too.

This sounds like it should be in suicide watch but I promise you readers I’m not suicidal (same ex is my reason for living). Anyway, no one noticed me screaming for help, no one noticed me withdrawing from my social groups and social media, no one noticed me completely removing myself from social media.

I am going through a break up and finally I reached a level that I wanted to move on and never look back. I start to accept the reality as it is and really looked beyond the current situation and said to myself:"" whatever I am letting go."" yet, the very next day, I woke up with anxious thoughts. I started to have my panic and intrusive thoughts. I couldn't hold myself. The air was blowing cold, I couldn't feel my feelings and let them just be. I felt it wasn't the right time to meditate. I wasn't in peace at all. A wave of depression hit me so hard. I started to look for my motivational resources. Didn't work out. I felt so down. Depression is not a linear line. Some days are better than others but I really want to move on.",02Dec2020,1
33,"i think help forums are great for a quick vent and for knowing you arent alone in whatever situation youre in but there are problems if you overuse them..

 constantly surrounding yourself in posts with despair just isnt a good thing to do.  itll only make you more sad and you might not even realize it.  

most people with depression or other disorders affecting mood just dont have the best outlook on life.  im a victim of this, i browsed a suicide forum several times a while back to cope but as i started to find myself relating to people more on there i found myself degrading more.  if you are constantly reminded of your mental illness, youll feel the symptoms more. 

maybe its just me, but be careful..  

you are the media you consume- at least for me.  replacing the toxic trash id watch on youtube a year ago with comedy skits really helped me feel better since then.  

i saw someone berating therapists in a post (a support forum subreddit) and a lot of people were agreeing with them.  imo, thats someone without the best outlook on life.  and since others are agreeing with them, im sure that post caused shared anger at life.. and anger leads to stress.  its a downward spiral.

 you can have your opinions and all but id rather constantly be with a therapist thats been extensively trained to help others for years rather than with people on reddit who have the same problems as me and dont know how to cope.

i browsed this forum for a few minutes, this one seems fine, this post mostly applies to r/depression , r/anxiety  etc.",02Dec2020,1

36,"I’ve had depression for long periods of time for almost 5 years now. During quarantine (mid- march 2020) It actually went away. I wasn’t happy or anything but I wasn’t depressed anymore and it felt amazing. I’ve felt it coming back for almost a month now, but I’ve noticed in the past 3 days that it has definitely returned it it’s worst form. I am a High School senior and I have exams next week Wednesday, but I just can’t get myself to actually study and retain ANYTHING. I have ADHD so I’ve always had problems studying, that’s why I had to do my junior year twice. If I fail my senior year I don’t know if I’ll be motivated enough to finish high school so I HAVE to graduate. I know what I want to do with my life but I just feel like I’ll be stuck in high school forever and I’ll never be able to do what I want to do in life. Does anyone have any advice?

39,"During all my life I've always been someone who never talked about her problems, and when I was a kid I didn't use to cry a lot, my friends always tagged me as insensitive, and I didn't like to comfort anyone because it scared me, nowadays I've overcome that fear. My big problem is that I'm not able to talk to anyone about me, and I'm getting even more isolated than ever, It's killing me. A friend of mine got mad with me because of that months ago, despite he forgave me, that hit me hard. Since that day, I'm getting more and more depressed, I hate myself more than ever, and I want to die every day. I've asked myself, how can I solve it? Exactly, opening it up, but I swear I can't. A lot of people wanted to help me, and I just keep denying it over and over, I do even have a psychologist, and I still don't open up. I just keep asking myself, why? why I do this to myself? why? The problem is just me, I blame myself for it, why I can't just talk to somebody? Ask for help? It's not a matter of trust, because I trust some people more than myself. I feel lonely, I know I'm not, but I feel it, why? Because I'm isolated. This got to the point where my friends aren't talking to me like they did, they stopped from inviting me to calls, they don't wait for me. And it's not they fault, it's mine, for isolating. I'm sick of myself.",02Dec2020,1

42,"I feel broken. I'm a 16yo Male.

I met this girl through a friend. She lives in Maryland. Remember this bit. I met her around April during the start of the pandemic. We started talking on the phone starting on FaceTime and Snapchat. At first I really didn’t consider her all that attractive but she considered me attractive. At first we were just friends, friends that would call each other everyday, over quarantine. I want to note that she had a boyfriend at this time. Over the course our friendship she broke up with him and gained a new boyfriend. When this happened I felt pretty hurt. I couldn’t distinguish why but I felt hurt. So I told her I was done talking to her for a bit and it hurt her and she could not tell why. This is when I found I had feelings for her. A week or so later I talked to her again. Fast forward onto school, I’m starting to feel bothered. I realize I want to see this girl. It becomes the only thing I want. Slowly I abandoned my interests in the gym but my performance in school is still well maintained. Now I want to include this piece of knowledge. I want to note, I live in Florida. Now I know what your thinking. She lives in Maryland. I live in Florida. This isn't going to work. Well, I didn't care and so I did what any crazy person would do, I went to see her. I'm not going to note how I managed to go from Maryland to Florida but let's say I pulled some strings and got my way. I can tell you that what I did was quite out of character and this is not something I would have done so the year prior to this happening. When I saw her we hooked up. This is when everything goes to shit. By doing this I think I’m mentally made myself completely vulnerable. As I went back to Florida, I realized in the next week that I could not live without this person and I slogged through the next week with no drive. This happened over a month ago I am now writing because I cannot take it anymore. I’m going crazy. This is the only person I can think about. I know this is of one girl but I feel like I connected with her like no one else. After going back to Florida, I told her I would no longer talk to her and she cried. I feel like it’s affecting me worse than it affected her. I am not someone that talks to the opposite gender to where I have options. The worst part is I look like a mess to others and I feel like a mess and I have no drive to even put on a façade that I can use to get someone that I can use to distract myself from her. I feel like this is the ultimate conundrum. I’m writing this because I felt tempted to add her back on Snapchat and on her story that I accidentally checked, To my luck it was her boyfriends birthday and it was her with him. I have distinguished seeing (Her with her boyfriend) As a trigger. Even though we were ""friends"" It drove me CRAZY. I literally cannot handle the site of seeing her with someone else. I made myself so vulnerable to her because I was able to connect with her like no one else. I am well aware that you are not supposed to put another being rather than yourself on a pedestal but internally I always feel that way because the way she once made me feel. I have no drive for anything, Or anyone but I am trying, I am trying. I attempt to go to the gym and I just slog through the work out. I go to school and I just slog through the classes not paying attention to a damn thing. I go home and I lay down for a few hours before doing an hour of work total. Thank God I got all A’s last quarter so now I can I can get B's And it will average out to A's so I am not affected by this. I don’t know what I’m going to do for the future because I do not see this getting better. I cannot find a way to distract myself from this and I need serious help. I’ve always been kind of a down person but this is really sent me and I really never understood this constant weight that does not ever ever go away. Not like this. Please  help.",02Dec2020,1
43,"im in my senior year of high school. i moved to online school as a result of covid and i've done no school work for the entire term. i managed to bunker down and pass the first term of school, but as of now i have a lot of important core and elective class assignments for this term piling up that I haven't done, and I know if I don't do them I will fail, and I know i'm not going to bring myself to do them. I really don't care enough nor have the energy to write the papers that I have due or to learn the subjects i am taking. I don't really have any idea of a future for myself, which i guess is why i'm ok with being so apathetic. all I really do with my time is stay in my room and listen to music and get drunk and occasionally write poems and short stories. my mom is worried sick about my schooling and it makes me feel really awful about myself but not to the point where I will actually do anything to help. the obvious answer is to just do my work and graduate but i know that's not going to happen. i used to see a therapist but i stopped because i thought that i was creating my own problems and that i would never mature if i used a therapist as a vice. I just feel really isolated and selfish in all this because I know I am not going to do anything to help myself or my mom.",02Dec2020,1
