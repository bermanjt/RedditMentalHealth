0,"Like a flash of light, it suddenly appeared


Knocking the fragile stability I had built for myself


Like a thief at night


It robbed me of my sleep


I spent many nights


Turning and tossing


My mind had been hijacked


My happiness was held in ransom


My past and current failures were displayed for me to see


I was held hostage in my own body


It’s a peculiar feeling when your mind conspires against you.


Sending unwanted thoughts throughout the day.


Whispering secrets in you ear


Telling you lies that you don’t want to hear


The hole gets deeper


The feelings get real


This depression


Is spiraling out of control.",26Feb2020,1
1,Im so unmotivated. All I do is hide my sadness all day and get home and cry. My grades are terrible and Im so stressed. I cant get anything done cause Im so depressed. Im on adhd and depression meds but while they help a little I still cant figure out how to help myself. Im in therapy and stuff so Im not using this as my first source but if anyone has had any similar experiences I would greatly appreciate some advice,26Feb2020,1
2,"I'm 22, italian, I have never achieved anything.
I like so many things, almost everything and I can't decide what to focus on. when I try doing something I get stuck after the first problem (hobby, sport, work, relationships). I hate myself cause I'm not as smart, charismatic, confident and good looking as I would like to be. I'm in analysis since 6 months, I always try to break my limits but I don't see any results, even if I'm inclined in self development and always try different approaches (my analyst says that I'm doing huge steps). the only thing that I have noticed is that my recovery time after a bad episode of deep ""depression"" has been reduced consistently, but I'm still stuck and I see my goals impossible to reach. I live with my parents and we don't have a good relationship. My family is not poor and I Always have been spoiled, I admit that I was not easy to manage so I can understand them in some ways. I lived in Australia for a year working and managing a little company owned by my father. As a person I grew up so much, but when I got home everything came back as before and I became deeply depressed. I am highly ambitious: if I think that I will live a ""normal life""(find a job as employer, getting married, have childrens) everything loses meaning. My dream is to live an intense life, doing everything I want, being anyone I want, and feel satisfaction for things that I made with my own hands. I don't know what to do anymore.

(I have a good introspective side so I can provide ""deeper"" informations if needed)",26Feb2020,1

I am always tired, and couldn’t even watch my own daughter for a time because I was not well. I have been getting better but am feeling tired of fighting. I come home from work and neither my significant other or my daughter are happy to see me. They both seem to rather not have me around and I think maybe they would be better off if I wasn’t. I don’t know why I am still going at this point, maybe I shouldn’t. I’m sorry I had share with someone to atleast lie to myself that I tried",26Feb2020,1
5,"I’m going to spare the long back story of how shit my childhood and General life has been . That’s the story for most of us.  But I swear the older I get the harder life pushes . I’m surrounded by a lot of people who arnt very fond of me , I have friends who are bi polar as hell with me . One day we’re awesome the next they would rather talk to anyone else in the room . I have an intense amount of personal issues I’m trying to work threw in therapy and with myself . But everyone in my support group has nothing to say when I open up . Half of them put distance when I’m talking about my personal issues . My girlfriend is awesome but shes impossible to talk to sometimes . I open up hard to get , which is hard for me . And she’s a brick wall . So there’s this shitty unbalance . 

You couple all that shit with the fact , my heart sucks , Iv has surgery on it , my liver sucks and needs surgery next . I have diabetes and organ issues . My body sucks hard . It likes me about as much as I do . I’m 31 and I’m on 5 medications for life already . Whatever we’re working on it . 

Then the regular life trash . My car sucks always , rents always do , always this surprise bullshit expenses on my 14 a fuckin hour job I have to keep because I need the health insurence there . 

Idk y’all , only blood relative that likes me still is my dad . I’m close to almost no one except like  4 people.  And there are days that the 2 of them I work with are annoyed to high hell with me . 

How’s a person supposed to enjoy life ? Iv been to mental hospitals 3 times in my life because I thought I was gunna end it all and 1 time tried . I fight this stupid brain like its life or death . I try to be self aware and work on my shortcomings. But how can a man , who is so disappointing and annoying to the people even close to him , supposed to wake up every morning . Go to my shit job with my shit body and shirt brain . Work 40 to 50 a week to scrape by . Then go home and underwhelm my wonderful girlfriend and not be able to provide like I should or make myself into the person the people around me deserve .

7,"So, I made my first attempt a month and a half ago, things felt really good the first month after, but the last couple of weeks have been bad. I feel lazy and miserable.

I was wondering what were some small things I can do to make sure I don't go straight into my bed onto social media for hours after school. I have lots of work to catch up on, but I haven't quite got there, what're some things I can do to take my mind off stuff?",26Feb2020,1
8,"I was diagnosed with MDD and I am taking meds but sometimes I feel as if I'm just faking it. That maybe I'm just lazy or trying to make excuses for my failures. I tell people I can't concentrate at work, that sometimes I just can't make myself do things - but maybe it's just me being so useless and stupid that I'm making excuses. I really don't know. I keep worrying about being a burden. And I keep forcing myself to do things. But even chores can be so difficult. And then I start feeling guilty that I'm not even doing simple things and I keep berating myself and I'm just - so tired. 

Last night I even had dreams of countless of people just telling me, ""you're lazy."" And I woke up just being unable to do anything that I took sick leave. 

Is this normal? Is this how depression is? Or is this just me and my crippling low self esteem and/or stupidity. I don't know anymore.",26Feb2020,1
9,"I am 20 years old, and for the first time I am asking for help, because I can no longer continue with myself.  The problem is that I suffer from shyness, lack of self-confidence and introvertedness.  Every day I feel worthless and not worth anything.  I don't have any hobby or anything that makes me happy and something I like to do.  I always find myself different from others and everyone sees me as a stupid, shy , idiot , without any use.  I am not good at mixing with people even though I try to be like that every minute.  My shyness makes me unable to speak in front of anyone for fear of saying something stupid .. And when I gather my courage and talk , I wish I remained silent .. I spend all my days present with people and I am so silent that they forget my presence even ..

10,"I'm a first time poster, I think this might be my first time posting in any board at all.  I am 22 and since I was about 15, I have eaten like garbage and as little as possible to survive.  I am not suicidal and I do not want to be thinner or not get heavier.  I just... don't enjoy food anymore.  Everything tastes like mashed potatoes, to quote that one internet post.  I do occasionally get a craving for chicken or sweet potatoes or something healthy and then I take one bite and feel sick.  I can usually mindlessly put away candy, soda, or small snacks that are unhealthy.  I am so tired of being so thin and eating like crap and I'm scared for my health and worry that my nutrition has something to do with my depression and anxiety.  Until my doctor's appointment, I'd just like the advice of you nice and helpful folks.  Thank you.

12,"So do I just be honest?

My friend recently had two major things happen, and its occuring simultaneously. I haven't known about their thoughts and whatnot, but the last time I saw them they mentioned the two things above.

While I never asked, they did say they thought about ending it (their lives) at some point, she didn't state at the time, but previously when I asked her clarify a phrase she said - - point of no return. And she added if it weren't for her medication and her therapist, she stated she'd be in a darker place.

Anyway, it was the last time I saw her on Thursday. I messaged every other day, so Sat and today, heard back from her Sunday. I knew she was meeting her brother and they had plans to do stuff together but not hearing back today made me kinda anxious, I called but it went to voicemail so I left a message and they picked up midway.

We talked and they seemed fine, she was with her brother/sister-in-law when I called and now I feel both dumb and awkward, since leaving voicemails isn't typical of me. We talked briefly and now I feel like I owe an apology for overreaching and I wonder if I seem like a bad person for jumping to conclusions/worrying.",26Feb2020,1

14,"I’ve been homeless in a car for years. I continually seek help, try to better myself apply for jobs and fail everything. Recently I was called into take a test for an apprenticeship and passed it. I’m now awaiting an interview which I know isn’t going to go over well. I’m in my 30’s the only thing my resume portrays is many long gaps between jobs and the jobs that I did have aren’t long term. They’re going to look at me scratching their heads wondering what the fuck is wrong with this guy — like they always do and I’m passed up on the job. 

I took another test for a different apprenticeship today and will be surprised if I passed the 80% requirement. And yes I studied for it as best I could. 

Frustration is boiling into a rage. I sit alone every. single. day.  And when I try to help myself I just shut down and ended again and again. 

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, mood swings, depression, ADHD and I have severe behavioral issues with other people. I cannot trust anyone and become very hostile but in a very calm manner..if that makes any sense. 

People are often very scared of me and can sense some deep issues. I have been labeled a psychopath by every. single. person. that I have tried to trust and let get close to me. 

I am lonely, tired and sad. I can’t hold down a job because of interpersonal relationships with supervisors or coworkers. 

I have had some very good jobs that people only dream about, $120k+ a year and I loose control of my behavioral issues and get fired. Can you imagine going from homeless to that type of job and then loosing it and going back to homeless again? Can you imagine the frustration?  

People say don’t quit you’ll find the answer someday but I have tried so many times and failed.. that someday is a fantasy. That “someday” is never going to happen.  Trust me I have tried more times that anyone will ever know. 

I haven’t had feelings of wanting to destroy and or hurt myself in a very long time but the amount of frustration is indescribable. I want to scream and destroy everything in my sight. I’m so tired and angry I can barely take it anymore. 

This life is making me want to start doing crime, robbing banks and selling drugs. I can’t handle living in a car watching my life pass me by year after year. 

I have been prescribed all the medications you can think of for treating those “mental illnesses”. I have seen over a dozen psychologists and they have no words for me. I have taken holistic approaches like mushrooms. I have experimented heavily with MDMA. 

At this point I am so destroyed internally there is no coming back. Some people call is PTSD. I don’t know what to call it but being on the streets wrecks for years alone changes you. 

I am trying to hang on but I can barely do it anymore. I have a very dark sinister side to me, I grew up very bad and unhealthy environment. 

I am feeling stronger and stronger justifications as to why I should hide it. With every failed test and door slammed in my face after my wholesome attempts to better myself.  With every single night going to sleep in a car alone and waking up alone. It just reinforces how fucked up this world is and how I mean nothing to anyone.  Unless you have you been there you simply cannot comprehend what that feels like. 

I don’t want to do anything bad but what’s the difference considering everything at this point in my life? My rationale is reaching a point where I’m realizing I’m fucked every way.  My efforts to better myself are shit on by society and other people and I remained completely fucked and suffering. 

Or I go and just do anything I want, “good or bad”. And there’s at least a chance that I’m not fucked anymore... and what’s the worst that can happen?  I’m screwed? Well I already am. So what’s the difference?",26Feb2020,1
15,"I have to unjumble it from my mind so it's gonna be kind of weird. and long. i apologize. im super out of it and feel really bad. 

Stuff just piles up, y'know? You think you finally get to a tolerable level of bullshit that life throws at you, and then more adds up. And like, most of it is stupid shit, but I'm so tired of it, y'know?  For instance, I have one friend. Which, yeah, having a friend is good. But I used to have more. I've tried making more. But people just don't fucking reciprocate and I'm so tired of it. Like, take one friend. she used to invite me to do stuff, her family drove across the country, partially to meet me, partially to look at moving here. But she stopped talking to me. She would respond, but not talk. I was the only one initiating everything. Maybe that's just how it is with most friendships? But that's how it's been with literally all but 1 of mine in the past like 6 years. And I'm so fucking tired of trying. Take another friend. Only other person I know whose aro. Figure that would help us bond even more, we have a ton in common, used to talk a bunch. She doesn't talk much anymore. I've stopped trying to initiate conversation because she barely even goes with that. i've tried making friends with people in my state, both in school and a robotics club. all was shot down. only dude that remotely talks to me, just the one, from dozens i tried with, only does when he's horny. so basically im just there because he wants sex. which is totally a great feeling. And it hurts even more because I invited her to a discord I found that has a couple aro people in it, and she instantly started talking to everyone and initiating conversation. And Im just sitting here like what the fuck. like she acts like we're friends or shit, as does the other one, but then they both just do nothing to act like it. and its a stupid thing to feel like shit over but im a people person, i love talking to people, im just happier with friends.

and watching all of my fucking friends, including my best friend just fucking ditch me over and over. im so tired of it. literally my only friend i met through my ex best friend. we are awkward about talking because anxiety but she at least fucking tries. but she's also busy most the time. but even so she told me they broke up. before my then best friend did. weeks before he did. and like. i used to think that, yknow, its just gotta be this person. im getting the odd apples. but its happening with mother.fucking.every.one. the one best friend who visited me has a group of friends she actively talks to and asks to play with -- i know because she invited me to the discord for some goddamned reason, for me to basically be ignored every time i try and talk. like its gotta be me, right? i don't know what im doing wrong? do i complain to much? i do feel like i bitch about everything, like look at this. im bitching because some people dont like me.

i dunno, its just so tiring. im so tired, i just want friends. i want people i can laugh with. i haven't actually laughed in 3 god damned years. like ill have some amusement and ill kinda fake laugh and shit for my parents but

i just don't find humor in anything like i do with friends, and it just grows worse and worse

probably depression

that'd do it and its a stupid thing to be so bent up about   


and like the people who don't talk to me are so successful in shit too and like, if they do talk to me that's what for. or used to be. and thats fun because like. i have no plans. no career path that i want to do that i also can do. becuase i have to have a desk job. and all of them make me almost fear being alive because what the fuck is the purpose of sitting behind a desk doing nothing for 50 years and then dying? even if i wanted to, i can't afford college. all the people i know are going to college and doing shit and fucking everything else and. i can't afford college. can't afford a car. cant afford the test for my license. have an overbalance on my bank i can't really pay right not. can't find a job. i just feel like a waste of space yknow? im so tired of it&gt;

like nobody likes me and i have nothing i do in life, its stupid lol

&amp;#x200B;

also, not being able to keep friends worries me as i am aromantic so if i can't keep friends while not including that, how the fuck will it be if i try that?   


i had been going to a therapist but she was shit. she was the only one i could see too, in my current situation, so while any recommendation of that is valid, i cant see any other ones right now, sadly.

17,"So I realized that my laziness, lack of motivation, lack of desire to interact with people, anxiety, etc. are signs of depression. I started to analyze my life and think about how I used to be full of life and had desire to live compared to my life now and I just wish I could go back. So I came to the conclusion that the only logical explanation is that I might be depressed. 
I’m a single college student, with a family that loves me and supports me yet I find myself not wanting to do shit in life. Most of the things I do are because I feel obligated to and not because I want to, even though I once wanted to. 
Sometimes I think to myself that it’s because I know I can rely on family that I let myself do this. 
But who would want to really be down and lazy like this all the time. Now I know I used to not be like this and my mom didn’t raise me like this. But yeaaa its what I am now and idk how to overcome it. Also I’m new on reddit so I’m not too sure how to work it yet.",26Feb2020,1

20,"My family is toxic and abusive. I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

27,"My fiance is showing most of the signs of clinical depression, and I don't know how to help and support her without being patronizing or just an asshole, which I definitely don't want. 

Some backstory:  We own a house together, and have 2 dogs.  I can just squeak by all of our expenses on my own, which is good, cuz she was out of work for close to 6 months.  Now she has a part time job, but its nothing special, and not something she is thrilled with.  Also, we are starting to do the planning for our wedding.  I  know that she is feeling a bit useless and unaccomplished, with a birthday just passing, and that she doesn't have a career at 24.  Any of our joint accomplishments (extensive travel, avid hikers, buying a house, having 2 dogs, etc) she ascribes entirely to me (which is utter bullshit, she got me the connections that got me the job I have now)

As for myself, the pressure from work has been crazy lately, and I know that I have been distant and preoccupied because of it.  Concurrent with that, she seems to be sliding further and further downhill.  She isn't exercising any more, is putting off chores indefinitely (we split those, btw), and has less and less impulse control with eating and drinking.  

last night I came home from another long stressful day of work, to find that she hadn't made the dinner we had planned that morning, or done anything else that she had put on her to do list, and instead drank a bottle and a half of wine and ate a whole loaf of bread.  As soon as I got home, she went to bed and passed out in the pile of laundry she has just started folding.  

If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't think much of it.  Bad day at work, bad news from family, whatever.   But it's becoming a pattern that has been getting worse for a while.  I asked her this morning as gently as I could what prompted it, and she said nothing, and that she was fine.

I'll be honest, right now I'm pretty frustrated and irritable about the situation.  But none of that helps me help her, and that's what I really want to do.  It would be so easy to vent, about how annoying it is to have to take care of her any time we go out for drinks, cuz i am always the one to stop so we can drive home.  Or how I can't relax at all when I come home, because I have to dive in and pick up her slack on house cleaning, or dinner, or whatever.  Or how I am so stressed out right now that I can't even get the tiniest bit excited about any of the things we have looked at for our upcoming wedding.

In this video we will look at the age-old subject, what is the meaning of life? Where can we find happiness? Is meditation the key?

I was inspired to make this video following a Ted Talks conversation.

After watching a TED TALK about a Mars Mission I then commented and this started a short conversation about happiness and what is a meaningful action and what is it we can do to find meaning in our life.

If there were such things as Aliens, would they have the answer to our question: How Can We Be Happy? Maybe we already have the answer….

35,"My girlfriend (27) has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. 

These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and it's beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since he's moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since he's been admitted her depression has crept up on her. She's doesn't want to do anything but sleep and cry. I'm always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that I'm not overbearing on her. Lately she's been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isn't the first time she's said something along these lines. She's never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. She's been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but it's only been her 3rd session, and she hasn't completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I haven't been giving her the ""attention she needs""despite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

I’ve been through trauma, deaths of friends, been abandoned by people I loved. I have to deal with living with parents who don’t accept me for being gay. It’s all just so much. Way too much for one person to bear. Like a heavy weight on my chest, holding me down, restricting my breathing. As if any day now, my ribcage will splinter under the weight and pierce my heart.

I have a part time job, but I don't like it. I only have it because I work through family, It's not really a ""real"" job. 

I dont know what to do with my life and I just want it to end already.",26Feb2020,1
42,"i’m just tired. i’m tired of always being tired for no reason. i’m tired of my body always feeling weighed down by some invisible force. i’m tired of wanting to do things, praying and crying for even just a PINCH of energy to get up, only to never leave my bed. 

It genuinely feels like my battery has died and no amount of sleep can charge me. 

I drank some coffee, took a Vyvanse and some Adderall this morning hoping to god it would wake me up. Nothing changed. Even stimulants don’t work for me! I’m done for. 

I have so much to do but no energy to do it. I want to die please someone make it end :(",26Feb2020,1
44,"I'm depressed and going through a particularly rough time at the moment. I feel so lonely I ache. I distract myself and watch netflix, I try and reach out to people but don't get much back, I pet my dog, I have volunteered in the past but I'm not up for that at the moment, I go for walks but nothing is helping at the moment. What do I do?   
I'm currently coming off medication as it wasn't helping so I feel worse then usual for the time being (to be expected).  
 I just feel like crying all the time, I feel like I have a big whole in my heart that's empty and nothing comes close to filling it and I don't know what to do anymore.",26Feb2020,1
45,"Hey, guys, first time posting. Sorry for any rambling or stuff of the sort.


I've been dealing with depression for around a decade, maybe even earlier but who knows. All these years I've managed to get by with no therapy or medications. I also thought I had it under control but I see now that it was a lie I was telling myself.


My depression has affected my life so negatively in recent years, so much so that I can't see how to climb up again. I was so ignorant to the ground that was slowly caving beneath me. But now, I'm realizing my mistake and I want to seek help. But even if I were to seek help, my life is not salvageable at this point. Sure, you managed to put out the fire but the damage is done. Nothing what was once could be saved. 


I want to talk to my mother about seeking therapy and the emotional struggles I've been through, but she won't understand. I know she won't because a few years back, I decided to open up and all she had to say is that ""she had it worse"". Mom, this isn't a contest! Our pain is unique to all of us and how it affects us is also different! I wish she'd be there for me but I know she won't. 


I have an older sister but my relationship with her is strained but healing. Not enough to confide in her at least. My dad lives in another country but he is actually emotionally tuned in unlike my mom and sis. I went to visit him over the winter and seeing him so worried for me made me feel all types of emotions. When he was still living with us, he actually supported my love for drawing and offered to pay for drawing classes. I was a stupid, ignorant kid back then and refused. When I visited him, he actually remembered I like drawing and asked whether I still draw. I replied that I didn't. He asked why and I just answered that I no longer had interest in it (not a total lie since I no longer have the energy for it). He replied that it was a shame and that if I had someone supporting me, I wouldn't have given up on it. Guys, you have no idea how much I wanted to cry at that point. I wonder if my life would've turned out differently if my dad was the one to stay instead of my mother. 

I've been struggling alone all these years. I just want a hug and for someone to say that everything is going to be okay. But i have no such person in my immediate life; no family, no friends, nothing. sometime i wonder if life is worth living. the only thing keeping me alive is a moblie game. i mean how sad is that where the only solace i have is a game? I want to get out of this hole and seek help and live life but at this point, i feel like only a miracle would get me out.


Sorry for long txt post. If you had the time to read my long post, thank you. And I'll also gladly hear your own thoughts as well (:",26Feb2020,1
47,"How does anyone get through this? Is there anyone who has truly got better?

I've been struggling with depression more recently and I don't know how anyone does this. 

How do you deal with all of this? Has anyone that's struggled with this and honestly got better? What did you do? 

I know my job is a big part of why I'm so miserable and I'm looking to change that. I'm also planning to go back to therapy and see a new psychiatrist and I'm gonna discuss getting on medication with them. 

What else can I do? I honestly want to know what helps and how I can get better.",26Feb2020,1
48,Does anyone ever feel so depressed they can’t form proper thoughts disabling the ability to explain to anyone fully why you feel that way? it’s as if there’s so many contributing factors that my brain is so overwhelmed my thoughts and just a mixed up mess of all the depressing things all at once and I can’t hold onto any one thought train for longer then a few seconds so I’m left utterly debilitated and feel completely disabled,26Feb2020,1
49,It's going bite me in the ass soon.. I barley have money and I can't get up for work.... I feel like I've given up.... I don't have It in me anymore.... To keep going..... I can't hold on I'm dying man someone help,26Feb2020,1
50,"This is a long winded story but it's what im struggling with sorry. Hi im 33(M). Last year i was diagnosed with bi polar, manic depression and anxiety. As far back as i can remember I've never really felt ""good"". I have ever only had 2 friends all my life becausewe live within walking distance of each other. I recently had a bad falling out with friend #1 because basically i realized what kind of person they really were and i had to let them go for my own mental health. Friend #2 we have always been close as well but as time has gone on they grew up, moved away, got a house, married, kids job and such and we might talk once every 3 months if that. Now me. I was never a social person even in school I was only friends with people because I seen them every day and i never fit in anywhere, not even with the out sider niche. After graduation is when the economy took a dive and to help support my family i went directly into trade work. For almost 15 years work has been my life. I work come home sleep. Last year i had the mother of all mental break downs, i spent my entire life savings on a POS rv, my friend #1  and his then girlfriend were moving cross country for whatever reason and i was like let me take you in my rv. So after a month on the road we make it literally to the otherside of the country and i run out of money. Now on top of a mid life crisis im in full blown panic, flat broke and the depression kicks in and things get dark from there. This is when friend #1 began to show his true nature. I started selling all my stuff, felt like the most worthless thing on the planet, stopped eating, you get where this was going. Well if im grateful for anything in my life it's a caring and close family. My family noticed the red flags immediately and my uncle who is like an older brother to me flew across country grabbed me and shoved as much stuff as i had left it in my car and drove me back to my home state. I still feel like i abandoned my friend(s?) on the otherside of the country but my family did give them a decent amount of money for them to get settled. I don't  know it still bugs me but moving on. That's when it became clear that i had been suffering from severe depression and mood swings for apparently a loooong time. After a year of treatment i was able to go back to work last November with minimal panic attacks and anxiety. Im with the same company i explainedmy situationand they were willing compromisewith me on my schedule. However I have come to the realization that while i worked for so long none stop the world has past me by. I have no friends, ive never had a girlfriend or been on a date, i would spend my free time in the past playing video games as an excape from realty but even now the people who i use to play with have moved on with life and i very often find myself alone. The loneliness is so bad it is causing physical pain. Like 2 fingers being pushed hard into my guts just under my sternum. I have no social skills, even at work i would wear a mask so people didn't know what was going on in my life. I would just smile and nod until I could escape the interaction. I did this for 20+ years of life and now that i have clarity (mostly) and tell coworkers what was really going on. However i find i have no clue how to be a person. Im 33 and i have zero social skills (of any kind), hobbies, friends, intrest, i live with my parents having to rebuild a life in which i never felt alive. I have nothing to build on. Everywhere i look for advice starts off with "" Find something that you enjoy doing"" ""people that have common interests"" exept i don't know what i enjoy. Or how to find something to enjoy. I dare say that i don't know what joy feels like so how would I know if I did enjoy something. I have no interest. Work was my life/hobby/ subject of conversation, literally the only ""world"" ive known was the job. What do i do? Video games where and still kinda are my escape from the mundane until i figureout what to do. I want to do things. I want to move out, have a girlfriend or just go on a date but i have no clue how to talk to women without ""the mask"" i have nothing in my past thats interesting. I went to school then I started working. I'm actually terrified of to talk to women. Im thinking about therapy but I don't know how to small talk or carry a conversation beyond. Hi..... im good how are you?.... thats good.... yea wether is crazy, Ok bye. I feel humiliated and embarrassed by how much of a loser i am. My family is close but they won't be here forever. What am i supposed to do? This is agony and i don't wish it on anyone. Can anyone relate to having absolutely no clue what to do or how to start a life from scratch because I desperately need advice.",26Feb2020,1
51,"I have to go to the dentists early March. I have my first cavity.. my first ever cavity. It’s my last tooth in the back, the rest of my teeth are remarkably straight but it goes outwards and I can’t reach it with a toothbrush hardly. So I got a cavity, i can see it. It’s a hole. 

I could blame it on me not being able to reach it but I really just don’t brush my teeth. My major depression is so bad, I don’t hardly ever brush my teeth. Maybe once a month if that. I hardly shower anymore. Probably once every two weeks, even then I don’t have the energy to shower anymore. Most of the time I just lay in the tub, then scrub my armpits, butt and private parts. That’s it. I don’t have the energy to scrub anywhere else. It’s gotten bad, now when I lay in the tub it gets a kind of greyish color and I can literally scrape the build up of dead skin off. Am I grossing you out enough yet? This is my life.. not much of one that is. I lay in bed all day everyday.. once in a great while I’ll go to the living room and work on art. I’m not living. I’m just here. I’m beyond helping myself, I need somebody to save me.",26Feb2020,1
