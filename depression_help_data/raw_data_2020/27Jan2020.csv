0,"Hello all. So, I have depression and anxiety myself, but I'm doing quite well actually. I'm wondering about how to advise my boyfriend on something though. We've been dating for about a year now, and the whole time he's had issues with depression/anxiety. Not terribly severe--but the things he says definitely all sound very much like depression/anxiety (feeling a lot of self hatred at times, not feeling good enough, having days where getting out of bed is hard emotionally and he can't bring himself to do much, feeling separated from people around him, feeling to anxious to leave the house sometimes and then getting angry at himself about it) and he agrees, although he's never been ""officially diagnosed"" despite being recommended to therapy for a large portion of his adult life and being offered depression medication at one point by a doctor (although the doctor said ""we can give you this, but really you should just see a therapist"").   


I and other friends of his who have depression or similar mental illnesses have suggested he try medication, but obviously as doctors (by which I mean mostly therapists and one recent doctor, although I don't fully trust that doctor's opinion because we're in a country that has a pretty bad track record for actually recognizing and treating mental illnesses as an actual health issue) haven't really recommended it to him and have just pushed therapy (which he has done repeatedly over the years, though he's currently between therapists because of moving) he hasn't tried any medicine. I know he's not anywhere near as severe as I was when I started medication--I was at the point where all I could do was sleep because I didn't want to be awake, I cried so much and literally couldn't stop so I ended up missed college classes crying in my dorm room, barely anything brought me pleasure and even when it did it was in very small doses--but knowing that he's been working on this for so long and still feels like this a lot makes me so sad to see. If, even with therapy for multiple years in the past, he still feels depressed, wouldn't he be a good candidate for medication? I'm pretty confused as to why doctors haven't suggested medication much yet. Like, not even an as needed anxiety thing for times when he starts clamming up and can't interact with people much because of anxiety or feels like leaving the house is extremely stressful.

I don't know if I should just assume that these therapists and doctors know best, which is what I've been doing because they are trained professionals, or if I should suggest that he maybe pushes them a little bit to look at some options for medicine, if he decides he would want to try it, since he is open to the idea. Like, if it was a short term thing I wouldn't question it, but it's persisted for years from what he tells me, and to me that sounds like something medication might help for since it doesn't appear to be a temporary/situational thing.",27Jan2020,1
1,"I feel like something is wrong with me. Whether it is real life or online, everyone pushes me to the side whenever anyone else shows up. They value everything about these people and eventually it just feels like I am forgotten. I just want a friend who cares. I am sick of feeling so alone.",27Jan2020,1
2,"my stepmom passed a few months ago and I'm having a really hard time staying afloat, I deal with depression all the time but now I just feel like shit whenever I'm alone with my thoughts and not high.. I'm being careful with how much weed I use, rn it's only like 1-2 times a week but it's so tempting to just be stoned all the time cuz then I won't be sad and anxious. I'm pretty suicidal but I know I won't do anything stupid. I have my 2 fiancees that are honestly doing a really good job at keeping me from spiraling too far off course. I'm just fucking frustrated, I wanna stop being so mopey and anxious whenever I'm alone with my thoughts for me than a few minutes. it sucks and I just wanna be less sad",27Jan2020,1
3,"I've been on Vilazodone for about 15 months. I've been having really severe short-term memory and attention issues. Misplacing stuff, forgetting what I'm doing mid-task, etc. I still have recollection of longer term memories, but I'm starting to feel senile or something. Will be talking to my doc about it(missed my appointment, because surprise, forgot about it).  Has anyone dealt with this side effect? Was there a workable ""cure', ie piracetam, ginkgo, meditation, etc?",27Jan2020,1

6,"It hasnt gotten easier. I enjoy typing my thoughts out, I imagine you there, in my head, dressed in your dressing gown, you'll stroke my hair and tell me it's okay. I miss that, I miss you. 

I'm in turmoil, turning back to old vices for comfort and numbness. I cant help myself, I dont want to feel this way anymore, is this what they meant when said hell on earth? 

I haven't really accepted your death, it's not really sunk in per say, it feels like more of an idea, a thought or a dream and I wish it was just that.

I can't keep myself together, I feel like a mirror, who's glass has broken into a billion shards, each day a few fall off the frame, to the ground, I try to pick them up but my hands just go right through them. I cried Friday, in work. For a brief moment, I smelt you and it broke me. Like a sledgehammer to the groin. 

You have and will be always be the absolute greatest thing to ever happen to me in this horrible existence I'm now forced to suffer alone. 

I love you, I'll always love you P.

7,"So, I’m a 15 year old suffering with depression. My counselor told my parents I have depression or however that would work. Lately things have just haven’t been the best for me. For the past few months, I’ve been thinking about taking my own life.. I tried to do it once by taking a bunch of pills. I don’t know why but it did nothing.. I somehow didn’t overdose. Now, things are getting the better of me but I don’t even know what “things” are at this point. I’ve tried talking to people but I just don’t tell them about how I’m feeling.. I just want to have this darkness hanging over me constantly and keeping me from doing the things I want..

(excuse me if I made any grammatical mistakes)",27Jan2020,1
8,"Hi all! I’m new to the thread and I came here to see if anyone can relate to my story, or if anyone can provide insight as to how I can go about handling everything correctly. Im a almost 22 year old female in love with a 23 year old tortured soul. As dramatic as that sounds, that’s how it’s been for the past year and some months. Before getting into our relationship, I was unaware of his depression, he didn’t tell me the extent of it for fear that I would run off. I haven’t. And I won’t. In fact, for the better part of our relationship he expressed that I HELPED his depression, I took him out of him mind, of our the darkest parts of him that wouldn’t let him function. And I was proud of myself for doing so actually. Then came the worst year of my life, with school and work and family all caving in on itself, I turned to him for support. Like an angel, he was there when I needed him. Then things got bad, I couldn’t be the light that kept his depression away during the tougher times, I didn’t have any light myself, this caused us to not be able to go to each other in our darkest times. His depression got worse, I only felt more and more alone. Things got worse before they got better. I’ve been growing, bettering my situation. I have found the light in myself finally, and now I want to help him find his. Sometimes we can be really great together, only for something to happen in which he says something to upset me or disappoints me in some fashion and things get lost in translation and we try to talk it out .. but it’s too late .. the depression hits him. The man I love is gone, and what’s replaced him is the worst thoughts, the worst things to come out of his mouth. What causes it to come back and hit him hard is a situation that he is unable to fix in the moment, and my own feelings getting the better of me and me basically popping off. See, he can be the best man in the world for maybe a week straight, bring me lunch, say all the right things, the there for me morning and night. But when we go through one of our rough patches, that man is gone. And the fact that he can’t fix it in the moment makes him go so far from me that I don’t know how to bring him back. To the extent where he tells me he wants to be alone, just alone. And it’s happened before, and I’ve been the one to guide him out, and he’s told me how grateful he is for it, how grateful he is that I stick by him. But sometimes the depression makes him say the most awful things, and it affects me. It’s like from one day to the next he’s a different person. I’ve never met anyone like him, as amazing as him, yet also with this illness that he is suffering from. I’ve found that music helps, affection as he is slipping helps, but sometimes I’m not even capable of that myself. And that’s when things get really bad. How can I help him when he’s so far gone ? It can last for about a week before I see the man I love back in his eyes. I know I should give it time, but I’d like to know if anyone who’s currently with the same thing can shine a light on how to go about things when we’re at this point. Whatever disagreement we had is in the past, I told him it’s not worth seeing him like this. My priority is to help him come back to me, because I know that it doesn’t let him do that on his own. Sorry for the long post but thanks for reading :)

Tl;dr : loml has depression, sometimes triggered really bad when our relationship gets rocky, how can I help without him telling me there isn’t anything I can do. How can I get to the him that’s trapped inside the darkness ? The emptyness ? 

Thanks again !!",27Jan2020,1

10,"I am pretty sure I’ve been depressed for a while now, maybe a couple years or more. It seems to be getting worse now and the spates of motivation are getting fewer and shorter. Sometimes when I’m just sitting I’ll be just struck with fear for a few minutes and otherwise the thoughts of pointlessness and everything will always be at the back of my mind. I’m functional and everything, though. I shower every day, keep up with homework, look presentable etc but the thoughts are always there and it’s just eating at me. I’ve been considering getting professional help or something which medication would probably come with but I don’t know if it’s a good idea. I like dealing with things on my own and most of all I don’t want people feeling bad for me because it annoys me a lot. Plus it costs money and time. Also, I want to apply to a military academy and I know there are rules about the US military and medication, so is it worth going this route? Is it possible to deal with it by myself, and if so, how?",27Jan2020,1
11,"I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I don’t know how much it would cost as I’m not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. 

I overthink everything. I think that’s a main reason why I self-deprecate. Because of that my self-esteem has dropped over the years that I feel I can’t do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I don’t think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and ‘mentor’ are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... it’s hard to imagine teaching children anymore. 

I’ve cut down on using instagram because I know it won’t do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts.

I’ve been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustrates/saddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says she’s a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I don’t want to bother her with my problems.

Well I guess I’ll just share these. Sorry if it’s really unorganised, I just needed to get some things out before I have a breakdown.",27Jan2020,1
12,My anxiety has been absolutely overwhelming for the last couple of weeks. I'm barely functioning. I don't know what to do anymore. I tired reaching out to a friend today and never really got a response back. It was my biological dad's birthday a few weeks ago which always sets my anxiety off but this year has been worse. I haven't been able to get it under control. I've having anxiety attacks in the bathroom at work. I've started self harming again. I'm getting desperate.,27Jan2020,1
13,"I (M) got out of a very toxic relationship in October last year, I was not happy in the relationship for 5 months but my fear of being lonley again kept me in and allowec myself to get mistreated and emotionally fucked with and become emotionally drained.

I was diagnosed with PTSD beforehand for other reasons but never really felt any symptoms of it until during the relationship and after it. It was partially my fault for staying even when I knew what was going on was wrong and each day I put on a fake smile for my ex and bullied myself into believing I was happy living in denial that I wasn't.

My ex committed 3 to 4 cases of infedility (cheating, probably spelt that wrong) and broke up with me 6 times and then came back saying she missed me and that she was sorry she hurt me and that she wouldn't do it again. I knew she would do it again and again and again. Judge me all you want I know I was an idiot but I hated the idea of being all alone again so I always went back telling her I belived her (I didn't).

I tried to be the most emotionally supportive boyfriend I could and the times I tried to express to her my feelings she always got stressed and distant with me which spiked a now current fear of people getting distant with me. I won't lie going through old messages sometimes she was rightfully stressed but I eventually gave up expressing any feelings of sadness after she broke up with me because I was to stressful.

I never expressed discontent or sadness let alone any anxiety I focused on her problems and was there whenever she needed me, I never self-harmed really but she did, I waz playing video games one night and she sent me a snap of what looked like her arm absolutely covered in razor cuts about what I estimated about 27 to 30 cuts and I panicked and tried calling her to make sure she wasn't trying to kill herself and messaged her and she got distant and wouldn't tell me anything and said she would tell me in a bit and I freaked out, thankfully they were on her thigh but at the time I thought it was her arm.

I remember the amount of blood and all the cuts, her thigh was covered in blood. I tried talking to her about it a few days later and she got mad at me because she felt insecure about what she did and told me to leave her alone. I tried to get her professional help on multiple occasions but she was always afraid and I felt lost on what to do. I had MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), Anxiety, and PTSD and I had a mental breakdown on my birthday just wishing all the emotional pain to end.

On our final breakup she called me an asshole for calling her out on the stuff she did to me and said that she should have blocked me for the things I said on how I called her emotionally manipulative among other stuff and that she felt very hurt about what I said. 

Now that the relationship is over I just have flashbacks of everything that happened in that relationship I broke down twice in a bathroom and I have nightmares about everything and feel everything I felt in the flashbacks and nightmares and I am just exhausted and tired and find it hard to trust people after everything but I am trying to.

I don't miss her but I just want a normal relationship where I am not constantly worried all the time and unhappy.

If you managed to read all of this you are a fucking trooper and applaud you 👏 thank you for reading this :) respind if you please :)

Btw I am improving somewhat with the help of my therapist and friends and I know I was just dealt a bad card here.",27Jan2020,1
14,"Background- I’m currently the sickest I’ve ever been. I have random side of effects of withdrawal from Effexor. I hated that idea of switching all my meds as the solution. I’m now also taking Lexapro. The totals: Wellbutrin 100mg twice daily, Effexor 75mg three times a day (this is what she wants to get rid of), Lamictal 100mg twice daily, Ativan as needed and trazodone to sleep. 

I didn’t like the idea of messing with my system of meds  and she going to want to keep playing with the meds which wreaks havoc on my brain. I just really need some immediate results. I can’t keep waiting to get the care I need. 

Effexor withdrawals are supposed to be the worst. And she was like you’ll be off it in 3 weeks. I wanted to scream. I need help now. I don’t need the extra horror of withdrawals. 

Before ECT all the other treatments have had to failed... but just the prospect of weighting so long for a treatment that is virtually guaranteed. My body is very delicate and sensitive... I don’t think it can handle much more.

I'm(M24) in love with this (F24)I met back in September and have told her that I love her more than a friend as well as wanting more. She didn't say she loved me back and made it semi clear she doesnt want anything more. Yet constantly brings up the possibility of sex and is usually all over me physically when we see each other.

Which gives me possible hope of her wanting more. But at times it's like she throws it in my face she doesn't want anything more than what we have. She'll bring up kids or having a future husband then say ""I havent met anyone I want kids with"" or ""There's no one I truly love that I'd want a life with."" Like today she brought up sex again by saying she didnt want her first time with me to be anything but special.

22,"**\[I moved this from a different sub-Reddit\]** Hi, this is my first post on Reddit ever. I made this account so no one could trace it back to me in real life and to exclusively post here because I do not want anyone in my real life to worry about me. See, I have been chronically depressed for years now. I was diagnosed back in my last year of middle school, I am a freshman in college now. I was never really supported by my family when we found out because they are Christian(not really sure what sect anymore) and follow the bible in a very cult like manner. I was just told that I could pray the pain away and my life would just get better and for a short time I believed it but nothing got better. I had very personal problems with my parents which resulted in a lost of mistrusted and emotional abuse. (not to mention physical abuse as a child before age 13) I would get called spoiled, retarded, ungrateful, over dramatic. I wasn't allowed to cry or have opinions. I couldn't question what they said or did or else. I was spanked up until 13 as discipline but had things throw at my head, been choked, punched, had a knife head to my throat once, and had to eat soap until 16. They justified all this by basically saying that I was a little shit (granted I was) and they only punished me because they loved me so much. Around age 17, I started standing up for myself which started with me admitting that I was an atheist which resulted with my mother crying violently and screaming at me to get the car while to speeds close to cliffs and and trees. She was so angry that I thought she was going kill me and her at the same time. She didn't but ended it all with screaming at me, ""Why do you hate me?!"". My father on the other hand made my feel bad by writing me a letter describing the times he had fucked up with me and blamed himself for my lack of belief. **\[TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT\]** I don't want to talk about this too much because it still hurts me, but I was also raped at 17 was victim blamed by my own mother. I can not explain how much that hurt me and I still am learning to cope with that. Fast forward, I am now 18 and am struggling to hold myself. I now have a loving boyfriend who lives quite few states away (he knows about my episodes and my toxic family and is very supportive) and I don't want him to know that I've been struggling with my mental health more than usual. I am ashamed to admit but I wrote a suicide note tonight and thought about doing it while he slept on call with me. I feel so bad for even just thinking about it. I already hate that I place so much stress on him already and don't want him to worry about me. Not like he can really do anything right now to stop me and I don't want him to feel like its all in his hands. I don't know what to do. I can't do therapy because my parents will find out and take me off the insurance and I don't have money to spend since I am college student. Not to mention, mental health is not so great in the bible belt. I don't even know if anyone will read this or even care. I don't even know what advice I need right now, but if anything this will be the only trace I will leave of my suicidal thoughts.",27Jan2020,1

24," I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past two years. I became a jerk because of it and my ex left me 6 months ago but she wasn't sure. We haven't seen each other in person since then (it was a long distance relationship, so that was expected).

I tried to become a better person, I started therapy and meds (Lexapro 2 weeks ago). But two days ago she sent me an email telling me she doesn't love me anymore, that she's happy without me as a partner. She also told me to stop sending her messages until I move on, that our relationship is over, but she would like to be friends some day. She sounded so condescending and harsh, she also had depression and anxiety, but she started getting better before leaving me. My hope is gone, she forgot about me so quickly now that she's not depressed when a year ago she told me she could love me forever... I doesn't matter anymore. She sees me as a problem in her past.

I'm so hurt and so desperate rn... I'm stuck with her memories and it's all my fault. 6 months like this. I don't deserve anyone. I'm so tired of this feelings, I can't enjoy life anymore and I'm sure my friends are tired of me being sad. I don't deserve them either. I want to kill myself or make it stop.

27,"I don't know, maybe I'm being pathetic. But things do get to me.

It started the moment I woke up. I go on twitter and see this horrible news that one of the famous basketball icons, Kobe Bryant was gone. What shattered my heart was that his daughter had died with him. I never really liked basketball that much but I was shocked when tears started to roll down my face.

I slept at 4AM and woke up at around 8:30AM to get ready for school. I had exams today and I guess I tried my best to be prepared for it. 

When I took the exam, the two proctors were whispering to one another. I found out later on that they were gossiping about how they thought my classmate's boyfriend was ugly, which had ticked me off btw, they were both fresh graduates and were waiting to pass the teachers licensing exam, so I found that despicable. Anyway, it really annoyed me and I found myself shushing them, because I couldn't focus. Then the proctor just smiled at me and sarcastically said ""If I'm making too much noise for you, then please leave the classroom so you can take the exam in peace."" It irritated me to my core, so I said ""fuck it"" and wrote whatever the fuck I want on that piece of paper.

In the afternoon, I kinda skipped class with my best friend to grab milkteas. I had just found out that she has this heart disease and it's keeping me on edge; so I want to spend as much time with her as possible before her operation.

We just got back and headed to the library. I remembered I had forgotten to bring ""professional"" clothes for our film. So I told my other ""best friend"" that I had forgotten it. But she cut me off before finishing my sentence by yelling ""shut up a second"". That had really ticked me off. After that, I remained quiet, scrolling on my phone.

After that, the girl that had cut me off half sentence said ""hey, did you guys remember to bring clothes today"" and I answered ""I tried to tell you but you cu-"" ""why the fuck would you tell me? Do I seem like the leader or something"" she cut me off the second time. This time, it really pissed me off. She had done this before and I always made sure to stay quiet as to not make another fuss. I don't like conflicts because I can be quite the debater. 

She proceeded to spit out sarcastic remarks in front of our classmates in order to embarrass me further, I guess. So, I just stepped out and went to our office.

Now, I'm writing this with a really heavy feeling in my chest. I may just be pitying myself and being pathetic but I just feeĺ sucky that I don't want to tell any of my friends how I really feel right now. I guess, having strangers read this and not judge you is better for me. What my friend said to me really just hurt me. But I don't want to admit that to anyone that knows me personally.

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this post. Knowing someone knows how I feel is comfort enough.",27Jan2020,1

I kicked a hole in the wall because my dad had 2 lunar new year party’s and both of them I was not able to be down stairs one because I was sick the second I had to baby sit. I’ve been fighting some sickness for like a week and I think it’s something to do with med changes. I’m sick right now but my mom is getting mad and wants to send me to a boarding school and I really don’t like that idea.

so my whole life my dads never been there he’s always on business trips one time he took 3 week vacation in China while we had to stick through the school year with my mom who also works 9-5 . My older brother loves to pick on me he’s 15 I’m 13  he really hates me. He gave me a birthday present in 2018 just finished building it yesterday and stole something of mine as a “fee” basically making me pay for my own present and I had no choice as he had already started modifying it.

29,"It's been 7 months since my ex broke up with me. We only dated for a year but we've had a long history before that. It's complicated so I won't get into it too much. Just know we were in and out of each others lives a few times over the past 10 years, she's had numerous partners in those years and I've had a small handful to give a little context I guess. We only gave s relationship between us a go in 2018 and it went horribly.

She's the only person who has ever made me feel wanted. In all my 26 years of being here, I've had countless amount of friends in and out of my life but none have ever made me feel the way she does. 

I ruined it. She fell in love with me and I couldn't accept that someone could have those feelings for me and ultimately it drove her away. I'm so distraught and I just can't move on. 

I was seeing a counselor for months after the breakup, I've been reading self help books and trying dating apps and sites and in the end it all feels meaningless because I don't seem to want to move on. 

I hate myself so much for not appreciating what we had and for not having the emotion maturity to accept that she could actually love me. She was good to me more often than not in the relationship and any time she was bad to me I can attribute it to being caused by me being bad to her because of my fucking anxiety. One day I decided to be better to her and to myself, but obviously that day was too late because she had decided to end it all.

I've had her blocked and removed from social media since the break up but time and time again I unblock thinking I should send a message to her. Selfishly impose myself back in her life because I'm stupid enough to think she'll want me back. She's moved on and it's very evident. So why can't I? 

I'm tired of being this way. I'm tired of still having feelings for her that are ultimately just going to lead me to heartbreak again and again because she's moved on. 

To be honest, I did send her a message the other day that I thought would help me move on. I acknowledged my faults in the relationship and how I treated her and how I didn't see how that would make her feel until it was too late. I didn't ask her to get back with me, I never would. She has her new life now and it would be selfish and horrible of me to impose myself on her again. I love her and I forced her to fall out of love with me without realising until it was too late. I'm still the same person, I haven't changed yet. But I want to, not  for her, but for myself. Yet since the very brief conversation we had the other day, I've been in the worst depressive episode I've ever had. I've had two sleepless nights and I had to call in sick to work today because of it. 

I hate myself and despite everything I've been trying to do to get better I just can't seem to get there. I constantly have self harming thoughts, I've never actioned on them and I would like to think I never will, but lately they're becoming more and more prevalent and more and more they're sounding like a good idea.

I really just don't know what to do anymore. I've told this to friends and they've been super supportive and helpful and I just can't keep burdening them with my issues. The thoughts and memories aren't going away and I really just don't know what to do anymore.",27Jan2020,1
30,"I don't know what to do. Most days my depression is really bad which leads me to miss my early classes by either over sleeping or just not being able to leave the bed. I am not a bad student I just keep tripping over myself and its so frustrating and embarrassing. I have a hard time telling my professors because I feel like I'm making an excuse when it is actually super debilitating. I don't know what to do so like, how do you go through college with severe depression?",27Jan2020,1
31,Made an appointment for a physical today.  Got there and waited 30 minutes the told me insurance was out of date I could still see the Dr but it would cost me $200.  So I left. I’m suppose to go the work tonight but the mess at the dr took everything out of me,27Jan2020,1

34,"Like it can be something really small and I still just want to hurt myself before anything. Like, ""Oh, you're late for work? Kill yourself."" How do I get that voice to go away? It can't be healthy.",27Jan2020,1
35,"Hello, I will cut it short: I can't go to therapy, because I work. A lot. I REALLY don't have concrete time to see a psychologist. I don't have friends, I don't have anykind of relationship with people. It's really hard for me to ""live"", but still I want to feel better because my bad health state it's disintegrating me. What can I do? Is out there some exercise or reading, or ideas that will swift my bad thought and toxic behavior away? Of course I don't want immediate effect, also slow results are ok, but at least I could try to fix me",27Jan2020,1
36,"I feel like it never goes away and I don’t know how to cope with it. Sexual abused as a kid and went to therapy for my ptsd. Was suppose to take anti depressants but my family didn’t believe in that stuff and didn’t allow me. I was convinced that there is nothing wrong because all I would hear from my family was “you are just sad” “you’ll get over it” “god will help you guide your way” “it’s just a sad moment, you’ll be happy tomorrow” but they don’t realize that even though I look happy doesn’t mean I’m not hurting inside. 

I finally made the decision to get help since I’ve been living my adult years stuck in the mind of my family. It’s starting to effect everything I do. Constantly changing my mood and getting away from all my life goal, getting in to bad relationships and making so many stupid mistakes.

If anyone have any good advice of how to cope with ptsd please let me know..",27Jan2020,1
37,"Fam helps with my cellphone bill. But it's become nothing but drama. T-mobile texted me saying it's passed due. I called them to say something started leaving a humorous message on there answering machine. Dad answered litteraly with ""why the fuck are you calling! we can't here when you're talking!"" Then hung up on me. I called my moms she pulled the same shit. So I had enough and texted them saying that is not cool. I get that your morning itallian is your happy place. Dance for cardio is mine.  I've accidentally snapped and then felt horrible about it getting friends saying something adulting mid jog pumping iron. 

I don't know I'm trying to fall into a bitter pit to rant about them snapping at me about their morning shit.",27Jan2020,1
38,I recently switched grocery stores to try and save a little bit every month but the switch has just filled me with so much anxiety and it was truly such an awful experience. Normally grocery shopping is my escape and the one thing I look forward to every week but now it just feels like a chore and something I don't really want to do anymore. It was the one thing I would tell people makes me happy and now it doesn't feel that way. I know it sound ridiculous but it really has been bothering me and I cried abut it more than once. I had been to this store before but it was remodeled so I didn't know where anything was and I forgot you needed a quarter for a cart and I just felt like I was in the way of other shoppers. I think the change will be good for my wallet but I am starting to wonder if the $20 a week is really worth it. I just need a way to go there and not feel so lost and stressed out.,27Jan2020,1
39,It wasn't prescribed for depression but rather for an unofficial ADHD diagnosis as a substitute as we don't have drugs specifically for ADHD. The psychiatrist said it could help me focus. So what effects gave you guys noticed who use this medication?,27Jan2020,1
40,"I've managed to keep my depression under wraps most of the time. I'm great at being a people person in groups and whatnot, but lately as of the last week or so, I've been having problems in my relationship and I feel like a burden to my girlfriend and those around me. Life goes great for months on end, then something bad happens and I sit and wallow in that depressive mood. Idk if this makes any sense, but I just want to be ok again",27Jan2020,1
42,"This will come across as more of a rant, but I'd like insight if anyone has it. This may seem fragmented or messy, so if clarification is needed, let me know. 

Technically, I suppose I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, but it's all been through self-report questionnaires with my doctors, and response to anti depressants in the past has been poor. There's a boatload of variables, both genetic and environmental, and the paradoxical nature of needing to be at a certain place in life in order to exploit mental health services has prevented me from getting consistent treatment outside of a prescription. My ability to work and live (though always limited) has spiralled downwards, and for every trick I learn my mind finds a new way to shut everything down.

I've been putting off writing something substantial on this for over a decade. I've only recently realized just how disparate my feelings and principles are - I tend to play roles in order to adapt, and to defend myself from what I think may be perceived threats of abandonment. For example, it always sticks in my head for months or years when someone genuinely doesn't like me, in spite of my thoughts on how I should perceive those situations. I resent feelings of this sort, and manage to near completely avoid needy behaviour, but they turn inwards to self loathing regardless of how I try to work through them. In nearly 20 years, I am no closer to being in line with what I value. Negative thoughts and feelings constantly run in the background no matter how proactively I try to address or counter them - altered perspectives are impossible to maintain in the face of that mental resistance. And since my feelings are so wildly different from both my principles and an acceptable range of behaviour, I think I might lack an identity as a result, constantly shifting around the demands of a situation to make everything as smooth as possible. I go ""blind"" to my own needs the second I share the space with someone, involuntarily and quicker than I can think. Occasionally, I will violate my principles in conversation, and honestly believe it to be my opinion for the duration. I can walk into an encounter with the knowledge of these tendencies fresh in my mind, and part of me simply turns off and performs the same act.

I am full of resentment, fighting off a subversive and creeping form of suicidal ideation, crippled by doubt, and completely unsure of how to bring things into focus. Life has been a perverse disaster of film-grade bad luck, and not a single set of rules has provided any padding. As time goes on, it even feels harder to define the problem - the more I search for solutions or try to understand a healthy persons perspective, the more alienated I am from my humanity. 

Emotions are not to be neglected - for an ordinary person, they're often referenced as being an internal compass to guide you towards the sort of nurturing, cooperation or familial ties you need to live a satisfying life. My entire life, their suppression has been a necessity for survival, but it isn't sustainable. I have to solve these problems before they finish eating me alive, and I've never felt farther.

I do not want to die regretting having lived, but nearly 20 years of my admittedly young life has gone by with no positive change, and I have little confidence I can change things now as I enter my late 20s. I can't even define what my desires are outside of wanting to escape ""this.""

43,"I'm f16 and ive gotten used to my family arguing over the years because we are incredibly incompatible. Anyways my brother came home from work and food wasnt ready and he started arguing with my sister about it and all of a sudden i felt really stressed out. I could feel my breathing getting heavier and heavier and i felt like someone was sitting on my chest. not to mention the anxiety i feel of what happens after an argument, could it escalate etc. I kind of just want to leave right now. I basically just had a panic attack over something that doesnt concern me and im just struggling... Well yh thats that",27Jan2020,1
46,If I'm on meds and therapy is there still a point to go to the ward? I've just been feeling down and have urges to SH. Should I admit myself or no?,27Jan2020,1
48,"So people that can only comment negative things about you are really annoying to deal with, but what if they are your parents?

I still live with my parents right now but maybe in this case that only shows it more. Whenever I do anything at all the only thing i ever hear is negative comments or nothing at all. Usually little stuff but sometimes it's about bigger things too.

It seems like such a small thing but when your day is already bad, the last thing you need is more comments about things you fucked up. Usually about stuff where I was just trying to help too.

I mostly mean things like when i cook everyone food, not as much as a thank you but if I forgot to turn off the extractor hood then you bet they will complain about that. Or another, just the other day I spend the entire day helping my dad with some stuff. Even though I'm busy myself, I just wanted to help. Again, not as much as a well done or a thanks son. Nothing, but you bet next day they will complain I spend to much time on the pc and not helping them (sidenote: I study industrial design. I need the pc for 90% of the work I do. That's what I spend most of my time on) if i mention i helped out the entire day yesterday while i was pretty busy myself, they will just say something along the lines of ""yes but that was yesterday""

Then with other stuff like what I even do at school. They have no idea. I never really tell them. It's very rare they ask but they will still somehow try to convince me they know for a fact I dont work and deserve to fail. This has gotten to the point a couple of times that my dad will throw around sentences like ""I'll kick you out and you are going to end up in the gutter"". They dont even know what I do 95% of the time because they dont ask. If they do they dont care. Anytime I do talk about it I'm convinced a conversation with a brick wall would be more engaging. It's just very obvious they dont listen to a word I say about it.

Some of those are fairly small things but it just feels like just another kick in the gut when you are already down. How hard is it to just say thanks for once? Or actually be intrested in something I worked 20 years for to be able to do? Is that to much to ask?

I tried talking about it with them many times. Just tried again today. Only thing they will say back is ""no that's not true, I dont do that"" to anything I say. Then they will mention some time like 2 weeks ago when they did say thanks for something. If I start about those other 95% of times they will just completely ignore what I said and continue about that time 2 weeks ago they did say it. It just feels like they dont care and dont take me seriously at all.

Sorry for the wall of text, I hope I made it somewhat readable. Thank you for taking the time to read it. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, if you want to share your own experiences or thoughts I'd love to read them. Advice would also be welcome if you have anything else I could do.",27Jan2020,1
49,"I have a severe case of walking depression and I’m an anxious mess. I keep everything bottled up on the inside. I’ve been this was for as long as I could remember, I’m 22 (f). Ive self harmed and self medicated for years. I work so hard to fight all of these horrible thoughts but I’m so tired all of the time and it’s just wearing me down. I’ve hid all of my problems for years and as far as most people are aware, I’m pretty “normal”. I can’t complete anything or do anything on my own. I feel so dull and empty, I’m just getting by with the bare minimum. I just hate myself. 

Six years ago from what I can recall, I tried lexapro and I was on it for about 2 weeks when randomly I was acting silly and hyper. My mom contacted the doctor asking if my behavior was normal and the doctor diagnosed me as bipolar over the phone and I’ve had that tag ever since. I’ve never been manic or hypo manic and I’ve tried to educate myself on bipolar disorder and I just don’t seem to fit any mania or hypo manic symptoms. The new doctor I am seeing is afraid to treat me for just depression because of the bipolar tag, I don’t feel like I’m being listened too, I know the doctors just want to make sure I am safe, but I have no prior history of being bipolar it’s other than this lexapro incident. 


I just want to know what others think about this, what your experiences are and if anyone experienced anything like this.",27Jan2020,1
50,"Therapist here. Last week I posted an article (about ways to cope with anxiety and depression) that seemed very helpful to most people who read it. After doing that post, I decided to write a specific article on depression. A portion of the article talks about symptoms that might not be an obvious sign of depression. For example, we don't often think of an angry person as being depressed. I would love your feedback on the article. If it didn't address something you'd like me to write about, please offer your suggestions!
