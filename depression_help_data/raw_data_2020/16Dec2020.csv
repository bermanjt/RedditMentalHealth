It's been months of depression,anxiety, grieving, hoping, fights, tears, and many other low energy self pity life style. I am just wondering if it's possible to wake one day with a shift. Like literally a click that it no longer matters and just not caring at all?

Any similar experiences?

Thank you",16Dec2020,1

First, thank you to all that commented and reached out!

Met with my therapist today and really examined the events leading up to me making that post. 

See, this woman and I have been having difficulties all year, even before Covid-19. We've had them the first time we were together 6-7 years ago. 

The basic scenario: She starts acting differently towards me. There is a coldness, or I'm just ignored. I think, uh oh, what did I do wrong? So I ask. Nothing is the reply I get. This goes on for MONTHS. Eventually, I get an ""answer"" that I know is not the truth, but accept it. Things are better for a few days, then the cold front blows back in. Wash, Rinse, Repeat. 

This time I asked if she wants to try and see each other in person. I don't get a direct yes or no, I get, ""Ok, you are being too damn cute"". I don't get that it was supposed to be her way of saying ""yes"", if it even really was, but I tell her taking a day to answer is really an answer in itself - no. She denies it. I have my mental breakdown, which is what led to that original post.  

So, if I ask a yes or no question, but don't get a yes or no answer, am I wrong to be insecure?  Probably not, especially if it's a pattern that has repeated time and time again over the last decade. 

The biggest thing I'm guilty of here is staying with someone who can't be honest about their feelings but has absolutely no problem stringing me along. And she knows all too well about my depression, we've talked about it many, many times. 

I sometimes wonder if she wants me dead...",16Dec2020,1

I get 10 hours of sleep on average on average as I have a gene of narcolepsy. So I need it to feel refreshed.

But I feel very motivated to make my life better but while working I don‚Äôt feel like how I used to in having as much enthusiasm. And there‚Äôs no reason for me to be sad, I just don‚Äôt feel well, thoughtout the day I have dead eyes in that there always half open now by default. 

How can I help myself, I take 15 mg of Celexa but I tried 30mg with no noticeable increase in my well being. And I actually don‚Äôt think the celexa is doing much for me as I haven‚Äôt noticed any improvement, since taking it 3 months ago. My memory is also poorer than it used to be.

I just want this cloud of tiredness to be gone and for the default position for my eyes not be half open and dead anymore.",16Dec2020,1

5,"It hasn‚Äôt been a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù holiday in a very long time. In the 7 years my SO and I have been together, we‚Äôve spent Christmas together once. I‚Äôve chewed off all my nails and my nerves are frayed. I‚Äôm going to go back a bit to explain.

In 2013 after 4 years of a bitter, nasty divorce, in a deep southern state, not where either of us where from, I lost my youngest son to my ex husband. I was shattered. I had just moved back north with my kids because I could no longer support us on the little I was making, but what‚Äôs more having no real support system. My ex comes from money and since I had no family down there, I struggled to support myself and my children. They don‚Äôt look kindly upon poverty, or single mothers, or mental illness (anxiety) he was granted full custody and I was given my son only one month and a half in the summer and a few days to a week at Christmas depending on if it fell before or after the holiday. Some years he would get out of school on the 23rd, and then I would have to take him back on the 25th. It was the most heartbreaking 1200 mile drive of my life. We could only afford to be in a cheap motel, and most of the time I could afford motels for the drive so myself and my older son would sleep in the car, in a Walmart parking lot or a safe wayside rest at a state line. I was just completely destroyed mentally having to do this stuff. During this time I developed multiple health issues that made car travel impossible so I had to resort to flying and the costs went up as well. My older son stopped wanting to go, so I traveled alone. Then I became very ill and after returning from a flight in the end of the summer, I found it hard to breathe on the plane. Once I landed I drove myself straight to the hospital and within 20 minutes of walking through the front door I was intubated and put on a ventilator for a better part of a week as my body had went into crisis from my autoimmune disease and the stress of traveling, and the sheer heat they had in the south those two days. 
After that it was like that scene in the grinch where his black heart grows, my ex decided that he would be a bit more flexible in the plans. 

So I have disabilities and awful diseases, anxiety and depression, and a ton of ptsd to boot. I have to take two flights, that used to be one, but the airlines are changing things around like crazy. I spend Christmas Eve all alone, away from my husband in a cheap ($50) hotel
 (** rant**  because I feel bad that I can‚Äôt afford to pay from the travel myself anymore, my husband is helping. I was carrying a large credit card debit on a credit card with no interest, to help me get by since the travel just cost so damn much, but then they were going to start charging interest so I took out a low interest loan and I‚Äôm very slowly paying it back. But my husband doesn‚Äôt know about it, and I‚Äôm afraid to tell him because I don‚Äôt want him to take another of my burdens. üòî I‚Äôm managing on a minimal disability but it‚Äôs tight every month. He makes good money but I help pay my part with food and other small bills. **)

Sorry I got off base. I fly down, spend the night alone, get my son we fly back (2 flights) and get home close to midnight on Christmas Day after a two hour drive from the airport. It‚Äôs not much of a Christmas for him. I will have to fly him back down around the New Years, my ex mil normally does but she just canceled on me because she‚Äôs afraid of covid which I understand, she‚Äôs older. So now I have to book new flights for something less than two weeks away. And get a hotel! Ugh. I‚Äôm screaming inside. My ex thinks my son should just wait and come for spring break. It‚Äôs nothing for him! He doesn‚Äôt have to wait an entire year to see him. I‚Äôm an emotional timebomb and I‚Äôm not processing it well. So yeah... I‚Äôm crying.",16Dec2020,1
6,"Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. I‚Äôm now to the point where I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day. It‚Äôs definitely affected my work as I know and feel I‚Äôm not as efficient and poignant as I used to be, and I fear that I‚Äôll lose my job due to lackluster work. Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I can‚Äôt find therapy right now due to pandemic?

Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. I‚Äôm a man in my late 20s and I‚Äôve never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so I‚Äôve spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didn‚Äôt match with anyone and sent me on a self-doubting downward spiral. I just want to find someone that I can share a true connection with, but I don‚Äôt think that opportunity will come for a long time.",16Dec2020,1
7,"I find it weird that the only thing I can find online when I'm trying to figure out what to do about depression says goto the doctor or the hospital or call suicide holiness if its server.... I have these weird wave of feeling super down and then neutral, and I make these manic decisions whether its getting super smashed or batching online or hurting myself or whatever and once I realize what I'm doing I get in one of those moods to hit its worse cuzbim emarenned or ashamed...

I called suicide hotline seconds away from driving myself off a mountain and all they did was talk to me like I was 5 years old and apologized for me feeling a certain way... I smarten up a bit but I was suffering another cuzbi made the stupid decision to try some drugs which I promised myself I would never do, and to top it off it was coke laced with mama so for weeks I just felt worse than death.... 

I went to the hospital and they gave me pills... I was skeptical so I didn't take them...

Not too long ago I was given pills... I took them for a bit and I felt better, then terrible then normal yet fake almost like I wasn't myself... and then I started getting super agitated, more violent than usual and I couldn't do some of the things that use to keep me entertained like drink caffeine, booze, use tobacco, which honestly was for the better but I learned moderation... I felt happy and motivated but super artificial.... 

Idk what to do now I stopped taking the pills and I'm starting to feel bad again except I have no one in my life anymore, only people I do know either have their own things going on or at this point can't help me anymore than they tried which I respect... I don't wanna be a mooch out here....

I'm a very passive person but when I'm with people I'm conformable with I'm pretty out going and I can look like an idiot when I start to show off... I find it hard to meet new friends because they usually aren't as excepting in person as they would be say online when I'm the exact opposite... I am very excepting in the real world but my ""online"" persona is not...

I'm 20 and single, I don't think I'd want a relationship right now in my life because I already can't save anymore some how idk where it all goes, but at the same time I miss the sort of ""affection(?)"" My mother had to offer which I took for granted

Things I think that drive my sort of craziness or whatever tf is wrong with me is that all through out my life.... school, out in public, online, work, I was always outcasted or f!cked with, always pushed to the edge and I had no idea why. I was always held back in school because since I was a kid, school was all I knew but I despised it so much cuz of the way I was treated *even teachers and parents would bully me, no word of lie) the last thing I was worried about was my work... all I was worried about was getting out of that hell hole so I can play hockey, video games, or hang out with the couple friends I may have had... and then the teachers would trat me worse over that! Lol...and now what really pushed me over the edge was the past year... I almost killed someone I should have went to jail, I became and alcoholic, lost all the friends I had except 2, started smoking alot of dope and then did Cobain  then my mom passed which was she last straw 2 days after I called the cops on her, 2 weeks after her birthday, the day my dad was going to go pick her up so they could find a new house, after I left because I was desperate to get away from all the terribleness the place I was in had to offer the past while since I moved there knowing she was sick, but not knowing I wouldn't see her again... since then I worked a job where I was treated like sh!t and where I was always fighting with my boss and coworkers, I lost the chance to goto college or do anything I would have wanted to do in life... and now I'm living with my sister and a drug addict in a basement working another job I hate while I just want to hit the open road and see the country... and if I'm being honest go homeless or die afterwards lol.

The idea of this life and lifestyle doesn't appeal to me... goto school, goto work, retire when you to frail to do anything, then die alone and in my case like many other people (so far) being so miserable you almost forget what it means to be depressed or suicidal, it just becomes your life... so far with everything I have personally felt, I don't want to feel anymore, and if dying is what it takes to end whatever this experience called life is, then id pray for death... I use to think I wouldn't wanna die no matter how depressed I'd be because of the pain and panic, but I had a dream the other night (as cheesy as it may sound)... my dreams are very vivid and feel very real, and the other night I had a dream that was so real I feel like I did experience death.. I rely ever ounce of pain, pressure and whatever else clear as day. I don't expect you can imagine, but I never imagined how REAL a dream could feel...

So what happened was there was an old lady, one that lives in my neighborhood with her friend outside... I was having lunch talking to my sister waiting for my brother inlaw to get home and this old lady started yelling to me through the window she wanted to give me something for helping her... I then went outside to tell her there was no need I didn't want her money blah blah blah, lmk if there's a lever anything else I could help you with... she then folded 100$ in my hand and as soon as she turned her friend came to what I assumed was to hug me, but she ever so slowly and effortlessly pushed a nice through my neck.... I grabbed my neck and started putting pressure on it immediately and turned around and ran inside and did what I'd expect to do I a situation like that...

I tried my hardest not to panic I said my sister name with whatever strength my voice had and I said call 911, she replied with ""what""? In the goofy voice id expect her to and as I stumbled up the stairs she started panicking as I was bleeding out sat me down and frantically called 911, I said I might die and I did in my dream, I felt my life drift away and everything just went dark and while that was happening I felt comfortable and almost relieved, and when I woke up I never really thought much of it...

Anyway that dream kind of erased most of the fear I had about death but that kind of scared me to ironically because now Idk what I'm going to do with myself... I don't think there's any way for me to feel better and I'd like some tips from some actual people who may have gone through something similar in there lives before I do something really stupid... I kind of lost my train of thought, and I'm now realizing I'm having one of those moments where I realize I'm doing something kinda dumb so ill end this here and just say any advice would be appreciated, thanks ‚úå",16Dec2020,1
9,"December 15. Winter is here. The skies are more grey, the sun is still there. The days get darker quicker, the sun is still there, on the other side at that time. This moment is here, we must live present in the moment and enjoy it for us. Enjoy something that has been given to us, a blessing.

  
Its been difficult at times to maintain presence and to enjoy the moment when goals have been set, time schedules need to be met and there are many things to do everyday but what I am learning is that the balance of life is, that in itself. Balance from day to day is what makes up, balance from week to week, month to month and the year in full circle. The calendar year may be coming to end but I truly hope you are not waiting for the switch of the calendar to start your ""resolutions"". You should be starting them right now, to get ready to go **FULLY IN,** once the ""new year"" changes. For me, I believe that the new year starts on my birthday, again you believe what you believe, I will believe what I do. I will still celebrate the change of the year but I am not waiting for the change of the year to start focusing on what I want now. Everything takes time though and within that resilience is where we learn how to manage our day to day, week to week, month to month, leading to the full circle of the year.

  
If you are waiting for the new year to change, start **right** now by writing down some goals that you want to start working on, **right now.** Then either later on today, tomorrow, the day after, start at the top of your list, middle, bottom, remember there is no true **structure,** but solely what structure we allow ourselves to think there is. Start working slowly on your new goals or what we have conditioned to be called ""new years resolutions"", so by the time the year switches over, you will be in FULL FOCUS for those goals and ready to conquer them Day 1. Remember, it takes time to move into what you want to work towards and that starts by beginning to work at them now, clearing space, changing day to day habits and preparing yourself.

  
**I love you.**

So its my finals week and im really struggling and scared that I won't pass my statistics class. I've always been terrible with math and even when I get a tutor its hard and I get panicked even thinking about doing math. And because of this I'm sorta spiraling a bit. 
Im in school to get my bachelor's in psychology but school is always so hard to foucus on. It doesn't make me happy anymore. I keep finding myself crying about school and how sad it makes me. I'm only in school because my parents want me to not have to struggle like them. And im afraid if I fuck all this up then I'll just be a failure. I've already had to retake like 3 classes anyway. 
 I also have chronic pain and it makes school and work hard to deal with. And I keep hoping that maybe my chronic illness will just kill me so I don't have to go on...
The thing that makes me feel any bit of happiness is being around my friends and family but that alone is not a job and I feel like I'm just a disappointment to them if I can't be able to provide for my family. I'm always thinking about killing myself or how I would rather be dead but I'm not actively planning anything (tho I have tried many times in the past but I know it can't solve my problems) I just have alot of trauma and bullshit in my life that is getting in the way of me being happy and I wish I could just live a happy life. 

I just really would like if anyone could give me some advice or words of encouragement. I'm not actively going to do anything but I just feel hopeless and really sad right now.

12,"(I am 15 and a boy)

This year I grew from about 4'11 (january) to 6'1 (december).  
Growing this tall ruined my perception of girls, I used to be shorter than everyone in my year group except for a few people, now I'm taller than almost everyone and I hate it.  
I used to be shorter, weaker and lighter-voiced than most girls and I liked it (which is something I wouldn't ever tell anyone that I like because it's embarrassing). And I was okay with being shorter and weaker than boys because I basically grew up fighting my brothers, I grew up tough and don't need muscles/height to win a fight.  
This whole year has mostly been me crying about the fact that I'll never be able to look up at a girls face anymore. I just remember this time a girl about three years older than me from school saw me in public and hugged me because she knew I wasn't doing well. Makes me wanna cry again.

And now I'm becoming a ""man"" which is something I don't want to be. I don't want to look down on women, I don't want to be stronger than them, I don't want to be deeper voiced than them, it makes me feel disgusting. The whole idea of a man to me is gross and it always has been.

And now I hate people - I hate men for sexualising short and weak women and I hate women for sexualising tall and strong men with deep voices. Because those preferences over time is the reason men have gotten taller, stronger and more deep voiced, it's the reason I am getting tall, strong and deep voiced.

I wanna be a boy again. It's so bullshit that females will remain girl-like until about 27 but men are considered men as soon as they're 20...

I hate being alive because every noise that comes out of my mouth comes out in a deep tone, I don't want to be in this tall muscular body. And I hate (most) woman for having a fetish to be dominated, like what the fuck is wrong with you all? You might not think most women want to be dominated but if you prefer a taller boyfriend then you want to be dominated... Women say they want taller boyfriends so they can feel protected, have some self respect and fucking protect yourselves you useless twats. I don't even think men have the preference to have shorter girlfriends, it's girl who are picky. Females have customised males to be tall and strong and then they go ahead and say we can't hit them and can't have better jobs than them.

18,"Hello everyone ! I hope this post finds you well and I hope you are having a beautiful day üíõ

Ok so I will try to make this short ... I (F) met the man of my dreams 5 years ago. We flirted and ended up dating. We have been in a LDR for a long time but we were seeing each other every three months and it was fine with us as we started going to uni and I traveled a lot for work etc..
A year and a half ago, all of a sudden, he became distant and cold but still very caring which was very hard to deal with and it didn‚Äôt matter if we were staying together or apart it became weird. I noticed a certain weight loss and he ended up telling me he got sick with diabetes and that he felt like he was failing me. 
I had depression for 6 years when I was younger and I started noticing his behavior and he seemed depressed and I started feeling worried of course.. I won‚Äôt lie it triggered my own depression...

Ok fast forward to last year for his birthday I decided to surprise him and I traveled out there with gifts and I decorated our place and it was just cute and perfect and I felt happy to see him get back to himself somehow. But at the same time every time we were trying to have a conversation he was feeling emotional and decided to make me laugh or kiss me or change the topic just so we didn‚Äôt have to talk about what was wrong. He cried in front of me telling me he felt like he didn‚Äôt deserve everything I do for him and that eventually he would have to leave me because I am way too good to/for him. We had a conversation and we felt emotional we hugged each other and later that day he asked me to forgive him if sometimes he is being mean it‚Äôs beyond his control and that he is mentally tired af.
After a month I had an emergency so I have to leave and travel back. We spent the weekend together. He made love to me like he never did before and before I left he grabbed my face kissed me passionately and he said ¬´¬†I love you so much baby¬†¬ª (which made me feel so good because he stopped saying I love you and calling me cute names after he got depressed..).

Few weeks after that he texted me saying that he will stop texting everyday and that he would just check on me sometimes but that he had to stop the relationship and that he didn‚Äôt love me anymore that he couldn‚Äôt keep going. He said it‚Äôs not my fault he is simply mentally sick and that he didn‚Äôt want to ruin my life. I called him I tried not to cry and he said he couldn‚Äôt give me what I deserve and that he was thinking about what he has done to me everyday and that he feels like shit so he prefers to leave so I can find happiness somewhere else. I got mad and I told him he didn‚Äôt have the right to choose for me and that we have been through so much more than that we could talk and see how he needs help. He refused and he keeps saying he would ruin my life. He also told me he wouldn‚Äôt like me to be with another person but ¬´¬†what can I do about it ? You are free¬†¬ª. The thing is my heart is so broken and I am still in love with him how could I even date someone else ? (Call me na√Øve if you want)

After that we kept talking sometimes to check on each other. He was flirty but not too much. We even sexted and kept talking as if we were still together but without saying I love you or calling each other cute names or without sharing the way we used to. At some point I felt almost humiliated... like a dog running after a ball. But I am in love and other than that I have been depressed and sick and no one was there to check on me and I don‚Äôt want him to feel the same way so I kept checking on him etc. 

Few weeks ago my grandmother passed away. It was a very hard thing to see my grandfather cry and regret not saying I love you enough to her. I decided to text my dude and I told him what had happened and how I wish things were different but that I still love him and support him no matter what. He texted back saying he loves and appreciates everything with me but that it‚Äôs better for him AND for me to just forget about this love. I asked him if the past five years have been nothing but a lie since everything disappeared after few weeks he said ¬´¬†no, I mean you know love comes and goes.. idk please I don‚Äôt want to talk about it I feel shitty for what I am making you go through¬†¬ª I just felt numb and that‚Äôs it. 

After that we kept talking sometimes.. this situation has triggered my own depression. He told me few weeks ago how he thought everything was boring but that we gotta do what we gotta do. We talked about sexuality i don‚Äôt even remember why and he told me even though he still had desire for me he felt like he was getting completely uninterested in sex. He then told me how much pressure he has on his shoulders lately because he has exams and also his mother got sick but his siblings don‚Äôt help so he has to deal with his mother‚Äôs health his own mental health and his diabetes. He also told me that he was sorry if sometimes he doesn‚Äôt answer my messages but whenever he has a mental breakdown he feels like he can‚Äôt do shit. I reassured him of course but idek if he felt supported since he doesn‚Äôt show feelings for nothing.

His birthday is the day after Christmas. I know he hates surprises üòÇ but I was thinking that maybe sending him a gift or something comforting would be good but I am doubting. I won‚Äôt lie I am feeling very down and worried. I am trying to be as supportive as possible even when he is being distant and cold and stressed. What he did felt unnecessary. He left and just came back saying that  ¬´¬†the situation between us is shitty all because of me¬†¬ª. But I swear we have seen worse together. Once again I know what depression can make you do/think so I am not blaming him. He even blamed me for not blaming him he told me ¬´¬†how can you be so supportive?¬†¬ª I just told him that I couldn‚Äôt be mad at him for something he can‚Äôt even control. He just kissed me and thanked me for everything.

Now I am lost. Idk if he loves me. Idk if I mean something to him. Idk if I should send him a comforting gift to let him know he is being thought of still and that I am still here whenever and whatever happens. Idc if I am the one depressed I have been there already it‚Äôs dark and hard but it‚Äôs even harder to see him suffer from it. It triggers mine too and I just can‚Äôt seem to understand what the hell happened.

Anyways I tried to make it short and here we are. I forgot a LOT or details. But yeah this dude is perfect even when he is down like you know when someone else feels like home ? And when you can be yourself and feel safe and at peace as if your soul finally reached its destination ? Well that how it feels like. Depression sucks. I hate that he pushes me away and that even though he describes me as perfect for him I am still not enough for him to let me in and support as we used to do for each other. I hate that the only moments of happiness we have are ¬´¬†loveless¬†¬ª and you can feel a certain tension.

I want to see him happy again. If you guys have any advice or story to share please feel free to do so. If you have any idea as to what I could send him please let me know. And I am sorry it got so long but thank you if you read it.

God bless and you guys take care of yourselves. And if you are reading this thinking I am stupid or whatever well I might be but I just also want you to remember that you are worth having someone fight for you to be good again one day üíó",16Dec2020,1

Ever since full virtual schooling started in my area (about 3 weeks at this point) I have lost all motivation to do anything school-related or even trying to find a job, I haven't been taking care of myself as well as I used to and my room has turned to an absolute mess. I don't have any thoughts about hurting myself but depression has a trend on my dad's side of the family and I'm starting to think I'm depressed.

28,"I haven‚Äôt been the happiest since lockdown, haven‚Äôt really been feeling my best with school either. This is probably one of my first posts where I actually open up. I‚Äôm glad to have friends that are there for me but it seems like I just can‚Äôt do that because I feel like I‚Äôm bothering them. I‚Äôm 15, currently in grade 9. Starting the school virtually was weird, and I haven‚Äôt gotten used to it either. I try to do the work they assign but I sometimes get assigned so much work where I feel like I‚Äôm not capable of doing this. I try my best and sometimes spend hours, even nights finishing work. My main problem is science, the teacher expects us to learn as soon as we read and assigns work that is 9 pages long. I spend nights doing and even sometimes I‚Äôm behind with work. Recently the grades finally are being submitted and I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. I went from a B to a F. I tried so hard, and I end up failing. This has happened before where my anxiety just takes over and my emotions are all over the place. I want to give up, I really do. And I can‚Äôt talk to my parents because we were never close. When I was younger, I used to get beaten for not knowing a answer. Which is what started my drift from them. We barley speak to each other in the house and always argue for something. Since my older brother moved out because of my parents, I‚Äôm in that slot now. They want me to be the best. They want ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù for me. I feel like I‚Äôll never be good enough for them. (Also I apologize if these come out of nowhere it just comes up as I type this.) I‚Äôve been through a lot emotionally, had my 6 month relationship end because of lockdown..(I know I‚Äôm young and love at this age won‚Äôt work out most of the time). But I also reconnected with this friend I haven‚Äôt spoken to, she was the best and had helped me before in grade 6, we drifted apart because of social issues, she was more further away and she wanted to focus on school so I let it be. She came back into my life and I just felt the emotions I had for her. We tried to make it work but I end up messing that up, and now it haunts me to this day. I literally pushed the person I loved and has helped me away. This started a bipolar type of phase. I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I just stayed up at night trying to move on but I couldn‚Äôt. My guilt I felt I just couldn‚Äôt bare with it, and I still can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just trying to be a better person, I know it will take a lot of change, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reaching out to random people.

29,"I am empty again. It took me months to get back up, do stuff that I like and even get some money to feed myself with. It felt good. But I feel terrible right now. There is nothing that feels enough. I keep  blaming myself again and again. It just sucks.

Almost an year ago, my sister invited me at her place. It was hard to get out of bed too. She thought a change of place would help. My depression followed me there but thinking of a new start actually gave me hope. Something changed when I started listening to David Goggins. That was so good. I started running. I started looking forward to the day. I even got 1 client. Then 2. Then 3. The money was just 5 dollars, 10 dollars per order but I was still grateful. I thought naively I could increase this to something sustainable. I had to come back home to my mother after 6 months of stay there. But I was much better than 6 months before. I had better skill, some projects to look forward to. I started earning roughly 5-600 dollars a month. It was empowering. So much better than the abject poverty I was used to. My workouts improved and for the first time I invested in a pull up bar. I also had good reviews of my work on fiverr. I wanted a bigger order now. 5-600 dollars for 1 client. 

I finally got it with a youtuber. It was heaven at first. I looked up to him for inspiration. But after uploading a couple of videos the guy just wasn't interested in his own channel. 2 months later he just announced that my work was shit and I had to up my game. I told him I was out the 2nd time he said this. The work was not shit. He earned 1200 dollars off my work and calling it shit afterwards was an asshole move. Now my pay is with him. My half of 600 dollars. I don't have other clients. My family tells me that it will get better. Everyday, this guy just messages me and the uncomfortable conversation lasts for hours. Its the same old -  your work is trash &gt; you should have told me before you earned all that money and then he proceeds to tell me how bad my videos were(pin points more and more problems). I just get crushed. I snapped once. Lost my cool and shouted at him. Apologized 5 minutes later but the guy just held on to it and decided to punish me by telling me how shitty my work is. I am just waiting for youtube to pay him so that he can pay me and I can finally block him. 

At this point I am thinking about not falling into the downward spiral of depression. roughly 12 months earlier I was in such a bad shape. I was fat and depressed, unable to get out of bed. My girlfriend had broken up with me. She was the only one who had believed in me, but she got tired of my negativity. Its been so hard getting here from that state. But right now I am just super worried about my future. If I just collapse every time I encounter an asshole, its just going to get me back there. I have just started getting thoughts about how useless I am and the world would be a better place without me. I don't want to go there again. Its so bad right now. I really don't know what my life is about anymore. My art seems useless. My passion seems pointless. I don't have any friends and don't want any because I don't want to ruin anything. My family thinks I am finally getting back up but they don't know how tormented I feel due to all this. And all this for 600 dollars because I can't even earn that on my own. 

I realise that it would be on me if I let myself fall down that path. Its my responsibility to keep myself floating but right now it just seems hopeless. Why does the universe love putting me in this position again and again? What does it want to teach me? I am so out of gas right now. Thanks for reading. I know people have it worse and I am just a crybaby but it does feel hopeless right now. I don't know how to deal with people like this guy who keep coming again and again in my life.",16Dec2020,1
30,"Hey girls and guys,

I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today I'm 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (disinterest and joylessness), lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes (about past, present, future, that I don't have anything to offer, that I'm disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc.), lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions (memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts) and irrational social anxiety.

I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me (anhedonia again). I then think what reasons or motives do other ""normal"" people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I don't eat that much and don't feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression.

Sure, I don't have much self worth or confidence at all. I don't have many things I'm passionate about or I'm good in. I see the connection: no things you're passionate (drive) or good at (feelings of success giving self worth) =&gt; depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think I'm dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona. Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology (esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology) is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making.

I'm sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts?

Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings?

Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, that's somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression.

Have a nice day, I wish you the best! &lt;3",16Dec2020,1

32,"I‚Äôve had clinical depression and anxiety since middle school. I‚Äôm a sophomore in college now. I have been on EVERY MEDICINE. Including abilify and lamictal for my depression. It never helps, as I‚Äôm still heavily su1cidal. Doctors have tried to tell me in the past I‚Äôm bipolar or borderline, but I‚Äôm not. I thought it could be CPTSD because it makes the most sense given my background, but it‚Äôs not even in the DSM and professionals don‚Äôt even know what it is always. I am starting to realize maybe this could be ADHD, apparently it looks different in women, and is not always the hyper kid in class. I forget everything like seriously, I procrastinate daily to the point I literally don‚Äôt do basic functioning things for days or weeks, I can‚Äôt seem to function as an adult it‚Äôs too overwhelming, I get intense hyper spouts where I day dream in my head to songs and I can only do this if I have my headphones in, in a very specific setting. I also can not concentrate very well, and although I‚Äôve done okay in school, I am doing POORLY in college. I do have mood swings and can have bad anger towards triggers. I also always feel like I‚Äôm not real, I never fit in, I can‚Äôt keep relationships, I‚Äôm different, etc. imposter syndrome x100
Basically I haven‚Äôt been able to tell my doctor because I have seen her for years and can not pinpoint who I am. All I know is I want to die to the point I have been hospitalized and attempted, and I never can really find the words to explain because I always forget or can‚Äôt formulate or get too scared/shy to say anything. I feel like I‚Äôm an imposter towards her, like if I‚Äôm honest now she won‚Äôt believe me, and will pass it off and throw me on another medicine that doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm very depressed over this, I‚Äôve wasted years and years and my memory is so poor all I remember is the bad stuff. 

I am very tired of not finding answers. I always am stuck and it‚Äôs getting worse. I feel like a fraud or an attention seeker, and honestly insane. Idk what to do. No one listens they all just want money and don‚Äôt care. I want to die",16Dec2020,1

Hi, I‚Äôm (1)two, really way too young to be on the internet if you ask me. I‚Äôm feeling things that I‚Äôm sure no person as young as me should be feeling.

I reached out to my parents about how I feel like I‚Äôm depressed (I‚Äôve talked to a psychiatrist and I started taking meds yesterday) which honestly took a lot because I‚Äôve been feeling like this for about a year. I don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm feeling all of this, I have a family that cares about me and everything that I need to go on but yeah lol. 

I realised I was depressed when I stopped taking showers regularly, brushing my teeth after every meal, talking to my family, and, just wanting to stay in bed all day thinking about pointless things and worrying over even more pointless things. 

The pandemic just worsened all of this to be completely honest. Over the span of 9 months in quarantine with my family, I stopped talking to my friends slowly, my school work started to pile up because I wasn‚Äôt doing it, and I stopped attending zoom classes. 

These things became part of the contributing causes of my depression seeing as I always did well in school and talked to people quite a lot of people because, again, I was stuck with them in school.  

Every time I try to find a reason why I‚Äôm feeling this way it always goes back to school. 
I definitely don't want to go back to in-person school because of my anxiety and my thoughts being all over the place, but the whole reason why this started was because of online classes and I guess being isolated. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Sorry for writing all of this down, this isn‚Äôt even 1/4 of my thoughts lol, but yeah. Have a nice day or night to whoever reads this haha :)",16Dec2020,1
37,"Some mornings after my sleep, I wake up and feel tired, I feel refreshed but as well as exhausted from the travels that I did through my subconscious. Some mornings I wake up and feel like I need more sleep, some mornings I wake up and feel fully refreshed and ready to go. All mornings I know that I must follow how my body feels but as well as sometimes push through what my body is trying to condition me into feeling. The life of a human being is very peculiar, always changing, always evolving, always growing, always sharing, always learning, always failing, always realigning; We Pause, for a moment.

Energy is based on a feeling. Everyday is a new day, everyday is a new start but all mornings are a blessing to wake up, rise and start new. Its so interesting to me when I get energy based feelings that are different from what is trying to perceive me, that is trying to tell me, that is trying to scare me, that is trying to say one thing, when I can feel otherwise; God, I Thank you. Everyone and anyone can connect with those feelings, what it took for me was getting to a point where I was over my alcohol and marijuana abuse on my soul, spirit, being and my body. I had, had enough; I knew that there had to be more, there just HAD to be.

It all takes time. Life is about the time we are given daily. We can set goals to accomplish, we can work hard towards them, but most of the time the Universe will guide us differently, we may still accomplish said goals but it will come with many different experiences, learning, self growth that was unexpected; always for our Highest Self. Keep doing your best. Growth and Change comes through day to day hard work; giving yourself time and space from what is being focused on, to maintain grounding, presence and pausing. 

I love you.

39,"To begin with i am a 17 year old guy, who used to be in a four and half-year long relationship. Now, initially, we were just best friends who thought of the term girlfriend and boyfriend as a special friend and decided to well start dating. She had an insane amount of problems on her side of the family, her parents were in prison, her siblings both dead and a shit ton more. So a big chunk of our time was me supporting her, comforting her and so on, and well i ended up getting really attached. I was so close to her that i ended up developing somniphobia which was something she struggled with and not me. 

2 years ago my grandfather went ahead and killed himself, which came as a massive shock to both of my parents, who had spent over an year to get him back in shape both mentally and physically. During that entire time span, I ended up being neglected and would only talk to my girlfriend. We were very close and would talk almost 4-5 hours daily, so when she got caught up in a car crash and suddenly passed away, i didn‚Äôt take it well and i still don‚Äôt.

Neither my parents nor my siblings know anything about this, since my household is not supportive of relationships till i become 18. Its been almost 11 months now and i need someone to help me get over her.

Anyone have advice how to? I‚Äôve tried a lot of stuff such as:
Meditation
Gymming 
Exercise
Focusing on studies
Therapy

None of those helped me that much, would appreciate some advice!",16Dec2020,2
