0,"Last year I was really struggling. I was lonely and seeing someone who mentally manipulated me and made me feel abandoned. I couldn’t make friends, didn’t have anything to do but study and still failed most of my classes. I felt like a failure and wanted to die and felt bad about it bc I know I was lucky to have the life I do where I can go to school without working and have opportunities. 


NOW my life has gotten so much better. I’m doing a lot better in classes, have reconnected with good friends that I get to see about once a month (it would be more if not for covid), got my shit together and LEFT the asshole who was making me feel so unlovable, and met a lovely new person who adores me and spends as much time as I like with me. But I still fucking want to die. I think about it every day and I don’t know why. I feel so horrible, what if I actually kill myself? I can’t stop the thoughts, who’s to say I’d be able to stop myself actually doing it if I got a good opportunity? 


I don’t want to put my family or my friends or my SO through that, but God I just want to be dead already. I wish I had never existed so I wouldn’t have to worry about hurting them like this.",04Dec2020,1
1,"I don’t think I’m depressed but I needed to post my situation somewhere. If this can serve any of you that feel in the dump and realize your situation is not as bad as mine, then I’m glad. What I do need is an ear and frankly some human sympathy.

I’m an entrepreneur. I was totally screwed by a couple business partners and ended up with 250k high interest debt on my name while they took all my assets and went off to make millions. My net worth went from a lot to nothing. Investments I made in the past got completely destroyed with covid (restaurant industry). I’m late on my mortgage and my car is about to get repossessed. Just had a newborn and my wife has no clue. I can’t tell her any of this as she’s going through post partem depression and had to get on the pill. Cant talk to anyone because through my business problems I basically lost a big part of my network. I don’t really have any help or friends as I am not connected into the community, mostly because I work so hard and pre covid never went out. I have one of the hardest work ethics I know and I don’t give up. I have a lot of ideas I am pursuing to generate income but keep getting kicked down for stupid reasons. My wife wants to be supportive but just isn’t in the way I need her to be on a couple fronts. For one I’m an entrepreneur at heart and she just doesn’t get it. I can’t share ideas or get her excited on anything that doesn’t bring stability. On the marital front she is awesome but sex is nonexistent. I have a high libido and basically have to squash it.

I don’t believe I am depressed but perhaps am in some capacity as I easily get burned out and it is hard to concentrate on fulfillment at times. I read of entrepreneurs that lost it all and then became successful and hope that this is me.

Don’t know where I’m going with this but saw this reddit and needed to vent. Appreciate the ear and if anyone has ideas or kind words let me know. Have a good day all.",04Dec2020,1
2,"I (24f) completed my Bachelors a year ago. I was supposed to apply to graduate programs and the deadlines are only about 10 days away but I simply cannot get anything done. I haven't even started with my SOPs and LORs. I have an exam in 2 days and I haven't even started studying for it when people take months to prepare for it. I don't know if I'm being the laziest person ever or if something is wrong with me but I just cannot get myself to start on it and I also just cannot concentrate. 

I used to be very organized and methodical a few years ago. I used to plan ahead and ticking off my checklists used to give me a lot of satisfaction but now I just don't know what I'm doing. I cannot make myself move to do the things that I have to do. I just waste my time surfing the internet scrolling through useless videos and posts, which I don't even enjoy. I even screwed up my final year project this way. I did just the bare minimum required when I knew I could've done so much more if I had just tried. I got a job after graduating and I even managed to screw that up by doing the work at the last minute and asking for a time extension by lying about why I couldn't get it done. It's been a year since I graduated but I haven't done anything to show for it. Now, I quit my job a few weeks ago saying that I couldn't manage my time between the job and my applications but I haven't even done anything since then. 

I am so disgusted with myself. I know I should do better but I just cannot get myself to move. I just ignore all my problems and waste my time and sleep all the time. I don't know if it's lack of motivation or I'm just plain lazy but I'm so tired of being this way. I cannot work. I cannot think properly. It's feels like I just have this constant ball of stress in my head due to all the things that I have to do but I'm not even able to start on them. Due to this I cannot even do anything that I used to enjoy, I cannot talk and have fun with my friends, even eating and drinking water feels like such a chore I have to do. It's been so long since I've actually  felt happy.  I can talk and act happy when required but it feels so superficial. 

Going to a therapist and getting help is difficult where I live and I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I am really tired of living this way and but I don't know how I can change it. Any sort of advice on what I can do to improve my situation would be greatly appreciated.",04Dec2020,1

4,"The past year or so has been hard lots of ups and downs and I've been more and more thinking back about people who are not in my life anymore and I've been falling into this loop were its all i can think about. These memoirs are extremely unhealthy and over the past month or so this has been happening more. I don't know how to go about helping myself not have theses recurring memory as often. I know part of my problem is that I've been very isolated the past 4-5 months and im worried that its for lack of a better word broke something in my head and im regressing back to times when i wasn't isolated at all. Any advice would be amazing. Im worried that im becoming schizophrenic.

Thank you for your time",04Dec2020,1
5,"I've been to multiple different therapists in the last few years and they've all sucked. They just keep repeating shit like ""go out more :)"" ""try yoga :)"" ""make some friends :)"" (pre-covid) but now in 2020 it's switched to ""everyone is struggling this year :)"" ""try writing your feelings down in a diary"" and everyone acts like this is amazing advice. People act like therapy is this incredible cure-all. After struggling a lot this year, going to a therapist again was kinda my last resort and it didn't pan out. Again.

6-7 years ago I had a therapist who I really liked but they ended up moving away, and every therapist since then has been terrible. They just act like they don't want to see me, and try to push me out the door as fast as possible. They just repeat the same things over and over again and I feel like we're talking in circles. I have depression and anxiety, struggle with an eating disorder, weight issues and I have a hard time with self discipline and motivation. They make me feel like that's nothing and I'm just being whiny. Like my problems aren't ""severe"" enough for them to bother with me.

All the things that they claim should help me with my depression are things my depression STOPS me from doing. Cooking and eating healthy meals, exercise, going to bed early and having a consistent sleep schedule, going out and doing activies, making friends, finding hobbies, etc.

Like I said, I have a serious problem with self discipline and motivation. If my dumb fat ass doesn't want to exercise daily, I'm not going to. If my dumb fat ass wants to shovel junk food into my mouth on the daily, I'm going to. If my dumb fat ass want to stay awake until 7am and sleep until 6pm on the weekend and ignore all my alarms, I'm going to. If my dumb fat ass wants to let my laundry pile up for weeks, I will. If my dumb fat ass doesn't want to make art or play videogames like I used to really enjoy, I won't. No matter how hard I try to fight against myself and do better, I just fail repeatedly,  constantly disappointing myself. 

People just say I'm lazy, I just need to push myself to do better, and sticking with healthy routines will make it easier. But the issue is I've been pushing myself to do better for years, and nothing has ""clicked"". Simply telling me to ""try harder"" isn't working. I'm switched up my meds and upped the dosages as much as my doctor's will allow, I take plenty of supplements. I feel like there has to be some sort of step in-between, hidden somewhere that I just haven't found yet. But it doesn't exist, I'm just a lazy piece of shit apparently.",04Dec2020,1
6,"It sounds so silly and petty, but it’s a feeling that’s plagued me for a long time now. I think I noticed it in high school, but it may extend back further in my life. It’s a weird, detached feeling in every relationship I have. Everyone else has people they’re more established with, friends they’ve known longer and have more of an attachment to. It makes absolute sense, and I’m not really someone who goes around trying to be more important in relationships than I am. In fact, I try very hard to do the opposite, because I can’t bear the thought of feeling important to someone, only to have them turn around and tell me I’m wrong and never meant much in the first place. Despite my careful treading, it has happened a few times. But I never feel like I’m able to form meaningful relationships like that. I feel like, because I’ve come later in their established lives, I’m more disposable. I don’t feel like I last very long in friendships, and it’s not that I have many falling outs.. it’s that they stop caring it seems. I never feel like a permanent piece. I don’t know what to do about it, I’m sure I’m to blame for it, but I really don’t know what to do.  I don’t know what this means, how to handle it, anything.",04Dec2020,1
7,"So long story short me and some of my friends decided to rent a place in the mountains to spend the weekend there. Some of us came up on Thursday and other will joins us later. So four of my friends and the girl I like as I sad earlier came up here yesterday. We invited this girl let's ca here Helen so me and her can possibly get together if things go well I'm a bit of a shy person as well so I didn't wanted to just like invite her out since we didn't know each other very well.

Before this  I was talking with one of my friends let's just call him Peter, that I really like this girl and I find her attractive her personality is great and all. We arrived here started playing music everyone got their place packed their stuff out and we started chatting drinking the usual. I saw that this girl was really shy sitting all alone next to the table on her phone. 

So I sat next to her started to chat with her I asked and told her that is there something bothering her maybe there is something that I cna help her with to relax or something. She just replied ""I'm fine don't worry I'm just a little quiet at first"" I sad ""ok but if there is anything bothering you anything that we could make you feel better just let me know"" I saw that she was just shy and she was hiding her feelings. After some time she was still on her phone not really interacting with other so I told her ""let's play some beerpong"" to which she replied ""sure let's do it"". So we prepared the cups and filled them started playing I was joking all along about anything that came to my mind to make her more confortable. 

Every hour or so she and  Peter went out to have cigarette brakes. I was like sure go ahead I'm not smoking so I'm not gonna join you every time. After the 5th or 6th cigarette brake I was like I don't got anything better to do so I might as well join them see what they are talking about. As I exit the house I see them kissing. 

At that point anger filled me I rushed in and told my other friends what he just did and how big of a dick he is I never felt this disrespected in my life. I was on the edge of braking something. I felt so betrayed, back stabbed. Then they came inside went up stairs and stood there for like a half an hour or so and in the meantime I was talking to my best friend like every I told him the story and he actually was so kind and brave that he wrote in one of our group chats how ashamed he should feel and why did he just brake my heart by doing this. And it felt so good that he's protecting me/on my side. 

After which Peter came downstairs, I was talking with my friends still shocked. He sits down next to me. And says nothing. After some time my other friends leave and I was thinking about leaving him there I didn't wanted to talk to him but I saw that he was sad. And I'm a really sentimental guy and I couldn't leave him there. 

So he sad he's sorry and he feels bad for what he's doing. I told him that I would never in my life would have imagined that he will do that and basically ranted for about 10 minutes. After which he started to cry well not really cry but he got emotional and he's eyes where full of tears. So I felt sorry for him I don't know how after what he just done to me tho I was slightly under the influence of alcoholic drinks but still I was very well known what I was doing. And I sad ""Peter you just did the unthinkable today and I never in my life would imagined you doing something like this I'm sorry you made me feel really bad but all I ask you is that you don't brake her heart as well treat her right"". 

After which I left to grab a drink. I got back he was still sitting there. So I sad down and asked him why didn't he tell me that he likes her as well so at least I know that if she likes him better there is no arguing and no hard feelings. He sad that I was very passionate when I told him how much I want this girl and didn't wanted to ruin that. I just shakes my head and I sad ""look we are not going to be as good friends as before but what has been done has been done"". 

So I hung out with my other friends talking watching funny videos trying to not think about this whole situation. Then I went upstairs to grab my charger (my room was upstairs) and as I enter my room she was sleeping there. I got my charger and left. After some time we got bored and sad let's sleep. 

Everyone went to their room I with Peter and another guy. By this time Helen has already moved to another room to sleep in. Peter told us he goes to wash his teeth. He went to the bathroom which is next door. 

After 5 minutes or so he leaves the bathroom and goes in the room where Helen is. We heard them talk all night. One of my firned actually went in the room because he needed a charger and we didn't have any spare ones. 

He told us that Helen was laying on Peter and the where talking. As far as I know Peter didn't actually told Helen what's the situation between us. They actually talked all night long. 

I couldn't sleep I think I slept like 2 hours at max I was just jealous angry depressed all night. 

Sorry for beeing so long and the ones who actually read through this let me know your thoughts. We will be here for the next 3 days so I don't know what to do I don't want to leave but I don't  want to just like be depressed and waste my time here either. Should I just try to accept it that they are together or do something about it? Anyways thanks for reading a simple comment or anything will help as I really don't know what should I do. Either way have a great one.",04Dec2020,1
9,"Hey all. I'm wondering if you could give me some advice on how I might help my brother to improve his current situation in some way.

Currently he is living alone in a new city away from family. He is 21. He doesn't have any friends and he isn't interested in seeking employment, so he is really struggling with loneliness since the only people he interacts with are food store owners. 

He is absolutely uninterested in professional help as he thinks it unhelpful. He is also pretty difficult to reason with once he decides on something. He will just flat out say no repeatedly and become upset.

He used to be very interested in gaming, but lately he can't bring himself to play anything, so he just lies on his bed most of the time. 

I think he really wants to have more social interaction in his life and I believe the easiest way for him to do that would be through finding employment. (He lives in New Zealand, so there is no lockdown or anything) But as I say, he hates the prospect of work and thinks its just a way for people to be controlled and made complicit.

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I just really don't know how I can help him when I dont live with him!",04Dec2020,1
11," Recently I’ve made an instagram page where the focus will be on recovery, at the same time my DM is open and if someone needs help or someone to talk to don’t hesitate to message me.

For the last 5 years I struggled with depression and anxiety problems. Which made it easier for me to understand and give people advice with the same problems. I noticed I really enjoy helping people out and get energy of it. Thats why I started this instagram page.

The name of my page is: KintsugiiCare

Explanation of the name:

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of putting broken pottery pieces back together with gold, built on the idea that in embracing flaws and imperfections, you can create an even stronger, more beautiful piece of art. Why I use this is because I think it works the same for people like us! Depressed people are broken, but it can be fixed in a way better version of yourself, golden repair! ❤️

Take care and to everyone: It gets better!",04Dec2020,1
12,"I've been depressed for about 10 years now, and have struggled with suicidal tendancies.  I was in a very abuse relationship about 4 years ago that nearly ended with me offing myself.  I took time to myself and stubbornly have tried to just take care of it myself.  I make myself be social.  I make myself get up in the morning.  I make myself be optimistic.  And for the most part I've managed to keep things in check.  

Up until recently.  Out of nowhere I was hit by the strongest wave of depression I've felt in years.  Its unrelenting, and I've found suicide on my mind more often than I would like.

How would I go about finding a therapist?  Are there things I should look for?  Do you guys recommend a guy, a girl or does it not matter?  Is therapy covered by insurance usually?

And lastly, I worry about taking medications.  I really don't want to be reliant on a pill to function.  But I worry that due to how long I've had this condition that it may be a chemical issue and not an emotional one.  Should I be worried about antidepressants?  Why or why not?",04Dec2020,1

17,"I have actually still been struggling with this despite being medicated, I have bipolar disorder and ADHD. 

When I hit my low points, I CANNOT bring myself to do anything. My joints hurt, my head is fuzzy, and my body feels glued to the bed.

After that, once I’m heading towards baseline again, I’m too exhausted from recovering to do anything.

I have not been hypomanic or manic for a while, which unfortunately powers me a lot of the time. It’s how I semi-survived college and high school, I was just constantly over vigilant, anxious and too high energy. 

But even when I’m doing better and not manic I still have zero motivation and when I try things, I don’t FEEL the fun nor do I FEEL the pleasure. I feel like I’m walking around in thick jello.

Something I also noticed is that I have this intense fear of being bad at something or not getting it straight away. When ever I try something new, it’s like my brain gets so loud and mean that it doesn’t even feel worth it.
It’ll criticize me even for not doing little things “perfectly”. I guess my brain just doesn’t see the point anymore when almost all I feel is flat or frustrated or a combination.

Please, I feel like I’m wasting away and can’t stop. I want to have fun playing videogames again, and I want to get back to writing a novel I started and I want to go back to school. But this symptom is driving me up the wall, I will accept any and all feedback.

20,"I was born in 2005, im male, and I was born in Las Vegas Nevada. my father an addict who spent
t most of my life in jail, my mother a failure who hated the mistake I was. I was abused, raped tortured, and beaten by my mom's many boyfriends for as long as I remember then at 12 and 13 my mom got into drugs so the abuse got even worse. By this time I had 2 siblings who I tried to help but I couldn't save them from the same abuse I suffered.

 Then at 13, with a glimmer of hope, I went to live with my grandmother and father in Illinois. My father was abusive and intent on killing me or beating me until I understood exactly why I was being beaten. Wish I could have died then.

 This went on until I was 15, I got another chance, my mom's parents offered to help me, to make sure I could be ok, and so far I've failed them. I argue a lot I can't follow rules I continuously lie I do bad at school I don't help out I suck at chores I don't know how to help with stuff and I can't be normal.
This leads to the present, now. 

I can't get any mental support, it's too expensive with covid. And I need meds. I refuse to do drugs like my mom but I need something to keep me from slitting my throat. It hurts to be alive I need help. I just want the pain to stop. Even now with a decent family, I can't stop thinking about the past, and not a minute goes by without me feeling as if im being beaten within an inch of my life even though im physically fine.

I won't ever be normal, I have no interest in life, I have zero friends, my grandparents have even grown to hate me as well. I think this is the end huh. I've wanted to die since 6 years old and I may finally be able to rest now. 
I've promised myself a week. I'm giving myself a week.
If I find a reason to live, even if it's just a show I like or something I want to do when im older, it would still be more than I've had all my life.

24,"During the early quarantine, I met a guy online. He was married and in an open relationship which was fine with me because I'm moving in months and genuinely only wanted to be FWB. We shared a few conversations and even a phone call or two and the connection just felt so real. We had a lot in common. He'd message me out of the blue and everything. It wasn't until later I learned that his husband was in a different country and that was bringing him down quite a lot. He started to become more and more distant. I understood at first until he started to deliberately ignore me, I'd see literal proof of. 

Being a very vocal person, I naturally brought up my feelings that I was being ghosted after it had ate at me for long enough. He apologized for it -- sort of -- and I told him that I forgave him but wouldn't forget basically. And then I asked when a great time to hang would be like we'd been planning beforehand, and he repeated the same things. As follows, I repeated my worries to him -- this time, with more bark. Understand that I didn't want to believe what was happening because of how big I felt the ""bond"" would become. This led to some what of an argument in which ended with him basically not apologizing this time, instead trying to play victim and then blocking me only on Grindr and going completely silent.

I had never felt more betrayed. I had been going through a whole lot and that had just iced the cake. I felt like he was supposed to be what got me through before I moved, not what added to what was already going to be rough times and thus a void was created. I wanted that story in which I chose both the start and the end. Basically have him there as my temporary ""go to guy."" So when exciting things came up or I was feeling down, he wasn't there  like I wanted him to be and I just felt lonely and would even have episodes where I'd be alone with very dark feelings. 

After letting things air for about a month, I apologized for acting out even though he owed me a greater apology. He basically did, once again, kind of apologize, and told me that he wanted me to be happy and stuff but I needed to figure out basically how to control my mental challenges. I didn't respond at the time and let things air out again. I requested to follow him on Facebook just to have some peace of mind after having some secondary doubts and he declined it. And then tried to see what was up after about a week or so after to no avail. 

And for the next few months, basically the remainder of this year, (this happened in Aug/Sept), it's been a repeat of loneliness and no comfort. No other guy would interest me. It had to be me. I was basically Bella in New Moon. And all for someone I never even met past online borders? I feel all kinds of embarrassment and question my thoughts on why I let something as simply stupid as this affect me. 

Those issues he used to push me away? It makes absolutely no sense. He's got it all -- a husband, a good relationship with his family, a good job and everything yet he's so ""depressed."" He has such a perfect life and he's clearly just too self absorbed and get off on crushing other people to see it. HE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED -- NOT ME! 

I've been so affected by this that I don't feel like I'm ever going to find peace until he gives me the proper closure. I've been feeling like I'm recovering from the greater damages lately, and hoping that when I move in a month, a greater chunk of that weight he's forced on me will somewhat be lifted and that I'm going to start fresh. One thing I've never done is share this story with a broader audience and I certainly feel like that's going to help. Advice? Can anyone relate?",04Dec2020,1
