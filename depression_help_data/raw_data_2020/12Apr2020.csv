1,"We are in rough times in our relationship and it‚Äôs been this way for some time. I think mostly it has to do with me and many might agree with me as well reading all this. 

My girlfriend is very empathetic and feeler kind of person. She feels everything too much and it affects her. She has had low self esteem and confidence since the start. 

Last night she was telling me how throughout life, she has only been made to feel like an outsider in every place. She didn‚Äôt have her own friends and was friends with her sister‚Äôs friends. Later, throughout her school life, she had only one friend who got into a relationship and left her on her own and stopped talking to her. My girlfriend had no issues with her relationship except that she would tell her friend to not become rude to all her friends because of that. 

Then in the last year of school, she finally felt like she had her group because she made good friends. But in a year, the group fell apart and they aren‚Äôt friends anymore and don‚Äôt want to be. 

Then we got together and it had been 2 years. I didn‚Äôt ever tell my friends and family about her due to my anxiety that they wouldn‚Äôt like it or I don‚Äôt know how to express it even though I was always in love with her while she already expressed it to everyone. We decided we wanted to be with each other and have a future together and when you‚Äôre in relationship, and it‚Äôs been 2 years, it‚Äôs weird how a boy wouldn‚Äôt even tell anyone in his family. 

Before being married, she wanted to at least have a friendly and accepting atmosphere with my friends and family. Because she‚Äôs an anxious and shy person and she‚Äôs always feared not being welcomed and accepted because of her life experiences. 

Later, she had to ask me too much that I talked to my family about her so that they are aware of her and happy to welcome her and my brother and she became friends. Just a few weeks later after that, they got into argument and instead of standing alongside my girlfriend because she wasn‚Äôt wrong, I instead fought my brother instead of just trying to be at her side and being cool about it letting them both figure it out. 

This lead to my brother hating her and he started thinking of her as a horrible person, narcissistic and self-victimising person who was a negative effect in my life and he blackmailed and threatened her to break our commitment off if she hurts me. 

And this left her traumatised badly that after everything she has been through, all she wanted was to be accepted by my family and nothing more than that right now but my brother made it so horribly worst that I don‚Äôt even know how to make it better but I don‚Äôt want to lose her. 

So this is what something she always feared and my brother made sure to make her fears and doubts into truth. I try to make her feel like he isn‚Äôt like that anymore but my brother never even apologises to her saying he was absolutely right. So because of remembering all these things again, she went back into her depression and he had started to be just a bit better before because she has been depressed for about a year now and I don‚Äôt know what to do to make her feel better at this point. She feels too depressed because of remembering everything and especially the thing that happened with my brother. 

That thing particularly makes her not want to continue it because she can‚Äôt feel like my family is going to accept her which isn‚Äôt true but she wants some kind of reassurance or proof of something. I don‚Äôt know what to do and how to help her out in this situation. What should I do?",12Apr2020,3

3,"I've been a long time sufferer of depression which over the years I have managed with varying success but over time I have cracked my personal formula to stay on top of it. 

However... with the current state of affairs in the world I am having to self isolate and I have been doing so for the past 4 weeks. And i am struggling. I live in a HMO with 4 other people. 3 people have moved out to isolate with their respective partners or families. Which just leaves me and the final housemate, who unfortunately makes me feel really uncomfortable. 

All of friends, family and my partner are staying together and they dont seem to understand how much i am hating it and cannot cope. Most of my time I am completely alone and the rest of the time i feel very scared and uncomfortable. 

For 3 weeks I was working from home which helped as it gave me something to do during the day and helped me to focus on something/was a great distraction. Last week I was furloughed for the forseeable future. Now i don't know what to do with myself during the day and i find myself getting in my head thinking bad thoughts that i cant pull myself out of. 

My partner is a key worker who lives with their family. I'm trying not to burden them with my problems but also have the urge to explain the severity of my issues because i feel like i'm falling down a really slippery slope. The past few days i felt they have been distant from me and hardly speaking to me, and when they do they have been quite off with me. I know they are tired and working hard but im not bombarding them with messages. I just want to check in on them and their families to make sure they are okay. Tonight i saw on insta that they have followed lots of young attractive women which has just added fuel to my depression fire and what was left of my little self esteem has now gone. 

I feel completely hopeless and i dont know what to do. Im shouting out to everyone as best as i can for help but no one can hear me. The cloud over my head gets larger everyday and my will to fight and stay postive is now feeling weaker than ever.",12Apr2020,3

6,"Hi, Some context: I‚Äôm 20 yr old female &amp; 2 months away from graduating with a bachelors. These past few months have been absolute hectic. I had to move back home to a verbally abusive mother, my boyfriend got a full time job so I‚Äôll be hearing way less of him, online classes have been a struggle, and everyday I‚Äôm left to over think things. I feel extremely anxious about  finding a job once I graduate since it‚Äôs so soon. And I feel like no one will take me seriously because of my age. 

I really want some advice on how to get my spirts back. I used to hold great conversations with people and tell jokes but lately I can‚Äôt pull myself together enough. I feel boring and I can barley hold a conversation with my boyfriend. I feel bad for giving him lame short replies, he‚Äôs a very sarcastic and funny person in nature so me not being able to match that energy has been extremely depressing. 

Any support/advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like too, I‚Äôm always open to making friends üíõ",12Apr2020,1
7,"This is my first post here so I'm gonna provide some context, I'm trans (ftm) and gay. I'm out to most of my family. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I've been seeing my therapist for about 2 years and I see her once a week (due to social distancing I haven't/won't be seeing her until all this is over) and I take anti-depressants. I've been struggling for years, even as a kid I was sad a lot and at around 8 already wanted to genuinely kill myself. And even though at the time I didn't know why I was so sad, I look back now and it's obvious it was about my gender. I've always been shy and quiet so I never said anything about how I was feeling as a kid, I felt weird and different and didn't want my parents to mad or upset with me so I just endured the sadness. Growing up my parents fought a lot, and my parents and my brother fought a lot too. So I just tried to stay out of everything and be on everyone's good side, not wanting to start anymore conflicts then what was already going around. A lot of people find the fact that I was trying to stay out of things and be as good as I possibly could a good thing, and to some degree it is, but those habits are still with me and have gotten worse. The initial thought of ""I don't want to upset anyone"" has turned into the thought of ""I can't upset anyone because if I do they'll never forgive me and I'll loose someone I care about."" The initial thought of ""I'll just wait until things get better to speak my mind"" turned into the thought of ""things will never get better and I don't want my problems making things worse or stressful for somebody else."" I'm always scared of talking to friends or family out of fear they'll get upset or I'll make their lives more stressful. There's a lot to get into but this post is far long enough, point is I'm sad and lonely.",12Apr2020,2

23,"I need to vent.
Everything is getting difficult for me right now.

I'm 23.
I've been in a relationship with a girl for about 5 months. She was my first real girlfriend. She told me all the things like 'you're the only person who had made me feel that way'. I felt loved, which was the best thing ever as my life was pretty blank.

The relationship got abusive quickly. She was very demanding, controlling, after some time, started being aggresive, putting me down, doing lots of fake breakups, putting me through a rollercoaster of emotions, etc. It was abusive, but there were many good moments, we confessed love to each other a lot. She started studying abroad. She wanted me to visit her. I loved her so I did it once. Then, did it the second time, cause she didn't want to spend christmas alone. The abuse was increasing, but she wanted me to come to her, and I had lots of hopes. The day before christmas, she broke up with me saying some weird excuse, like we are not meant for each other, our personalities don't match, etc. altough she was saying very different things before. I basically put a lot of effort in this relationship, put myself in completely and than felt like being tossed aside, like all the things that we've been through didn't matter. I was stupid because I agreed on being friends with her post breakup and lived with her for some days until my flight back home. I've been contacting her for some time later on. But all this time it seemed like she just used me to complain about her life and ask me for help because she couldn't get her life together (although she dumped me), and was often disrespectful to me. She also showed me a lot of hate post breakup, as if what happened was my fault. I couldn't stand it, so I finally went full no contact which I keep to this day (should've done it as soon as she broke up with me). 

The problem is that during the pandemic I can't move over her, I'm just staying home thinking about all the traumatic experiences I've had with her. It doesn't seem to go away. I don't have any motivation, I can't try meeting new people right now, I'm just depressed, left with my anxieties, and cry often. The things got even worse. I've seen on her instagram that there is some guy she's meeting. She spends time with him during pandemic. She could've been meeting him before our break up, becuase I think she was meeting him short after the breakup with me. That thought makes me feel even more humiliated, like some trash without any value. I lost trust for people and feel jealous all the time. I can't stop ruminating about this.

Some part of me wants her back because I feel lonely, and miss all the good moments, but I know it was an abusive relationship (I think she is either narcissist or borderline, unfortunately). I just feel too weak for all this - I feel like I'm in a void of negativity and that it will persist for a very long time.

If you have any advice of how to overcome this kind of situation or have a similar situation, please share",12Apr2020,2

28,"Hi everyone,

I've been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. (I'm not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them.) Now, I've looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. 

Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know it's not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, I'm not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad.

I've read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this.

Thank you for reading :)",12Apr2020,9

36,"I'm 23. Depression runs in my family on my mom's side. I started having symptoms when I was 10 following my parents' divorce. When I was 11, I told my mom I didn't understand what the point of being alive was. Having suffered from depression herself, she took me to a psychiatrist. At 11, I was diagnosed with major depression and started taking medication. I have never been able to stop taking antidepressants. From the 6th grade until now, I have been taking antidepressants.

I've been hospitalized multiple times, once for a 2 month period. Due to a combination of depression, anxiety, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. It's not that being hospitalized or going to therapy doesn't help, but I feel like I'm so used to being depressed that I can't remember what it's like to not be depressed. I've had several psych evaluations over the years. The last one I had when I was 17. At that point, I was in a relatively good place and I was genuinely surprised to hear that my results still indicate that I have major depression after all these years.

At 23 now my symptoms are worse again, and they are exacerbated by other medical conditions that I've developed. I have narcolepsy, which literally triples the amount of tiredness and fatigue I feel. I have chronic headaches and muscle spasms. And I have Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder, which caused me to start having joint issues getting recurring tendonitis around the time I was 19. I've had acute tendonitis at least 5 times, and I've had chronic tendon problems in my hips and shoulders for three years. I already have mild arthritis. My body feels and behaves like the body of someone who is much older than 23. I know exercise helps me feel better, but a lot of the time I feel like I can't really even go on a short walk without causing pain that might last for days.

I'm just so tired and I feel like everything just keeps coming down and getting worse. And everything feels so pointless. Things that should make me smile make me cry when I think about them because I don't enjoy a lot of things anymore. And I don't even know if there is any chance that I will ever be able to stop taking medication. Every time I've tried to go off of my meds, it's been a failure. I take 4 prescription meds every day and they have significant side effects. I hate taking medication that fixes one problem and causes another one.

The stimulant medication I have to take during the day partially masks some of my symptoms and I have a slight boost of energy and mood, but it's short lived.

They're currently angry at me and they're blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I can't talk to them or make them understand how I feel.

42,"So my boyfriend &amp; I have been together 5 years this August! He is 23 &amp; I am 22.

I have suffered with depression since I was 18,  (my bf and I had been dating in school for a year when It started) and Ialways found it difficult to open up to him and be clear about how I was feeling and why. It would often result in a lot of arguments for us with me saying things like ‚Äòwhy havent you asked how I am‚Äô ‚Äòwhy dont you check to see if im ok‚Äô ‚Äòwhy arent you ever asking questions about my life‚Äô 

Fast forward 4 years and we live together. Honestly, i‚Äôd say im mentally stronger and given us both growing up, I am definatly better at communicating how I feel, and he is better at listening and working round my triggers &amp; understanding. However I do sometimes feel like when he is listening to how Im feeling all I get is a ‚Äòyeah baby I know‚Äô or a ‚ÄòI understand, you‚Äôve had it tough babe‚Äô. The verbal response I get honestly, is not so great and sometimes this still really really infuriates me.

However when I have had a breakdown (which are becoming more &amp; more rare thanks to my therapy sessions) he will make sure he holds me whilst I cry, and will get me out of old clothes into new ones, he‚Äôll wipe my tears and tell me Im beautiful &amp; amazing and he‚Äôll cook me a meal, or tell me that we‚Äôll order something, or some days he will run me a bath &amp; tell me to use all my nice smelling creams etc.

Should I stop being ungrateful and focus on the nice things he does? Or should I just speak to him  about his verbal responses? Honestly I do have a REALLY complicated life and he has said its overwhelming at times. I have accepted sometimes men can get stuck in what to say when a women is having a meltdown! Should I go easy on him a bit &amp; appreciate all the other nice things he does?
