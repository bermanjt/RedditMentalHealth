0,"Lately I've found myself on here alot, and have tried to give help or encouragement whenever I can. However I've also realised I need help myself, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm stuck in a home that makes me miserable (neighbourhood factors) and feeling like I dont deserve my partner. I just want to raise my average mood and quality of life. Where I live is a tough place to get out of. There isnt opportunities and they dump everyone in here... drug dealers, drug addicts, but not the harmless ones that only ruin themselves... the ones that wouldnt hesitate to hit you with a bottle and stab you with what remains. The ones who dont seem to leave the house without a baseball bat and the ones who get into fights at least twice a week. My family wont visit me because they're scared to come here and I cant afford transport. The only jobs are temporary or part time, all minimum wage and I wont be able to feed us on that but I need a purpose. I'm sick of feeling so lost. Im a diagnosed scitzophrenic and the doctors wont help me. They won't give me medication for it, nor therapy. It takes alot for me to gather enough courage or trust to speak to a doctor, but when I do they seem to do the same as the rest. Ignore me. 

A poorly insulated one bedroom ground floor flat with nothing to insulate sound, neighbours who seem to take turns to party and get drunk (genuinely every single day). Loud music and shouting until dawn and then when I finally get to sleep, their kids, or dogs wake up and make a racket waking me up. Then it's hours of thump thump thump of their speakers and the smell of ash tray, weed and trash as they empty their bins into the bushes at my windows. Front door covered in fag-ends, ladies hygiene products, nappies (diapers) and smashed bottles because they dont know what an ashtray or a bin is. My family never bothering to speak to me, invite me to gatherings or even let me know they're happening, and the fact that due to my rather unstable mental state I find making friends generally impossible as I dont trust them one bit

2,"Fiancée and I had our first major fight. She told me that I don't get to decide that I'm mad because I broke her boundaries but I told her the reason I was mad was because she always assumed I was joking when I told her to stop something because I didn't like it. She drove aggressively and gaslighted me when I told her not to. I am currently suicidal. When I made a off handed remark she said ""don't kill me too"" which I don't want while I want to kill myself. I ended up cutting. When I tried to talk about it she turned it into ""you never apologized for any of your mistakes"" when I actually had been. I want shit to work especially since I can't afford rent alone and I just got an esa cat. I'm taking time away by staying with my mom and grandma for the night. I want to make it work but I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. I feel like I'm too broken to actually be a good person to be with. We make each other happy most of the time and we love each other but I'm starting to wonder if it's enough. All I want to do is curl up and die.

5,"So, I have struggled with depression since i was 12. It was a very strenuous process that resulted in one attempt and finally me stabilizing. I'm ok now. I still have small moments where I'm overcome and self harm through hitting myself or pinching but mostly I know how to cope and prevent those moments. 

My friend revealed to me that her son (whom is like 8 or 9) will hit or pinch himself when upset. I've tried to explain to her that he should see a therapist but that's just not the kind of person she is or the kind of environment we live in. I'm worried he may be struggling with something and I want him to get the help he needs. 

What can I do?",13Sep2020,2
6,"I had another thread going about how my wife is suffering from depression, and I was curious, recently she has been having anger issues and is always mad at me, about things that occurred early in the relationship, albeit, yes they weren't good things(name calling during fights etc) we typically talked about it and resolved it and that type of shit activity doesn't take place any longer once I realized what I was doing to her and how wrong I was(I had anger issues).She now gravitates back to these and has doubts about the marriage and stuff because of this. Though I know she pushed the feelings down obviously - I don't think the issues are anywhere near as large as she has made them out to be in her head currently. Is this common with depression, or should I be significantly more concerned with this at the same time as trying to get the depression taken care of?  


Edit :: Obviously I want to address those feelings if she feels that way, I don't want people to think I don't. But I'm more concerned if its an actual HUGE issue that can't be tackled after the depression as that is amplifying the actual gravity of it.",13Sep2020,1
7,"this is my first ever post on reddit so if i’m in the wrong place, please let me know. i honestly only made an account so i could put this here. also i figured i should put a TW for suicide (just a mention, but i marked it nsfw just in case)

it’s a long one, so strap in folks. this will also probably be all over the place, but if you’re reading this, thanks for taking the time out of your day to listen to me. 

i’m 17 years old and i’ve been struggling with my mental health for a long LONG time and this isn’t the first time i’ve reached out for help, but this is the time i’ve been most serious about it. i wanted to know what it’s like getting diagnosed, especially as a minor. can i go to my regular doctor for that? can they diagnose me then and there and get me a prescription the same day? am i going to need to see a specialist or something? i’d like to try getting medication for depression but i’m afraid of being shut down either by my parents or my doctor. this is not some mild teen angst thing. i know i need real professional help. i’m not actively suicidal but it has gotten...bad before and i don’t want it to get to that point again which is why i’m reaching out, but it seems as though nobody is listening to me. i know that if i’m going to get help i need to actually commit to it and stand my ground but i want to know what i’m getting into first. first and foremost, my mother is somewhat anti-medication. she’s not some super crazy karen anti-vax but when i’ve opened up to her before, she always recommends exercise, essential oils, more sleep, fruits/vegetables, etc., which is incredibly discouraging to me. don’t get me wrong, i know that they help in the short term and i have incorporated them all into my life, but it’s not a cure. and i’m not saying that pills are a cure either, but i need more management options. i think part of her issue with me getting medication is that she was diagnosed with anxiety or something related a long time ago and her medication didn’t help. my older sister has also been diagnosed w an anxiety disorder and said that meds made it worse. is that genetic? that worries me because then i’m mostly out of options. therapy really isn’t realistic for me right now because it’s 1. expensive and 2. i live in a rural area so i don’t really have many therapists nearby and covid makes things even more complicated. if i did have the means to see someone, it would need to be over the phone/computer and i honestly don’t think i can open up without being in person and without fear of my very nosy and intrusive family listening in. i have a doctors appointment scheduled in early october for a flu shot and a check-up and i was thinking about saying something there. the only issue is running it by my mother first and seeing what she says. i know she’s not entirely unwilling to get me medication and there was an incident early this year when she did say i could see a doctor about it, but then quarantine threw all of that off the table and i never said anything to her again. i’m also worried about her backtracking and asking me to hold off on getting help before because “it’s not that bad.” she’s done that before and it really really hurt me. the next part about that is overcoming the embarrassment of having to sit in the doctors office and tell them what’s going on. first off, i’ve never been in a doctors office without my mother before. i’d like her to leave but i just don’t know how to ask for fear of making her get all weird about it. plus, this is a double appointment so my 13 yr old brother will be in the same room and getting his well visit at the same time, which sucks even more. i know i can ask them to go but i just feel so awkward about it. when is the right time to ask them to leave the room? should i mention something to the doctor beforehand and have a private talk with them at the end? during well visits they always ask about mental well-being and i always lie on those questions and i think it’s weird if im just like “uhhh actually yeah i have a problem.” which brings me to my next point about actually talking to a doctor. i’ve never been very good at putting how i feel into words. i don’t want to worry about making them overly concerned, but i also don’t want to downplay how i feel and get brushed off. if i go to the doctors and they don’t do anything for me, it’ll be a long time before i ever work up the courage to seek help again. but i know that in the end this is something i need to at least try to do. also, let’s say i get on medication. what’s it like? how long does it take until you notice things are better/worse? if one kind doesn’t work, should i switch to something else? how expensive is medication? 

TLDR: i’m depressed and want to get help. here are my questions: 
- can i go to my regular doctor for mental health help? 
- can they diagnose me then and there and get me a prescription the same day? 
- am i going to need to see a specialist or something?
- how do i tell my 13yr old brother and my mom to scram and leave the room so i can talk to my doctor about mental health help? 
- should i give my doctor a heads up before so that we can get my well visit out of the way and then talk? 
- if my mom and my sister both tried medication for their anxiety and it made things worse for them, will trying medication also be worse for me?
- what’s is going on meds like? 
- how long does it take until you notice things are better/worse? 
- if one kind doesn’t work, should i switch to something else? 
- how expensive is treatment? 


anyways, there’s my rant. if you made it this far, thank you for reading through my late-night vent bullshit. if you can answer some questions, give me some advice, or just some encouragement it would be greatly appreciated. love you all and stay safe.

note: i should also mention i am from the US. also not sure if my insurance would cover my treatment.",13Sep2020,51

I just nap and watch a bunch of shit on youtube all day long just to fill up the 'void' I feel all the time. I feel like crying but no tears won't come out. I don't talk to anyone about this because I feel like they won't understand me or think I'm faking it. There was one time I talked about what I was feeling to my 2 closest friends. I get that maybe they were trying to help, and they didn't know what to say, but their ""attempt"" to make me feel better was by saying everyone experiences it and that its normal.

today was the first time i logged into discord as a friend i met through twitter invited me to their group chat then i saw her username in the messages and clicked on it which was a stupid mistake. i saw the messages of her breaking up with me of us going back and forth with me begging for her to stay trying to explain with her not having it and saying how she wanted nothing to do with me anymore i probably shouldn't have but i scrolled up and read the messages until i relived through the entire conversation. what followed afterward was a mix of a anxiety attack i honestly felt like i was gonna throw up it felt like someone punched me in the stomach. i just feel so pathetic even tho its been a year and i haven't seen her in a long time this is how i reacted to seeing year old text messages i just feel like im pathetic for acting the way i did after seeing those messages i just need someones advice",13Sep2020,1
17,"My native language is Spanish, and right now I am not sure of my grammar.

* A little bit of context in random order*

We started our relationship 6 years ago, in high school, so we see each other almost every time for 3 years. She went to de college and I had to work cuz I didn't passed the test. This was our first real trouble for long. We live like 2 or 3 hours of distance, so we couldn't see so frequently. However we spend 3 days together every week, unless I need to go work to other place for a few weeks, never more than a month.

Since the pandemic start in our country, we haven't seen since April. We did have called and zoomed (crazy that zoomed is a new verb),but never in person, even though our friends and social contacts are having meetings. My parents are older than 55,both with some troubles with the lungs, so they are really afraid of this.

My dad is a teacher from preschool to college, but he's not into tech, barely knows how to use the smartphone, and check the mail on the laptop. As all the clases are now online I spend from Tuesday to Friday helping him with the camera, the laptop, plying music, using Muppets (he is the arts teacher), so my time just reduces. Also spend some time repairing our home.

*the breaking*

Two months ago, my gf just stop responding my messages, calls and everything else for a week and a half. She called me and said she was not more into this. That I totally changed into another person to be accepted in our social life (I've never been of many friends). Also said that I was giving less time than before coronav.
We talked about everything, kind of solved it, but still felt tense...
Today she told me that she was totally fed up of everything.
So she said that we should just let it go and that she was out of this...

*help*

Right now, I haven't been able to tell anyone about this. I do have 4 really close friends, and some other of the college who have been nice with me, but never really into a deep relation. Also it's hard to me to show how much depressed I'm now, cuz I've been always trying to help...
I'm not sure of what I want to hear (or read, in this case), I'm not so confident of sharing my troubles with my family or friends. So I'm here taking advantage of the anonymity... Hopefully someone see this, but for now maybe it works for me as a relief.

20,"Hey all,

Created an alt account so I could share my thoughts here. First of all, thanks for creating and using this subreddit to be there for others and provide support.

Just some background, I have always been someone who studied hard at school with the belief that getting top marks would mean a successful future. This meant that I had always sacrificed social life and making valuable friendships when I was younger.

Fast forward a few years. I started my career in the finance industry and started climbing up the ladder. Over time, I had always had this burning desire to start a business in the finance sector (to help people be financially free). This was something I would openly share and discuss with people, about how I wanted to accomplish so many things. 

However, I would just talk about it - but wouldn't take any action, thinking I would always do it later once I grew further in my career.

Right now, I am 31. I am in a reasonably senior position at an investment bank, and still want to do something with my life. 

I appreciate that I am in a pretty good situation and have plenty of things to be happy about. However, I am just depressed with this notion of where I could be in my life and how I haven't yet achieved my dreams. I keep ""talking"" about my business ideas, but don't take any action.

I feel like a failure and that I haven't achieved anything with my life. People who had barely passed when I was in school have started businesses, have got higher positions and so on.

I can't help but compare myself to my benchmark and to others, and feel constantly depressed.

I realize this isn't healthy at all, but it just keeps bringing me down. Keen to get some thoughts on how to cope with this constant thought of being a ""failure"".

I even feel guilty of feeling depressed (if that makes sense), as I know that I am in a reasonably well-off position that other people would be striving for.

Figured I would just share my thoughts here.

Thanks.",13Sep2020,2

I don't know if I'm really in need of help or if I'm really suffering from this mental illness, It's like I'm faking it for attention or something, especially because of my age(14). I'm really frightened by talking to my parents because it contains details that I'm rather not comfortable confessing, yet I'm also scared of visting a therapist or a doctor due to the possibility of it being all in my head. I don't know who to talk to, I lost all my friends that I could've maybe talked to. I feel guilty of feeling this way, and I'm afraid to bring this up due to being mocked for trying to get attention.


I feel like everday is just a chore, the things and activities I used to enjoy and love doing became dull and lifeless, all I want to do is just sleep and forget about everything. It's just the feeling of everything going downhill , and me just letting it be that way. I've lost many, if not all the people who cared, and the love and care that the few people do give for me is completley undeserved. It's as if I'm losing everything, my grades, my friends and teachers, my love for doing the things I used to do, my motivation, like it all just disappeared. I just miss the people I was the closest with, the people who cared and considered me as a close friend of them, now I've moved too far and they just vanish. I can't make new friends as they just can't compare to someome I knew closely for 8 years, I try my best to make new friends, but it just doesn't work. I just don't find life as enjoyable as it used to be, I don't look forward to anything anymore, I just want to be in bed and sleep.

26,"My bf and I were arguing about something now, and like every other time I feel down or depression hits hard, I cry a lot and can't really cope with my feelings.

Everyday negative thoughts go through my mind and I was talking to my bf about those, about how I always feel like everything I do is wrong, how I feel ugly most of the time, how I feel like a pain in the ass for most things I do or say. I just wanted him to hold me, hug me, put my hair behind my ear and say that it isn't true, say that he doesn't see me like that, refute all those negative thoughts in a loving and comprehensive way. Help me eliminate them.

But, like all other times I brought that up, he seemed to be angry about it. Angry that *again* I'm thinking those things. Angry that I don't seem to listen all those times before, that I don't understand once and for all that those negative thoughts are wrong.

But I know they are wrong! I know that, but still they appear and when I talk to him for that is because I failed in making them go away on my own. I talk to him because I need help! I told him that and he only seemed to be bored that I brought up those issues again. He never says that I look pretty, he never says my body looks great, he isn't this type of person, he show more than he tell. However I still need to hear that I'm pretty, that I say interesting things, that he likes to spend time with me. I don't need it to be constantly, but I still need it. And when he finally says those things he say in a ""I can't stand anymore you repeating those things"" way? How can I truly make the bad thoughts go away with that atitude?

But again, I feel bad for that. I suffer a lot from those thoughts and I do ask for help quite often, but my psychiatrist does the help most of the time. The last time I asked my bf for help was more than a month ago. Still I feel like I'm horrible for wanting him to be more comprehensive. I feel horrible for wanting him to be nicer and don't appear like I'm just a pain in the ass for saying those things and asking for help. I just wanted him to make me feel better, not to make me feel worse.

Am I a horrible person for wanting one hug and a refutation of those thoughts in a sweet way instead of a touch in my back and a ""I already told you that's not true""?",13Sep2020,5

So about two months ago I met someone online, since then we've been chatting for a long time and a ridiculous amount of hours per day, I am aware that he had depression in the past (since he told me). Recently he got covid, so since that happened he hasn't been social and stuff, I tried keeping in contact as much as possible and so has he. We'll he just came covid negative today but he also checked all the marks for having depression again, he was very sad to tell me we might not be able to chat for a while since antidepressants pretty much take all his energy and make him just want to be left alone.
This is my first time dealing with someone I really enjoy having been hit with post-covid depression and I've never dealt with it so I'm here to ask for advices, I've been trying to only say positive things and stuff that won't make it seem like I'm very sad (which I am).

Also found out that he had feelings for S while we were together even though he had denied it when questioned while we were still dating. I've gotten mad at him for spending too much time with his friends and colleagues instead of with me. He said I was being controlling, that I didn't understand his job. S was his colleague and ""friend"". I finally realised why he was acting the way he was towards the end of our relationship. I feel so betrayed. And heartbroken. I guess deep down I still love him. And I'm afraid I'll slip into depression again (will be the third time). I don't know what to do... Should I ask to meet him for closure? Even thought it's been 1.5 years since our breakup and I'm currently in a relationship, sometimes I still find myself crying at night thinking of him or he'll appear in my dreams and I end up crying too. 

There are so many things going on in my mind right now and it feels like I'm spiralling out of control. I see my friends getting married, having children, buying their first houses. Yet I'm here, approaching 29 and nowhere close to meeting my dream of marrying the love of my life and having 2 kids with him before 30. I can't believe I gave 10 years of my youth to a guy who moved on so easily. 

I know I shouldn't compare my life with others but I can't help it. Why can't I have a loving family and not have any money troubles like the people around me? I've been giving so much of myself to others, to my family, to work, to friends, that I don't have any of myself left. Friends who don't understand depression say that it's because I have negative thoughts. I've been asked to think happy thoughts, to stop feeling so down, as if it's a switch that I can press to turn it off. What I've said in confidence have been used against me too. So now I don't tell them how I really feel.

I am 17, I don't have a good relationship with my parents, and I currently reside with my grandma. I never go outside or do anything besides work. I'm not going anywhere in life, and i feel like ending it is the best option. Ok so now since some background information is out of the way i want to tell my story. I don't care if anyone reads it or responds to it. So my story begins on mothers day 2019. I had just officially got my first girlfriend. I was so happy as i was an exceptionally quiet kid. Our relationship moved extremely fast and we were extremely happy together. My life was perfect until June 14th. On June 14th i was working at my grandpa's trailer park spraying weed killer. The day started out pretty typical and good. Then my dad broke the news that my mom had an affair that's been going on since the fall of 2017 and that everyone else in my family had known except me. I had always viewed my dad as the bad guy and always defended my mom. My mom and I were extremely close and i trusted her more then anyone else on the planet. My brain couldn't handle this new information. Over the course of a couple weeks i began a descend into madness. I became more aggressive and mean. Well this all accumulated at my gf birthday party.  We got into a big fight and it permanently cause a schism between us. After the fight I tried to make up it to her, and became so attached to her. I would lay down my life for someone that barely should and compassion towards me. This further caused me to spiral. In August i had a mental breakdown and had to quit my job. I was jobless for a good month and my dad wouldn't leave me alone about not having a job. He wouldn't talk about anything else with me. I then started to turn to drugs to cope with the stress and pressure. I smoked weed every day, drank extensively and vaped. Then October rolled around. I built up the courage to confront my Gf about her treating me poorly. She gas lighted me by saying I was an awful boyfriend and that i did nothing for her. This destroyed me. It pushed me further into drugs. we got back together a couple weeks later. Only for her to tell me she didn't love me anymore after telling me that she did. This again wrecked me. I accepted it, but barely slept and my drinking became alcoholic levels. Then about 3 weeks later she called me crying about how she did love me and how she couldn't live without me. I went back. Nothing changed. But i made myself believe things were better. around that same time all of this stuff was happening my friend group was fighting. my girlfriend was the cause of most of the fighting. That furthered my stress and anxiety as i was put in the middle of it all. In December My girlfriend start posting extremely racy pictures on her Instagram. I told her that it made me feel unconformable and that i didn't like it. She yelled at me and told me that she can do whatever she wants. So i broke up with her. Then that night i got extremely drunk. I saw her posting a racy picture on snap chat and broke down. I texted her that i needed help and that i didn't want to live anymore.  She just told me to get over it and blocked me. I lost it completely. I walked upstairs and grabbed a kitchen knife. My mom saw me and Stopped me. They sent me to the stress center. Fast forward to Christmas. I asked this really nice girl out and she said yes. I was so happy again. Until i went back to my Ex. I lost a lot of friends doing that. We broke up again and this time i was completely done with her. But the damage had already been done. I lost good friends and many people lost their trust in me. They saw me as unstable and weak. My self loathing increased. I then attempted to Kill myself 4-5 more times. Then on Mothers day 2020 My friends and i went down to see my new girlfriend, who lived down in the capital of my state. Well everyone else beside me and my friend decided to get high. One the the girls got extremely emotional and started crying. I calmed her down at the expense of getting lost at night on the freeway. We then got further lost in a very bad area at 10:30. We all had to be home by 11. My dumbass decided to book it home. I scared everyone in the car so badly that one of my friends called the cops while they were HIGH. Weed is illegal in my state btw. Well my friends all told me that they weren't my friends anymore and left me. Even some that weren't in the car with me. I lost my Best best friend which killed me. I again turned to drugs. I started selling. My parents found out and I left to go live with my grandma. Ever since then i've been completely alone. No friends, Barely are family that doesn't see me as a failure. No one to love. Ive had to fight these battles all alone, no one to cry too. I cant even cry anymore. I just want a friend. My Misanthropy and disillusionment has grown immensely. I Hate the world. I only want to destroy everyone and everything at this point. I just want to feel loved again. Its all i want. Please anyone Please.",13Sep2020,3
38,"One night after moving back into university halls of residence last year, I basically watched Porn Hub for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height.

I'd also already experienced false memories by this point, and very unusual, irrational obsessive worries about hurting children. This originated from the extreme distress I felt after finding out that an ex-teacher is a pedophile. The overbearing empathy and sympathy I feel towards people in general led me to believe that I was somehow to 'blame', unnecessarily.

That night, I would go from lying on the front of my chest and humping the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching the different bits of the same Porn Hub video on my phone, to then sitting back up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 18 month-old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after sitting up in bed again. 

At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. 

Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to the lewd stuff, and only then did I kneel down again, but with the video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having wasted my evening watching Porn Hub.

The reason for this guilt is that - as best as I can describe - seeing a baby (the pinnacle of innocence) in the YouTube video made me realise the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers I'd been watching. I felt heavy guilt for objectifying them, as well as a hypocrite who talks about the importance of feminism.

Even though the videos were obviously different, my mind basically told me that going to watch porn again after watching an unrelated interview video that - just happened - to have a baby in it, somehow made me an ''anti-feminist'', an ''evil person'', and a pedophile.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know. I remember going to the sink afterwards, dry-vomiting because of this guilt, and then eventually calming myself down through talking to myself for an hour step-by-step. The next morning, I wasn't stressed.

How my brain has twisted all of this is to say I humped the bed to the point of ejaculation while staring at the paused video image of Kurt and his baby.

I have no explicit sensory recall of any of this. But obviously, the more I've obsessively ruminated about it, the more the 'image' in my head has gone from being grainy at best to very detailed. Yet again, I don't remember the sensations of any of this. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite. Plus, this worry only arrived in May.

I literally remember feeling content and happy/making different mental leaps forward at further points towards the rest of 2019, and on New Year's, and not being worried about anything, let alone this. Surely, I couldn't have done this and 'repressed' it?

Yet, I still feel like a liar and fraud who shouldn't live, and has been lying to himself for the last 11 months. 

The guilt and stomach pains and sore throat is so painful, and I keep losing sleep. It's gotten so bad that I tried to hang myself earlier today, but I stopped myself before pushing the chair away.

I'm due to collect a new prescription for mirtazipine (for depression) and propranolol (for this intrusive thought and anxiety) tomorrow, hopefully. First OCD therapist appointment is on Thursday, as I've realized I most likely have POCD, which fits in with my history of obsessive compulsions; plus, Asperger's makes me obsess a lot over the past too. At this point though, all the anxieties have left me; I know I'm not like my teacher and never will be, it's just this one intrusive thought that is preventing me from moving on.

My mum and brother and friends keep telling me I didn't do it, as well as my own inner voice/event recall; though, I'm wary of the addictive nature of being constantly reassured. 

Mum said, ''Worst case scenario, you did it; after watching that stuff for 5 hours and being as low as you said you were, you might've made a mistake. That said, I'm pretty certain, because I know you Dec, that you wouldn't do that''.

So, at the moment I'm 50/50, but more inclined to think I didn't do it. My brain keeps going from doubting to hopeful, and it's killing me, but I hope things get better. I want to move on with my life so bad, but the niggling voice tells me that I 'ruined' it.

What do you think?",13Sep2020,2
39,"P.S: i am sorry the writing is not clear my head is not clear
 I just graduated engineering school with a decent GPA , but since i live in a 3rd world authirtian decoratorship ; i got enlisted in the army as an officer for 3 years(without any salary), so it's practically slavery . Since the announcement I can't think straight in any thing, and i have got multiple panic and anger attacks . My life became useless , imagine being fresh graduate at the age of 27 and you got your degree 3.5 years prior to that at the age of 23 .",13Sep2020,4
40,"About three years ago I decided to step back from society until I got my surgery. It was a pretty stressful time and one night I smoked weed and suffered a panic attack (my first ever). That weed was probably moldy too. 

Ever since that moment, just being alive was excruciatingly painful. I couldn’t focus, or watch tv, or read a book without suffering another panic attack. 

I was put on anti-depressants, which made everything just a bit less painful. I still had to walk around in the city on many days, because just sitting on the couch and doing nothing was unbearable. 

Now three years in, I stopped taking meds two months ago and switched to 5-htp. I stopped that too around 2 days ago and feel so bad right now. 

I can’t really explain, I feel something weird in my belly that keeps me from focusing. If I watch a movie I lose focus 10+ times and have to rewind if I want to get the story. 

I’m so sad and feel hopeless even though I know what I would like to do with my life, but after that incident with the weed, I just lack the drive all of a sudden. 

Before that I was really driven. I don’t know what’s wrong with me 😕.",13Sep2020,11
41,"Like I know that self-harming is bad, and I shouldn't do it. It's just, I dont know how to describe it. They bring me joy? And satisfaction? And I know it's not right. I read to many books to not know it. 

But I like looking at them dripping, and then healing. And when they are healed I just like running my hands along them to feel the texture. 

I know it's not healthy, but I really dont know how to stop, because they're already there and I'm not harming myself when I look at them? And then I want to add to the ""collection"", so to speak, and then it's done, and I cant do anything about the new one, accept let it heal? 

And I know I should probably talk to someone about it, but I don't want to worry anybody. And I want to stop but at the same time i dont want to? 
And I thought that if I had a replacement for them it would be easier? But I cant think of anything to replace the feeling of satisfaction that they bring!",13Sep2020,1
42,I'm 22. I swear I'm not creepy. I'm just really sad and all my friends are happy and I just don't know how to be happy. I'm depressed and I hate my life and I hate the person I am. Please talk to me I promise I won't be a bore. I like anime and videogames and I fall asleep to asmr every night.,13Sep2020,38
43,"Do I go to a general practitioner? Do they prescribe antidepressants/anti anxiety medication? Or do I see a therapist? Or both? Do I have to go a mental hospital if I’m having suicidal thoughts? What about payment? I’m insured but can all insurance be excepted everywhere?

TLDR: I’ve never sought help for my mental disorders and I’m unsure on how to get started with treatment. Please help and thank you!",13Sep2020,3
44,"I won’t tell you every single detail. I’ll answer questions if you have them but I had a hysterectomy in 2018 and around that time is when I believe my husband started using drugs which turned into mental and physical abuse and him cheating on me. He got arrested and moved in with his girlfriend. I was severely depressed to the point where I’d force myself to eat. I didn’t think I was good enough to be loved having been told so by him. 

I met my boyfriend in January 2019 after having lost about 70lbs from the depression. I had at that point started to get healthy as the husband was in jail and I wasn’t be constantly harassed and other factors in my life just getting better. In May 2019, he was out of jail and we went to the first court date for the divorce. The next day he hung himself. We have three kids so I was again depressed but for different reasons. I was in a relationship but it felt like I lost my husband twice. This time as the father of my kids. I just wanted him to get better and be a father. 

Anyhow at that point my weight loss cane to a halt. Even though I had been doing good and eating right I’d lost about 15lbs the healthy way. It’s now Sept 2020 and about a month ago I started trying again with some light exercise and dieting. I’ve lost like maybe 2 lbs. I had to go dress shopping for an outdoor wedding we are going to attend and I cried in the dressing room. This was yesterday. I feel like I’m doomed to be overweight and I’m entirely sick of people telling me “you look good”. No I don’t. I’m not healthy and I’m at least 50lbs from being at a healthy weight. I’m short and have short fat legs and having three kids and the fast precious weight loss my stomach is lumpy. I don’t feel good and I’m embarrassed to be seen in a dress with some lame coverup because my arms are gross. I have been crying all day and haven’t cleaned anything in my house and I just don’t know what to do. I wish I could just be normal and lose weight normally and be confident like people twice my size, but I’m not. 

TLDR: I was struggling with depression and lost a lot of weight, got better and now struggling again because I cannot seem to lose anymore weight.",13Sep2020,1
45,"I really dob't undertand.. Ot was ok since last friday.. But then a friend was talking to me about his date and was become his boyfriend, i was happy and motivated on a project since a week, like never before, and suddenly a feel of abandon taked me, then anguish, anxiety.. I was totally disabled, I've tried to continue what i was doin, play a game, take air, eating something, looking a movie... Nothing waa working, i was just a piece of crap on feet that was crying for nothing.. Even though she said me she's here for me, she said me i should said this to my therapist because it seems not normal at this point

My background is that, i have depression since i was a kid, i dont really know when it happened, but my father and mother was in perpetual violence, physical and oral, when i was going to school, every day, every weeks, i had a terrible feeling of ""what will happen to me today? How i will manage to don't be seen to don't trigger the kids to come and beat me for the reason i'm not included? How i'll do to pass this day..""

Then, when my terrible day was over, i was thinking non stop how to do to don't trigger my dad to yell at me and said me how a piece of shit i'm, and beat me, throwing me on walls..

When i was sick, and coughing because of it, my mother always said me to cough less hars because my dad didn't like it, to don't cry too loud because my dad will be pissed..

Then my parent divorced, i didnt have the memory but my mother said i've choose to stay with my dad..

Ah yes right, sure, i wanted it..

Then i was literally walking on egg everytime he was here, if the roll of toilet paper was on the last drip, or a glass was somewhere, or the dishwasher wasn't empty, he will trig his infinite rage and will have to dump it on me..

I didn't have the right to don't knowing to do, i should Know what he want me to do before he ask, if i said i didnt know how to or that i was affraid to, he literally said i was finding shitty excuses to don't do thing, so ok i will drill holes a 8 years old without knowing how this sh*t work, and of course i cant fail, so the presure was so. Insane that i didnt event know what was happening in life.

I have the memory that one time, he tried to learn to me how to tie my laces, then i didnt figuring out in 15 sec so was throwed on the flass wall that had broke in piece, then was crying because of the shells of glass on my face, he gived me a slap for crying like a crap

Then, when i had the courage to ask i was beaten at school, he said i should react and insult them or give them a puch.. I wasn't ok with this but for me, my dad was always right and cant said something wrong, ever, ao I've said to the boy of the group that was fat that he was a ""big sac of fat"" and.. Yeah.. He said me to said it again, and i didnt see him he taked it on tape and recorded me..

So then a meeting of teachers was done because of it.. Saying me how bad i'm to done this.. And my dad was just crushed me as always saying that i'm a big cunt to doing that and never said me to do anything like this.

I. Didn't had any hugs, any encouragement, nothing.. My dad was my employer.. Not a dad

I remember when i was home, the feeling of fear, anfuish, anxiety that quickly taking me when i heard the sound hof his diesel vw passat pass on the road below before arriving.. 


Now i struggle with all the shit that caused to me.. Loneliness, struggle to have relationships, and fear of abandon, i have lot of personality disorders and i discover day after day how the lack of affection make me like i'm..

Now was recentl declared invalid to all sort of work.. And i'm alone.. My lack of affection and disorders just push away almost everyone that know me.. I.. Just want some love.. Some affection 😢

I want to die.. I can't handle it.. Or.. Am i?..",13Sep2020,1
46," I can't do it. No matter how many times i promised myself, how many times i tried, how many times i failed and got up just to try again, i just can't fix my life. I'll be 23 in about a month and a half. Or i'll be dead. I guess we'll see.

I'm not even quite sure what's wrong with me, or why i do what i do. Or rather why i don't do what i know i should do. Nobody around me sees this, nobody knows. I'm not really in pain, i'm just a big ball of nothing floating around and taking up space.

I should study for an exam i have tomorrow. Well, i should have studied for the past two weeks. Yet, i haven't even touched it. I'm going to fail this year of college again. My parents payed for all of it, and i'm going to fail again. If you asked me why i didn't study, i couldn't tell you. I can't explain myself, there is nothing i can say in my defense.

I have a loving family. I have people who want to hang out with me that i could call friends. I have no problems finding a girlfriend. I have every ounce of love and support one could need. And none of it fucking matters.

Every couple of months i get a sudden burst of motivation to change something. It lasts for a week or two, and it's in those couple of weeks per year that i have managed to somehow stay afloat. With every burst of motivation, my hope is renewed. Maybe i can actually fix this, maybe i can make something of myself. And every time, i inevitably fail.

When i was younger, i thought i was just lazy. But this is far worse than pure laziness. I see what i have to do. I always know what i have to do. And yet i never do it.

I don't know how much longer can i go on. When i was 16, i thought i'd have a job and live on my own by the time i was 23. Well, 23 is right around the corner and i'm still stuck in the same place, completely by choice.

The only thing i want in this world, is to be able to erase my own existence. I don't want to cause pain to people who love me. I just want to undo myself. That way everybody would be much happier.",13Sep2020,1
47,"So recently I have experienced a number of physical problems.  I have a flight or fight feeling for no particular reason.  It generally starts with hand numbness and a feeling of my immune system acting weird.  Sleeping has become hit or miss.  Certain foods would trigger it as well leading me to believe I have developed a wheat allergy.  It would really seem to come out of nowhere.  Over the last year I had quite smoking a drinking for the most part.  When I do drink I don’t really get that drunk feeling anymore which is weird becasue since early this year I would drink socially a couple times a month.  I did go through a phase of smoking weed daily as a “relaxation” thing.  I went to the ER once in June with stomach issues.  All my blood work and CT scans came back pointing out nothing.  It would seem to be “ all in my head”.  Past vices now don’t really do much for me i.e. smoking, drinking, fast food or food in general.  I am 40 and over weight so it feels like my body and mind decided to turn on all possible check engine lights on.  I have anxiety and depression but not to the point of self harm.  It just feels overwhelming because precious depression and anxiety was more situational or temporary.  The food thing is weird because I don’t really feel hungry or enjoy it yet I haven’t lost much weight even though eating less.  So this is a laundry list of stuff but any comments on feeling similar or suggestions are welcome.  I have started going to the gym and plan to read some Ram Dass- esque books.  I have listened to his old podcast as well as Pete Holmes, Joe Rogan type stuff.  I plan on reading the Four agreements as well just to give an idea of where I’m at.",13Sep2020,1
