3,"So I've either quit or have been fired from all four jobs due to depression and anxiety. I dropped put of college due to total lack of motivation and lethargy. I have been on pills for a few years and so far it's a safety net for the worst of it. We are below the poverty line and although the house and cars are paid for, I have extreme fear of not having enough to eat or get by (despite this absolutely never being the case, people give food and are decently generous). My father, who I knows does love me, in a terrible misguided attempt to try and get me motivated told me ""You probably won't amount to anything"". I am currently enrolled in easter seals but they can't find me a job I can keep or preform. I almost constantly feel like I am a blight on the world and society.

First, being diagnosed by a doctor with a depression is itself scary to me. I never expected this. I feel like I’m being dramatic or blaming my faults on something or using an excuse or something... being on here and reading other posts does make me feel better about believing that maybe it’s really true... maybe I really do have depression.. what could this mean? 

My point is, I’ve never been the type to take medication, even ibuprofen, so an anti-depressant is  scary to me. Has anyone taken Wellbutrin extended release before and found it helpful? I also smoke weed pretty frequently and want to know if it’s safe or if it has negative side affects? I’ve researched but am wondering personal experiences as well.

16,"     My GF is diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthymia for about a year now. Our relationship has been about 7 months already. 

     She's had episodes in the past and one attempt of suicide where she drank bleach. Luckily I was able to call an ambulance to her place (had difficulty knowing her exact address as she lives in a condominium). She had second degree burns in her throat, but she recovered after a few weeks.

     Now she's at a very low state. The past week, she has been really depressed. I thought her call with her therapist was going to be enough (as it usually is), but it wasn't. Her past episodes and attempt had some events that triggered her, but now it's all out of the blue. She also recently told me that last May (before we were together, but we were officially a couple at May 11) that she was thinking to he put in a facility, and again a few months ago and her therapist already made calls, but they weren't accepting patients because of COVID-19. 

      I really love her and I do my best to keep her safe. I've done my research numerous times and I know that as a BF to her, I can only support her. I'm already getting worried as she feels like she has made her decision already. I just don't want to lose her as she's a wonderful woman who loved social work from a very young age. I don't think that I would be able to forgive myself if anything bad happens to her. Any help or suggestions? All of them would be very helpful. Thank you.",28Nov2020,1

Hi,

For the last 2 months, I've been on Fluoxetine and for the past month or so I've been seeing a therapist. I have depression and one of the main ways this manifests is an inability to motivate myself to do even the most basic things. Since taking the anti-depressant things have improved. I am more motivated and less down. Therapy has also helped in this regard too. However, I still sometimes really struggle with trying to motivate myself to study (I'm at University). Some days I can do all the work I planned and more. Other days I struggle to even get out of bed let alone start studying. Today was one of the latter days yet earlier this week was more like the former. I'm now writing this before I try and get on with my assignment as I've managed to talk myself into doing at least part of it but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to make it easier to overcome that obstacle. My therapist has suggested writing a to do list with a routine of when to do things and this does help but sometimes my motivation and mood is so low that I struggle to follow it.

Does anyone have any advice?",28Nov2020,1

21,"((cw-got some uhh. suicidal thoughts, child abuse, substance abuse))

On some days, I can deal with the idea of being alone. I didn't have a good relationship with my family and I was abused pretty often as a developing child, so it's been ingrained into me pretty early on that my parents won't ever genuinely love me lmao. (my mother is dead since 5 yrs ago, and my dad is very passive/absent and its hard to talk about some things with him because he's hardly there, not to mention the language barrier between us..... i never learned our native language because i was so busy AVOIDING my abusive non-english speaking parents my whole entire life up to adolescence so yeah now that thats out of the way lmao)
Fast forward to now, I guess. I'm 24 and I've been taught some self care methods, on some mild medication, and been going to therapy for almost a year. It also turns out that I'm Not That Bad At Making Friends™️

However I'm kind of at a point where I literally absolutely hate every sober moment of my life and no matter how much I try to convince myself how enjoyable being alone (especially while high) is, I still fucking hate it. Having a job helps distract me but now I try to get high at work when I know I don't even need to 😅

Idk maybe now that its the holidays and everyone's posting happy content with their family and friends and its just reminding me how alone I am. I know jealousy is a really ugly emotion but I can't help but feel fucking disgusting and unwanted inside, especially after being dumped recently by a guy who would tell me things like, ""it's YOUR fault that you're like this"" and would just. basically make me feel like shit for being the way I am :') anyways


tl;dr: im tired of being high all the time because thats how i make living bearable for myself and i would like to stop idealizing suicide pls

yes i know some people have it worse, but having an insanely mentally ill mom who never got help for it and took it out on you your whole life and leaving you as a confused 19 yr old with undiagnosed mental health issues for u to discover on ur own isn't exactly fun either 🤪

i'd really really RATHER NOT share more info about my personal life. I'm a codependent, been idealizing suicide ever since I was 10, I'm a heavily traumatized piece of shit, and I just want to know how to move on from the ""boo hoo im forever alone :'( teehee me get stoned, me get high, me get drunk teehee""  phase because frankly im sick of it. this morning i was PLAGUED by thoughts of....what if I just tied a bag around my head in the middle of the night.

My girlfriend is suffering from depression for about 6 or 7 years now.  
They are getting worse and worse.

We are living in germany and getting a therapist is really hard over here.   
I called many psychologists here and she has some appointments in the next three months.

However, she often thinks about killing herself. She does not want a stationary therapie because of her anxiety of foreign people plus its hard for her to trust others.  
She already was disappointed of some therapists.. One of them told her to go to a monastery....

She was on the phone with our local psychiatry and they told her she could get medication to start a medicational therapy before she has an ambulant therapy with a psychologist.  


I read a lot on the internet and I am also a medical professional, although I am not a doctor.

I could get her some medications via my contacts and I think Citalopram would be a good medicine to begin with. 

We are really desperate because there is fucking noone who can help us.

I just wanted to hear some experiences before begin the treatment.  


Does citalopram help you?  
What do we have to take care about whats not on the internet about citalopram?

  
We would start with a daily dose of 5 mg for a week, then 10mg for a week or two and then 20mg/day.

I am really glad about any help I can get here.

27,"(This is going to be a ramble because I only had fifteen minutes to write this)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have felt this way since March 2019. I just feel kind of blah. I have a roommate and he has friends come over but I just don't feel any joy or happiness even engaging in things that I used to love like watching videos, playing games, listening to music, talking, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean stuff just sounds kind of blah to me lately. Games just seem very meh, anything on youtube/netflix/OTA/etc. is just eh at best and blech at worst. Like I just both feel blah and meh but also don't feel anything at the same time. I mean I just feel like everything takes effort it just nothing matters. I don't feel love, joy, etc. Music just doesn't sound as rich, nuanced, good, etc as it used to. I've tried various genres, speakers, etc. and nothing has really helped. I know part of it is my hearing loss but it just feels like that some of it just does not work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also had many memory issues lately. I can not for the life of me remember anything really. I mean it just feels like I have lots of memory issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done some really good things in the past 18 months. I quit doing any drugs minus energy/caffeine and nicotine back on December 20, 2018 was my last time. I lost 100 lbs although I have been keeping that off in a terrible way. I have been fasting/taking a lot of fat burners and walking on those days that I do fast and I've done that up to five days in a row (longest I've gone without fasting is 136 hours). Although I haven't fasted that long since late September. The longest I've made it without eating the last two months is 64 hours.  Some days I'll ""splurge"" and eat up to 11000 calories! I have fluctuated between 150 at my lowest and 180 at my highest (If I hit 180 within a day or two I immediately put the brakes on and just fast. I was around 260 to 280 prior to this. Right now as of typing this I am 173 lbs. I ate really bad the last two days (Thanksgiving and Black Friday) so now I'm going to try to fast for at least two/three days to get back under 165 lbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. I always withdraw and just sit alone in my room. I do not interact with my roommate much at all. When I do bring my laptop out there to play Destiny 2 with him on our gaming laptops it does not feel good at all. I mean I fake having a tiny bit of fun and I guess maybe I do. But it seems like my absolute absolute best mood I've had lately is maybe a 6.5 out of 10 and that's either only when I've over eaten a ton of food or have done way too many energy drinks. Most often I feel like I'm a 5. Now at the absolute absolute worse I feel like maybe a 4. Like I said I have no want to self-harm or hurt anything or anyone. I do not want to damage my health and I do want to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even enjoy or feel like I love my cat as much as I used to. I pet her and such still sometimes but I used to feel a comfort and warmth in her that lately I just do not feel whatsoever. She just seems like almost everything else to me lately. Blah and uninteresting. I mean sometimes I find her cute and comforting but nowhere near what I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now one thing I will say that might disappoint or make some people on here mad is that on my own volition back in January 2019 I discontinued any anti-depressants/psych meds I was on. In fact I scaled back my meds completely down to just two nose sprays because I have ear/nose problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of ear problems I also am extremely worried about ear/hearing damage. I withdraw bad when there's loud noises even when it's only around 75 decibels or so I believe it will damage my hearing. I mean I've spent $60 on some 3m worktunes connect + am/fm hearing protectors. I got those because specifically they block out around 25 decibels of noise and because they are supposed to have two settings of volume limitation in them where they are not supposed to go above 82 decibels. I walk a lot and sometimes there's jerks that rev by in extremely loud cars and I'm afraid that it may have cost me some permanent hearing damage. I would go with in ear earbuds but I can not stand the way those feel. That is not a recent issue I've always been like that since at least a teenager which is when I can first remember trying those out so that isn't related to this at all but my point is that.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways with all of this out of the way I just don't know what to do I am a mess. I have a neuro-psych evaluation to see what is going on with my memory issues and a psychiatrist appointment set up and I also have counseling set up but I just don't know anymore. I do not want to harm myself and I do want to continue living but it's just so blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually the main reason I got off of my anti-depressants in the first place is that I was worried that I was going to have serotonin syndrome caused because at the time I was still doing dxm (cough syrup) that is known when combined with anti-depressants can cause serotonin syndrome. I don't think it ever happened but I don't know. Now I've been sober three weeks shy of two years off of that but now the reason I do not want to get on anti-depressants again and want to try everything else is because of my weight. I do not want to gain weight again. I know being this much slimmer has been good for my blood pressure and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that I need to work on my eating habits. I just feel so empty. It's either I can completely go the whole day without eating or I eat up to 12000 calories. Leptin doesn't exist in me it seems. I will eat until I am sick. It's all or nothing with me.

29,"It has been years since I've had a major depressive episode, but I am teetering on the edge with work burnout and financial anxiety. After a decade of supporting him, I desperately need my (also depressed) partner to return the favor and start working so I can afford a major career change for my own mental health. We (44M, 44F) need health insurance to cover our therapy (solo and couples) and our health conditions. He has not had a job in a decade due to depression, but he does have degree, is intelligent, and excels whenever he applies himself.

Even as I read this, I can see how non-empathic I sound. Please share practical tips that have worked for couples trying to support each other through depression?

I unintentionally worsened his depression and anxiety few years ago when he compared himself to a happy stay at home dad in a wealthy couple we know. I was shocked. In my own weak moment, I angrily stated that I’d always expected him to eventually start pursuing work, and I never hoped to be the sole breadwinner. This came as a very unpleasant surprise to him, and he is working though the trauma of this in therapy. He felt that I did not appreciate him, and interpreted this conversation as deeply undermining his worth. Of course I never intended to hurt him, I love him so much, and he is an exceptionally good person. But he still feels attacked when I ask him to do chores or follow up on promises that he's not naturally inspired to do. This kind of thing has cost us tens of thousands of dollars. I made a mistake of thinking that he could take care of our home economics and planning (or even that this kind of small responsibility would help!) with his depression. I know now that this was wrong and unfair and just increased his anxiety.

Even though he is now in therapy, started daily exercise and medication, he is still sleeping 10-12 hours a day and drinking from 6pm to 3am, about 12 drinks a night. At my urging/bitching, he recently softened to the idea of cutting back on drinking, even got naltrexone. But there is always a new reason to delay both the job search and start the difficult task of starting the naltrexone and addressing drinking. He firmly believes drinking is not causing any problems, he is doing this for me, that alcohol is his only respite. 

Meanwhile my mental health and trust is deteriorating. My compassion for myself and for him are both drained. I am frustrated with both of us, I am confused and ashamed of how I am treating him. I worry that I'm projecting some of my own insecurities about productivity and career and self-worth on to him.  

Lately, the kinds of things that are coming into my head are teetering on paranoid delusions. Some days I think he has alcoholic brain damage because he can't remember or take initiative on anything that is not an urgent situation or I'm expressing exasperation. I wonder if we are merely performing a loving relationship rather than actually loving and supporting each other. Then I wonder if he is a sociopath manipulating me -- he is so affectionate and gentle, all of his words are so kind-- but his refusal to help ease financial pressure and stop drinking contradict his claimed intentions. Then I wonder if I am manipulating him - am I trying to test his commitment to me by asking him to make sacrifices? Am I doing all of this for my own ego and adding to my own stress unnecessarily by thinking my job is worse than it is?

I know that at heart, he believes that his (truly) generous affection should be enough for me, and he can wait for my mental health problems to resolve without making any sacrifices; then things will return to ""normal"" once my depression improves. That will, in turn, help him get better 

As I read this, I’m self-aware enough to know that I’m not only looking for suggestions, but also looking for validation of my feelings. 

My friends will give me validation.

I loved it so much that I became a full time writer leaving my engineering career behind. 

But recently, I haven't been feeling like myself anymore. I sit for hours everyday trying to write something, but nothing makes sense or pleases me. It's like a shrapnel of million thoughts is raining on the walls of my brain 24/7 and it's incredibly exhausting. I just want it to stop but I don't know what to do.",28Nov2020,1
36,"I've left all my studying late and I have no idea why. I just kept putting it off and when I did sit down to do something I just couldn't concentrate. Or I'd start getting really upset for some reason and start crying. I should be able to manage this kind of thing but I just can't for some reason. 
I don't have much time during the week because I work full time (it's part of an apprenticeship scheme so I get day release for lectures and stuff.) I'm always tired and when the weekend rolls around and I have time to do something, I end up sleeping the day away. I woke up at 4:30pm today and I hate myself for it. 
I don't know what to do. I'm going to fail and then what? What if I lose my job and everything. I don't want to be unemployed again, I hated it. I hated every second of it because I felt so useless but now that I'm doing something I just fall flat on my face because I'm too stupid and lazy to get anything done. I don't know what's wrong with me.",28Nov2020,1
37,When I woke up this morning I was so fucking tired I have no idea why I slept for 8 hours I just couldn’t stay awake so I went downstairs and ate breakfast and laid on the couch when my mom came over to talk to me about getting a project done and I said that I’d get it done tomorrow because I had work in two hours and then I went upstairs to take a nap before driving to work. She found me asleep woke me up and started yelling about how my apathy towards everything is gonna ruin my life and that she’s gonna kick me out of the house and she won’t put up with this. She then asked me why I was apathetic and I told her I didn’t know because I don’t know it’s just hard for me to get motivated to do anything and she said I was lying and told me to just go to work. This comes right off from an incident a few days ago when i told her I was feeling suicidal (after I wrote a note and decided to tell someone) at which she yelled at me how I was manipulative and this is just like my dad(whom I have cut contact with as he was a strong negative influence in my life) and that I was lying. She then said if I didn’t change she’d force me out due to my bad decisions because being kicked out makes me sound like the victim. I’m just so sick of trying to change and get better and falling flat on my face I just want to go back a year and fix my mistakes or to just die idk what to do anymore as without a place to stay I will never get a higher education and will be forced to work the dead end fast food job I currently work at.,28Nov2020,1
38,I’m laying in my partners bed having a mental breakdown as I typ this I should have noticed the red flags I should have spoken up. Why does this keep happening to me why am I not good enough what do I do wrong?? All I want in life is to be happy and when I though I finally had someone that loved me and was honest with me it was all ripped away. Now I’m just waiting for them to get home to confront them and then who knows after that I don’t even want to be here anymore I’m tired of hurting,28Nov2020,1
39,"You will either see the beautiful silver lining in all things
or the darkest storms where there are none..

At the higher eschelons, nothing can affect you because you realise we ascribe our own meaning to all events. 

You are entirely in control of every reaction you have.

This is why those that have everything on the outside can still be unhappy on the inside. 

If you cannot learn to be happy with nothing, then you will not be content with everything.

The happy medium is to always be appreciative and thankful for what you have.

But still recognise the benefit in progressing and improving in our lives and being able to effect more positive change in those we care about through furthering of material wealth

At the same time, you must remove the attachment to any outcome of this process.

You can either live in heaven:

telling the truth
living how YOU want
being open and loving
Be-ing

or live in hell:

lying
emotionally defending your 'self' (ego) 
attached to posessions
wanting to control outcomes
REACTING

Depending on your mental framework.

Know that all the troubles in your life are under your control - in that they ARE troubles ONLY because you make it so with your interpretation of the events

Nothing is FORCING you to react with anger, fear
It is just a relic of deep societal programming

And this, we can change
