0,"I just woke up at 12am after sleeping from around 5pm. I've working from home for a while now and I feel that I've become more and more apathetic to my job. 
I really shouldn't because my job is an apprenticeship so I'm in the very fortunate situation were my employer is paying ME to learn. They're even paying for my degree so I don't even have any student debt. And yet I find myself becoming more and more apathetic as time goes on while working from home. 
I really need to get myself together because, even though I've been told that it's okay for me to not know what I'm doing and that I shouldn't feel bad about deadlines. 
At first I felt horrible because I didn't know what I was doing and it's so much more difficult to ask for help over messenger than it is to just quickly ask for five minutes of someone's time in the office, face to face. It made feel so stupid and inadequate to the point that I'm struggling to concentrate on my work. And it's been going on for long enough now for me to just stop feeling anxious and start feeling depressed. Which has lead to these long bouts of apathy where I almost don't give a crap if there are any consequences or not. I just think that I'm bound to be a disappointment anyway so what's the point. What's the point in even trying if I'm just going to end up making myself feel bad. 
This isn't even mentioning the fact that outside of work I basically do noting now. I think about the stuff I want to do and make plans but I kept running into to minor set backs and ended up just not having any energy or motivation to fix it. So I'd just let my car sit there until the battery needs replacing or keep looking at a website to get my cello fixed up only to do nothing. 
There's also the fact that I've basically been putting off calling my work place councilor to talk about this stuff. I haven't had the nerve to do it and every time I think I did, I'm not alone at home. My mum or my brother are in and I just can't risk them overhearing a conversation like that. My brother has already started an argument with me once because he just kept insisting that I must be depressed and wouldn't let it go. Or that anytime he's alone with me he tries to act concerned. And I know he means well, but he just prompts conversations that I don't have the answer to. And he uses this tone of voice as if I might break down in tears at any moment and makes feel so coddled and uncomfortable but I don't know how to make it any more clearer that I don't want to talk about it. Especially if I've just gotten out the house for the first time in a month. I don't want to talk about the stuff that's bothering me, I want to have a break from that for just an hour or two maybe.
I don't even deserve that kind of talk right now because if I'm not apathetic or sad I'm angry or agitated. And I end up taking it out on others over little things. And I feel horrible afterwards but, my mum is right when she says I'm just looking for a fight. Maybe I'm just being a dick on purpose to get some variation in reaction that isn't pity or a stressful conversation topic. Like money or moving home or politics because I swear that's the only conversations that ever go on in this house.
I don't know. I should go do something to eat because I don't think I've had anything since breakfast. 
Thanks for reading this far if you have.",08Aug2020,1

4,"About me, I'm a 31 year old female, I'm married, have 1 kid, I have a steady job and recently bought a home. My husband is wonderful and overall, I can't complain to much about my day-to-day life. 

I'm seeking advice because I'd say for the last 4-5 years I feel like my emotions have gradually become ""watered down"", in the beginning I found myself not getting excited about things and losing interest in old hobbies, I chalked it up to being a busy, normal adult. Now a days I rarely even cry even though I feel I should be crying. I remember what emotions feel like but they just don't come to the surface.
Example: When my husband and I bought our home, he was jumping up and down with joy where I was just ""oh cool..."",

 I've always been terribly introverted and he the extrovert.

I work in retail, I know when to smile and pretend to be happy, I can (fake)laugh at customer's awful jokes and puns, I know how know to look sad or sympathetic but I don't actually feel anything.

I know my emotions are still there, I recently watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and I burst into tears, sobbing. I guess I really miss feeling happy, excited, etc. on a regular basis, I'm tired of feeling ""meh"" about everything. 

I am working on myself, I've been exercising regularly, my diet is pretty healthy aside from the monthly pizza night my family and I do. Since Covid hit, I've been outside in the sun more. 
I plan to talk to my doctor about all this in the next few weeks it just seems odd to me right now as I don't ""feel ill"" ,I'm hoping my doctor doesn't just hand me pills and call it a day.  As far as therapy,  I don't think it's covered in my insurance and I don't think I can afford it.

Td;dr:
What is wrong with me? Why do my emotions feel watered down? Is this just me being an adult? Anyone think it's a chemical imbalance maybe?",08Aug2020,1
5,"TW: Depression and Suicide. 

Hi everyone. Recently depression has really been kicking my ass. I go to school for welding and I’m supposed to graduate in 2 months. I feel like I’m not ready for the real world and am not going to get far. I feel as though my boyfriend hates me. He also struggles with depression so I don’t wanna stress him out more by telling him I’m suicidal. I also don’t have any friends to really talk to and get help. If I talk to my parents, they will just threaten to take me to a hospital. I’ve been struggling really bad lately with suicide and it’s getting worse and worse each day. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",08Aug2020,1
7,"I've been diagnosed with depression almost 12 years ago. I've always been somewhat apathic and empty because of it. There always seemed to be something or someone that gave me some hope for a better tomorrow. These things gradually got less and less until there was one left. It was a girl who I've loved ever since i met her. She's my best friend and the thought of maybe ending up with her kept me going ever since i dropped out of school again last year. But today I've lost that last bit of hope. She got distant and ended up dating someone. She was the last bit of light at the end of the tunnel. Now i have nothing left to live for.
I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess just needed to vent. Just please don't message me or comment saying anything along the lines of ""it'll be fine"". It has gradually been getting worse ever since it started and it never really slowed down. I have nothing left to fucking life for anymore so i might as well end it. I'm sorry if i bothered anyone, this will be the last time

Edit: i probably won't end it tonight, i don't have the balls to do anything after all. I'd first have to write a few notes and such and I'm bad at that so i doubt it'd be anytime soon.",08Aug2020,1

11,"So many times have I, in the dark of night with nothing but me, my stupid thoughts, and my device, looked up stuff on google, hoping it would give me a magical answer. Example being “How to cope with negative emotions” (It’s super cringey, but hear me out) The answer i get is usually, or in the form of, “reach out to others.” It seems so simple, and yet it feels like trying to jump across the ocean. I do want to take this advice, but don’t know a way to go about it, I intend on trying to text a friend about it, as I don’t want to tell my family about my negative thoughts in a period where they’re already breathing down my neck. How do I start such a conversation? Should I even be reaching out to a friend?",08Aug2020,1

16,"I have been gettin thoughts of cutting myself for reasons I don’t even fully know. It just feels incredibly tempting and I hate it. I’ve yet to do it but I’ve been making deep marks with my nails and it doesn’t feel like enough to stop the urges. 

I also seemed to lost the point to actually keep going. Everything is so fucked up, and everything I do doesn’t matter because of two reasons. The first being that nothing matters in the end, everything passes in time so why bother doing anything? and secondly because of humanity slowly going to the brink of making ourselves extinct. How can I live a normal life when normal is hazardous for the planet? 

I just feel like a hypocrite when I see posts of people telling everyone that their going to end it and I try to tell them that they shouldn’t. I don’t think I get a say of what they shouldn’t do if I’m close to doing it myself almost everyday of the week. 

Everything I enjoy is slowly being sucked dry and the only thing that’s left is a bland and boring thing that seems more like a task now. I used to draw, and I would always create new ideas for stories, but I only made one thing for the first time in almost half a year and I’m really burnt out from it. 

And the worst part of it all is that I don’t know if I am really good at lying or if I am better when I’m around people. The worst thoughts only come when I’m alone, but I just want time for myself and to be in a place without people to worry about or be around. I don’t want to do everything except be on my phone. But then it makes me feel like I’m just being lazy and I’ll feel worse.

Being around people at least gives me the illusion that I could beat this, but I’m making no effort to actually get help for this, ironically it also takes no effort to make people not notice anything is wrong with me. A lot of people don’t know that I am struggling. Only one, my irl friend, the one person that knows and their close to suicidal as well. 

I often think some days what’s on the other side after we die, like todays the day I do it, and I question what I could find. Is it nothing, just my consciousness in a empty void? Is it heaven or hell? Will I become a ghost forced to wander in an endless torment? The possibilities seem endless, and I feel like I’m decades older than I actually am, like I know everything and that it all led to this moment. I know it probably doesn’t make sense but it’s what I think. I’m *that* close to ending it on days. Dying feels better than living cause I won’t have to deal with life and I’ll know what’s on the other side.  

TL;DR: Humanity is close to going extinct with the way our society is, everything feels pointless because of that and other reasons, my life is in the shits, and I’m going to eventually cut or kill myself if this keeps up but I don’t know how to get help by talking about it. It all sucks and dying just seems easier than dealing with the world of the living.",08Aug2020,1
17,I have no idea what I have to do and things just keep getting worse. I’ve become the person I never wanted to become. Thinking about the future and the fact that I have no idea what I want to do freaks me out if I’ll ever reach my potential. Confidence at an all time low.

19,"I am 20 and I’ve been having the worst time since December last year. November 2019 was the best month of my life I had got my first place, my girlfriend was pregnant and me and her had very steady jobs. In December she had a miscarriage, which caused me to lose my job because I had to leave early and had no personal hours. So now my girlfriend and my grandma(who moved in with us) had to cover rent until I got a job. I didn’t find one March. Two months later my dad kills himself, he was very lonely and I feel it’s my fault, I’m his oldest and it broke him when he moved across country and I didn’t come with him. We had stoped talking, and not even two months later my grandma(that lived with me) passes away. So now I’m stuck with a job that doesn’t pay the bills in a relationship that I feel like I’m ruining because I’m so broken that I’m hurting her and I have no clue what to do. I’ve tried taking a break so I can heal and come back when I’m healthy but that didn’t last, I’m stuck, and I just want to be happy",08Aug2020,1
20,"So I been depressed and anxious since I was around 9 or something (22 now) I've had my own brother abuse me and my mom didnt do anything about it. I ended up in foster care when I turned 15 and now my life is a lot better. However I'm still depressed most of the time I'm really unhappy with my body and myself in general. I haven't had sex or a gf for about 5 years now. I also found out recently that my mom has cancer now so that's just icing on the cake. Idk what to do with myself anymore. I've turned to drugs and alcohol to numb myself almost every night. Idk what I'm trying to say here or do but some help or advice I haven't heard before would be appreciated.

21,Does this happen to anyone else? When I get sad and upset I start to think that I’m faking it for attention and that I’m not actually sad. It happens every time and it makes me feel useless and that I’m a horrible person for faking it when others are actually hurting,08Aug2020,1
22,"I tried it when I was 15 with a razor; the razor was dull. I only ended up with raw wrists. But during this time I realized what I was doing and vowed to never get to this place again. I didn’t want to die I just wanted to stop the pain. A memory of saying no. What had happened is a girl that my group of friends had befriended.. she was a small 12 year old. and I found out that her 18 year old very large brother had been raping her. I called the police and they put him in the car and he looked at me and said “I’ll get you.” I had suffered some abuse as a small child as many of us have. But at 4 years old I said “No”. And this is what I kept hearing.. myself saying no. Over and over.. I just wanted to stop the loop. I didn’t want to die. I was just “desperate” to stop the loop. I snapped myself out of it but it could have happened. 

The brain isn’t finished developing until the age of 25. 

When we’re in our teens we’re not equipped to handle these things. In hindsight I suppose an adult should have been the one to call the police. But there were no parents. I was at a friends place and I was alone calling the police. I was 15. Many years were fine as a child. I had music, singing writing and dancing to absorb myself with but 15 was a really rough year and a year I thought I could take better care of myself. In some ways that was true. But something like this I was in over my head. 

It would have been a horrible mistake. Looking back I see that it’s the age I was. Being older it’s apparent I just didn’t have the ability to realize  ( at least not right away ) that this loop would pass. That I just had to wait. That there is so much to experience in life “later on” that this feeling of not being able to escape from it would pass. 

The age you’re in is a difficult age. I wouldn’t want to be that age again in those situations. 

Now I’ve grown. My kids have grown. 😊. 
But my mother committed suicide less than a decade ago. 

Some times of year I feel her. This month is my birthday. I unusually prepare myself near her birthday, near Mother’s Day and before the time of her death. It’s as if I’m haunted by her. But my birthday isn’t usually to bad. I just woke up in an anxiety attack because I woke from a dream of her and been doing this several times this week. There are times that I blamed myself though I didn’t have anything to do with it ( I found out years later ) I felt tied to it because I know she had guilt from what happened to me. But it had nothing to do with me and she was across the country when it happened. But the sadness I feel for her still haunts me and the sorrow for her. The feeling of her. I would have taken her place. Now I know that’s irrational but the feeling returns from time to time. It always will. 

The heartbreak is unfathomable. 

The one thing that I wish and hope that you can keep in mind is that this time shall pass. Everything does. 

It’s so hard to know this at 15. 

You have life to enjoy in the future. I promise, you just have to hold on. 

I don’t want anyone to go through that. Nor go what I’ve gone through then and since. 

It’s a place of darkness. You have a beautiful soul. The darkness fades. And there’s much more than this. There aren’t any shortcuts. But in time life will be better. All of this will pass and you won’t be in High-school and you’ll make your own rules to a degree. 

But if I’d been successful in killing my self I wouldn’t be telling you this. If this is something you can’t control you need to have a therapist and perhaps take medicine if it’s compulsive. I want you to live. And perhaps you can give this to someone when you’re older 💕. The age you’re at is a bear you’re wrestling but I swear this time will pass and your world won’t be anything like it is now. 

You just have to get through this. 

All my love ❤️〰️❤️.",08Aug2020,1

She is currently trying to get things in order but I'm afraid that if something happens it will bring her down and make things worse.

25,"As the title says, being sad just feels so good.  During an extreme depressive episode, i will initially feel horrible and after a week, the depression feels satisfying in a way.  Somewhat orgasmic for some reason.  For some reason it just hurts so good.  i also just ghosted my friends.  I now have nobody to talk to, but this self destructive behavior is so satisfying to me.  What is wrong with me?  And why do i forcefully isolate myself?  I am so lonely, even with friends and family around me.  My mind is more clear right now but when im in the gutters again i will probably continue this shitty behavior.  What is wrong with me?  Why do I enjoy being depressed?

27,"Hello,my name is Julius and I wanted to share my story. I was born and raised in a little town in germany. My family wasn't the kindest one,if at all. My father would beat me and my brother for any little mistake or simply insult us everytime he could. My mother would do nothing to stop him,even when we told her. His view was that to beat your child would be a right of every parent. My mother on the other hand wasn't better. She would get enraged if I would not do as she said. For example,we would exercise writting words,if I could not correct the miswritten word she would trow something,scream at me,beat me or take my head and slam it into the side of the glasstable. My brother is in some situations like a wild dog. He bites and scratches without an end in sight. A couple of years later,I would wake up without any pants on,if I can believe my brothe for once,because my father took the of my body while I slept to stare at me.(That was in third grade) School  wasn't better. I was an outcast,mobbed for my sexuality,behaviour,look,etc. I thought until 6th grade that this would be normal,but then... I began to look around  and notice how the others interact with eachother. They were friendly to thier friends,make gifts,jokes and plans. So I began to mimic thier behavior. I didn't work. So I turned to my edjucation,I learned english,history etc. I loved hearing about the great war,ww2 and seeing art that was depicting famous battles.I was fed up with people calling me fat and ugly,so I lost some weight,finally got some compliments,lost some more. Until I was at 47kg,you could see my bones. I developed Anorexia,my commerads and reachers made fun out of me. My mother didn't help me. Hell,as I told her it was a fiting way out,she didn't want to hear it. She said I was crazy for saying I would be depreesed or suicidal! 2 weeks after that she said to my face:,,I am jealous of my friend,because she decided against having children!'' Now to the present,the 10th grade. I feel like I belong anywhere,my heart is rotten by the anger and hate I feel towards thoose who did me wrong. I could go on become a docotor for the army or a fieldmedic in the special forces,but I... am done. I can not even starve my self right,if I believe my doubts and all I have heard. I am nothing more then an accidental byproduct of my brothers birth,an f\*\*\*ing error in the code. That has been ignored and treated like sh\*t for what reasson? Right,his unwanted birth. Sorry,this was a little bit heated,but how could I get better and closer to getting out of the cycle of lonelyness,self-hatred,without correcting my parents mistake by starving,catching a bullet or something else that is tempting for me right now?",08Aug2020,1
28,"I suffer from depression that comes and goes throughout the year. Sometimes days, sometimes weeks, occasionally months of feeling blank. Like I’m not actually there, just living, trying to make it another day. For me, time starts to speed up, I feel empty, and I become sad that I’m wasting my time feeling so empty. I recently had a period of this depression lasting a few months and decided to take action on it. I have tried many products/medicines/cbd/exercise etc. Exercise definitely helped the most but I tried something different this time. I started taking Lions Mane, a mushroom supplement. I got a CBD vape pen (pharmaCBD), and a German Shepard. I didn’t plan to get all of them it just happened that way. I’m posting this because I believe it genuinely helped me. Now I feel I am living in each and every moment, time has slowed down, I am not worried about missing the moment because I am sad, and have been disregarding my anxious voices to do what’s best for me. This is a week into using lions mane and I would definitely recommend. I’m not going to lie to you and say it’s a fix-all. Nothing is. I still have short periods of time (half-days) where I kind of breakdown but nothing like before. Here is a list that is worth trying:

-Lions Mane
-Gallon of water a day
-30 min outer door activity/exercise (doesn’t matter the weather, no excuses, get a rain jacket)
-CBD (preferably PharmaCBD)
-Close friend/pet you can talk to (yes I talk to my dog) 
-make your bed each morning
-add small tasks each day
-make lists of any and all questions that come to your mind and research them when you get the chance, this builds knowledge and confidence
-make lists of goals, no matter how crazy. Research what it would take to accomplish them


I am not an ad for pharmaCBD I just specifically recommend them because they are the only CBD product I’ve gotten relief from. It uses Delta8 THC which is legal (I bought it in N.C. where medicinal marijuana is Illegal). It’s not getting high, but does provide relief that I can’t exactly put into words here.

I hope the best for each and every one of you.",08Aug2020,1

She barely eats, and the little sleep she gets is riddled with nightmares, so obviously when morning comes I literally have to drag her out of bed sometimes. 

This morning she broke down while trying to get up and I felt... Furious, and I hate how I felt. I used to, and still kind of do, deal with anger management issues, so I'm scared one day I will snap and become properly mad at her. I don't want to do that, that would make everything so much worse.

We started her on Sertraline a couple weeks back and she's had more good days. Yesterday was a good day, which I think is why I felt so upset with her this morning. I didn't let her see that obviously, but It feels so draining. I feel like nothing I do helps her. I feel useless knowing the person I love is suffering, being unable to do anything about it other than making sure she takes her pills and follows up with the psychologist.

I don't know what to do. I miss my wife. I miss the person I fell in love with. I want to be able to take walks with her, and play games with her, and be able to wake up in the morning and just have a proper breakfast with her. I just want her be able to be happy again.",08Aug2020,1

38,"Someone please tell me how to deal with my girlfriend. She's depressed as hell and hides it by trying to be over the top happy so now everyone thinks she's a really happy person. I've told her different things to try including lifting, running, reading, getting into a show or anime, writing in a journal stuff like that, but all she does is sleep all day because she has diabetes and bc of that and insomnia she has limited energy to begin with. Her family does nothing because her two brothers are complete and utter assholes to her (pardom the French) and Im scared she's going to kill herself or start cutting again.... its been happening for a while (the depression) and nothing I say helps her and then i get fed up because im depressed too i just work and do shit during my day to get my mind off of it or I deal with it. I dont know what to do and I don't want to end things but I dint see a light at the end of the tunnel. Please help. And by all means if you think its me then tell me that and ill change myself but I do EVERYTHING for her. Day in day out I drive an hour to see her even if its only for a few hours or overnight, i am trying to save money so I can get her out of that house and Into an apartment with me bc when she's only around me shes fine. what do I do??? I'm ag a loss.",08Aug2020,1
39,"i dont know why my energy is so low and has been for a very long time. i dont really talk to or text anyone anymore because even having a conversation takes too much energy

it feels like there is no solution other than just forcing myself to do things. i go to therapy and talk about this and nothing has really improved.",08Aug2020,1
40,"I've been on a journey of recovering from depression and actually trying to take care of myself. 
It's been going kinda ok so far.
Yet this feeling won't go away.

Its everyone's right to do something without me. Hell I don't like people that much.

Yet when my girlfriend and I skype every day (were in a long distance relationship) and she says she wants to go do something with her friends (or flat mates their both the same) rationally I'm happy. She's gonna have fun with her friends and I get some alone time. 
Yet once we hang up the feeling of being unwanted has been coming up over and over again for the past few days.
Rationally i know she wants me irrationally i want to cry cuz the feeling is getting overwhelming.  

How do i deal with it without seeming clingy as fuck?",08Aug2020,1
41,"Does anyone else ever think that people are trying to hurt you even when theyre not? For example, my BF tells me to take care of something, ""i trust your judgement"" is what he says. When i tell him its taken care of, he seems irritated. He says that i didn't have to do it today, that i had plenty of time, that he doesnt like 1/2 of my solutions, and the one solution he might like he asks me a bunch of questions about, almost in a rushed way of talking, like i should have thought of these questions beforehand. I explain that the way hes acting is making me feel as if he doesnt trust me, and that he could have done it himself. He says that i am a child who just want to start arguments all the time and i dont care about him only myself, that i want him to be hurting me and i want to fight so i jump to conclusions all the time. I apologise and say that i dont think thats the case, i just honestly feel that way. Am i really making up the attitudes, am i percieving every thing in my life wrong? How is it possible that i can hear someone being passive aggressive or having an attitude, but theyre not really doing that at all? Am i hallucinating? Do i just somehow get things mixed up in my head? How do i stop doing that? I literally so full of rage and hate against myself right now i just want to slit my wrists and be done with it. Im so tired of feeling like everyone on earth hates me. Am i just somehow making that up? How do i fix myself?",08Aug2020,1
42,"I’ve always been pretty good at separating logic from emotions. My depression makes me feel like ______, but logically, I know that’s not true and it’s just my depression trying to trick me. My depression often makes me feel like people don’t really love me or care about me, but I can usually calm myself down with logic. 

This time I can’t, because someone told me they don’t care about me anymore. He was the person I felt most comfortable talking to when I was struggling, and now I can’t talk to him. I know I have other friends I can talk to, but it doesn’t feel the same. 

I’m so stressed out that I’m having heart palpitations, and I can feel a lupus flare coming on. I just don’t know if I can live like this anymore. I’m currently sitting outside the ER, a strategy that usually works for me when I’m feeling actively suicidal. I sit here until the feeling passes, or go check in if it doesn’t.",08Aug2020,1
43,"When I'm at my grandmas house or anywhere other than my house and my room i feel happy, motivated and all that good stuff, those feelings encase the more I'm away from home. Today i returned from my five day trip with my friends and it was great but as soon as i stepped into my house i just felt tired and sad and unmotivated to do anything. 

Any similar experiences, any advice how could i make it better? I'm 17btw",08Aug2020,1
