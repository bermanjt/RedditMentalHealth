4,"Stay at home orders have been a personal blessing for me. I hate that it's fine about from a public health and economic crisis, but staying at home all day has been fantastic for me, mentally.

I work from home now, and it's great compared to going into the office. I had virtual appointments with my psychologist and psychiatrist this past week. Both said I seemed much better. My wife also told me this has been the least depressed she's seen me in years.

A couple of hours ago it just came on, crushing. I can't smile. I can't talk. I was supposed to record my podcast tonight, like the last possible time frame we had to get it out on schedule, and I just.. Can't. I'm letting down my go host, my wife and best friend (Co-editors/producers) hmhe the purple who passed our show on Monday mornings. I feel awful about it, which is compounding the awful I already feel.

My wife keeps asking what v she can do to help and I tell her nothing, I don't think, which is the truth but can't be comforting for her.

I don't know where this came out of. I don't even have work shit to spiral me since it's Saturday night. Nothing had gone wrong today. I've been avoiding news for fear it might Fuck up my God logs and now u went and ruined myself and I don't even know why.

Sometimes I think this is the worst part. When worrying about work or obsessing over the state of the world or finances or something sends me over the edge, I can at least point to it and say hey, there it is. That's what is doing it. That's the trigger. This one is just nonsense and it's terrifying and utterly frustrating.

I went though TMS  treatments in December of last year into January of this year. I was really hoping this would be The Thing that finally fixed me. But insurance hosed me and I had to stop trearments for weeks, in the midst integral period, becuase I had hit my ""mental health visit limit"" for 2019 due to my daily treatments. And again, I don't know. I don't know if breaking up the treatments meant they weren't as effective or this was just another treatment that didn't work the way I wanted to. But since I don't have to go to the office Every day currently, I was feeling better than I had in aged. And in a matter of hours it all went poof. And I don't know how temporary this feeling is.

I just had to dump, this out. I've never posted here before. I how it's not against the rules, and if it is I'm sorry. I don't even know what I wanted out of this. All I know is instead of having fun with my friend over voice chat I'm disappointing hundreds of people and my wife and my best friends and I want to cry but nothing is coming out.

Hi. This is kind of my second cry for help on this app, or, in my current case, website.

Sorry. If you don't care to know any backstory, skip down to the slashes. The end of the post has a TLDR. Thanks.

I'm fourteen, fifteen in October, heading towards ninth grade. I'm pretty smart, I guess, Im taking honors classes and in a math class 2 years ahead of my grade. I'm adopted by my grandparents, I have a sister and brother, no contact with my bio parents. My life is okay, but I've been depressed for six years. In sixth grade, I started self harming, I cut constantly. In seventh grade, I wanted to kill myself for the first time, and came very, very close before I received a literally life saving call from my at the time boyfriend (who I lost my virginity to, at 13. That matters later.). We broke up in October of last year, and in December I was baker-acted for the first time. It was the most terrifying thing to ever happen to me. During this time, my grandparents went through my entire room and my cell phone, found out about the teenage stupid shit I do/did: Sex, nudes, cursing. Nothing too bad; I don't go out and drink (I have only had a maximum of 2 shots with my adult sister who supervised and cut me off), have never touched any illegal drugs (not even pot). I don't even sneak out or lie about who I'm with. I'm a pretty good kid. Anyway, during my baker act, my grandma was so angry that I curse and enjoy sex that she didn't talk to me for the entire week and a half. While my granddad did, it was frustrating. He would guilt me and make me feel like shit-whether it was accidental or on purpose is unclear. After that, I was ok for a little while. The only person who actually visited me to show love and support is my sister who has gone through the exact things I have. She is my world. Now, it's all back to hell. I still go to therapy, still on meds. I have the most supportive, though clueless, boyfriend.

////////////////////////

The current issue? I'm suicidal again. And I have been for a while, but especially since quarantine and having to stay with my family. And it's gotten worse and worse. A few days ago, maybe a week (?) or so, my boyfriend's psycho mom went through his messages, and did NOT like what she found. No nudes, but mostly innuendos and jokes. What can you expect from two teenagers in a world that refuses to sexually educate us?? She lost her shit, annnnnd called the school board (she works at our school!!!). School told my grandparents who barged in the bathroom, which I was completely nude in, getting ready for a shower, snatched my phone and went through everything. Still found out I was talking to my ex (the life saver, btw), still cursing etc. Got pissed, took my phone. Whatever, that's fine; I don't care about the phone, but now I'm bored as hell in quarantine and struggling to talk to anyone. I still have online therapy and here's when the fun part comes in!

My therapist is okay, she's from the school and my ""main"" therapist is out on leave (she had the cutest baby). I told her everything; my depression acting up again, suicidal thoughts etc. Because Im not in immediate danger, my therapist can't call to have me baker acted. She did, however, establish a safety plan: including having constant ability to contact my sister, the suicide hotline and mobile response team (they talk to people and evaluate for baker acting). She asked me to have my phone again for safety reasons, remove all sharp objects from my room, talk to my sister about my problems, and establish a better relationship with my grandparents. Therapist called my grandparents about it, called me back to tell me what they talked about and here is the cherry on top: nothing has been done. I have personally told my grandparents all I think about is slitting my own wrists (they once walked in on me trying to slit my throat. Nothing was done, but my knives were taken...however, i found one of my bedroom floor the next day. It is still in my room now.). Nothing has been done about any of the things I feel. I tell them i'm depressed and they tell me I shouldn't be because my life is great/I have a puppy/no reason to be depressed. I'm tired and scared.

I don't want to die. I have a lot of goals in my life; I want to be a neuroscience. I want to help people, i want to stop people from going through what i've gone through. I wanna stick it to my bio parents. I recently learned I have a baby brother on my bio dad's side, who I will not see because, according to my grandma, there is no point trying to help him. I want to see my baby brother and be there for him, and show him what love really is...I know that being with my bio parents will not show him love. I have goals in life and I want to be happy. But how can I, when my own grandparents call me a trashy slut and act like I'm a terrible person? I have no idea what to do. I can't leave, but I can't stay here for three and a half more years. Help me.

TLDR: My grandparents know I'm suicidal and don't give a shit, I don't know what to do. Help me.

PS- I have posted this to several subreddits. I don't know which is best to post to and I just really need some advice.",26Apr2020,1

7,"I've been having a problem for a long time about never feeling ""man enough"" or at least never commanding any amount of real respect. 

I'm barely noticed in a room, and when I voice my opinion, it's rarely considered unless someone more respected reiterates the same point. I don't know how to make friends with most guys in general, so that level of masculinity and developing healthy relationships among men has never really been there.

I think the main reason is because I'm a gay guy. I know it's 2020, but the idea of being effeminate for being gay isn't uncommon where I live. It doesn't necessarily define who I am, but it's hard to ever command respect or be taken seriously when you aren't ""one of the boys."" I've been trying to get better by working out more to put on some muscle, but I think something about my voice sets guys off to just not respecting me (might be gay voice, but I'm told I don't really have it).

9,"I've been depressed since I was 14. I've tried years and years of therapy and antidepressants. My psychiatrist isn't happy that I have to take an SSRI for my separate chronic illness because it limits what I can try. Nothing seems to work.  I have no motivation, I cry all the time, I haven't had a proper conversation with anyone that's not family in a long time, I know what this is and it feels like one of my worst episodes yet.  My family know I'm depressed and don't care - like they genuinely could not give a fuck, they're not worried about me at all.  I had a review appointment with my psychiatrist a couple of weeks ago and I told him I'm not improving and his advice was to cut down my dosage. He's very cautious and I respect that but I don't think it's in my best interest to lose years of my life to 'just wait and see'.  It's always just 'try it for three months and come back for a review'.  I like him as a person and I know he's committed to treating me but I feel so trapped and lonely and I want him to take charge and *do something*, I don't care what because I'm in such a shitty place I didn't know how much longer to can just hang in there.  


If anyone could give me any advice, or words of support or even just a little kindness I would really appreciate it.  Thank you ❤",26Apr2020,1

11,"My (47M) wife (50F) is suffering from depression/burnout/poss PTSD. We're both healthcare workers in leadership positions (she has a higher position) and her job stress has increased exponentially lately. We're in an area that geared up for the worst initially but now have to furlough staff d/t lack of elective procedures.

My wife comes home on the verge of tears sometimes but won't lean on me for solace. Our marriage has been strained and she has become so withdrawn from me. I admit I was very confrontational and probably pushed her away unintentionally.

I don't know what to do. I've been depressed before but not like this. I don't want to lose her but I'm afraid she's already gone. We've been married 15 years and have a child together.

I've decided to hold fast and give her space but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified that she no longer wants me. Is this a lost cause? I promised that I'd always be there for her but she promised the same for me and has no interest in being around me.",26Apr2020,1

13,"I knew I was finally making progress with my mental health. I started to like my antidepressant dosage, I’ve built up some routines amidst the quarantine, and I haven’t had a suicidal thought in a few months. 

This progress all came crashing down the past few days. I’ve noticed my sleep patterns becoming more irregular (staying up later), I’ve been feeling increasingly lethargic, and I’ve noticed I’ve become very sensitive and easily triggered lately. 

Now I’ve sat here in the same place in front of a screen for hours, unable to detach myself. I know this is the worst thing I could do for myself considering this is what I always did during my nights while I was stuck in my depressed stupor for several months back in the fall/winter time. 

I feel myself sinking back into my old ways and i want it to end before it gets worse.

14,"basically my entire life, i have had a really tough time with my body. when i was younger, i was a little wider but it wasn't as bad as i thought that it was. at 7 years old, i started to tie my sweatshirts around my waist as tight as i could and sleep with them like that. some nights it was sweatshirts, others it was shoelaces; whatever i could fit around my waist to the point where i could barely breathe was perfect. nausea and pain were normal. i would wake up with a red ring around my stomach but smile because i appeared thinner. to this day, i still do the same and i think that it was spawning from peer pressure and my family life. my dad would abuse my brother if he didn't do push ups in the family room for all of us to watch. i remember my brother crying and i would stand and laugh, showing him how a push up SHOULD look like. i can't believe that i would ever do that to my brother. now, im struggling with self harm, depression, and anxiety. one day off my meds makes me have severe mood swings but my parents want me to get off of them. at the beginning of the year, i would eat one meal a day (dinner with my family because they would get mad if i saw me skip a meal.) i lost 20 pounds in 1.5 months. When I told my school counselor about it, he said that he doubted that i lost that much weight in such a short amount of time. i was physically in pain and i got through that pain but im always so tempted to stop eating to lose weight. my therapist says that the belt around my waist could be a way of self harming myself. i never thought of it that way though. please if you guys are going through something, you can always get through it. take this from somebody who is still struggling. In the past two years, I have seen myself grow. I started off really badly but I have grown. I got help and I found better friends. It will always get better. There is always someone who loves you even when you don't think there is. I can PROMISE you there is someone. even i can be that someone. i love you. you are an amazing soul. play some music. stare at the ceiling and imagine that you're sitting on the grass and watching the stars. you deserve the world. i know that this is just something from a stranger but you deserve so much more than life has thrown at you!",26Apr2020,1
15,"yesterday i broke up with my boyfriend and ever since i’ve been feeling utterly miserable. he was someone who i really relied on for support and such... which i know probably isn’t healthy but somehow i just slowly became like this. 

i feel so guilty for so many things. i was always paranoid and jealous and crying, always a complete mess in front of him and he never once complained about it at all. but inside i felt like i was draining him and dragging him down with me. and then after he suddenly couldn’t spend any time with me i realized how toxic i must have been. 

i constantly expected him to always be there for me, and always spend time with me when i wanted him. and expected him to give me my space when i wanted it. and when he needed his space it drove me crazy. i have never wanted to be a hypocrite but now i am and i feel so so guilty and sick when i think about that. 

my mental health for a while now has been getting worse and worse, i have broken down many times and cut and burned myself. i want help so desperately but it feels so impossible. i feel like i am sabotaging myself so that i have nothing good. 

i haven’t been able to eat or drink or sleep. i’ve been trying everything in my power to distract myself. but it’s such a persistent knot in the back of my throat and in my chest and stomach that feels like a constant reminder. 

i am deathly afraid of being alone with myself. i don’t know what i can do about it during quarantine. i don’t want to keep hurting and starving myself. i feel like i have no control over my words or actions and i really feel like i’m going crazy.

my mom is visiting me tomorrow and i don’t know if i’ll be able to act normal. she is very worried and has enough issues i hate worrying her like this. i feel like a burden for everyone in my life. i’m just adding more weight on their shoulders and i hate myself for that.",26Apr2020,1

17,"long post sorry i need to rant.

**Backstory bc idk you might need it:**

Okay so I've kinda dealt with anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts since I was in like 5th grade (prob younger tbh) and I went really down the hole in my sophomore year of hs but junior and senior year i was doing better and I went by myself on a trip and I came back so much more mentally healthy. Except for when I'm at home(house I grew up in). I have three siblings (all boys I'm the girl, second youngest) and things have always been tough and highly competitive ie. no crying allowed B's were for little bitches, top athletes only and you gotta high on that popularity scale(they literally compare how many girls have asked them out). I'm the black sheep so I'm basically none of that. I have dyslexia(not diagnosed professionally because my family doesn't do therapy like that but at least 10 different people have told me including teachers) I'm not athletic(fucking couch potato for days)and a total introvert. I love animals and I'm a huge softy(secretly, i hide it by being nasty w/ my tongue kinda a bad habit now that I'm out of the house(you know defensively)) and I'm very into baking(not appreciated very much bc of cost of supplies). I'm the only one in my family who doesn't want to go into engineering. Aaaannnnyyyways lot of shit but main thing is I don't get along very well with them. I try but its like water and oil most of the time. It's mostly me and my dad(I could write a fucking book about him forcing me into dating  after accusing me of dating bc he tracked me to an event I was photographing for yearbook)(It's a whole lot of fun). I went to college and moved out but came home during the summer(I'm the only one moved out I pay all my own bills) and it was a major beating mentally. While in college I had learned to lower my guard and ""bare my soul"" to others and open up about my shit(I've told two people about my anorexia, cutting, suicidal thoughts, etc. Yay me!)(on here doesn't count you guys don't know who I am). I guess I was no longer used to the heaviness of my household. They all lived together still, my younger brother my parents both my older brothers and one of their girlfriends. Now this last time I have come home for the longest time I ever will(thanks corona) and I guess it kinda smacked me in the face how my family seemed more tight-knit without me in it and my dad seemed to have replaced me with my brother's gf. Not the first time but I guess it sucked more bc he was never very supportive about me wanting to work with animals and do environmental stuff but with her(she changed from a french major to marine science)(im pre-vet) he was always talking to her about opportunities and what she was thinking about it and well basically like an adult. I guess yeah I struggle but man that hurt bad. I know no one treats me like an adult and my dad always acts like me getting a job at a vet clinic was now a bad thing and I had to do better. Okay Ima start rambling so that's all the backstory Ima give. I just wanted you guys to kinda see whats heavy in my head and why i am the way I am.

**Tonight:**

Okay I prob overreacted but I wasnt having the best day and I was really looking forward to those cookies. So I had made a batch of chocolate chip cookies dough and I was waiting for it to be morning so I could bake(Its too hot during the day) and I was so excited bc it was a new recipe so I told everyone to please leave it alone. Later in the day I'm Zooming my bf(love that man we've been dating over a year and he knows EVERYTHING) and I was all depressed because I see him again in August and that shit is far and we are very cuddly people. I napped bc I had a headache and came downstairs for dinner only to have my seat stolen by my brother's gf.

**Side note:**  *I know that sounds childish as fuck but man every time I get up from whatever seat to get something she literally sits in my seat. Like I was watching tv after cleaning my ass off and I got up to get water and I turn around and she was sitting exactly where I was like you got a whole ass couch wtf! And if she hadn't known I was sitting there I wouldn't have minded as much but she watched me get up! She knows I wont say anything bc my bother gots a mad temper at anyone who doesn't treat princess right.*

She had been sitting on the opposite side of the table and I got up to grab a plate and she took my spot... Like I had my drink and phone there and she moved it(this shit has happened like 100 times). So that kinda irked me but I just sat at the edge of the table. Then come the ""lets kill June's cat jokes"" (my name obviously isn't June but I'm not about to just give it out) which happens a lot since they are all dog people and I love my cat who isn't a huge people person and isn't a fan of being touched(hence the enemy of all people who like to touch animals without their permission). They all take turns talking about how she'd make a good hat or target practice and shit and I'm sitting there pissed but trying to go along with the family. Then they all start saying ""well if you had a gun and had to either shoot our cat or our dog which would you shoot?"" and when I responded id rather shoot myself they all laughed and joked they'd just shoot my cat without any prompting needed. It kinda sucks and I'm keeping to myself and I go in to put food away and I discover that my carefully wrapped cookie dough that I was oh so excited for had been opened and someone had stuck their grubby lill fingers in and not covered it up and now it was rock hard and ruined(if you are a baker you know this). I was so upset because I really wanted my family's approval on it(baking is one of the few things I get praises on) and when I told everyone and demanded who did it they were all laughing and no one came forward(it was only one person bc it was one scoop and I can see the indents of only 2 fingers). That really ticked me off and at that point I didn't want to talk to anyone because I was fuming and upset. I just go inside and clean up the dinner mess. My mom comes in and gets upset when I give her short answers and tell her to please leave me alone. My brother comes in and is exasperated when I tell him I am upset about the cookies and I don't want to come outside and play cards bc I have math hrw. He said ""Sounds fake."" (I finished it before coming on her to rant) and finally while I was finishing up my hrw my dad came up and showed me the dough he had 'defrosted' by putting in the microwave and ask me if I was happy that ""I ruined the night for everyone because I had exaggerated"" and the cookie dough was fine. (almost a direct quote). I know I probably did but these days I've been so depressed I can hardly breath. I'm just so tired of dealing with it and trying to be better and then just them not caring I guess. I don't know. I wasn't this emotional before I graduated high school but now if my bf even raises his voice I'm breaking down and I honestly cried a bit from this incident. I have never been a crier before but I don't know how to be a cold ass bitch anymore. Tips? Thoughts? I don't even know why I'm posting this. Prob to avoid going downstairs so they can all shit on me.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk sorry for all the misspellings and grammar shit.",26Apr2020,1
18,"I never had someone to goof around with physically, never had someone to say “hey, let’s go get some food together” or “let’s hang out at the park.” I didn’t have that.. ever. Even when I was a kid no one was compelled to speak to me unless they were lonely. I was always a past resort. And now.. I try my hardest to make friends over the internet, I’m an introvert who’s a bit scared of going out due to anxiety, and the only “outdoor” hobby I have is ballet but, that’s out of the question. I see how easy people make friends from a hobby they do online, like art and writing, I’m not gifted at either of those things but I still share my creativity. Yet nothing. It makes me feel like you have to shine to be able to attract people. Be attractive, or be good at something. Be incredibly funny. I feel painfully average, and maybe that’s why I don’t attract people.. I met my first ever best friend on reddit almost a year ago. He’s my boyfriend. But I feel it’s important to have friends as well. I never had a girl friend go goof around with, to attack each other with affection, I’ve never had a sleep over. I never hung out with another human in a public setting. I never had that and.. seeing all these people who do? I can see what I’m missing. It’s hard.. it’s hard knowing these people somehow attracted others to them like a magnet. Yet I’ve been trying for years, and I haven’t attracted one person to continuously talk to. It hurts.. and I feel like giving up, but I want friends too badly to do that",26Apr2020,1

I would like your opinion if you think there is any value for those “battling depression” to read books or watch videos of motivational speakers like Tony Robinson.

22,I am living with my boyfriend during this quarantine. I feel like he hates me and doesn't love me anymore. This quarantine has been hard because we are around each other and it is very stressful. He used to be so happy when he saw me before. Now every thing I do annoys him. We don't have sex anymore and he doesn't notice when I dress up. We were arguing before over his female friend. They were spending a lot of time alone together. I was uncomfortable and asked them to reduce contact a little. He did that and got mad at me. Now he brings it up constantly. He won't let me ride my bike or walk during quarantine because he is paranoid. I stay home. We are both miserable with no end in sight.

A 23 year military career ended 6 months ago. Raised kids through letters, email, and pictures. Divorced.  Lost some friends.  I’ve seen the best and worst of humanity.  Was it worth it? I don’t know.

I'm only 18, ik i'm still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I don't have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didn't keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that I'm helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like ""if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you"", well thanks, but the real issue is that I can't find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. That's for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions.  
My parents know that there's something off about me but I've always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldn't understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I can't blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same.

25,"I don't know where to start. I dated a girl for 7 months. She was my first girlfriend and so I was really happy. We started dating because I supported her and tried to help her with depression. I was there for her and would always take time to chat with her and talk about her problems and would generally try to help her. She said she liked me but I don't know if that is true. It isn't anymore.

Overtime we grew distant. I think it was because we hadn't seen each other in a few months. She then said she didn't like me anymore. I still like her but she didn't. I was and still am heartbroken. One of the main reasons I want to end it all is because of the break up.  I  was and still am really lonely, as I have nearly no friends. 

I felt like and still feel like I was the only one supporting her.  She did not have many friends and I was the first person to like her. I feel like she just used and then thought nothing of it. 

Then I went to talk with her. I decided to try to keep supporting her. I don't know what else to do. Then she said that she had told her mother that she was going to the library, when she was going to the city to commit suicide. But she did not do it. 

I don't know what to do. The overwhelming pressure of school, family relationship issues and my social life is killing me. I want to die so bad. I have no friends to talk to so that is why I am posting this here. I've been hurt and everything is weighing me down. 

I feel like I am a failure. I did not think why she was being distant. As I said before I feel responsible for how she felt and feels. I was the one there supporting her I guess. Along with family problems my school gives us a lot of work as it is a top school in the state. 
Help. I feel like I am going to die from everything. I want to die. All advice is welcome.",26Apr2020,1
26,"Uh hi Reddit, I guess straight to the point, I'm 90% sure I'm depressed but that's not quite necessarily the topic, I guess it's the fact that I seem to enjoy being depressed and just that scares me. Like what if I get too depressed and it's hard for me get out of that state of mind, I've had a rough couple of years and have been depressed (at least I think it's depression) for large portion of them, over the last 6 months maybe I've seemed to enjoy being depressed and that version of myself more and more, almost accepting that's how it is and obviously that's not what you ideally want. 
Accepting depression. I guess what I'm trying to get out of this is, Why am I liking the depressed version of me? And why do I seem like to want to be depressed?

30,"Hi

Just needed someone to talk to.

I’ve battled with depression on and off since my early teens.

A couple of years ago I was in a very stable place and slowly came off my meds. I’ve still had bad days but thanks to a really solid routine and therapy and loving partner and a hell of a lot of coping mechanisms I’ve managed to keep on top of things. 

It’s always felt a little like a balancing act though. As long as I do everything right I’m ok. If I let something slip I can feel my mental health start sliding.

Obviously my routine (like everyone’s) has been thrown off by lockdown. I’ve been trying to build new coping mechanisms but I don’t think I’ve managed to do it fast enough.

I woke myself up crying three days ago. Since then I’ve hardly managed to do anything. I’ve been trying to do the things that usually help but they aren’t helping. I had a panic attack and lay on the floor crying for a few hours yesterday.
Today I tried to go for a cycle and get some fresh air. I managed to get dressed and get to the garage and got on my bike. But I couldn’t stop crying and couldn’t see the road properly. Ended up getting off and just sitting by the side of the road staring into space. I made myself a sandwich for lunch and thought I’d eaten it but I just walked into the kitchen and it’s still on the side and all the ingredients were still out and the fridge has just been open.

I’m feeling scared. I haven’t felt this down in ages. I don’t want to be in this place again.",26Apr2020,1

35,"Like so many others on this subreddit, I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life. However, over the course of the past two years or so, it seems to have fizzled out to a pretty substantial degree. 

In truth, I have no idea why. I haven't taken medication or gone to therapy in almost four years now, and my diet and coping mechanisms remained relatively the same during that period. I'm currently 23 years old, and the brain has been known to continue developing up to 26 in many cases, so I suppose it's possible that whatever chemical imbalances plagued me miraculously resolved themselves. 

Anyways, no longer feeling depressed to such a degree--while certainly a blessing that I'm sure many people here dream would happen (and I truly hope it does)--has brought on some unexpected challenges. The biggest of which is that, now, everything just feels... Bland. Depression brought crashing lows, but when those would lapse, the relative 'lack' of negativity brought on soaring highs. I was addicted to that feeling. It's really well explained with this short Bukowski poem:

""I don't know if this is true to you 
but for me
sometimes it gets so bad
that anything else,
say like,
looking at a bird on an overhead
power line
seems as great as a Beethoven symphony.
then you forget it and you're back
again.""

I felt comfort in that experience. It was what inspired me to write poems and songs. It was what made a connection with someone feel so deeply special. In a lot of ways, it was my home. It's a little ridiculous to speak as though I miss being depressed, I know, but it's surprisingly difficult being 'better'. It feels as though I've traded ""I don't want to be here"" for ""I don't know why I'm even here"", if that makes any sense. I just want things to feel more substantial again.

Well, thanks for listening to me rant about that. Any advice you can give me would be very appreciated.",26Apr2020,1

37," 

Things haven't been easy. I've been..sad.

Why sad? Because of a comment my boss said. It was supposed to be helpful. Don't be tardy. Nothing wrong right? I KNOW it's nothing wrong. I had lamented that i couldn't get along with my colleagues and wondered why. I can get along with some, but with the current ones its awkward.

But then she said don't let people think you're lazy, don't let them give you the impression. I was truly exhausted. I had just failed to pick up a bag that had dropped to the floor and my colleague picked it up, and that apparently can let them think I'm lazy. I think back on all the hell-bent work I've done over the past year, for Christmas and the sweat--and I come to the conclusion that no--its not that I'm lazy. It's not that I can't take criticism. It's that you don't value your employees fairly. I don't mind if you critique me fairly, but don't call me lazy when my other colleagues may come punctually but spend the hour chatting loudly at the top of their voice, laughing like a hyena and disturbing others, and suddenly surprisingly being quiet when the boss arrives. 

Fake.

I know, I know. This is the workplace. It's nooooormal. Fakery, bitching, backstabbing. Not for me. I'm an INFP. I'm 24 this year. And I still think like a child. Am I supposed to...enjoy and accept this? And it frustrates me so much. Why can't I be smarter. Why can't I be more matured. Why must I be so stupid, so rebellious even at this age? I don't smoke or drink or do any viceful things...but it's just my attitude. My incredibly sulky and childish attitude when people say things I don't want to hear. 

INFP. Alturisitic....stupid....blah blah. Our personality type is....naive. And our personality type is the one type out of everyone that struggles the most to cope with the outside. It's worse for me, because of my lack of self-esteem.

And I struggle. So much. I struggle to see the positive when I get critiqued, I turn into a defensive child. ""No....no!"" That's how I react.

I had stupidly thought I'd done my best especially being more loud and acting during work, but it wasn't enough. I feel like a child that can never please her parent, and I'm so tired of it. All I ever asked in life was to make someone proud, but my cons outweight my pros, and all that i can focus (or at least be reminded of) is my cons. It's hard to remember what my pros are. But it's not their fault. My work bonus was increased slightly. So in the end, it wasn't even money. Deep down, I yearned for affection and the approval similar to a parent.

If I have a child, I will never put her down. I'll equally tell her the good and the bad. Telling someone their weaknesses ALL the time, even if its supposed to be for improvement, it's demoralising. But the workplace isn't like that. Right? A normal person has a solid family background and thrives outside because they don't have to seek love in work of all places, but someone who lacks it seeks it anywhere. You might mention friends, but I fear burdening them. I had been too.....depressive. And we ended things. 

I know, I know. This is a workplace. I know why I am like that. I lacked family love growing up. A structure. a sense of.....belonging and self-esteem. Is it wrong to look for it outside? It wasn't wrong. But for the world...it is.The reason why I am hurt in the first place is because I yearned and trusted her as my confidant. I shouldn't.

Here are the things I did .

1. Friday:

I came home from work, mood at a -100% after hearing it. I changed my profile picture to a depressive one , posted suicidal notes as my suicidal thoughts came back and went to sleep to forget about things.

Sat:

2. I woke up slightly better but became bad again when I remembered what had happened.

I felt a frightful sense of exhaustion and that same depressive thought that i was a failure of a daughter to my mum and dad, my family, my workplace, and worst of all, myself. I was a sulky, moody, angry and angst broken flower who smiled so much with kids, but became fearful of what adults said even though I was one.

3. Around 8pm I spoke to my colleague about my troubles. We talked for nearly an hour and she was lovely and so supportive and she made me realise sometimes my defensive and oversensitive attitude made people not want to be close to me. I hadn't realised and was shocked. It was like AH, so that's why they didn't want to be friends with me. Not because I was an evil person or anything, no, no. But because I was like a CACTUS. A VERY prickly, VERY green, VERY dark-faced cactus. 

4. I felt slightly better and went back to sleep. I decided that yes, its childish to change my DP like that and changed it back to a picture of a family I love. I texted my mom to apologise. we had stopped talking for 10 days because of a fight. we don't stay together as my parents have split.

SUN 

Today. 5. Mood was good in the morning as i went for a talk online Mckenzie kurtz, star of frozen in the morning. she made me feel motivated. and i'm applying for a musical theatre course. i was accepted. i felt happy but equally shitting my pants because I am not confident in singing or dancing. acting yes, but not the rest. i started questioning myself.

Aw, hell, do i really want this? I want acknowledgment. But what acknowledgement is there if you aren't even spectacular?

so that's it. i am sulking. I don't know how to...grow up. I'm always, always constantly dissatisfied with myself and that feeling drives anyone crazy. It's so difficult and I'm tempted to just say fuck it and smoke and drink cos its easy. It's easy. It's EASIER. I could have been a gangster. Maybe it could have been easier. I avoided stressful situations because i KNEW it would trigger my sadness and it did. I don't even know for sure if its depression. I used to be so depressed in school because of family....no friends....being a cactus in class yet wanting friends....not fitting in. I felt happier when I started teaching kids. No more judgement.  I was so, so happy and kind and am great at my job. But adults...they scare the shit out of me. Because my family....especially my dad and his stepmom....i never recalled any emotional love at all from them. It was demeaning, terrifying. Adults are so scary they make me want to wallow up and cry though I'm not one. Is this PTSD? I don't know. All I know is that I have always had trouble making friends, my boss made it a point to suggest its my fault, and I don't know how to fake being happy and smile when I can't.  I react so badly, so defensively and depressively when I get criticized. I'm so oversensitive and my emotions CONTROL me like a leash. It's overwhelming.

But what else can I do? How can I grow? How can I be strong when I'm transparent (too honest and expressive even at work with my emotions) and as fragile as glass?",26Apr2020,1

39,"Hi everyone,

I'm a uni graduate, 7 months out now but no job to show for it, a lot has gone down since this time, and i'd like to go through it if you can be patient with me. 

Before I left university everything was going well, i had just come back from an internship i had in China, I had a loving girlfriend, I graduated very well from a top universuty. And i was prepared to move forward with my life. But i think it has all gone wrong. 

(First, I had a depressive spiral in my teens that i recovered from before, i had an L4 spinal fusion and spent 6 months recovering in bed (Though snuck out to debate in parliament, take that doctors!!). Left alone with my thoughts, and my friends moving away to university. I sunk into a depression that nearly culminated in me killing myself. Though i fought my way out and tried to better myself. )

My girlfriend left me for another bloke, i got really ill and lost a lot of muscle i grew after my surgery and became skinny fat. And my Best friendship broke down after he threatened and tried to cut me with a knife (A whole Mentally ill saga that would take pages and pages to explain.). And moved back to a struggling home with physically/mentally ill parents that don't know how to support me emotionally (Not their fault!! they do try their best by me).

All of which contributed to me sinking into a depression in October, i fought my way out and applied for a range of different jobs and schemes. But didn't get on any of them. This caused another spiral that lasted till February. 

I've been fighting my way out though, i was seeing a therapist but covid killed that, and was taking antidepressants but they made things worse. 

Ive substituted them with Physical exercise. I run 10km every 6 days out of a week, and am blasting my skinny fat spots. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose. 

But i struggle to motivate myself to take the extra step to get myself together and move forward with my life, Looking at job websites and stuff makes anxiety just make me freeze, or do anything i can to distract myself. Though i am fighting my depressive state, i cant help but feel apathetic about the world and about myself in it. I struggle to motivate myself because i struggle to see the point to. 

I have no real motivation to improve myself (learn to drive/code/travel more) i only seem to take interesting but impractical courses that have no physical use like ""the ancient history of food. But i feel this is just a distraction to . Apathy just feels like a slow death, and i know that the decisions i make now will shape the person i become in the future. When i try to motivate myself to learn these kinds of things, it is for material reasons, which don't appeal to me. I don't have any real motivations or dreams anymore that require me to learn them

On self-reflection, a lot of these feelings of apathy come from two key problems in my life

1.) Lack of and seeming inability to maintain meaningful relationships that sustain me-it can be days between which i get a text. It is my fault, but i seem incapable of change no matter how much i try. 

2.) Lack of purpose or community, there is little in this world that sustains me spiritually, and a lot of the world seems shallow and just full of suffering. I struggle to connect with a world that seems so indifferent. 

Sorry if any of this comes across as whiny or self-pitying, that is not my intention. 

I could just use some tips and pointers from fellow people going through this on how they motivate themselves to build better lives for themselves. As I hate feeling this consistent nothingness and want to fight to lead a life that i can be proud of. 

Thank you for reading through my diatribe.",26Apr2020,1
40,"Does anyone have a hard time watching TV shows where characters are living happy lives? It sounds goofy, but I was watching a show recently that depicted romance between two young adults (younger then me at least). I'm in my late 20's and never dated or have been in a relationship. I went through high school and college without even trying. My social anxiety and fear of rejection stopped me from trying. That part is my fault. I relate the show to seeing my friends and people I know in high school settling down and having kids. My current situation is being stuck at my mom's house because of high college loan payments. I racked up over 100k, I was stupid with a lot my college choices. I thought I would be making at least 20k more then I am now by the way everyone I knew was talking college up.

My mental health is in shambles. Because of the quarantine, I am ~stuck~ safe at home. Thankfully I live with my very kind, and understanding parents, who have helped me get this far. But I fear that I’m putting too much on them. 

Before beginning to type this I was a few moments away from leaving my room, and bringing them all my belts, pills, a pair of scissors, my pocket knife.. basically anything that could be used to harm myself. Then unloading everything that’s been going on in my head onto them. That just isn’t right or fair to do. They’ve got their own lives and problems, and I really don’t want to be a burden.

I’ll be clear here and say, I’m not actively suicidal.

I am however close enough that I believe the above actions seem reasonable.

While I have always struggled with depression, I haven’t felt the way I do now in many years. Usually it’s more struggling to be happy or care, less struggling with hatred of myself. If that makes sense?

I’m so scared of what’s happening in my mind right now. I don’t want to go back to the days of suicide attempts, and being hospitalized. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I just want to feel nothing again.

47,"Hey Reddit. I need some advice from you guys. I have a few problems with my mom understanding my illness and related struggles.

I am 20 and live with my dad. I have been diagnosed with depression and my therapist and I suspect that I might have Asperger's syndrome but due to Corona I can't go forward with testing for that. My parents don't know about my suspicions of having Asperger's so I will only talk about my depression in the following. I just wanted you guys to know in case I didn't understand the situation right or I'm  rude without noticing.

I had a burnout last summer/fall due to not knowing how to say no at work and often doing extra work/after work events that I hated so I did have to go home since I could always feel the stress in the Air. In the end the outcome of my family situation was that my sister won't talk to my dad anymore, and she and my mom moved out which was a releve for me since I had a stressfree safe place again. A while after that my sister began treatment for her depression (depression seams to run in our family since my grandfather on my mother's side had also depression and ended up killing him self because of them). 

I kind of had a few bad experiences with therapists since I had the feeling they were judging me or had a personality that wasn't compatible with mine and I couldn't be vulnerable around them. So around Christmas I finally found a therapist that I like and appreciate. Anyway to the problem since I started therapie I noticed that when my mom called or came to visit (often only with a small heads up like ""I'll come by later to collect ""insert item"". ) Witch in itself wasn't a problem. When I said I'm busy and couldn't talk to her / spend time she always understut, but when I said I didn't want to talk or I just hadn't the social energy for it she either said ""ok"" and was upset/offended or would ask questions. When I answered the questions with ""I just have a bad day"" or deflected otherwise she got upset and would ask even no and wouldn't except my boundaries and I had to get loud and audibly annoyed for her to shut up. ( I'm not proud of myself for it but in the situation it always seems the only way out since I was always afraid that if I didn't get out that situationit would really hurt me mentally.) So in the end my mom would be offended and I would have to apologize over and over again. I'm sick of this cycle and it causes me to be stressed when I'm meeting up with her since I expect that we somehow end up fighting again. I don't know how to explain to her how  I'm feeling, that if I don't want to talk means Im mentaly mit able to and that it has nothing to do with her. 
Maybe someone went to the same and can help. Maybe someone knows how to approach that. Maybe someone is a parent and can tell me how they would like to be told that.

50,"My wife and I have been together for 5 years, married for 2. Going into it, I wasn’t aware of her depression but I was told before we got married and figured, “Okay, maybe I can help her with it.” I was mistaken. She’s worked at the same workplace since we’ve been together and over the last couple of years, has been unhappy with it. I’ve done the best I can in encouraging her to make a change that she will be happy with but she never does anything to actually make any changes. Also over this time period, she has become very angry at times when I’m attempting to help with things when she gets in a mood. So angry that at a few points, she has become physical (hitting me on the chest/shoulder, never anything that leaves marks or life threatening in any way) and she also becomes verbally abusive, calling me overweight, stupid, etc. There have been times where I’ve become very frustrated and have slammed my fist in a counter or doorframe but I have never and will never direct that frustration towards her physically. I’m trying my best here but just don’t feel like things are getting better. She’s been to a counselor a few times and has had weekly appointments but has not been able to go due to COVID-19 and she has fallen back in to old ways. She recently told me that she tried to kill herself in high school but had never told anyone and no one except her mother has ever known that. There are times when she is spiraling down that she makes comments that everyone would be better off if she killed herself. When she says things like that, I feel like I’m failing even though I know she’s in a dark place. I try my best to be supportive but I’m coming to the end of my wits and I could use some advice/help.

52,"I just don’t understand. I want to kill myself and tried once and failed and will try again. but I don’t understand why I feel this way. I have so many loving friends, I party, I have sex, I am always surrounded by friends. My home life is great I have loving parents and siblings. I get good grades in school, I’m athletic, I’m pretty good looking and I love myself. Usually I read this sub for help and it seems like everyone is either lonely, heartbroken, horrible home life, suffering from PTSD etc.. but I’m not dealing with any of that. None of my friends or family know that I’ve been dealing with this for about 2 years now. I debated going to the doctors and seeing if I can get on meds or something to make me stop feelings this way but I just don’t see a point. There’s no point to this all. Please help, I don’t want to die but I just don’t want to be here anymore. Please if anyone else is in a similar situation and made it out alive please help. Please.",26Apr2020,1
53,"It all started small with gambling csgo skins with friends. Which then escalated as soon I turned 18. I have lost over probably 20 000 SEK in 2019. It all ended with me suspending myself through the Swedish betting service for a year.   


I still gamble sometimes on international websites but haven't done any since Covid-19 delayed all the sports games.   


The only thing I told my friends last year was about the money I won, but never about how much I lost. I lied to my mother about spending all the money on stupid things and now she always talking badly about me over the phone with her friends when I'm around. When she actually doesn't know the truth. She has always told me to never gamble, but it has turned to an addict.   


The only person that knows about my addict is my Swedish teacher, through an essay I made about banning gambling commercials in Sweden. I told her about how I took a loan which I still pay off (I'm almost done with it and I will never do it again). But I don't know if she knows that I really got an addict, or if I only wrote the things for the essay.   


I don't want to search for professional help, because I don't think it will help. And I won't tell my parents. I have always wanted to tell my friends, just to hope for some support. But haven't had the nerves to do that.   


You may think gambling only hurts my finances, but I don't feel good at all.   


The gambling addict, the fact that I always think that I will be lonely for the rest of my life (even when I know that's false), has made me have suicidal thoughts lately.",26Apr2020,1

55,"These past weeks I can feel myself getting more and more anxious about EVERYTHING. I’ve had anxiety most of my life and it’s been manageable due to grounding exercises, keeping my head clear, etc but these past few weeks it’s been completely unmanageable. No matter what I do these exercises and tools haven’t been working, even if they’ve worked in the past.

My anxiety is now to the point that it’s interrupting my daily life constantly. I’ve never talked about to a doctor about my anxiety (I’m self diagnosed...I know self diagnosing is bad but I’m gonna explain why) my mom thinks the only time I need to go to the doctor is if I’m dying. She’s a psych nurse before that she was a Rn. I just wanna sit down with her and talk about what’s going on but she’ll say stuff like “there’s plenty of tools you could be using but you refuse to.” Even though most of them are tools that don’t work for me. She has anxiety and depression too, and once again she has her own tools but that’s what works for her not me. Me trying to talk to her usually ends up with her yelling at me about this or that. It’s tiring and I think I need professional help. If anyone had any ideas please let me know.",26Apr2020,1
56,"I have nothing, I am nothing, I will never be anything. I don’t have any passions, any motivation, any desire to be anything. I can’t keep relationships. I push people away for no reason. I’ve recently lost several good friends and my girlfriend. I don’t have a job. I don’t have any useful skills. I don’t have any hobbies. I sleep 12 hours every night. I never used to be like this and I have no idea where or when my life started to collapse.

I would kill myself, but I am terrified of death and I don’t want my family to be sad. 

I guess I’m just going to live out the rest of my miserable life. I will accomplish nothing and I will be forever alone.",26Apr2020,1
57,"Maybe im just passing through one of those stupid suicidal crisis but. Like. I feel horrible. My brain have 2 separates ideas which make me feel crazy. Or I'm that stupid jerk, or my parents are the jerks. I really need to kill myself. But i have hemophobia (fear of blood) so i cant. Its strange actually. I wanna kill myself, but i wanna feel happy before i die. But. Just how. My sleep deprivations are growing. I was falling asleep around 1am. Now its 2:30 am. At this rythm i'll dont be able to sleep anymore before 2021. I just cant. I wanna kill myself but i dont know how to do it properly. I can just wait 'till im 18 to get a gun but 5 years is stupidly long. Everyday the wound gets bigger. But it never gets lethal. It just. Hurt. No one can fix that wound. The wound is that big that it's covering your whole body. Youre the wound. You hate the wound. You hate your whole body. You hate yourself. No ones sees the wound. No ones sees that bag of rocks, slowly filling up, to the point you cant get out of your bed anymore. Anyone can take a rock in his hand. But no one can take a mountain in his hand. No one can fix the wound. If you lose a part of your body, you'll get a prosthesis. But who can create a prosthesis of a life? No one.

58,"I am a 20 yr old male, almost have two years of college done. I feel like life ahead of me is a mountain that I am supposed to climb yet I hate rock climbing. I'm sitting at the base of the mountain looking up and hating what I see. I have a girlfriend and mom who want to help me and support me but I don't know how to let them help me. I don't know what to say or do with them. I never have anything to talk about. It's partly anxiety, depression and a blank fucking head.  I don't know what I want to do for a job, everything seems uninteresting. I feel awful all the time, I have my second therapist appointment on wednesday but I don't even know how to say that life is a drag that I dont want to attend without being put in a mental hospital, sometimes I think that would be best for me but I dont want to. Life just seems like so much work and I'm lazy, depressed, tired, uninterested. Idk what to do",26Apr2020,1

So I am literally alone and for a time that is ridiculously long ... I feel that this it consumes me inside ... What do I do? PS: All the people I asked for help didn't do it ... Or they ignored it ... Or they don't want to help me ... All the people who knew me hurt in one way or another ... I also recently finished a relationship that was toxic ... And that was a liar ... And I loved her very much and it hurt that the whole time I was with her she lied to me and saw that she was actually toxic ... Besides, now this relationship with people that I asked for help ...
