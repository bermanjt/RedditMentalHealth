0,"The girl I’ve crushed on for a while is gonna be moving away soon. When she told me, I realized there was no point in trying to pursue her anymore, because everything about that would just hurt. We’re still friends, but I kinda just gave up on being with her.

Anyways, that, combined with a lot of other stuff has made me feel real shitty about everything. School is stressing me out and I’m falling behind. I’m so tired and irritable. My relationship with my dad isn’t great. I’m losing interest in my hobbies, which have been some of the main things that get me through the day. I miss seeing my friends, but at the same time I have no idea how to interact with them anymore. I feel like crying but I can’t. I just feel so empty and useless and awful.

Anyways me and some friends, including my crush, were hanging out yesterday and I think she picked up that I wasn’t really feeling up to it. We haven’t messaged each other in weeks, probably because I’m the one that usually initiated the conversations. 

Last night she messaged me asking if I was okay, and said that I seemed distracted. I told her I was fine, but she asked again. So I just told her a bunch of stuff on my mind. She has gone through some similar problems before, so we talked for an hour or two. About my problems, about her problems. It’s the closest I’ve ever felt to her. And afterwards, I felt better. I felt like despite how much I might hate myself and how worthless I feel, there’s a girl that cares about me and wants to know if I’m okay. Maybe not romantically, but she cares. And, that just meant so much to me. I felt at peace for a bit.

But I feel like reality slipped back in. She’s still going to move. I can’t be with her in person anymore. I won’t get to hear her laugh. I won’t have the chance to be with her.

Maybe it would’ve been better if she hadn’t checked on me at all, because now I feel like I need her more than ever. Before, I hated myself and wanted to die, by myself. But now, I hate myself and want to die AND i feel like I need her. She understands what I’m feeling more than any of my other friends. And if she leaves, I don’t know what I’m going to do. 

But at the same time, i wouldn’t want to burden her with dealing with my feelings all the time. She still has a life, and I’m sure she’s even more upset than me about moving away. That kind of dependent relationship probably wouldn’t be healthy.

I love her so much. I don’t know what to do.",19Oct2020,1
1,"Hello! I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, or if I’m looking for someone to talk to or if I’m trying to give advice (maybe that’s it). 

I’ve been in love for a year. From the moment I saw her I knew she would be someone who would change my life. She was beautiful, she was smart and funny and she was made for me, no matter how hard I closed myself away she pulled me in. And so I knew that opening myself up would cause so much pain, in time it always does. And it did, but with everything that hurt me, there was an equal amount of peace and harmony. She was who I knew I wanted forever. Here’s the hard part; through time my depression took over. I wasn’t myself and I didn’t even know it. I didn’t tell her that I needed her, I didn’t give her the things that I know she needed. I thought I was trying but I wasn’t. It changed me and I didn’t even know it. I couldn’t communicate to her that she was the love of my entire life. I couldn’t tell her how badly I wanted her babies, or how much I envisioned my life with her and our kids that I’d wanted. And now I’m in a hotel room alone. 

Guys, I don’t need advice. I need to give it. Take a look at yourself and see if your illness is causing your loved ones pain. If it is, I beg of you to try and change. Try try try try try. Tell them you love them before it’s too late.",19Oct2020,1
2,"A few days ago I was writing in my journal talking about the past two days before then. My mom had screamed at me two days before while I was on the phone and that really triggered me. Also she basically called me lazy because my room is messy, but I just don’t have enough energy to clean it. Anyways then, I tried to write about the day after she yelled at me. I kept thinking and thinking and thinking, but all I remembered was going to Whole Foods and then immediately after I was on the phone with my friend. I remember almost nothing me and her talked about and I don’t remember anything before or after these two things happened. I find this very strange and I was wondering if this is a common thing people with depression struggle with or is it just me? And if it’s not common, does anyone know why this happened?",19Oct2020,1
3,"I’m about to be 29 and I still feel as useless and hopeless as I did in high school. Because of covid I lost my real job and I’ve been driving for a delivery app but have so little motivation I don’t think I’ll be able to pay all my bills in the next few weeks. My friends are going through a lot but I haven’t been a good enough friend and I’m pretty sure they all hate me now. I have an amazing partner but I don’t understand why they like me at all and I’m sure they’ll leave me sooner rather than later. I’m so lonely and depressed all the time. I have no reason to believe I’m lovable and no matter what good things I try to do I don’t think I’m a good person. I had a really awful childhood and struggle with cptsd, and I logically know a lot of the thoughts I have are due to how I was treated growing up, but I can’t get passed them enough to even believe I deserve caring about myself enough to reach out for help. Why should I bother other people with my problems when I could just die and let everyone move on without me? Even professionals don’t deserve to have to listen to me, especially when I couldn’t even pay them because I have $100 to my name. My friends and my partner deserve better than me. They’re amazing people and I just sort of take up space in their lives. I need way more attention and reassurance than is fair to ask for. I’m an emotional and financial burden and I’m back in a place where I can’t even think about trying to fix it without having a full on breakdown like I am right now",19Oct2020,1
4,"This article was insisting on how you're supposed to call 911 or something like that without hesitation if you're having suicidal thoughts. Made me chuckle. Am I supposed to call them every day? I feel like they have some better things to do and honestly if I've dealt with my shit up until now, why bother someone else. 

Also, what are they gonna do? Arrest my brain or some shit? Technically yes, my brain is responsible of attempted murder on my body, and premeditation too, lol. Or maybe depression. Depression has been trying to kill me for years but this bitch hasn't succeeded, and no matter what it's not going to, but yes, officers, it would be nice to stop fighting against a fucking invisible murderer for once. So if you could arrest it for me that would be amazing. 

Hmpf why not call 911 after all? 

But for real guys take care of yourselves, just wanted to share my random thoughts and hope I at least made you smile a bit. Even if it's in your head.",19Oct2020,1

I'm not crushed under depression yet. I just feel tired and sad a lot.  Which thank god, I've definitely experienced worse for longer.

7,"I have therapy tomorrow, but I really wish I did not exist so I did not have to continue keeping up with living or being a human being. Therapy has felt like a chore more and more lately rather than a help, which may be my own fault over anything and I just don't realize. That happens a lot, I think I'm too selfish of a person and I have a lot of negative qualities that often push people away or make them end up disliking me once they've known me long enough. The only thing I ever feel like I want to do anymore is escape into my art, but that's not realistic as an adult and that is not taken seriously as a career and probably won't until the day of my passing like most artists. I've felt extra drained lately and have been writing a lot of sad poetry that leaves me feeling embarrassed and less sure of myself. I'm too sane in this day and age to do anything drastic, so I just cry dealing with myself. I want to punish myself everything I do something wrong, but it doesn't stop me from making more mistakes.

I hate my existence right now and i can't help myself i'm a lost cause, just trash, there are people who don't give up and continue fighting, i'm not that person, i wanted to be incredible and do so many things in life, but those are just dreams and nothing else, i just think life is misery and i doubt anyone could convince me otherwise, i even wanted to be in a relationship with someone who could understand me, but that's not reality, i don't want to make people commit suicide but now i don't even think is that horrible ( to me, not other people, i may have lost hope but i still have empathy for others)",19Oct2020,1

NSFW - brief self harm/ suicidal thought mentioms


I ( f, turn 20 next week), suspect I may have depression, but I'm not entirely sure. The past few months I have noticed a lot of changes in the way I feel and act. I either can't sleep ( even when taking sleeping meds and being insanely tired) or I am so tired amd deeply asleep that I struggle to get up without feeling physically sick to my stomach every time. I have lost the ability to enjoy and focus on things I still have a great interest in. I have also had multiple panick attacks recently with no apparent trigger, just randonly when I am alone in my room. ( I used to have sensory overload fits commonly during childhood due to sensory processing disorder, but hadn't had any in years before now). I have no energy during the day and my appetite has decreased dramatically, I just don't really feel Hungry or get excited about my favorite foods the way I used to. Most embarrassingly, I have to admit I have started bed wetting, and I hate it so much, it makes feel so ashamed and I always end up breaking down sobbing.

  What prompted me to finally write this, was one morning drive when I felt like I just couldn't handle facing the day and how much better it would be if i just stopped existing. I started thinking about suicide methods I had heard and ultimately decided Iwas too cowardly to actually try anything. When I realized what I was thinking I was terrified and ashamed. I feel really guilty for feeling and thinking all of these things when I dont have a reason though.  

I have never really attempted self harm in the form of cutting or things I typically hear about, but I have found myself using extreme heat to snap myself out of it when I'm zoning out or particulary down in the dumps. I often find myself with mild surface burns that will last a day or two.

I decided to take a couple questioners through my medical cares website, and got several results for severe anxiety and depression but I'm still not sure. Honestly I'm afraid to go to a professional about it because of some things my mom said. I had asked her about seeing somone for anxiety and she told me that a doctor wouldn't help because she thought it was ""obvious you only have social anxiety and the only way to fix it is to force yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable so you can get used to it"". She also shut my sister down when they were talking about their own mental struggles amd my mom adores my sister( she has made it very clear she doesn't support or tolerate me). I feel like I don't have anyone to go to with this. I have also never really been allowed to do anything independently and this will be my first time seeing a doctor without my mom taking over everything.

I have decided I want to seek help, but I'm scared of going in unprepared, so I was helping someone could help. Do I see my primary doctor or is there someone else I should see? What kind of things will they ask about? What information of my own should I have ready when I go in? Can ask about medication or do they decide that based on what I say? What should I talk about with them? Also I have to send an email to make an appointment ( I physically cannot talk on the phome without clamming up or stuttering wildly) so how brief or detailed should I make that email? I have only met my new primary doctor once before so I'm not very familier around them.

Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.",19Oct2020,1
14,"It’s 1:28 am and I’ll still be awake until 4am. The nearest appointment I can get for a new therapist is November 3rd and I can’t wait that long. Besides, I’ve already been to that healthy center, and the previous therapist I had didn’t help at all, and it sucked telling him he wasn’t helpful. It sucks telling the psychiatrist to fuck off when she sent police to my house after missing her phone call. It sucks to return to the same place after telling them to fuck off. 

I don’t have any hope to do anything in life at this point. All I wish for is to kill myself. Therapy and medications haven’t helped over 6 years, and I’m completely alone. I’ve been planning on quitting my job, and leaving a suicide note on the kitchen counter. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. Nothing helps or gets better, and no one will believe me. Everyone tells me I’m wrong for thinking the way I do, and at this point, my death might just stick it to all of you. I hate the feelings I have and I can’t change them. Honestly it feels like I can’t think straight and nothing matters. I have to go to work and help my family, but I’d rather be dead.",19Oct2020,1
15,I am currently a 20 year old college student who is living at college. I began experiencing depression a month or two before I started college a little over two years ago. It continues to get worse and worse and I feel like I’m in a hole and don’t know where to go/what to do. I have abused alcohol and other drugs during these last few years so maybe that is why it continues to get worse. I have also gained about 30 pounds and am no longer as active as I was in high school. I struggle to fall asleep often falling asleep around 6 am and wake up around 1 pm. I visited my parents this last week in my home state after they just finished a divorce and my father moved out. I want to find a therapist or speak to a doctor but I don’t know if my insurance covers that and I cannot ask my mother and father to pay out of pocket for this after the divorce and paying for school. I need advice or just someone to talk to about what to do in order to get over this. I often feel like I just want to sleep and dream in order to not live in reality and get over this perpetual feeling of dread in my stomach.,19Oct2020,1

However, to ask my aunt for money to move out because your immediate family is not willing to help you, I got hit with a real slap in the face by her. Now I'm all for going to vocational school and all of that, that's not my point, but the way she says it and the solutions they all come up with are just horrible. The act of ""moving back ""home"""" doesn't bother me but going back to THEM is just spirit crushing. 

Her quote was ""is that what a man does for work?"" And ""come back here and take a vocational class and  work a real man's job."" (Paraphrased because it was in between yelling and stuff)

I'm hurt. I'm really hurt. That type of behavior is so hamful and so toxic. My family has always been the ""family values"" type people except they actually allow dual income, since they come from Europe. But now I'm stuck here f-ing excited and broken because of some stupid words from someone who doesn't even contribute much to my life other than the inheretence from my uncle and cousin. 

I'm so torn and it hurts really bad to be stuck like this. I know I won't be making the best money and not even the best money in the line of work I'm doing. But it's my first work at home job (and first from my family since they wanna keep busting my balls about ""working in the office is so much better than working the way I do"" (physically labourous job) and I'm so, so happy for the job I got.

So I'm without any certifications in education, can't drive, live off disability...basically I can't look into a career life.

I'm stuck in my tiny apartment. Just me and my 3 cats. I spend so much time sleeping. Just sleeping my days away. I guess I'm just living until I die. 

I want so much more than this. This can't be all there is for me? Is it because I'm not strong enough to just grab life by the balls? Idk. There is so much that is out of my control. If I could drive...I could go places, at least.

She had negligent parents who were low-income. Her family of five had to squeeze in a three room apartment for years. She's suffered emotional abuse at the hands of both her parents. She been molested by relatives and strangers but her parents never did anything to protect her. She's been trying to get through university but mental health and physical health issues keep getting in the way. Next year is her last chance to graduate. She's staying with her uncle and aunt (siblings), but they are not welcoming to her and have triggered her before.

And I'm also at the end of my rope. I was supposed to find a job but I've been supporting her alone for a sudden allergy issue that appeared this year. My family has a bad impression on her and triggered her. We've had traumas in our relationship. My finances are depleted after trying to help her.

I think I can't support her much longer. There's nobody else. She doesn't want to seek help from friends but she has recently. She unloads to me mostly. But new health issues keep appearing. Her mood could destabilise at any moment, unpredictably. It feels like she's dying every day. And honestly I'm starting to think it would be better for her if she died.

I can't support her. I'm exhausted, I'm burnt out. My family would just blame her if I sought help from them. Her friends don't know how to help. The mental health system in my country is lacking, they just send people back to their families but she has no family support. 

I don't see a way out for her. I thought there was but we just quarrelled and now she's isolating herself from everyone, even the help we were contacting. I think it's just her destiny to live life on hard mode. But it's not my destiny.",19Oct2020,1
