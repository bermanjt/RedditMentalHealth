0,"I'm mid 30s M,  had depression since about 15, undiagnosed till about 2 years ago. 
I work but am basically house bound outside those hours. I'm high functioning ASD, I don't have any close friends,  I have literally ZERO social life and get social anxiety to the point of dry wrenching if I do go out near large groups of people. 
I sit at home and do nothing but smoke weed just to make it to the next day. I struggle with any housework and my personal hygiene when I'm really low. 

I've been in councling all this year and medicated but I find it has little effect. 
I want to get better and everyone tells me the key to happiness is loving yourself, but what do you do if you utterly hate and despise yourself as a person? how can you overcome that?  Because I'm stuck.  I'm not suicidal but I certainly don't care enough about my life that I would care if I dropped dead tomorrow and that makes me feel even worse about myself.

Any advise appreciated ,  thanks.",11Dec2019,1
2,"After a while of job searching I had a breakdown, and am now in the bathroom trying to figure out the best way to end it. This happens a few times a month. I'm looking for a way to get this under control, because I fear it will only get worse as I have absolutely nothing to live for. I have no passion or will to live at all, adulthood is hell and from what I've heard it's only going to get worse. 

So I'm trying to figure out what to do because it's just been a continuous cycle of me trying to improve my life, failing, being suicidal and picking myself back up and doing it all over again. I'm tired of life and want off immediately, and I know I'm going to do it if I don't find something. I don't see my counselor for another month and I can't wait that long. My family is emotionally unavailable. The hotline hung up on me. I've tried walking and stuff but it ultimately just feels like a bandaid- life and adulthood will still be shitty afterwards. I cannot keep going like this.",11Dec2019,1
3,"I live at home, my parents are not really supporting me and I keep to myself. Sometimes, when I have meltdowns, I wish I could just scream out on top of my lungs and cry as loud as I can.. But I can't do that in my room. I need to find a way to vent.. What do you guys do in such situations..?",11Dec2019,1
4,"Her and I have been together a year and change. We were long distance until June when I graduated college. I moved to PA and we got our first apartment together. I left all my family and friends in NY to come live here with her in PA. She recently started a job for mentally ill children about 3 months ago. She works with kids who are depressed, suicidal, or delinquent. 

Ever since she started that job she's been getting really depressed. She comes home complaining she cant sleep. Says she cant ""turn her brain off."" She's also become very distant. We stopped being intimate, if i approach her for a kiss or hug she often pushes me away. She wakes up and says things like ""I dont want to talk all day, I just wanna be quiet."" Recently the big one is ""I dont feel any emotions right now, literally none."" She really is my only friend or family out here. Everyone else is back in NY. Her pushing me away and isolating me is really hurting me as I feel very alone. Usually I cry it out on my way home from work. 

I clean the house constantly, because I know mess makes her anxious or frustrated! I bring flowers or leave love notes and show tokens of my love! I cook dinner! I do the laundry! I do everything I can to help take some stress off. It seems I do it with little success. I barely get a thank you. Her job offers free therapy as they know how mentally strenuous it can be. She yells back at me ""I DONT NEED HELP"" anytime I bring it up. I love her, we have many highlights and good times in our relationship. For the first time ever, we hit a HUGE LOW. I dont wanna abandon her, but idk what else to do! It hurts getting cold treatment from the one I love. I ask her if she still loves me and she says yes but we just aren't intimate because her stress and depression stop her from being turned on. ANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!",11Dec2019,1
5,People everyday deal with depression and anxiety that effect them in so many different ways it’s hard to explain. But for me the past week and a half my depression has been be up. I’ve gotten good feed back from my lawyer say it possibly that opposing counsel might being willing to deal and make a settlement on my case if I got Medicare to say I’m lo longer eligible. I’ve called the past 2 days and finally someone has called me back say they are willing to write a letter that I need. It’s amazing how fast life can change for the better. Even if this deal does not go through I have figured out who is truly on my side. Even the people I’ve pushed away for ears I’ve reconnected with. Things are going in the right direction for me for once! I swear it my best friend that died that is looking out for my best interest! I can’t explain it but any time anything that has gone wrong I look to him for prayer and something positive comes. Even if I don’t believe in god I believe in a spiritual side of life that I can explain. It’s like you may be broke and have $10 to your name but yet you give a homeless person $5 of your money knowing that it will come back to you 10 fourth. I’m a fighter by heart. I have Aztec tribal with a full back tattoo and full sleeves on my my arms and side of my body because I believe in never giving up no matter how bad things get. Life is about fighting for what you believe in. True life is love. Loving your self and loving your kids and fighting to make a better life for them no matter what the cost are. That’s how I deal with my depression and anxiety every day! I’ll never give up fighting tell my body gives up on my! Much love to people that have depression and I tell you this keep on fighting for your dreams because no matter who tell you! You can or you won’t be something in life they are wrong because they don’t know what you have been through and have achieved in life right now.. keep on fight tell the day you die. It’s not the past that matters it’s the future and the legacy we leave behind now that matters. It’s never to late to change! Go after it. Fuck everyone else that has doubted you! Your better than them!,11Dec2019,1
6,"I'm tired of smelling bad. I'm tired of being overweight. I'm tired of living in a dirty, empty apartment because I spend every cent I get on alcohol. I'm tired of being a burden on my parents. I'm tired of failing my classes even though I know I'm smart. I'm tired of losing friends because I ignore people when they want to hang out. I ignore them because I havent taken a shower since Nov 1. I haven't showered because I used all of my towels cleaning up throw up, from when I drunk too much.

10,"The idea and act of typing this is making my heart race and body shake.  I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post,  but I'm just begging for anyone to listen.

Since my teens I've had really bad issues with my mental health.  It started with panic attacks. My mom took me to a doctor in which I got my first ""you're doing it for attention"". We walked out of the office with my mother saying she had never been more embarrassed in her life.  I felt so ashamed. 
I learned to hide my moments of panic, which unfortunately evolved into moments of rage. 
I couldn't stop myself. I yelled at my family,  my friends,  my pets over the stupidest little inconveniences.  It stayed that way for years. 
I never asked mom to take me to the doctor again.
I lost all my friends and ruined every relationship I'd been in. Poison in the well they say.
In 2010 I got pregnant,  and my mental health took a huge backseat.  My ex and myself became unemployed and homeless during my pregnancy,  but I persevered.  
I walked miles looking for a job (lost my car too) and actually got hired at 9 months pregnant. 
Due to the need for funds for my family,  I started working 2 weeks after delivering my first son.  I worked 40hrs or more a week and missed every single milestone. 
My ex refused to get a job until I left him before our son turned 1yo. I had to walk away from my son until I could get an apartment.  Depression started and the panic attacks came back worse than ever. 
I scheduled an appointment with my doctor,  but was basically told "" you're fine,  this is attention seeking behavior"". Shamed again,  I left. 

Over the years I tried many times to get help but was met with many obstacles ( i.e. no new clients,  referral only,  insurance only) or doctors who pushed pharmaceuticals or had no interest in actually helping me. I've taught myself different ways to cover up my declining mental health.
But I can't always keep control.  When a panic attack hit,  it hit me hard. 

[NSFW - self harm]
By my mid twenties,  I still hadn't found anyone to help me.  I met a new man,  we had a son together,  and I knew I couldn't risk hurting my boys in a panic attack. 
And that's how I learned my new trick... cutting. 
I started turning that panicked rage against myself so I could keep smiling and telling my family the world is ok. 
You may think it's wrong,  but the fact is no one really cares so long as you smile.

Back in April 2019, i got very sick.  Couldn't eat, vomiting,  diarrhea.  In the span of a week I lost 20lbs (my top weight had only ever been 110lbs).
I bit the bullet and went to the hospital. 
I still don't know what was physically wrong with me.  I was hit with the Baker Act thanks to my shredded wrist.  That was the absolute worst experience of my life.  No medical help, shamed for being uninsured,  and no contact with my family. 
I was released and immediately started slashing my wrist to feel good again. I ended up quitting my job because they made me feel so useless in my life. 

It's now almost 6mo later. I'm back to work,  back to my family,  back to life,  trying to do it alone. My husband is a huge empath, so my mental health weighs heavily on him and makes everything more difficult.  I'm still trying to get help and being met with the same obstacles. I was actually able to go 2mo without cutting and was quite proud of myself,  until Saturday. But being rejected in so many different ways is harder and harder to cope with. 

Tonight I tried doing the suicide prevention hotline and was met with the same advice any other doctor had given me.  "" just have a spa day where you pamper yourself and get the attention you need"".

I don't need attention.  I need someone to help me.  Not just throw out some pretty words and hope it sticks. Because I truly believe,  in all my experience,  I am useless and better off not existing. 

I haven't put a razor to my wrist since Saturday.  But the temptation is so strong when your mind is against you.  I just want someone to see I'm trying.  I just wanted to share my story before I'm just another statistic. 

Sorry if this reads all wonky. Also sorry it's so long.",11Dec2019,1
11,"I live in Brazil, if you don't know, it's too hard to get a decent job here. The most of the opportunities is shit. The good jobs are very disputed, and I don't have the basis education to enter the competition, even I am being graduated. The more wealthy people always takes the jobs. I just want to have a good job to afford my family. Why is it so hard? I don't know what to do. I never wanted to be rich, I just want to be independent.

When I start to think about that, I get really sad and it's make me don't believe in the future. I don't wanna get sick, because I'm feeling I will. So what's your advice?",11Dec2019,1
12,"TL;DR I’m extremely numb and I need to get my shit together ASAP and finish studying for an exam. I’ve tried many things and my finances are limited. Please, help me.

I’ll try anything I haven’t tried already. It’s finals week. I’ve gotten some things done, poorly, but done. I have two presentations, a huge paper, and two final projects left still. I have an exam at 9:50am tomorrow. I need to make a two sided chest sheet and if I can just make it with my formulas and statistics testing steps and things I can show up for the exam and at least try to write some down.

The trouble: I have passed the point of feeling stressed or anxious. I feel absolutely nothing and I go to the library and sit at my laptop with my notebooks and things and 4 hours, 6 hours, etc pass and I have not managed to write anything down. I’m going days without showering again and last night I slept in my jeans again because I tried so damn hard but I couldn’t get myself changed. I’m doing well in my classes. I have all A’s and B’s. But if I go to my exams or don’t go, I know I will feel absolutely no different either way. I would have to retake these classes after working so hard this semester, putting me an additional 2 semesters behind for graduation. It doesn’t matter to me at all and I have never once in my life been like this. I always have panic attacks and breakdowns because I care so much about doing well. I currently don’t care about doing anything at all. I honestly wish I could cry. I just haven’t been able to.

What I’ve been doing: I’ve been on 100mg trazodone since March. It was enough to help for the first half of summer break without school. It feels like it’s not doing anything now. I try to stretch. I drink plenty of water. I tried different music. I tried less caffeine. More caffeine. Snuggling my cats. Doing something completely different. Spending time with my best friend. Talking to close friends and my boyfriend. Working on the cheat sheet with my friend who is in the same class. Getting a little exercise (biking). I’ve eaten enough today. I had a little hot chocolate as a treat. I’ve tried getting high (I feel happy but there’s no way I could do my studying like that). I’ve tried thinking about “fun” plans I have with friends over break. It doesn’t sound enjoyable at all and I have no desire to do any of it.

Please. Please I need suggestions. Anything. I know this is my brain and my brain is not doing well. I know this will pass. I am not going to hurt myself. I just don’t know how to get into a state that will allow me to finish studying. Please. I don’t know what to do. 

Also I’m having difficult financial issues and I can’t afford to spend money. I just don’t have any. And by any I mean I may have $100 in my checking account but I owe $1700 to people I’ve had to borrow from and my credit card has $800 on it. I’m having these issues because I worked very hard at a restaurant job and saved $10k and then quit at the end of January because it was destroying my mental health and have been living off savings and i was the only one with an income in my family (me, my bf, our two kitties). My boyfriend just started working and he’s been taking extra shifts and things but we do not have a cent of spending money and we won’t for awhile.",11Dec2019,1
13,"I've been depressed for a long time now. I have sought help and nothing is really working. I just really hate my life right now and find it really hard to see the future. My support system is essentially nonexistent and has decreased over the last 6 months with changes in my life. Does anyone else go to bed hoping they don't wake up in the morning? Or hope something else takes them before themselves to preserve their dignity? Does anyone else wish they could give up their life for anyone else? I saw this family in insta with a young daughter that had a terrible accident in August. She suffered a major TBI and will probably be in a vegetative state the rest of her life. I SO wish I could just give her my life. I don't want it anymore. I feel too guilty about my family if I did take my life so I'll never have the guts to do it. But I just wish I wouldn't be here anymore and someone more deserving could have my life. It's so hard having these thoughts and family belittle them when I reach out for help. I even started self-harming again and family has done nothing to help me after finding out. I'm considering admitting myself to a hospital when I get home from a family vacation I'm on, but I don't want family or anyone to know. And I'm worried about insurance covering it (I'm a college student that gets insurance through my parents). I also lost my job and don't have a way to pay bills right now. I wish everything weren't so complicated. I'll keep praying to not wake up in the morning I guess.",11Dec2019,1
14,even when things seem like they’re getting better i always fall into deep depression at least everyday for 17 years idk why people say things get better when they don’t things always end up getting worse they say time heal things but i still seem to can’t get over things that i thought haven’t even effected me i’m scared for my future the only way i can see myself living is if i’m fucked up everyday again but i know that will just put me into my grave faster than anything it’s so fucking hard having family and a boyfriend i just want to push everyone away so i can kill myself in peace but i don’t want to hurt the ones around me for my selfish behavior.,11Dec2019,1
16,I’m a compulsive liar. I keep lying to my boyfriend about really huge things and really insignificant things. I want to stop because I want our relationship to work but I feel like I can’t help myself. I’ve dug myself into such a deep hole that I don’t know how to get out. I go see my counselor but I’ve never mentioned this to her because who can trust a liar? What can I do to fix this and stop lying ?,11Dec2019,1
17,"I've been dealing with bouts of depression and other issues for most of my life but I was still able to work and function normally until some time last year. My best guess at what happened is that all the feelings I'd been putting on the back of my mind finally boiled over and just caused me to shut down. I hate to use the term ""blackpill"" but that's pretty much what happened.

I  walked out of my job and quit with no notice(it was a retail store and we got the message that it was going to be closed). I was set to transfer to a university for my bachelor's but I dropped out after the first week and that was only because I procrastinated on dropping my classes before the semester started. I stopped showering or keeping up with any basic hygiene. Aside from doing some chores so I didn't feel like a complete mooch off of my parents I would spent most of the day lying in bed looking at YouTube videos. I would break out sobbing at random times. The only thing that kept me from seriously considering suicide was not wanting to hurt my parents. My only long term plan for the future became to kill myself after they died.

Anyway, I feel like I'm getting better now. I don't have any more sobbing fits. I have energy to get out of bed. I'm cleaning my room and maintaining basic hygiene. I have things I want to do. I realize now that I should probably get some professional help to deal with all my issues so that I don't shut down again. To do this I need money and to get money I need a job and that's where it gets tricky.

Does anyone have experience getting back into the workforce after such a long employment gap? Any tips or suggestions? I worked in retail and fast food previously and even though I really hated the customer service aspect of those jobs because of my social awkwardness I'm probably gonna have to go back to that since it's my only work experience. Any help is appreciated.",11Dec2019,1
18,"So I have a friend (M) who has had a girlfriend for 6 months. The thing is though that he also had another girlfriend before that, and supposedly, he’s in love with both of them. And he has twelve or so other side chicks right now. Since I found I told him to either tell his girlfriend everything (if he can even pick a girlfriend) and go from there, or not tell her, but stop fucking other women. So last night he asked me to break it to one of his “girlfriend” that he was already in a long term relation ship and lie about “his other, more serious”, girlfriend’s name. He was going to act like a dick to her afterwards and ask her out to see if she still wanted him. So I obliged. I think I might of hurt her pretty bad. The worst part is that when I did it, I didn’t give a fuck about how it affected her, and I was actually just as happy as I was before that situation. I’m only even feeling the slightest remorse now, the morning after. Even now, the only thing I’m concerned about is me and how I’m a bad person, instead of her, the girl who’s heart I think I crushed. It’s like whenever I’m happy, I’m a dick to everyone around me, like I become this narcissistic, toxic parasite that everyone would be better of without.",11Dec2019,1
19,"Finals end in a week and I have almost nothing done. I have multiple partially-written papers and barely-started projects to get done and I just don't see how I can do it. I open my laptop to what I have to work on and I know what I want to write but I just can't get myself to do anything at all. My sleep schedule has been fucked for weeks- I stay up until 5am doing nothing, finally get to sleep, try and wake up in time for my 9am classes and either sleep straight through them like an idiot or get up, go to class, go home, sleep and get no work done. I love my classes so much, when I manage to get myself to them they're the only parts of my days that make me feel alive or motivated or worth anything. I worked so hard to get into my university and my family and I are going into so much debt for me to be here and I'm just throwing it away because I can't manage to focus or sleep like a normal person. I haven't gotten out of bed for two days. I sleep, wake up for an hour or two, and fall right back asleep. Time literally doesn't feel real right now but it is and the deadlines for classes are getting closer and closer and I don't know what to do. I feel completely numb and unattatched to what's around me. My mom called me earlier to say hi and I made the conversation as short as possible because I didn't have any energy to talk and felt so guilty, the second we hung up I just rolled over in bed and started crying. When I wake up there are literally tears all over my face and pillow and I just don't know what to do. I'm on meds that have worked fine for almost a year, I used to be in therapy but my therapist, who was incredible, moved out of state and I haven't found someone new since. I'm so scared about the semester ending, I have an autoimmune disease and got really sick a few times this semester and I'm worried that those absences alone will make me fail my classes (my uni allows you to have a few absences excused with dr notes but my autoimmune disease makes it so I get really wiped out from simple stuff, I got a cold and was bed-ridden for nearly a week, and I don't have the money to go to the doctors every time I get a cold or stomach bug) and I'll lose all my scholarships and have to drop out and move back to the small town I'm from and I'll never accomplish anything. Some of my good friends who I haven't hung out with in a little bit invited me to a free concert later this week and as much as I want to see them, I feel like I don't deserve to go. I know that you don't have to ""earn"" or ""deserve"" happiness or enjoyment, but if I can't even get up for class or get some papers done then I really feel like I don't have the right to go dance and have a good night, seeing as I haven't accomplished anything worth celebrating (I know, I know, gross capitalistic mindset, but I can't shake it). My job started giving me less hours because we're in our slow season and I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills, buy groceries, or get gifts for my family, but today I blew $15 on delivery because I hadn't eaten in almost 48 hours and couldn't get myself to get out of bed and walk a few blocks to the grocery store to get groceries for the week. I just feel like a failure, everything I do, no matter how little, takes so much out of me, I'm literally getting tired typing this. I just don't know what to do.",11Dec2019,1

I don’t eat hardly anything yet I’m still fat and not in the nice places, like I practically have the ugliest female body you can imagine. No the fat didn’t go to my boobs.

But after about a year and a half, I started getting jealous and suspicious. I was worried more and more whether she was cheating on me, or that she was going to leave me cause I wasn't good enough for something, I was very insecure and it affected our relationship. Well I started trying to control what she did, I didnt want her to talk to her friends, really I was just a controlling asshole with PTSD. But she tried to help me all the way through it. But in the end about a year ago she left me for the guy I was worried about, I've been told she was cheating on me a lot but multiple people. But I still love her. Dont really know what to do.

25,"I'm a 22 year old guy

Currently in college studying economics, in my 5th year. I struggle with depression, GAD and minor OCD. 

I have major issues with motivation. Most of the time, especially when I'm stressed out the most, I lack any motivation whatsoever. There are a couple fields that interest me, but the college experience has been very stressful for me altogether.

However, I'm not motivated to do anything. Starting a new degree doesn't motivate me because I'm not passionate about anything in particular, except for statistics, and my degree is the best to undertake a specialization in that which I want to do.

Very often, if not almost everyday, it's hard to get up from bed. It's hard to eat. It's hard not to cry. I have the full support from my parents, I have friends, I don't struggle financially yet I'm profoundly unhappy. I hate myself as well. I have suicidal ideation very often.

I'm scripted benzos but I want to drop them for antidepressants. Benzos make my anxiety better and make me motivated and cheerful; but they're not something designed for long term use.

So I want to ask my doctor for an antidepressant script, since he is a very kind and understanding guy and I'm sure he'd script me what he thinks is best; however I'm profoundly scared of side effects. I have more exams in one month and I'm scared to be hit by side effects during them and that they might make it even worse.

If you have a playstation so that we can talk then that would Be great, Because, Reddit is slow for me, Plus it would be easier for us to relate to each other and get along.

&amp;#x200B;

I love all of you guys and hope everyone can find happiness.",11Dec2019,1
28,"To each person who said that I'm over dramatic/
Y'all know nothing of my panic, your brain in static/
You don't have an illness, telling you you're empty/
Or you don't know 'about cutting wrists, blades tempt me/
Each day I wake up, feeling that I shouldn't have/
Going to sleep at night, but staying awake the whole or half/
No sense or sensitivity you have, just you laugh/
When I forget my name, 'cause of my amnesia/
I dissociated fool, it's not a joke like rich in Asia/
Each time I think about the people I pushed, I go crazier/
Each rhyme I sink doubts under my eye bags, go lazier/
Than you think, no sleep, no joke, it's an illness/
But you don't get it, blinded by the damn fulfillness/
Of your hand, 'cause you ain't had to ever struggle/
I ain't no Harry Potter fan, but you a damn muggle/
Smuggle my happiness just to look edgy you gargle/
On my pain, and spit on me, but I spit on you back/
With my pen, my trusted friend, I will change this track/
Bring a change, make life easy for people of my kind/
I love y'all, who have a special illness, no one left behind/ .",11Dec2019,1
29,"So my parents are well off, I’d say, like they don’t stand on top of the world, but they provide my family (even extended) with everything we could ever hoped for.

As the eldest child in a relatively successful Asian family , you can say that I have my pressure, but also heaps of opportunities.

I’m a bit overweight at the moment but nothing life threatening, I still consider myself to be healthy. My brain is supposedly not that bad either, I got 125 IQ (not the best, but not the worst).

I also got the study abroad, surrounded by talented people who are passionate about life while also don’t have to work to support myself . I should be enjoying life.

But unless trying to get myself drunk and losing sleep over a girl who in all probabilities would never think the same of me is enjoying life, I’m not enjoying life.

While I’m sober, which is still most of time thankfully, I want to kill myself. I just feel like excess weight, and extra someone that people have to make sure that he’s alright, and most of the time, they stopped bothering with me.

I even had a knife in my hand once, thinking about it, but me being a complete pussy, I couldn’t find the guts to.

I fail at every single thing that I do, even though I know I have the potential to be good, I just can’t. It feels like Chicken Little sometimes, only that chance never came.

I don’t think I have any friends. No one likes me, not even platonically, not even my parents like my personality (dang that hurts).

Every night, I try to tire myself to sleep, because I can’t cry, not when in the morning people would know, and then I would have nightmares, where I get to see what it’s like for others in a world without me. They are happier, and the truth is, I can’t blame them, I’m just the biggest liability anyone could imagine. In the morning, I put on a smile and show it to everyone, even my parents, trying to convince that they shouldn’t worry about me and should just do what they think is important.

I even find myself talking to myself, a monologue between me and myself, where a part of me wanted to pick up the knife nearby and call it a life, and the other part can’t do it.

I’ve been like this for a while now, I’m starting to forget what it’s like to be happy, like, filled with joy. I tried hanging out, be around people, but the. I found out that I’m a nuisance at best, and even when I’m not, I’m replaceable. Most people around me can’t be bothered to stay around me for more than 3 years, and that’s because we went to the same class, we saw each other everyday.

I feel like losing my mind. It’s like that saying: “All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man to lunacy.”

Maybe I found mine, and now, I want to watch the world burn. I want to see him everyone to believe in the same things I do, to feel the desperation I feel, and then, the world will be on fire.",11Dec2019,1
31,"My best friend for the last year and half has been struggling with depression and I think possibly Borderline Personality Disorder and I'm really desperate for help.  She split from her husband because of some attempted infidelity and it really broke her. On top of this, most of her family has stopped talking to her because she didn't want to move in with them across the country  and they were never on good terms to begin with. These two things have  absolutely demolished her sense of self.  She doubts everything - that people love her, that she is a good person, etc.

And  she pretty much only has me to talk to. I was the one she confided in and this was before she even knew me. I quickly came to care about her.  She truly is a wonderful person with a giant heart who I love. I've spent more time with her over the last year and a half than I've spent  with anyone in my life. The problem is she wants a more romantic kind of  love from me. I don't know if this is because she really really loves me in that way or if she needs to prove to herself that she can still be  loved like that or some combination of both. We did have a sexual relationship at the beginning of our friendship as a sort of FWB deal but I began to understand that it was confusing her because she loved me  in a way that I didn't love her back. I put a stop to it, but occasionally since then we have had sex on sometimes  less-than-consensual terms because if I don't do it, I know she will  have a breakdown. Our entire relationship for the last year or more has  been fighting and making up - her saying that I don't love her, that I don't care about her, that I hate her, that I'm just like ""them"" and me  saying that I do love her and care about her while trying to be clear that it can't be in a romantic way and this kills her inside.

Fast  forward to now and she has been talking about suicide all the time, constantly having breakdowns, saying she's going to shut down and not  talk to anyone ever again, etc. I have to stay the night sometimes  because she drinks and tries to lock herself in the bathroom. Last night, I had to threaten to call the cops because she grabbed a knife. I  know there is certainly a bit of manipulative, dramatic character to  this kind of action but I know she does have a real desire to end her  life sometimes. And I can't chance anything.

In another situation, where she has a family or other friends who she can  actually talk to, I know I have to leave. I am a problem for her - I  know this. But she has nobody else. She is completely disconnected from her family and has only a few friends from work that she talks to during work but never or hardly ever sees outside of work. I am all she has, and she tells me this. I know this relationship is four thousand kinds  of fucked up and unhealthy and much of this is my fault for letting it get this far and it can't go on like this but I have no idea what to do. I have never told anybody this and I really really need help.",11Dec2019,1
32,"Autistic teenager, school environment is giving me problems, problems in turn get in the way of school and opportunities, ppl around me dont understand because they're all good at stuff, life is getting tough, our planet is dying, im here at 3am crying and unable to fall asleep because things suck, need a hug",11Dec2019,1
33,"I'm 28 years old. Male. I don't know if I have depression or something. I think that I should go to a profesional, but I'm unemployed and don't have money. I've been unemployed for almost half a year. I just wanted to unburden what's been making me feel bad, feel...Paralyzed...

My life is not bad, I got a degree in economics. I have a beautiful girlfriend and used to be in a job that I loved. Got fired from it because the company didn't do well financially and cut staff. Then worked as a Credit Manager but this wasn't my area and got fired 5 months after joining the company. This hit hard my ego and my  self-confidence. Lately the unemployment thing started crawling trough my mind, more and more and been feeling paralyzed. I've thought of some ideas to get me out of the unemployment like putting a business, doing articles of financial and economic analysis (Which I'm good I think) to find an online writing job or something like that, study some online certifications...However, I've been feeling paralyzed. I'm getting desperate each day. Can't take this. I've found myself crying for not doing nothing, and this also makes me feel more paralyzed and do nothing.

I hate it. I feel useless. I know I'm not, I know I'm good at financial analysis. But can't take this felling out of me. I know I should look for help, but don't know why I can't. I feel paralyzed.

 I've always been too prideful. I hate to call for help. Even when I tried to post this told me to put a flair in this post and saw the ""Request support"". I think that should be the correct flair, but I never ask for help in this kind of stuff. I've always thought that I have a strong mental stability and been proud of myself about it.

Thanks for Reading. Sorry if this is too...vague...Don't know exactly what I'm doing...",11Dec2019,1
34,"I’ve been feeling very strange (mentally) for the past couple weeks. It’s gotten to the the point that I had a mental breakdown yesterday. I deleted social media for a couple days as trial and error but that only seemed to make it worse. I’ve never really had much of a social life or friends to begin with, but I blame that on moving more times then I can count back when I was in school. Thinking about this makes me feel like I’m not wanted anywhere or around anyone.  I feel like I starting to stray away from my family as well. Like I said, I can’t tell if this is depression but something is definitely wrong.",11Dec2019,1
35,"I don't know if I am doing the right thing or not, but need help.

I am 23.

Never had so called best friends or friends even for that matter. I was bullied throughout my early school life till 10th grade. Got beaten up in groups multiple times. 

I was also never good in studies or sports, just managed to promote my classes hardly. Always stayed at home watching TV because I was afraid I will get beat up at local park because kids of bad neighborhood were always there. 

Never had a girlfriend but always hope to have relationship to any girl but always turned out to a weird person.

No relative or their children respect me, make fun of me regardless of age. Was always told to adjust and think about others. For me every family function or celebration is a nightmare as I always knew I am going to be made fun yet again.

I am always the center of jokes and seems like my face is the issue.

This week I checked my school reports, and it was mentioned even in my kindergarten I was not confident, stay away from group and was lazy.

These problems still exists today. I have no hope for me and my career. Left my job thinking I will learn German but I am stuck in A1 for 6 months .

Sometimes when I alone think that would it that be better to end it all after all who will miss me. But I remember my parents and shrugs that thought.

My day include:
1. Wake up
2. Equip headphones ( to make me numb for sadness)
3. Eat like pig
4. Watch YouTube
5. Fap when alone
6. Think that I am worthless and sleep

I WANT TO CHANGE.
ANYONE/ SOMEBODY HELP ME PLEASE!!!",11Dec2019,1
36,"Every semester I feel like this, but this semester might be the worst so far. I’m one semester away from graduating, but this semester really hurts. I was doing great all semester, but I am never good at finals and I already know my grades will be going down. My final this morning sucked even after preparing for 6 days in a row. I’m pre med so this is the second to last semester I have to bring up my sucky GPA as I am applying in the spring and i already know it’s not going up. I have to study hardcore for the MCAT all winter break since i put it off to study for finals, so I won’t be getting any time off until I graduate. I am so sick of feeling so worthless and stupid and depressed and I just want to fucking kill myself. my parents and i don’t have the best relationship either and i haven’t been talking to my dad for a while cause of a huge fight we got into.
