3,"I was diagnosed with depression a couple months ago and was meant to go back to my doctor a few weeks after the first appointment, and my mother seems to be trying her hardest to push off my requests to take me back in for my follow up appointment. Whenever I say anything about it she’ll talk about it for a minute, and then does nothing further about it. Since I’m under 18 she still has to make my doctor’s appointments, and seems to have no intention of doing so. Even if I could make my own appointments, she is my means of transportation at the moment so it would have to work around her schedule, which means she would probably find something to fill the time when I need her to take me to any appointment.

4,"I've suffered from mental illness a significant portion of my life. I was about 7 when I first started having bad anxiety and I had my 1st major depression when I was 12 (my mental illnesses was not due to trauma, but most likely due to biological factors). And because I hid it in order to keep my family from worrying, I did not seek treatment until I was 19. It's been 5 years since then and even though it took a ton of heartache and struggle, I'm a lot better.
Looking back on my life, I feel sad because in a lot of ways I didn't get to have the normal childhood, teen years, and young adulthood I could have had without depression. Even though I'm doing better now and hope I've got a lot of good years ahead of me, I'm sad that I'll never have those years back. Often times when I see kids or teens or college kids who appear happy and enjoying life I feel a deep sense of melancholy because I didn't get to have those formative experiences and I never will. And I feel sad to because I might have been able to have a better childhood/teen years if I had not hid my mental illness for so long and got better treatment early on.

9,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a depressive mood lately. I've been struggling to make my life better, and was feeling motivated for a few weeks, but then I began to slip away. The lonliness has been getting to me. Last time, I was listening to motivational videos, and when I heard ""I love you, you matter."", I felt like bursting into tears (but I didn't, because I don't like to cry; it makes me feel vulnerable). I am a Korean (M) in my last year of school, have T1 Diabetes since 2007, have been clinically diagnosed with bipolar depression 2-3 years ago. I used to take Semisodic Valproate and Amitriptyline, but have quit a year ago, because it made me feel uneasy and anxious, always distracted and borderline paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very low self-esteem, have been a victim of abuse between the ages of 3 to 5, causing my achluophobia and mild claustrophobia due to a certain event(s).I suffer from Nocturnal Terror, sleeping around 25 hours a week. I have an under average appearance and physique, 170cm and 57kg, only because I've started working out a year ago (used to be underweight). I have some personality and behavioral issues, and am **EXTREMELY** introverted and asocial. Physical human interaction exhaust me emotionally and physically. I tend to push people away because I can't deal with rejection. I fear it, because rejection is a form of failure, and I do not want to end up a failure. I have anger management issues, getting me 2 indefinite suspensions from 2 schools and another school expelled me for my behaviour. What I consider my **only** redeeming quality is my IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS) and my curiosity for knowledge. I am in no way wise, but I always like to keep an open mind, even to the controversial or unethical, and I try to learn at least 10 new facts/news/definitions/concepts everyday, to improve my knowledge. Cooking, reading, drawing, video games and listening to songs are my hobbies, even though I can't sing, cook, or draw for shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, you see, I'm kind of like a sore thumb. I've always sticken out (in not a good way), so I've been pretty much isolated. I had 3 best (and only) friends since 2009, all of them overseas, and we've been getting distanced with each other quite recently. I was considered (and still am) weird. But, I want to change that. I want a normal life. I finally motivated myself a few weeks ago, but the depression is getting to me again. It got worse ever since I realised this girl I like(d) who I had befriended a year or two ago, actually feels uncomfortable and even annoyed by my presence. Her responses, both in chat and in person have been getting shorter, and more... direct. And so, I have cut off communications with her for quite a while now (around 2 weeks, we used to chat every 2-3 days) 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not the main reason as to why I'm depressed right now, but it has definitely made me feel worse. I feel like everyone is leaving me, and I can only blame it on my imperfections and deficits. I am now trying to fix these problems, one by one, but I'm losing motivation and hope. I am starting to wonder if anything is worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help guys. I need advice, support, anything. I'm desperate. Please.",17Jan2019,1

I know the song is about a relationship, but I just keep thinking of everyone in my life who has grown tired of me over the years. My family never really treated my mental health issues like they were legitimate, but now that I'm an adult struggling and embarrassing them it's even worse. My partner has become more and more depressed and I suspect it's because they spend so much time with someone so severely depressed. I never thought I'd live to see a day after 18. I was so sure I wouldn't make it that far. Eight years have since passed, I'm 26 now, and I just feel like something past expiration. I've been rotting and decaying inside for so long and I feel like there isn't anything left of me. I have therapy tomorrow. I would give anything to be able to go to a real inpatient program but the resources down here are more dangerous than helpful. I have seen people develop PTSD from ""treatment"" at nearby mental health facilities and have seen the bruises that resulted from their stays. I'm so exhausted and so tired of having to keep going. I'm not unsafe right now, but I don't want to be alive at all and haven't in a long time. I don't know if I ever really did. ",17Jan2019,1
11,"I was having troubles sleeping tonight, so I decided I'd just get on the PC and play CS:GO until I felt tired enough to sleep. I went to deathmatch and hit ""go"", and then I got sent to a game. First thing I noticed when I got to the ""terrorist / anti-terrorist"" screen was that the entire game was filled with bots, except for one person. When I started playing, I heard a younger boy crying on the mic. I decided to grab my mic and ask him if he was okay. He said he was on a game with a bunch of ""big kids"", and they made fun of him for his voice, and they booted him out. I started talking to him and told him about my personal story about being bullied and stuff like that. After a while, I asked him if he wanted to join a game with me that had actual players. He said yes, and as we both picked the same team, I said over the mic, ""Let's get 'em, dude!"", and he excitedly said, ""Yeah, let's get 'em!"" And... Our team lost. But he didn't care. He was just so happy that he had someone nice to game with that wouldn't make fun of him. We can all learn a lesson from this. At one point in our lives, we all were in his shoes. What we need to do is make sure that we're all taken care of. 🖤",17Jan2019,1
12,"I suffer from depression and insomnia. 

Yesterday at work it went particularly bad. My bosses compared my actual self with my 2-years -ago self (the one who was productive, and surely not depressed). Before that conversation I even thought I was doing better than usual lately! 
This hurt me so bad. Again the thoughts of quitting my once beloved job, having to change my life and perspectives, facing new interviews, came up scary as hell. 

At midnight I was having a panic attack and I just wanted to cry desperately. How could I imagine to sleep in such conditions???

And yet I told myself: OK, you're feeling bad. Take this emotion out, and let if flow like a bubble, around you, but separately from you. OK, you have this thought about your bosses. Another bubble. OUTSIDE of you.

20,"Can’t think of a better title. I’m running on two hours of sleep at most, so here we go. 
I’m 21 &amp; female.
I have been stuck in a rut ever since I came back home from Christmas. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend in a small city some hours from Dallas. Dallas is where my family is and where I was for Christmas. I will spare you the details but let’s say I’m relieved the holidays are over and I’m back in my apartment. It’s sad to say but I just can’t stand being around most of my mom’s family anymore, mom included. My parents are divorced. I enjoy my dad’s family a lot more, but that’s besides the point.

Here’s my main problem I guess...
My mom pays for me to live. College, rent, car, food, my ESA dog’s needs even, you get the point. She holds it over my head. It’s her favorite thing to do. She is very narcissistic. I frequent the r/raisedbynarcissists sub. You get the point...

I suppose it’s fair since I’m unemployed. Actually, I’ve never had a “real” job. I’ve had a summer “job” at 17 &amp; I’ve volunteered plenty, but not a real long-term paying job. And I’m 21 now. That’s gotta be a red flag for employers. I’ve always felt too disabled to work, which is such bullshit. I have long term depression, horrendous GAD, and ADD. I don’t know how my wonderful boyfriend doesn’t consider leaving me on the daily. 
I’m not “too disabled” as I think you can do anything you put your mind to. It’s just one of my internal excuses. Although, I do have to be careful where I hypothetically work. Big retail or big restaurants are just a big no-no. I’m terrified of having a panic attack induced by too much social stimulation. So is my boyfriend; he’s recommended I try local businesses and quieter places as such.

My problem isn’t me getting a job, I know I could probably get one within a few months of trying. 

My problem, I suppose, is I’m considering dropping out of school again. I’ve dropped out once, only one semester ago. This past semester (and my first one back) went very badly and I didn’t pass anything. 
Here in Texas we have a state-wide program called TSI.... I really don’t wanna get into it. I don’t know if similar stuff exists elsewhere. For me personally, it’s been living fucking hell.
It means basically I personally have state mandated classes I must take it order to continue along on my college career. For me, it’s math classes, because I didn’t do well on my math section on the SAT a million fucking years ago. I’ll skip ahead a bit and summarize...

I am still considered a college freshmen credit wise. I should be almost a senior now. I believe this is my 5th or 6th time taking this TSI math course. It’s awful. It’s literally awful. It’s not something they allow you to put off, you have to take it every semester until you pass. With the way I am, it’s not a good idea for me to cram my schedule with classes, so I’ve only been taking these TSI classes (along with a “PADR” course for students that are failing) non-stop trying to pass. I want to give up. I enjoy school. I love the art college at my school. I love the psychology school, and animal sciences, and I love learning about things I’m interested in but I can’t focus on the things I want to because of these courses. I’ve contemplated suicide over this shit, stupidly enough. 

I’m literally dropping out because of these academic handicaps. Beyond simple arithmetic math, I’m useless. Always have been! It just does not work with my brain. 

This post has become a mess of different topics at this point. I apologize to anyone still reading. 
So, my mom doesn’t know I failed my courses and am retaking the same things, even though she’s the one paying for said courses. I cannot continue to live with this guilt of wasting my mom’s money. That’s all I’ve ever done. I’ve been an academic failure since elementary school. I have 3 older siblings who are all extremely more successful than me. It’s almost impossible not to compare myself. I’m the runt of my family. I’m the dumb, humorless, loser of my family. My mom has continually watched me fail my entire fucking life. She has tried to best, whether money wise or trying to have school accommodate me, to get me to be successful. She has thrown all her money into trying to get me to succeed one way or another... even telling me before that she’s never spent more money on another child than with me... and I have nothing to show. I’m a huge failure. I’m so sorry mom. I’m trying my hardest just to smile these days and keep going. How do I keep moving? How can I drop out again? My only answer is to get a job so my mom doesn’t think I’m completely lazy, but honestly, I just want more time to rest and get some help... sorry this post is such a goddamn mess.

23,"I (29f) currently have an amazing partner. He is loving, caring, patient, playful, generous, accepting, understanding, affectionate, and loves and cares for me more than anyone else I have ever been with. I will admit, we have not been together long but when we are together, I am, for a majority of the time, happy.

We started dating in September and had to temporarily part ways in early November, being long distance for December, seeing each other for a visit in January, and being reunited sometime mid-February. I was head over heels for him during the time we were physically together and during the first month we were apart, I still felt that. One day in early December, I woke up and felt that my feelings had completely shut off.

I was at a point in my life where I wasn't feeling very happy and I assessed the different things happening in my life - I was taking birth control and thought that could affect my hormones, feelings, and depression. My doctor told me that that is not uncommon and I should stop taking it. I was working a job I hated where I felt used and underappreciated. I gave my two weeks notice. I hoped eliminating these things from my life would help me feel less stressed and less depressed but it somehow made me fall deeper into depression, the lowest I have ever felt.

I had lost passion and excitement for everything I once had it for, including my relationship. He stayed positive and I tried to do the same but it was difficult for me to be positive about anything.

I had bought plane tickets before the depression hit hard to visit him but as the trip got closer, I was consumed with negative thoughts and how I was going to break up with him and have a horrible time and how I was going to feel even worse. A glimpse of positivity came into my life a few days before as I texted with a crisis warmline and a friend who seemed to be positive about the situation.

I just got home from our time together. The good certainly outweighed the bad although I did have a few low, low points, all in which he comforted and supported me. We had a long talk and while I cried through the whole thing, I told him I didn't want to break up but also felt selfish for dating him when he has so much love to give and I can't reciprocate it right now. He said he wanted to be there for me and be my support system. He asked if I still wanted to be in a relationship and I said yes because I don't want to lose him and I care about him and I know he is a catch and I'm lucky he wants to be with me but I have been questioning myself as to if that was the right thing to do. I feel comfortable around him like I never have with anyone and I felt so strongly when we were first together (but of course, isn't that how it goes?)

I am home and I am now feeling depressed and sad again. I don't have much to look forward to at home (currently unemployed aside from driving with Door Dash here and there and volunteering at the food bank whenever they have available shifts). I live with my parents while home (I run an ice cream shop from April-October in another state but will be going back to the place the shop is in February to start therapy and have my own space) and this is the first time in the ""off season"" that I haven't taken a trip somewhere. I don't really have many friends to talk to.

I don't know if I've made the right decision to stay with him or not. I don't want to hurt him and I told him this and he said he is confident that I can get through this and I will be ok and he wants to be there for me. I am questioning my feelings now that I am alone again with my thoughts but I am having trouble figuring out if my feelings have faded or if it is the depression that is making my relationship seem as bleak as everything else in my life appears. Any input or advice would be helpful, please be gentle.

Tl;dnr: Can depression, which has made everything I once enjoyed now seem unexciting, affect feelings for a s/o or outlook on a relationship?",17Jan2019,1
25,"So, yeah.

Not sure how to start. I like someone who doesn't like me I don't think, but I don't know if I'm bothered because of the thing or because of the mania and depressive episodes. But I am bothered by the fact that my brain won't shut the fuck up. 

I feel I may have thrown away an amazing friendship by not keeping my mouth shut (it's a skill)

I despise my own company. Currently working through a bottle of gin as a way of dulling my head voice and passing the time.

And there's a niggling little voice in the back of head just telling me to kill myself. I won't listen to it I don't think. But it's there. And that scares me. 

I have managed to fuck my entire life up in such a superb way. There loads more, but every time I wrote about it, even with throwaway accounts, it comes back to. Bite me in the arse 

I just. I don't know 

TL;DR: may have ruined a great friendship because I like them more than that. Drinking more than I should. Voice in head telling me to end it. Won't listen I don't think

28,"Like some indie films and fine arts, it hurt my soul a bit and I came here to prep other depressed people who might play it. 

But what I came away with was that
1. The message I got from the game was; find value in more than just your ability to create or validation from others. Enjoy the craft and don’t live your own world, be a part of society or community where you share interests. 

Try not to make introspective games that embody hopelessness, unless you do it in a team, for a lot of money. Your mental health is more important than your value as a creator.

This game is at a fine artist level of introspection and showing the most vulnerable and raw human emotions in an uncomfortable way. Its the same with painters who make their whole career about testing how far they can push the feeling of isolation, autonomy, and emotional detachment to its limits. Never go Full Mind F***.  
The music, and sound and narration played a huge role in creating the ambiance of the game as the story progresses.

2. You only are as happy as you make up your mind to be, and what you interpret of a situation is what your reality will be. 

3. Don’t read too much into someone else’s depression. Use your imagination sparingly and for positive coping. They have good days that you cant see sometimes. Get a pet, go outside, do something else, exercise, see sunlight, do some groceries, balance out your routine. Take care of yourself mentally and spiritually. 

4. There are so many things to get value from other than beating your top creation.

5. In life there will be bad days and good days.. 
God Damn. This game. 
And .... that what is scary to one person may not actually be a problem to another person.
Some people are psychologically fine making horror games and some of us might be sensitive and take care of ourselves by avoiding prolonged exposure to psychologically unhealthy ideas.

It wasn’t fine, three weeks later she told me that she just lost her feelings for me,  I was heartbroken.

Now 1 month later I don’t feel any better , it’s not that I’m sad about her it’s just that I feel like I have been broken so many times that it’s permanent now.

I don’t feel happy,  I don’t feel anything, the only thing I feel is sadness and anger,  when I cry It feels so good to feel something. I’ve always had a bad temper so I get angry easily and my friends aren’t helping they don’t take these feelings they just say: “ Oh well sucks I guess” maybe I’m asking to much of them but just a “It’s going to be fine” would be great. 

I now have just lost all hope and would love to have someone support me and not just think that I’m a “depressed” teen who is faking it. 

When I realised that It wasn’t normal was when my dreams were always better than my actual life, I don’t have nightmares anymore because my life is a nightmare on it self.

33,"I'm not going to do anything, I'm really not. But I've basically lost all my friends/loved ones, I hate my job, and I have pretty much nothing left. I wake up, go to work, come back, have lunch, sleep, have dinner, maybe watch TV, sleep more. I spend my weekends sleeping and watching TV. That's it, that's my life. And I feel lonely and I feel like I (or my life) don't matter at all. I don't know what I have to live for anymore. I don't see anything good, a solution or a way out, I'm just waiting for it to kill me somehow. ",17Jan2019,1
