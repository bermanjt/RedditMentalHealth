0,"Halloa.
I'm not sure this is where I should post this, but I've run into a problem with a friend of mine who has fallen into a rather dark place.
It's not that he has tried to kill himself. On the contrary, he has pretty much given up on himself, to the point that he has barely eaten a thing in weeks, to the point that he had a fainting episode. Even this was not enough. After I managed to convince him to call the medical center, they told him to eat a specified set of things, and told him they'd call him on the following day, at which point he lied to them that he did eat what they ordered him to.
In a way, he is acting like a zombie, in which he is pretty much powering through whatever and ignoring what effect it may have on him until he cannot move anymore, and it is getting worse. He is also refusing to get any help, despite my requests for him to do so.
I have a few options, but all of them have a risk at this point:
-I can set an ultimatum to him that he either seek help or start caring more for himself or I will force said help on him. This, though, would result in him likely lying to me about said cares, and I would be unable to keep an accurate eye on him for the case of an emergency.
-I'm not sure what I can do in order to force an intervention on him. However, I have a feeling that, if I do this against his will, he will lie to them as well. In addition to that, it may very well result in him cutting any ties with me, in which I would no longer be able to observe and help. He doesn't seem to have anybody who would be able to take any action, so, if I do not keep an eye on him, there will be no possibility of any action if things turn for the worse.
At this point, the only thing I can do is remain vigilant and, in a way, hope that something cracks. Hope that he faints again, hope that things get serious without getting to the point of it being irreversible. Problem is, I feel this action is too risky at the same time, and that it may be too late if something happens. I'm also afraid that he may try to do something to himself. He has never mentioned any attempt to do so, but he has talked about it, so I do not know how far he may be on that road.
Do you have any advice on this? It feels like I'm at the end of my rope, but at the same time that I can and should do something, but every option I turn to feels like it will only burn all my bridges with him and take out any possibility to help him.",11Apr2019,1

2,"Hi there! I’ve been socially isolated for over 3 years now and i’m looking for some advice. I very rarely ever get out of the house or take care of myself. My hair gets so matted because I lay in bed all day. Anything other than doing nothing or laying in bed feels like a job to me. Playing games, seeing family, you name it. For these past years, it has been me sitting there fantasizing about getting my life together but I never got the motivation to do it. I love music and want to record with my best friend but I’m still so unmotivated. I recently got my drivers license (I’m 19) and started Zoloft again. I’m very interested in getting a therapist too. I’m coming on here because I’m tired of giving myself and others false hope that I’m getting my life together and nothing ever happens. It’s getting embarrassing. There are people I would love to reconnect with. I’m just not sure where to start. Any advice is greatly appreciated! :-)",11Apr2019,9

So I have this friend. He’s a good friend we’ve been friends since like 8th grade (about 4 years). So he’s was dating this girl I used to be friends with (not friends anymore, long story but a lot of hostility between us) their relationship seemed extremely toxic to everyone except my friend. Well they broke up a few weeks ago and he’s pretty hung up on her which I understand. He texted a group chat were in saying he was considering self harm bc (even tho things ended amicable) his ex cancelled prom on him (they were still gonna go together bc they had already spent money on their stuff). He said she told him he was dependent on her and she was sick of it. He is really hurt bc she is talking to another guy while he is still in love with her basically. We talked him down and got him not to self harm (thankfully) but I’m still worried about him. What can I do as a friend to make sure he is safe from self harm? Is there anything I can do? Should I tell an adult? I just don’t want him to do anything bad. He’s one of my best friends and I just really want him to be safe. I think it’s good he at least told us he was considering self harm bc we were able to talk to him. Please let me know if there is anything I could/should be doing.",11Apr2019,1

12," Hello everyone, my name is Cod. My life hasn’t been so good recently and I just want to vent about it, share my story and seek support.

Let’s start with a little backstory, I’m 19, Male 350lbs(158.7kg).

I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and Light Bipolar Disorder at 14 And migraines at 16.

We’ll jump forward to about July 2018. Around this time I began to notice weight gain(at this time I weighed 260lbs(117.9kg)), I began sweating more and more as the months went by, my heartbeat was becoming irregular so I approached my primary doctor about this and they told me to work on my diet and exercise. Fast forward to about February 2019. I was forced to quit my Full-Time job of 9 months due to extremely bad migraines. I was consulting my Neurologist almost every week, we worked out a schedule of migraine preventatives and pain medications. I shortly find a Part Time job to support the gas money back and forth to doctors and a gift here and there for my lovely girlfriend. Fast forward 1-month, mid-March I get a speeding ticket (dumb I know completely my fault) 1 week later the migraines returned with a vengeance. I consult my neurologist once again, more medications. Didn’t work. Day after day I’m sick, vomiting and nearly blind due to these migraines. I am again forced to quit this job too. I return to the doctor he requests an MRI/CAT scan (can’t remember which one) turns out I’ve had a pituitary tumor since about July 2018. (The pituitary gland is in the brain which controls hormones etc.) This tumor is the reason I’ve gained 90lbs(40.8kg), sweat like a leaky faucet, have a weird and concerning heartbeat and the newest development which started about February, Erectile Dysfunction. 

I’m 19 and am a train wreck. I haven’t been able to eat anything but 1 nutri-grain bar a day since the diagnosis, I have broken down many times, haven’t left the bed multiple days and have barely left the house. The only time I’m happy is when me and my girlfriend lay in bed, when I play Minecraft and escape the troubles around (lame I know) and when my girlfriend dragged me out of the house to target lol.

If anyone has any similar experiences they would like to share, wise words or advice PLEASE feel free to share. Thanks for the read.

I had bloodwork done and return to the neurologist on April 19th to figure out a plan of action. And will update when I find something out.

14,"I've had depression for something like twenty years now. Depression and me? We're buddies. I take my meds, make sure to eat something green now and then, and get plenty of water, and normally my depression is fairly well controlled.

Every year, though, about this time, I get sucker-punched by the dirty so-and-so.

I live in Georgia, in the United States, and it gets melt-your-face-off hot here. What's more, it's a wet, sticky heat, the kind that just sits on you. I've been in my bedroom, naked, with an artfully draped sheet and two fans on me. I haven't showered in a week or two, and I am supposed to have friends over this weekend to distract me from my divorce. 

I've done all the things that normally break me out of a depressive slump. I've binged a few shows, eaten some comfort food, even smoked some alternative medication. I don't have the energy to shower yet, and I know I'm dehydrated, but I'm not thirsty. I even tried getting some cut fruit, but I don't even want *pineapple*. I'm probably going to have to turn on the air conditioner, but I can't afford to, really.

17,"Hey guys, 

I haven't posted here in a while (actually, the account I used to post here with accidentally got deleted a few months back, so everything I did post here is gone!). But I had some free time at work today(yesterday by the time I finish writing this) and I wanted to use it to share a helpful strategy I've been developing and using over the years to keep myself ahead of depression, anxiety, and other mental struggles.

I made a video if you want to watch or listen, but it's not as detailed as this post will be.

**Video:** [Appropriating Symbols to Stay Anchored to Truth &amp; Identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1056vYap8Q) (in landscape, please don't hurt me!)
*******
I struggled heavy with depression throughout most of my teenage and young-adult life. Actually, I didn't really even start to get my foot on its throat until the beginning of 2017 (just barely 30 years old), only a few months after escaped a year-long intense battle with suicidal thoughts.

One of the things that have really helped me over the years, and even more so these days since I have a healthier perspective of myself than I did back then, is using symbolism to represent and remind me of personal truths. 

**It doesn't really matter what the symbols are, as long as when you look at them they communicate a quick and clear reminder of the truth that pulls your focus back.**

In the video, I talk about my Sacramento Kings hat, and how I’m not actually a sports fan but as soon as I saw the logo it spoke a thousand truths to me and I knew I had to have it on my head!

I also talk briefly about the movie Inception.

In the movie Inception, they go into the dream world. It’s revealed that the longer they stay there and the deeper they go the more they risk losing the ability to distinguish between what’s real and what’s a dream. 

To combat this issue, the protagonist, Cobb, comes up with the Totem. The Totem is an item specific to each character, each with its own characteristics that they use when things get too intense to remind themselves that they’re just dreaming (in other words, *""it’s not reality!""*).

[Here’s an article that explains the Totem in more detail, if you're interested.](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Totem)

This appropriation of symbols works under the same concept as the Totem.

My most helpful totem is the image of a crown. I have others, but when thoughts and feelings of insignificance and worthlessness come creeping in, the thing that keeps me grounded in reality the most is remembering, *“I’m not worthless, I’m not insignificant, I’m a king.”*

Rather than having to write that down everywhere and read it if I get bombarded out of nowhere, it’s easier to sum it all up in a symbol; so all it takes is one glance at the image and it speaks all of the truth I need to hear. 

It doesn’t always make the intense thoughts and feelings disappear, but it pulls me out of that sense of drowning and insanity by reminding me that not everything I'm thinking and feeling is the true reality.

Just like the totems in Inception, however, mine doesn’t have to be yours. In fact, the more personal yours is, and the more specific and meaningful it is to you, the better. 

The most important word of advice I can give on that, is it needs to be something that isn’t based on emotions or other people. For example, I don’t want my Totem to be an ex-girlfriend or even some trinket from a current one (a totem based on the emotion of love). Why? Because feelings and people are generally unreliable as far as being trusted as the overlords of our internal well-being.

Let’s say my totem is a hair-tie from a girlfriend, and every time I feel unloved, I look at that hair-tie and it reminds me *“Hey, regardless of what I’m feeling, I know I’m loved because this girl loves me!”* Well, what happens if we have a bad break up? That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *""maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out? Why did she stop wanting me?

There's already enough negativity trying to force it's way into our house without us opening more windows.

The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on. I don’t want to build the foundation of my identity on how I feel, or on the approval of another person, because I’m not guaranteed to feel that way tomorrow, and that person isn’t guaranteed to still approve of me in the morning. 

A totem must be something you can be convinced is true, in spite of what thoughts, feelings, and other people might be *SCREAMING*. It's a constant, and absolute, a solid piece of ground. That's why it holds so much power, because nothing or nobody can change it.

If depression sneaks in and lays me out, I can still believe I’m a king, even if I don’t feel like one, even if I'm failing to act like it. If a person I was hoping would approve of me doesn’t? I can still say, despite the knot I might be feeling in my chest over rejection, *“You know what? That’s okay, I’m still a king!”* And you wish them well and move on, knowing nothing about who you are has changed, and more importantly, they didn’t have the power to take any of it away.

If you want to know why this “king” thing is so important to me, I talk about that in the video. It's not arrogance, though, it's humble, quiet confidence. But that part isn't really relevant to the overall point, so I’ll skip it here!

The most powerful weapon I’ve ever forged in my fight against depression is building a strong foundation on truth and identity: something I can insist on, sometimes stubbornly, sometimes aggressively, no matter what’s going on in me or around me. And then I find or create symbols and images that represent those foundations, so a simple glimpse in times of trouble can give me everything I need to remember to stay on top of it.

If my head is full of suicidal thoughts? I’ve already decided in the times of peace that I will stay alive just to irritate the shit out of Death. When it comes whispering in my ear, *“Just roll over and die! You wouldn’t have to feel this way anymore if you weren’t alive! It’ll be over before you know it! People will only be sad about it for a little bit, and then they’ll move on!”* I’ve already decided, *“Whatever you are, you sure seem to want me out of here real bad. I bet you’re even a little pissed off, maybe even scared every second I’m still alive… so you know what? I’m going to stay alive just to annoy you, just to torment you the way you’ve tormented me, just to keep that power over you that you wish you had over me. Thanks for giving me a reason and a purpose to live.""*

# &lt;madman tangent&gt;

The same sword you swing at my neck is the same one I'm going to use to take your head off. So how badly do you want to take the risk? How badly to do you want to take the chance that not only might I survive, but I might expose your whole racket and teach the world how to react to it?

That's how I think of depression, and that's what helps give me the strength to endure it. 

It stole so many years of my life, so many of my relationships, and got so close to killing me. But that whole time it ran the risk that I might figure out its inner-workings and expose it to the rest of the world. That I might tell other people the weak points and vulnerabilities I found in its system. 

So in it trying to kill one person, it ran the risk of losing its grip on hundreds, thousands, millions... all because that person didn't roll over and die when it demanded it. So go on and whisper temptations of death into my ear, you're only adding to my arsenal. Go on acting like you're my slave master, you're only making me into an abolitionist.

You, reader, take a moment to understand just how valuable you are in this thing we call life. You might see no end in sight to what you're experiencing. You might be unable to remember or comprehend what silence and peace sounds and feels like in your head. 

At my lowest, I couldn't remember what hope and happiness felt like it. It was as if any remembrance of hope and happiness outside of bouts of depression was just a dream or a drug trip. It was like a word on the tip of my tongue, every time I would start to get a sense of what it was, it would slip away from me. I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was like to feel happy. 

At my lowest, I would stare at the walls and the cabinets and the hooks on the ceiling, wondering which one if any could hold up the weight of my body if I decided to pull a belt around my neck.

At my lowest, I was physically paralyzed by fear one day, completely convinced that if I so much as blinked my eyes, it would somehow kick my muscles into motion and end with me hanging myself. That was about the point I finally had enough of living that way and knew I needed to find a way out of darkness.

I'm so thankful I didn't listen to that voice because now even the hint of what I know I have to offer humanity is enough to keep me here, enduring through times of frustration and that hovering depression looking for a way back in. I haven't even scratched the surface of the potential good I can contribute to human history. 

And likewise, you haven't scratched the surface of how much you have to offer this world because of what you've been through, and may still be going through. You maybe haven't realized that you're going through it gives the opportunity to learn how it works, how it speaks, and how to respond a way that empowers you to live free. And then someone comes along going through what you've been through, and your response is no longer ""Yeah, I go through that, too! Life really sucks! It would be better if I was dead, lol..."" But then you can say, ""I've been through that, here's what helped me."" It's a human life saved and changed and given purpose again because you endured and dared to challenge that thing.  And what happens when that human tells another, who tells another, who tells another?

Get it? Your life is so much more important and so much more impactful than depression will allow you to accept. But we'll endure and we'll conquer. And I know that doesn't make it more *fun* to go through these things, but I hope it gives you something to hope for. Something to look forward to on the other end, an anchor of sorts that you can grab onto and let it pull you back up to the surface.

# &lt;/madman tangent&gt;

I'm sure some of this sounds crazy to people. But this thinking has worked so well for getting me better because it shifts the power back into my hands. It's not hype, it's not empty inspirational sentiments. It's practical. It might sound weird to other people, but what were they doing to empower me in those times of silent warfare, when I was fighting for my life against things they can’t see, hear or comprehend? So people can laugh at the weapons forged, but the most important thing is do they work? Are they practical? Do they give me the advantage when this enemy shows up to steal my land? Can I teach other people how to wield these weapons too? 

One important point I haven't mentioned yet is I’ve learned to be very intentional about making these choices and perspectives a foundation outside of the storm. So if the storm does come I’m already prepared to deal with it.

**Nobody waits until the tornado sirens go off before they start building their underground shelter.** They recognize the climate they’re in, that tornadoes are more likely to happen where they are than they are in other climates, and they build their foundations and prepare their shelters accordingly. And if those sirens sound one day they already have a plan of action, they already have a place of refuge so they don't get carried away by the wind.

Likewise, soldiers don’t wait until the war is declared before they start training. They train in times of war and times of peace so they are always ready if an enemy ever decides to get brave.

I also make these decisions apart from emotional hype. You know when you read something really good and you just get overwhelmed with that feeling of wanting to rally and run with it? A lot of people make their big decisions under those feelings, and they don't know why they can't stay committed to things long-term. Often it's because you unknowingly made a motivational commitment in response that strong swell of emotion, so as soon as the emotion dies down so does your resolve and your motivation. Since your commitment was a reaction to the emotion it's easy to think the commitment isn't worth it if the work isn't generating that same emotion.

So we are learning to strengthen ourselves on strong foundations, instead of foundations like feelings, moods, relationships, other people's opinions, and things that are constantly shifting from day to day, moment to moment. There's nothing wrong with any of those things by themselves or in their proper context. But in the context of building core foundations for a healthier inner-person, none of those things stay still long enough to keep a house from falling over.

It might take time and practice to work these things out and adapt them to your own situations. It's not one-size fits all. Depression is influenced by a number of different things (chemicals, circumstances, diet, etc.)! But it took me YEARS to get to this place, so I hope what I’ve learned and what I've written here can save you that time, and give you an advantage. 

As I said, I spent the entirety of my teenage and young-adult life in the in-and-out cycle of depression. But every time I was dragged into the darkness I learned something new about how it was working against me, where it was sneaking in, what its voice sounded like, its vocabulary, its tone, and I started putting the appropriate measures in place. So every time it came I learned to use it's own momentum against it, over and over, more and more, until the momentum began to shift in my favor. 

I used to get so caught off guard by it. By the time I recognized what was happening I was already deep in a bout of depression that might last for weeks or months at a time. *""This again? I thought I was over it! Maybe I'll never be over it...""* 

Now I recognize it as soon as it starts creeping in. I hear that first initial thought attempting to trigger the reactionary feelings that would open the door to more thoughts and more feelings (that perpetual downward spiral), and I can go, *“Oh! It’s just that thing trying to get in. I know you!”* 

But even if I do find myself caught off guard, I’m aware enough of what it is now that I can walk myself through it without getting my head held beneath the waves. 

*“It’s okay. It’s just thoughts and feelings, it’s not the truth about you or your life or your purpose. You remember who you are and why you’re here and you don't believe anything it tells you to the contrary.”*

This would lead to another one of my strategies, perhaps my most helpful one: *personification.* But we’ll save that for another day!

This was longer than I intended it to be, but I hope it’s a lot more helpful for it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to comment and ask! 

*Disclaimer: I don’t respond to cynicism. If you need me to elaborate on something, I’m happy to do so! If you’re here to passive-aggressively insult me or this post, please value your time and do something productive with it. 😀*

Thank you for reading, I hope this helps start stacking up the victories. You are stronger than you know right now, and you already have everything you need to conquer these issues. So keep each other encouraged, eyes always set forward, and let's crush this thing!

I have been doing very well for the past year or so especially compared to the few years before it. Improving little by little but have made enough progress to be significant. 

The problem is occasionally I get a deep and difficult to handle urge to destroy my progress and go even further by doing something that will make everything worse. It's difficult to go into detail but basically a part of me still wants to destroy my life, send me over the edge. I have been doing so well, better than I've been compared to anytime in the last fifteen years give or take a year. 

I have dug deep in myself to try and purge or even understand my problems. This one I just don't understand and it is very strong. 

Why do I want to destroy my life? Not necessarily end but the equivalent of intentionally driving into a tree full speed.",11Apr2019,3
21,"So I think I like this girl who’s like me, a sad boi and I kinda want to tell her but she’s said that she likes someone else(I actually don’t really remember all that much) and that her parents want her to focus on school and not a relationships, and I’m also scared of if she doesn’t like me back, how it will affect our relationship, we’re really close friends, any advice?",11Apr2019,1
22,"STRAP IN BOYS AND GIRLS CAUSE I NEEDS SOME HELP AND DONT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE ALL THIS FUCKSHIT 

So. 

Saturday my mom has me running around after I do a 5 hour long exercise that’s more physically demanding then almost anything I’ve done in the army as a combat medic, and all I wanted to do was be home &amp; spend time with my family. So I got yelled at for wanting to go home because it felt like nobody even cared that I was there. 

Sunday I’m told I need to re do an obstacle course due to whoever was with me in said course blocking every entrance and exit I could take. Sooooo...I ran out of air in a 30 minute air bottle...in 10 minutes. No biggie, but watch this shit. 

Monday’s just hardcore depression and anxiety. Which I fought against. Cool, whatever. 

Tuesday, I find out my 11 year old nephew is suicidal. 

Wednesday my nephew was born, and my mom &amp; 3 sisters know I had class at my fire academy &amp; that my insomnia is bad. Do I get a call or text? Nope. Did I get a call or text the next day? Nope. Saw a Facebook post and decided not to say anything. The only reason Mom texted me cause she wanted me to pay the phone bill this month after paying like $2200 in bills. Not even a hey, miss you (especially after Saturday) 

Wednesday night into this morning, I’m with a girl I’m actually super into, it’s like 1 am, we’re sitting in my car in front of her place being cute, and as I kiss her SHE FUCKING SMACKS THE SHIT OUT OF ME. She apologized for about an hour straight, but all I could do once I was in my car alone was cry. 

It’s 10 am and I haven’t stopped crying after I was slapped, and I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m the bad guy cause I got mad that nobody told me my nephew was born. I still REALLY wanna commit suicide, as much as I fight it (Im very open about it, I don’t hide how I feel). Yet absolutely nobody seems to care about what I’m going through. Am I doing something wrong? Am I being too annoying? Is doing practically everything for my family &amp; the people around me not enough? What do I do?",11Apr2019,1
23,"I just got done playing a video game in which I fell pretty far behind in, contributing to the teams loss, normally I do pretty well in it but just had a rough go and this time one of my teammates got so upset about my performance that he told me to go hang myself. I've struggled with depression off and on for a while but it's comments like these that can almost bring so many things back to the forefront of my mind. It's hard to tell whether the words hurt me more or that it hurts my view of humanity. Maybe a mixture of both? It just fucking sucks when you're already in a slump. Do you guys have any tips or tricks to prevent others pushing you further down the hole you're trying to climb out of?

24,"What have you found helpful in overcoming or dealing with your depression, beyond meds/therapy?

I’ve been on antidepressants for 7 years and in therapy for one year, and they help but not enough.

Some things I’ve found helpful in the past: sunlight, being in nature, family, cats/dogs, cleaning up my living space. 

The main way my depression manifests is lack of motivation to do anything, so I have a hard time with exercising/volunteering/focusing on work etc.",11Apr2019,1

27,"I can't tell if my depression causes my self worth issues or if my self worth contributes greatly to my depression. **I have addressed that several of my troubles are due to feeling low self worth and low self esteem. I'm wondering if there are any good books or resources out there that help work on building these things?** 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have problems doing daily tasks and grooming myself. I know some books start with doing small things like showering ect. These are great but I'm not at that point thankfully. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a councilor but I can't afford a session right now so I'm kind of just left to myself and free resources. I'm not currently on medication but I probably should be.

30,"So, I just want to write down my story of today so I can move forward I guess. If it happens again, I can just read this and then evaluate my feelings.

In short, I went to a water tower which was 38.5 meters/126.3 feet height. I.e, if I jump from there, I'm dead. I also considered the possibility to get paralyzed or even recover from my injuries and then move on. 

When I finally climbed up the last stair, I noticed that there was a family enjoying the view. So I waited for them to leave. There were children. Regardless of how edgy I might be, I wouldn't dare to traumatize some kids. So I waited fifteen minutes, they climbed down and I made sure to check if they were a good amount of distance away from the tower. Then I found three books behind my back and checked with my compass app at which direction I should jump. I had checked before I entered the tower, which spot would be the one without any trees in the way of my fall. It was the one in the east. I located the spot and looked down. Slowly one realization made itself clear in my mind. I'd be dead. And then I waited and stared into the sky. Decided to not jump and climbed down again. 

Honestly, I have no idea if I just chickened out the last minute or not. What I can say for sure though, I was imagining the ""injure yourself and recover""-future. I.e, I wanted to show everyone that I was broken. I was never able to say that aloud clearly and thus I just wanted to ""express"" myself better. Although I admit, jumping from a public water tower would be a bit too extreme, quite a bit. I decided to either use some drug overdose or other chemicals to just ""knock out"" and make this delusion of ""suicide attempt"" and ""now help me."" But before I think about those ideas again, I wanted to check out how I can help myself first. So I just use the internet and enter some depression boards I guess. The reason why I post this on r/depression_help and not r/depression is that I didn't jump. Therefore, I can just put this off as some morally good thing which motivates others to not be depressive. 

Yet I have to say, I don't think anything like that matters. You die, you live, you choose, sometimes you can't. That's how it works. There is not really a ""wrong"" or ""right"" at this point. Since those changes always. It's better to say, what the collective majority deems as ""right"", is smarter to perceive as ""right"" as well. If you don't do that, you may face discrimination towards your kind. This time, personality and way of thinking I guess. It's possible to hate everything after all.",11Apr2019,11
31,"Hello all, here's the story:

Went into hiding in fear of abandonment for almost 3 years, back on meds for 1 year. Only recently felt fine enough to apologize to best friends and met them last week. (I discovered something more to my mental condition but that's off-topic)

Now the final person I really need to get in touch with is my ex-SO. 

1. I couldn't bring myself to justify apologising to them, maybe they're better off on their own.
2. Even if I want to, the only contact I have left is their phone number, and I don't own mainstream SNS accounts.

Should I apologize or should I ""stay dead""? How should I tell them about the reason why I've gone missing? Is there a better way to do this?

I'm not trying to get back together, just wanting to maybe lessen their pain. In my understanding, if something isn't completed it gets stuck in one's head; maybe this could do them some good and they would be able to move on.

34,"Hi everyone. It’s my first time posting here, so I’m not sure what exactly I’m supposed to explain about what I’ve been experiencing, but here goes anyway. I’m a 24 year old girl (female, woman, young lady? Whatever) who graduated with a really useless degree and has been working as a receptionist with no idea of what to do next. 
I’ve been having a really, really rough few months with bad things happening left and right that are almost entirely out of my control. I tried my best to stay positive and keep going, but this week depression hit me like a truck. 
I’ve been exhausted no matter how much I sleep, I gave up on my diet that I was doing really well with in the last two days and have been alternately eating too much and not eating at all, I’ve been picking fights with my boyfriend while trying to explain how I feel, I’ve been crying at my desk at work and in a bathroom stall at work and in my car in the parking lot at work. I don’t even have the energy to do my laundry. I’ve tried talking to my family and they say I have nothing to be sad about, but here I am! Still so horribly and hopelessly sad that I really don’t know what to do with myself. I’m not actively suicidal but I’m not upset at the idea of dying by accident.
I don’t know what I expect to gain from this post. Looking back, this wave has been sneaking up on me for a while now, and it’s like I’ve been running as fast as I can to get away from it before it crashes but I just couldn’t run long enough. 
I abandoned all my hobbies a long time ago, I’ve been more and more reclusive as the days go on, I’m irritable all the time, I’ve just been in full zombie mode. I’m doing okay with putting on a happy face at work so people don’t think I’m an absolute freak, but it’s getting harder and harder to keep it together. I know the answer is therapy but I don’t have the money or the time. What else is there to do? I feel like such a head case lately and like no one understands what I’m feeling. I wish this could just go away",11Apr2019,3
36,"Hello- I was taking 200 mg Zoloft once daily. I still struggled with symptoms and then started with the suicidal ideations. I told my doctor as my psychiatrist was booked up for a month. My doctor lowered my Zoloft to 50 mg a day, and 100 mg Wellbutrin.

I’m experiencing really intense withdrawal symptoms from the Zoloft. I was able to get an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow at 9 am, but is there anything I can do or take to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms?

39,"Hello people.

I've been going through a constantly cycling unofficially diagnosed emotional disorder probably most of my life. It's gotten steadily more severe in the past year hitting an apex when I went through a particularly difficult life event a little over a month ago.
My issue lately is a just feel so lonely. Like I cant break into conversations and I can't concentrate on what I'm saying even if I'm able to approach someone. I'm trying to relax my body language but I'm at the point where I dont know how. I feel like people are avoiding me while it's possible im giving out such heavy anxious energy that I'm difficult to approach? Plus I've started to get massively paranoid at work that people are talking about me/don't like me/are spreading rumors/etc.
I definitely have days where I feel like I'm able to connect and mingle like a dream so by that logic it must just be my depression/anxiety/whatever disorder getting into my head right? It's funny, no matter how many times I go through these paranoid, depressed, lonely phases it still takes a helluva lot of restraint on my part to not have a massive panic attack because I'm so simultaneously freaked out and numb. Also as a sidenote I'm seeing a counselor and I'm in the process of figuring out a good medication. Just wanted a little support from internet strangers who have gone through similar things. 
Thanks for reading.",11Apr2019,1
