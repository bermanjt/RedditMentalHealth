0,"She recently got out of an abusive relationship and came to me for support and I've tried to be there for her the best I can. Since she got out of that relationship, her ex has been engaging in a lot of self destructive behaviour and she blames herself. This morning I woke up to a lot of texts from her, saying she blames herself for what's happening and that she hates herself for it. She says that everything reminds her of him and it brings her so much pain and that she wishes she was happy. I don't really know what to say to her and I feel like a broken record when I constantly tell her that she shouldn't blame herself. I really do want to help her because I care about her so much, I just don't know how.",01May2019,4

2,"Seriously, for some reason, my mind has gravitated towards taking any form of negativity as equally hard and paralyzing.  I hear people argue at work about money or politics and I break.  I see a YouTube video complaining about a movie and I break.  I listen to podcasts who bring up a societal issue and I break.  


I've viewed society, humanity, and the world as irrecoverably broken, miserable, unjust, and hopeless for over half my life now, and it's seeped into my 24/7 state of being.  I view every stranger as ""How have they been sexually harassed/racially profiled"", every news story as ""Further proof of the hopeless pit that makes life not worth living for all of us now"", and every negative media review as ""Unable to enjoy anything/proof that art and passion are dead and hopeless"".  Therapy, yoga, and meditation aren't helping either.  I need help.",01May2019,4
3,"2 months ago I wanted very badly to kill myself. It wasnt the first time and I dont doubt it won't be the last. I'm so tired of getting better just to get worse again. I can't talk to a single person I know about all the pain in my head, the cacophony of misery and guilt, every mistake, every regret burning through me like a wildfire.
I'm taking my meds every single day and its honestly so much better than where I was but I still can't stop the pain, it still comes back. I know I need a therapist but my insurance just changed and it will be 6 weeks before I can even do an intake to get a referral to find a counselor. Even then it might not be a good fit and I'll have to keep looking.
I don't have that kind of time. I need help now! I don't need a crisis line to point me to an emergency room where I get locked away for days only to get dumped back out with a list of useless resources.
I just feel like if I can't get all of this out I'm going to break down soon. 
Part of my symptoms include some psychotic features where i hear voices constantly mocking me and pushing me to hurt myself. My meds were stopping this but now it's getting stronger and my pills just aren't strong enough.

I know the odds of even getting so much as an upvote on this are slim. I'm just a piece of trash floating through the void never finding rest, never finding comfort, never coming home. 
I know I don't deserve to feel better but God i just wish I could be better for my family's sake.

I dont know what I even need at this point but please someone just tell me it gets better because I've lived with this for so long that I dont think it's TRUE.",01May2019,10

I need help, and advice please because I don’t think I can actually do this anymore and I think I’m breaking down right now.

Since October of 2018, I’ve been using cocaine, self harming in the form of head hitting and disregarding everything that was once important in my life. 
I’m currently high off cocaine and weed, just finished a panic attack and I feel so alone and want to just give up and call an ambulance but I’m so scared and I have so many things I need to do and I’m afraid they’ll take me away. I’m afraid of becoming an impatient and not being able to see my family or friends. 
I just feel like since Monday when my therapist said I have a form of drug addiction 
And alcoholism I’ve felt like maybe I do have a problem but I don’t know what to do.

I’ve not made a fully thought out plan for suicide, I’ve made half assed thoughts about using drugs to overdose but i just am too cowardly to do it.
I apologize for the long text with lots of mistakes I just feel very alone right now and am wondering if I should call an ambulance because I’ve been too scared to before but now I just feel like I can’t do anything and I’m tired of having the same routine everyday 

I wake up with plans to get things accomplished but I always end up doing drugs and driving around, ignoring my life and responsibilities and then go home and cry about it. Rinse and repeat. I can’t get out of the cycle and feel like I have Borderline or something because I’m constantly melting down.

(26M) I've been on medication for over 6 months, had to change meds at one point (which was awful), and I'm on the highest dose of Venlafaxine. Still nothing was working.


Go to the doctor, he asks the usual questions, I told him this time I knew/decided how I was going to end my life when I was ready (getting over the guilt etc)
He calls the crisis team and I go to the hospital.


End up seeing a psychologist (I think). We have the usual talk about things. He comes to the conclusion that it sounds like Existential Depression. I've never heard of this before, and have been struggling with my depression since I was 15.


I looked it up on google. Says that it's common in gifted and talented adults/kids.

21,"Hi everyone,

Don't really know if this is the place to post this but I figured I'd give it a try.
My cousin has been admitted to hospital for severe depression following a suicide attempt and things are continuing to get worse. His dad (my uncle) has been emailing us and is very worries about the possibility that he might not be with us much longer. His dad has asked us for ideas about anything else he can do to help and also asked us to think about what we can do to help. His dad doesn't want to have the conversation of us wishing we could have done more so he's asking us to think about what we can do now.

So I guess that's the question. What advice can you guys give to both my uncle and the extended family including myself of anything that we can do to help.

Thanks",01May2019,1

My boyfriend is getting tired of my moods.  I’m not even myself around him (or anyone) anymore. I’m just a miserable, negative person. He has even told me multiple times that he’s not sure about the long term viability of our relationship. 

I’ve always said I would never harm myself but lately I just can’t help but imagine all the ways I could just end it. I work in a medical profession and have access to lots of drugs that would make it so easy. But to be honest I’m a coward - I’m afraid of death.

26,"Hi. As of late, I have regained the ability to feel genuine happiness, thanks to some lifestyle changes and general improvements in my world. But of course, there's an issue that persists. My depression still lingers in my everyday life, still managing to take over some days. I've noticed that, despite feeling better, I'm not allowing myself to feel happy anymore. Like I'm reverting back to my older way of thinking, my ""who cares you don't deserve it"" mindset, shooting down more positive ones instantly. I can't stop it. It's really getting to the point where I feel so greedy and like an entitled idiot for being depressed as it just worsens. Every day I'm feeling selfish for this thing I can't control.
Can anyone at least just relate to this feeling of getting better, only for your depression to apply a crushing blow to any of your happy thoughts? Does it make anyone else feel like you're total greedy scum, or am I just delusional..?",01May2019,2

I have a strange feeling I’ve hit a spot in my playing abilities where I’m good to people that don’t play music, but to people that do know how, I’m just not good enough. I don’t know what else to think. I’m pretty sure my songs are good, but I just don’t know anymore. In three years I’ve only meet with two people. I just spent a week learning this guys 5 songs and 2 covers. Last text to him I ask if he used a metronome when he played. after four days of texting about the songs and when we could meet up, he told me he would send me the timing to the songs and he never texted me back. Saw today that he joined another band. Week after ducking me. I was a huge kick in the teeth. 

I’m also an out of work mechanic with 12 years experience that can’t find a job. I apply, I call, I interview... nothing. All I’ve ever done is work in cars and play music and I can’t figure out how to do ether to make money for my family. Luckily my wife is an amazing person and understands how I feel. My family’s the best. But I can’t help them. I sit around all day, dishes and laundry done before 8 am and the it the phone, video games, over and over and over.

29,"My father said to me in a drunken fit, ""All we suffer is a punishment for what we have done. Deal with it.""

I never knew getting abused when I was barely 3 was a choice. I never knew being diagnosed with T1D was a choice. I never knew having mental illnesses was a choice. I have tried my best. I have tried to make the most out of my intellectual capacities. I know more about psychology, philosophy, biology, linguistics and etymology than anyone else in my school, including *some* of the teachers.

 I have 3 language certificates, a fourth one on its way (DELE, DELF, HSK and FCE on its way) . I have won prizes for being the first one to implement probiotic food (that is not yoghurt or cheese, ice cream in this case, with probiotic testing done by a gov. organization) in Peru, as a national science fair project (for those who doubt, there should be some reference on the internet for the Science ADECOPA 2016, X. Gomez and Hyun Min Park in first place).

I speak 3 languages fluently and 3 languages in a begginer/indermediate level. I am elegible for MENSA, which I planned to enter once I graduate. And yet, they treat me like I've done nothing, because I am on the computer 6 to 12 hours a day, mostly reading. They treat me like a videogame addict when I barely play 4 hours a day. The blame me (which to an extent it is my fault) for having a special schedule for school, in which I assist 2 days a week, every 2 weeks.

I don't know what else to do to prove myself worthy. I have no friends. Nobody likes me. As a matter of fact, the girl I like *hates* me. I juat don't know what to do. I am severely fucked up, and yet my dad does not feel guilty for his actions. He denies them. I have personality disorders, bipolar depression (I believe it's also called manic depression), and a rapidly deteriorating health.

They think I have life easy, just because of my IQ. They deny my efforts in jealousy. Just because I have 152 IQ does not mean I don't have to put in any effort into my studies. I approach them with determination, interest and I dedicate my time into it. If they would do the same, I am certain they would be as knowledgeable as they consider me to be. High IQ means that I have to put in less effort to comprehend something, not that I magically know all information existing. 

I struggle more than others. At least I feel like I do. I work twice as hard and yet I am half as liked. My entire family dislikes me. They ostracized me. My cousin has a marginally better life because of better parents and a better environment. He has been loved by my grandparents even more than me. He has never been abused because his father is not a cockroach like my father is, who has to beat anything, to deal with his masculinity complex, whether it be his wife or his son. And yet, he NEVER laid a finger on his daughter.

I didn't choose this. I didn't choose to be this way. There are around 1,022,000 words (estimatedly by Harvard and Google a few years back) amd yet there is no way I could ever arrange them in a way to express my self hatred.

I have decided to commit suicide. I was fairly uncertain for the past few months, but I'm sick of it now. The world can fucking bite my ass. I won't struggle for a fight with no reward. I won't let myself be used and abused by others, sucking the life out of me. Fuck the world, and every each one of its pathetic, sadistic, abhorrent inhabitants.

31,"So this year a lot of us started ""Polytechnic"" (basically a Singapore equivalent to college with a lot of high school mixed in) . And I was really worried about not fitting in.  My fears were somewhat warranted as I've really only made one friend and generally can't seem to talk to others in my class. Occasionally I'll join a conversation and it goes okay, but it usually doesn't evolve beyond that. That said I'm not too worried for myself. I take more time to talk to people, and I guess that's okay. It does of course hurt at times, that everyone is already getting along and I'm unable to really do the same, especially considering the fact that my social life in Secondary School was pretty decent. 
But that said I'm sure something good will happen eventually. Or not, it's a bridge I'll cross later.
Here's my main issue. My friend who went to a different Polytechnic (Nanyang Poly) (I go to Temasek Poly) is having a worse time than me. While I was fortunate enough to befriend at least one person, she has been unable to befriend a single person. And unlike me who's on ""okay"" terms with the rest of my class, she tells me the class thinks she's weird and actively avoids her. I've tried to re assure her things will get better but the more I hear about it, the more I can't say for certain it will. We both talk to each other occasionally, sometimes jokes; other times about how our school life isn't going too good. 
I just kinda need advice on what to tell her because I don't know what to say anymore but I do genuinely want to support her.  And when sometimes your perspective completely agrees with hers and you think you'd end up in a similar position it makes trying to help even harder. Sorry if my points are a bit all over the place just really need advice",01May2019,1
32,"Does anyone else have a life which is just struggle and hard work? Whenever you feel something positive is lasts for a second or is taken away from you quickly. But whenever you feel a negative emotion is lasts for ages and more intensely than you probably should? Everyday is the same, gym, rest, work, come back, sleep, repeat. No human interaction, nothing. I’m like a robot. In fact, I’m worse than a robot. Robots don’t feel anything, I just feel negative emotions. A robot would be a step up for me. 

I came to a conclusion the other day that anything involving me and just me turns out OK, my job, my finances, etc. But whenever a project or task involves another human, it invariably fails. Why is it so easy for others? Why can others flash a smile and get what they want? Why am I “rude and surly” but others are “mean, moody and exciting”? Is anything good supposed to happen to me?

The world has the most amazing colors yet I see it grey.

I have given up in that hope that I could see the sky as it is beautiful.

Hands crawl my neck as if they were trying to escape and I feel like I'm drowning 

Do I see an escape? Maybe I do but it's so far away and I don't want to reach it

Every morning I can't recognize the person I stared at the mirror.

A different person occupies my mind.

Whispering the reality only I can see. 

Ignoring the reflection, a new voice that belongs to me calls it hurtful names.

Every sunrise, I hear the bitter voices in my head telling me I'm nobody and no better.

I see myself not like myself anymore.

It stains me and yet I feel two minds talking with each other.

I feel like I'm worthless and I will never get better,

I tell myself every day that one day the pain will stop

And now every dawn, I go to sleep hoping the voices stop whispering the things I don't want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i wake up with a smile that can fool many but only few can see what  meaning lies behind 

my pitiful existence yet people have it worst.

Other familiar voices said I have everything yet I don't want it

I would have preferred for anyone to have this life instead of me

The pain grows and I can't stop it because it's me, I am my own pain

The worlds feel like its getting darker and all I see its bright light from the window, is the end near or is it me? because sooner or later pitch dark will stop me from seeing the future the world has for me.

I (20m) am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior (I caused my own problems) and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. (Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again) 

I have been spiraling (more or less) over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. 

The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. 

I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 5/9 (May 9th - USA), but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is “tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it”. 

This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who can’t afford help and have gotten along just fine. It’s your life, and at the end of the day it’s on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying it’s pointless. 

Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniques/routines/activities did you use / partake in?  What helped change your perspectives? 

Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far",01May2019,3
45,I’ve got depression (gasp I know) and I recently started taking lexapro (about 2+ months ago 10 milligrams) it started actually working around the 4ish week mark so it’s been a fairly stable last month. But this past week has been really hard and I can feel myself slipping into one of my veeerrryyy deep moods again and I don’t know what’s wrong. I know I’m a bit extra stressed with school ending and finals and I’ve got my opening night for the school play (I’m a main role) next week and I just can’t get motivated to do any work and can’t concentrate and I’m constantly having anxiety attacks and I just want some advise on what I can do to help myself get out before I spiral down to my lowest. Should I talk to my doctor about upping lexapro so soon? Is there other alternatives or methods you use to help pull yourselves back up? I decided to write this post now after bursting into tears because my apple rolled off the table and I couldn’t reach it. Please help me,01May2019,2
46,"It seems to be happening again, these thoughts of suicide that I just can't seem to get out of my head, even when I think that I am happy these thoughts keep coming up, I write my feelings down in case one day it gets too bad. I've been sat in my room all day listening to music, playing sudoku, yet the only thing going through my head all the time is what would happen if I ended it all RIGHT NOW, if I happened to just disappear off the face of the earth, I mean that would at least stop me from this shit that I just can't seem to get rid of.
I just don't know how to take it anymore and I can't explain my feelings to anyone so if this is it. Goodbye, I do love you but I just can't take it anymore.
