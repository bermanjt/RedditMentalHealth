0,"i don't know what else to do. i talked to friends who seemed at a loss. i have called and asked my parents for help, both implied its my problem and i should just figure it out or get a new job, said all of the classic there are people with much worse problems in the world, this is only temporary, people do love me. where are they? I asked for help like this once ten years ago when i got raped and no one came. i got through it alone.  i usually compartmentalize my feelings but its like someone is knocking at a door and the sound is just getting louder and more persistent for me to just do something to hurt myself. that way either the pain stops or i get real help. seems win win. i can't take myself to a hospital, i just can't. i've been depressed for most of my life and this feels like the absolute worst its been in a long time. i wish there was just a good way, it seems like there are no good ways. i dont want someone to have to find my body and feel sad about that their whole lives but i dont know what to do anymore. i have what should be a dream job and its a nightmare. i feel like i can't quit and i'm just trapped in this cycle. i've been raped, in abusive relationships where men have threatened to kill me and i'm lying here wishing they had or beat me til my brain didn't work anymore. i've called hotlines, i started therapy, therapist is on vacation. everyone says just get through today just be safe today and i've done that for years but the last 4 months have been an intense struggle every single day to not step into traffic sometimes, but i wouldn't want to put my death on someone else. today i really asked for help from 3 people and all of them basically said they couldn't help me.. i've been on so many medications and none seem to work, just side effects that leave me feeling sick or worse. i feel so alone. i don't know how to keep going anymore reddit. i feel like i'm at the end.

1,"Ok. So I think we can all relate when it comes to death. It is there, and I'm sure that there are people who feel the same way I do. I have always hoped that there was something after death. Like reincarnation or whatever but for a long time I have been havinh trouble accepting that maybe there isn't anything? Thats my fear. I'm not trying to put down oyher peoples believes or anything, so please don't take it that way. I'm a very lonely person, and I don't really have friends and I guess the one thing that kept me moving forward  other than video games and TV was deatha nd that maybe I'll be better im my next life. This year was deticated to trying to be more sociable and loving myself but it has been really hard. If this really is my one life than I'm kinda screwed. I've tried alot of things to stop what I feel and to not feel depressed all yhe time and all it does is come back in waves. I know that depression isn't just a ""wam-bam- thank you mam"" but maybe someome can help me accept how I feel and death? Or any advice?",24Feb2019,5

&amp;#x200B;

About myself: I'm 24 still in a community college waiting to transfer. I started community college when I was 22, should have transferred last year but since I failed some of my classes and had to retake them, I had to spend an extra year at this place. I have a 3.0 GPA, so it's not fantastic. Pretty much all my friends transferred out last year, so I spend most of my time on my own, and I'm an international student, so I don't have anyone that I can go to when I'm feeling down. I talk to my parents, but I feel like telling them my struggles will only make them feel worse about sending me alone to this country. I'm scared of making new friends too.

&amp;#x200B;

Since September of last year I've felt like I'm a burden to my parents. We've always had just enough to go by so my parents were already risking a lot sending me here to study. The fact that I spent an extra year at this school bothers me every day. It wasn't because I did not understand the course materials but more like I was lazy. I took the minimum number of courses every quarter and sometimes I didn't do the assignments and eventually failed some of the classes. I try to keep my expenses to a minimum. I live in a shared room and help them clean up the house so I can cut back on rent. However, I still feel like I'm wasting their money.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find internships, but I don't know where to start, I checked with the guy in charge of internships at my school, but he said he couldn't help international students. I want to be able to be more independent. The fact that I'm 24 makes me feel old since everyone around me just got out of their high school and most of them seem to know what they are doing. I probably shouldn't be making that assumption, and I know everyone has their timeline, but it sucks to feel like you are lagging.

8,"I'm a freshman in college. I live on campus, my parents live an hour away, and I don't have a job. I never have. 

Okay, so. 

Over the past few months of college, things have gotten really bad. I mean REALLY bad. I can't take care of myself anymore bad. 
I hate these terms, but I considered myself a ""high functioning"" depressed person in highschool. I could cook, clean myself, do my laundry, and take care of my schoolwork. 

Now I struggle with changing my clothes,  getting out of bed, feeding myself, showering, and brushing my teeth. I haven't gone to class for pretty much half of the semester.

I honestly can't look after myself anymore. My therapist said I can consider a medical withdrawal, but I don't know of it will help me in any way. I don't want to be a burden to my parents because I can't take care of myself anymore.

What do I do? What are my options?

13,"I have been on Lexapro for about 3 months, and it’s been going really well. However, I went to get a refill and the pharmacist informed me that I have to have my physician approve more refills. Usually when my prescription says ,”no refills”, they simply call my doctor and she approves it. Again, I have only been on this medication for 3 months and I should have had more refills available anyways. I then called my physician’s office to ask for more refills. They informed me that I cannot receive more refills until I have an appointment with my physician.

This is not the only issue. My doctors office also informed me that my primary physician no longer accepted my insurance, and that I would need to find a new physician.

So now, I have been completely out of my medication for about a week. Not only do I have to make an appointment and meet with my physician, I have to find a new one to review me and further approve me fit for more medication. So I found a new doctor, and her closest available appointment is 2 weeks from now.

I am extremely frustrated with my situation. Given that I had no clue that I wouldn’t be able to receive more medication, I wasn’t able to ween off properly, and was forced to stop cold turkey. No matter how much I begged my doctors office, they insist that I need to meet with a physician before I can have ANY refills.

I am really starting to feel the withdrawal affects. I can feel myself slipping back into my depressive state, I’m having constant panic attacks, I’m even having physical heart palpitations and almost an electric feeling pulsing through my body, not in a good way.

Knowing I still have to wait two weeks for my appointment, where I’m STILL not guaranteed a prescription refill, I am FREAKING OUT.

14,"I'm 20 and in college, and have struggled with depression (no help or meds or therapy - parents never believed in it) since I was 10 (yikes, right?). In the past year, a ton of things just collapsed on me and I haven't been able to get out of this pit in the normal amount of time it takes me (at most 5 mos.). It started when my apartment flooded with sewage on the Sunday before finals week during subzero temps. I had nowhere to live, and all of my roommates had friends that they stayed with. I, on the other hand, had no one, and was left sleeping in my car outside. It made me realize I have no real friends, a condition that has worsened drastically in the past year. Coincidentally, I started dating someone right before the first disaster - so he liked me when I was on the upside of my semi-annual mood swings. Now, after having been left to find a new apartment by my best friend (she was my roommate, and bailed last minute on renewing the lease) and move by myself while simultaneously starting a new job, it got worse. My boyfriend was there for the first bit, but then slowly grew distant, no longer wanting to sleep over, hang out, etc when my mood continually plummeted. I lived with a complete stranger, who broke many of my things (including two plates I painted myself), and left many messes. Normally, in the summers, I go home and spend lots of time outside doing fun things. This was my first summer working away from home, and I spent maybe 5 nights total with friends for the whole summer, opting to smoke weed by myself and sometimes spend time with my (somehow, still) boyfriend. At the end of the summer, I asked if he was happy, and he said no. That transpired into him breaking up with me, as if he needed an excuse to start something that he clearly thought should have happened much sooner. This made me feel even worse, since he was my last somewhat consistent social connection. My few social interactions had been confiscated, and I was left with absolutely no friends and now the broken side of a breakup. I became even more recluse, barely kept up with school, and contemplated suicide for months that fall. I tried visiting my school's mental health services weekly, for a few months, but hardly any improvement was made. My cousin passed away that fall, and I've since been on the same antisocial/suicidal train, picking cutting my wrists back up from middle school a few weeks ago (after my current apartment also flooded, causing 15k of damage that insurance won't cover). It began as preparing to slit my wrists in the bathtub, but I was worried I wouldn't do a good enough job, so I settled. 

What do I do to get out of this? I am so tired of being depressed and socially isolated, but I have no friends to pull me out, nor even my boyfriend, who normally helps me at least abstain from committing suicide. I know this is long, and there's a lot, but any advice would be much appreciated. ",24Feb2019,1
15,"Hi, I (20F) have been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years now, and right now at the brink of midterms and such my depression is at an all time high...causing me to be at an all time low. I just recently had a mutual breakup with my boyfriend of 3 years because of my depression. I did so because I want to better myself and feel better so that I can be a better partner to someone. We still talk since we are such good friends, but I do not want to rely on him so much or be a burden. I started going to therapy again, it'll be good to talk to someone. But right now I am really struggling with the never-ending feeling of loneliness. I try to keep busy through arts and crafts or my studies, but I have gotten to the point to where when I do such things, the feeling of hopelessness, depression, and loneliness only gets worse.

I worry about losing her so much that it’s probably not having a very good impact on our relationship...

She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her self-esteem issues.

28,"In order to ask my question I need to give a little backstory. 
I've just turned 20 and for the past two years or so I haven't been feeling quite enthusiastic about anything, especially life. I can't pinpoint the exact day it started; it's likely that it was a gradual transition that started at around age 16. 
At first I thought it was just a phase that'd pass after some weeks or so. 
I eventually developed a feeling of insignificance in this world. I lost belief that happiness is real, I began to relish the idea of not existing anymore (from the time those thoughts started, they never went way. Presently they occur everyday). Sometimes I find myself climbing up to the highest floor balcony and just thinking while looking down.
 I began to understand people less.  I cut ties with all my close friends, not explaining my actual  thoughts.(I admit I may have had subconscious plans of 'leaving'.) 
Whenever I'm talking to people, after every laugh or sentence, thoughts linger saying, for instance, ""nothing matters dude, what's all of this for? Aren't we better off in a stsye of oblivion"". So after letting go of all my friends, I can't convince myself to make any because I always have these thoughts, thus I wouldn't be a real friend. Whenever I begin to consider some activity as joyful, the thoughts kick in again. To be honest, I even sometimes think to myself, ""Is this the feeling that causes people to start doing drugs? If so then I get it. I never thought I'd take that path but it seem inevitable"". I'm sure you get the idea.

I haven't really vented to any of my previous friends or family about these issues because I've somewhat believed that they're normal aspects of adulthood that you learn to live with. It seems most people in the depression memes subreddit probabaly feel the way I do, judging by the relatability of the memes. 
But I've been hinted that perhaps I am wrong to think this is normal. 

Thus, my question is directed mostly to anyone at least 20. Is this generally normal? I know it is isn't much information to work with, but in your experience, is this typical of adulthood?",24Feb2019,2

I can’t stop my brain talking shits and beating me up every second. I’m sorry for being such a coward. I’d rather stay this way than failing every single time.

I’m a big piece of trash. I’m a mistake. I’m doomed.” It’s extremely annoying and my friends were angry at me kept murmuring and not doing anything to get out of this situation.

I’m an overseas student and they told me to go back to my country and see a psychiatrist and a psychologist. 

I don’t want to go back because that means I’ll have to see my family, but I find it very difficult to face anyone right now. At least being here I have my own room and I don’t need to get out.

I have no choice but to move in with my father, who I do not have the best relationship with and our personalities just fucking clash. He’s an obnoxious, retired, over-the-hill frat boy and I’m a sensitive, anxious, depressive INFJ. It’s a cramped, small apartment where I have to sleep on two sectional couches pushed together in a back room and I also have two cats. Just when I think things can’t get any worse, my favorite client (I work in the group home field) dies in my arms; she was only 34. That was 2017.

2018 rolls around and I just hate life and everything else. I hate my situation. I hate everything. Summer comes and I meet this girl and a spark lights up inside me — something I haven’t felt in a very long time, maybe ever. I fall for her very hard and very fast. We end up moving in together and everything is just great. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a relationship, and in life. Things finally feel good. I planned on going back to school in a few months and I saw a real future in us. I was walking on clouds. The darkness seemed behind me.

Then, late November (week after Thanksgiving, I believe), she begins acting very weird and very distant. Pushes me away, says she’s depressed about stuff, needs her space until it passes. I oblige at first but, from my experience, this is how girls act when they’re about to leave me. So I keep prying and kind of won’t leave her alone...until one night I kind of just emotionally explode. Long story short, she leaves me on a Sunday night, and is back with her ex mere days later. Did I fuck something up or was that just going to happen anyway? I have no clue...but I beat myself over it constantly.

In any case, this absolutely destroys me. I talk to my therapist and what I’m saying to her convinced her that I need to be admitted to the psych ward of a local hospital (not my first stint; spent two weeks there after a suicide attempt as a teen). I spend a week there but feel worse after getting out. End up having to move back in with my father because I have nowhere else to go; I’m literally living on a fucking couch. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat; I end up dropping 20 pounds. I start drinking very heavily. I start getting fall down drunk at bars, literally sobbing on the floor like a child — not a 30-year-old man.

I ended up falling asleep at work in January since I hardly sleep at night anymore and it cost me my job. So I became a miserable lonely heartbroken suicidal drunk with no money, no job, no real home, hanging on by a thread. All I can think about, still...is her. And how she’s with him and how he has money and his own place and how she has a good job and I’m this fucking nothing. I feel like I’m going absolutely insane.

I found a new job but it’s shit and it pays even less than what I was making at my previous job. I’m about to be kicked off of state insurance because I “make too much money” now so I have no fucking clue how I’m going to get my meds. I feel like an incompetent child. All I think about is dying, ending it, being dead. I want to die. I’ve struggled with depression and mental illness my entire life and this is the lowest, darkest place I have ever been. I don’t know why I’m posting here, to be honest...I just think my friends are sick of me and I feel like a burden to everybody around me. I feel like I can barely function. I’m so tired. I’m so fucking tired...I don’t want to do this anymore...",24Feb2019,2
37,"Hey guys,

I've been subject to a lot of depression episodes recently, which really sucks because I'm currently actively looking for a job. I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days (suicidal thoughts and such).

The things is, before fully dedicating myself to finding a job, I decided to take a few months off. This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while *really* taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. 

The problem I'm facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question ""But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing."" with the nice tone of voice ""Have you been doing fuck all? ♥""

I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question?

Cus I'm not sure giving the depression background during an interview would really help my case, and on another end,  I've not been doing ""fuck all"", just not what they want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really lost on this point, cus I really want to start working again. I feel like it would be the next step toward winning over this freaking depression.

I don't want to lie during a job interview, because I feel it would give a bad start to a possible work partnership, but on another hand, should I?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you guys ever had to face that situation before?

Any beginning of answer would really help!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a bunch guys, and take care, because you're all awesome!",24Feb2019,6

By no means do I do all of these every day, but I do write a list of what I want to do the following day and then at the end of the day review and tick of what I do. I don’t always manage to do them all but seeing that I’ve done something always makes me feel better. I’m actually a therapist myself so I actually know a lot of techniques etc but due to a long term physical condition that’s struck me down nearly a year ago, naturally I have felt down but have tried to prioritise my well-being as well as my physical health. I thought this may help give other people some ideas and maybe it would be nice for other people to do theirs to hopefully inspire other self care ideas

39,"I'm just having a terrible day with it all, tbh. Took a few hours to get up this morning, took even longer to get dressed. Dysphoria has been acting up because my binder (a thing transmasculine people/trans men use to flatten our chests) got ruined recently, so I can't wear it and it's the only binder I have because those things are expensive. Gonna be a while before I can get a new one :(

Then I had a panic attack for a while.

Then, when I went out to buy clothes, I got massively judged by other shoppers and by shop staff. Got a lot of stares and a few whispers for being in the male section. I even got ""covertly"" followed around by a staff member because I went in the male changing rooms, so I left the shop feeling even more terrible.

I was also meant to get some work done today, but ended up spending the majority of the afternoon in bed doing nothing and feeling horrific. You know that feeling with depression where it's like all the bad emotions at once? I had that ""feeling"" pretty much all day, even more so in the afternoon. Some mild suicidal thoughts came with that. I ate some of my feelings and tried to drown them in junk food, which (as always) just left me feeling somehow worse than before.

Now it's night time and I can't sleep, don't feel tired, just feel dead inside. Idk man. ",24Feb2019,3
40,"I am a 17 year old male and I've been struggling with on and off thoughts of suicidal nature, But everyone I open up to just seems to shrug it off as me being 'immature' and I'm starting to worry that I'll act on them if I'm feeling particularly impulsive one day (as This has indeed occurred a few years ago) I have had counceling but that didn't help and I'm starting to get the feeling that they aren't going to go away. The thoughts don't always come with feelings of deep sadness so I believe that depression isn't the culprit. I'm basically just asking if anyone else is dealing with / have dealt with these in the past and if it gets better. Because I'm having serious doubts that life is even worth it. Sorry if this post bothers anyone I'm just an immature child anyway.",24Feb2019,2

Over the last few years, life has thrown us a few curveballs and her depression is at its worst.  I have become depressed during the last couple years and I dont know what I can do to help her.  She won't try therapy again and she doesnt like taking pills.   What has helped your spouse through depression?  Work? Hobbies? Drugs? Any advice would be helpful.",24Feb2019,2
42,"I'm new to Reddit and I've seen a lot of posts about mental health which can be helpful at times, but what do I do when /that/ symptom of depression destroys my life? No motivation is what I've struggled with the most for years. It got so bad to the point where I had to drop out of school and people made me feel so damn lazy, when I just feel too depressed to move. I've tried to work out daily, but the routine always falls out of place. I've tried to get a hobby, but it always ends up the same. I'm just too exhausted to even leave my bed. My life has just been full of 'I HAVE to do the littlest things because at least I'm doing something.' But I want to do something other than that. I want to be cheerful enough to go outside, get educated, take pride in my appearance and meet new people. I just need to know how to get there.

People who have struggled with this, please tell me, how the hell did you get out of this rut?
