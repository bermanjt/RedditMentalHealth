0,Really do not want to live anymore. I can't kill myself because of what it would do to my son. I just do not know how to be happy. I have nobody in my life except him. I only get him every other weekend. I can't afford therapy. I just wish it would all be over.,09Apr2019,1
1,"im a teenager first off 

my entire family is done with me because ive been constantly sobbing the last two days. i recently experienced some trauma that threw me over the edge and i cant go near my bedroom without going into fits. (that's where it happened). my mom is especially so tired of me coming to her and crying and asking for help. it's making me feel like theres no other option than to just stop living all together. i know its dramatic but nobody here wants me qnd i dont want me either. i just need help and i cant get it i guess.",09Apr2019,1
2,"Excuse the throwaway, but my brother knows my main, and I don't want him to know this.  

My depression has been really bad lately.  I'm ten years out of college, unmarried, and fairly isolated.  I have a few friends that I see occasionally, but for the most part I'm working.  

I live in New Jersey, so the cost of living is insane.  That being said, I live with my parents at the age of 32.  I didn't get a job in the career field that I picked, teacher, and spent years getting rejected, everyone giving me the same advice thinking that they were the revolutionary savior that was going to help me turn it around.  *Have you tried urban districts or New York City? They're always looking to hire!* Yeah, I student taught in an urban district and I've applied all through this state and three others, but please go on about this magical ""in"" you seem to have.  *Have you tried subbing at all? Gotta get your foot in the door, that's how it's done!* Really? Geez, I am already subbing in four districts for $70 a day and despite being recommended by just about every teacher for whom I filled in when a full time position became vacant, one of those schools still hired an outside person.  But since you're obviously an expert on the teaching profession, I'll just have to try harder!  

Well, I left teaching and went into the private sector.  Despite the fact that I did not get a full-time job in my field of study, I am a fairly smart person.  And that pretty much sums me up, a smart person who majored in something stupid.  So, fortunately I'm still able to earn a living.  

Between the three jobs I work (one full-time, one once a week, and one volunteer job that provdes incentive stipends) I gross about $65,000 a year.  This may seem like a lot, but in all honesty with student loans, gas, insurance, rent to my parents, and general expenses, I still live paycheck to paycheck.  

At my current job, I am the highest that I can be in my department.  This means other than a COLA, I will not get a higher salary, and I have no room to grow further.  At the same time, the idea of taking on more scares me in that I am already working insane hours to keep up with what I have now.  

I am a binge eater. I eat my feelings.  Give me an Oreo and I'll eat the whole sleeve.  Sneaking to drive-thrus late at night and hiding the wrappers.  Buying copious amounts of snacks and keeping them in the car.  I am very bad when it comes to self control.  I've tried to fight this, but I put it on the same level as drug addiction, some days I win and some days I absolutely cannot beat it.  

I'm also a runner.  Well, not a very good one. But I do run.  I started doing it for charity to support a scholarship fund that a friend of mine started.  Then I got my dad into it and he really enjoys it.  Even though I get terrible anxiety when running, I feel like everyone is starting at me, I'm embarrassed at the times I run, and I just want it to be over.  I do get a really nice endorphin boost when I do it, and for a moment I feel great.  I feel invincible.  I feel like an amazing valid person who belongs in this world, which is completely contrary to everything I've ever felt before.  It's also something that my dad and I can do together, which is huge for me, because it means a lot for me that we have a relationship.  

Admittedly, I'm a geek.  I go to New York Comic Con every year, often times in costume, go to panels of interest, and meet a ton of my favorite celebrities.  This brings me a lot of joy, because I feel like I can be myself.  Weird, silly, and a bit eccentric, but surrounded by people just like me.  I am in my element.  

So, maybe it was unnecessary to go into all of that.  Regardless, it gives you an idea of who I am, and I do want people to know that.  Because, admittedly, I'm going to be on the defense reading anything that anyone replies to this.  If a friend gives me advice that doesn't fit me, I get frustrated because I feel like they're parroting generic advice without actually listening.  

One friend I told that I definitely wanted biological children.  She replied, ""Well kids aren't everything, you can be very happy without them! Maybe you'll never get married and you won't have kids.""  I said, ""As I said, I want to get married and have kids, that's important and what I'm steering my life towards.""  She said, ""What if you adopt? You know there are plenty of kids that need a home.  You should do that.  We don't need more kids in this world.""  

Another, after hearing how frustrated I was with dating said to me, ""Well, you need to be happy with yourself first, so work on yourself and the right person will come along!""  I replied, ""I'm in the highest position in my department, I volunteer, I exercise, and I do things that I enjoy to enrich my life. What do I need to work on in order to attract the right person?""  She replied, ""I don't know! It's just good advice in general.""  Yeah, thanks, glad to know that your advice carries all the consideration of a fortune cookie.  

Also, I think I may have defeated the purpose of a throwaway because anyone who knows me is going to immediately know who this is by reading the above, though that bothers me less than posting on my main for some reason.  

So, I'm a nostalgic person.  I look at the past, I have a very strong memory and many things that happened long ago still feel very vivid to me.  So often it doesn't click with me that long periods of time have passed.  I'll often bring up a memory, only to discover that I am the only one who remembers it, or that others placed little value on it.  

Relationships haven't worked out well for me.  I've tried dating, but I have a tendency to attract people with whom it hasn't worked out.  For the longest time, I had very strict standards as to who I would pursue, and as a result I wound up single for a long time.  So I relaxed my standards a bit, and wound up dating several alcoholics, several cheaters, and several who managed to tick both boxes.  

I have a bad tendency to self-sabotage.  When someone seems too good to be true, I feel like they're just toying with me until something better comes along.  Throughout my life, people have treated me like a stepping stone.  They become friends with me and they've got something broken about them.  I help them find a job, talk to that girl, get enrolled in classes, or get over the slump they're in.  Then they leave me.  No explanation, no big blow up, no fight, no reason, just a ghosting and they've found better friends.  So when someone shows interest in me, I'm immediately suspicious that they're using me to get something else.  Several women have talked to me, acted interested, only to ask me to invite another of my friends out so they can get to know him.  Despite all I have going for me, and that's one thing I give myself, I have a great deal going for me, I am incredibly forgettable.  Unless I do something to make myself memorable, in which case I'm usually seen as incredibly annoying.

My most recent relationship, I decided I wasn't going to self-sabotage and I was going to have faith in my relationship.  So even when she would cancel, more often than not, I didn't see it as the doom of the relationship because she assured me she wanted to be with me.  When she would prioritize everything else in the world over me, I didn't end it because she assured me she wanted to be with me.  When I told her I didn't think she was in to me and we could just walk away with no hard feelings, I stayed because she begged me that she would be better and swore on her life she was in love and wanted to be with me forever.  When I finally brought up that she wasn't making or accepting physical contact (hand holding, etc.) she responded that she wasn't a very physical person but that she would try to get better. (Honestly, it made me feel unattractive, and it was like a vicious cycle, because that justified her not wanting to touch me) And after months of not demanding anything, after months of settling for what time she could spare, after finally mustering up the self esteem to say I deserved more, I told her.  She agreed, and promised to be better.  After going on vacation with her family, during which she ignored me and was cold the whole time, I confronted her, and once again she acknowledged I was right.  When we got back, she proceeded to remove our relationship status on Facebook, denied it when I confronted her, and then just said she wasn't in love with me.  She then untagged herself in every photo and status from our relationship and then proceeded to block me five months later.  And yes, I know there are a million red flags there, I know I put up with a lot of shit that I never should have, but I hope you understand why! I hope you know that even though it hurt, even though I allowed it to happen, I had to allow it to happen.  I couldn't just walk away and have ""what if"" linger on me forever.

And that's what keeps sticking in my mind.  I have never been the kind of guy that anyone loses sleep over.  I'm not the guy that someone misses talking to and regrets it.  There's nobody going to sleep at night thinking about me.  And that hurts.  I have this total and complete lack of affection in my life.  I had a friend at one point, she got it.  She knew what it was like to just need to feel wanted, because she'd been in the same place.  So she'd come over and we'd lay in my bed together.  We'd cuddle, watch movies, kiss, give each other backrubs, and fall asleep snuggling together.  She died a few years ago, and I still miss that amazing connection I had with her.

My friends, the people who know me best, have told me that I am this amazing force in people's lives.  That they know they can always count on me, I'm always off doing good for someone, and so many people are better off for knowing me.  

So that's why this is really so hard to even verbalize with them.  How do I, the person who they all see as the supporter, the cheerleader, the motivator, open up and say, ""You know, I am incredibly disappointed in my life.  I feel like nobody sees me, and that I'm so alone.""  They don't want to hear it, and even if they did, they don't know how to handle it.  They're out trying to have a good time, and enjoy themselves and I start talking about how I wish I wasn't here anymore? It's not fair to either of us, and it's just going to make them not want me around anymore.  

People advise me to see a therapist.  Well I saw a therapist for years.  Echo chamber.  How does that make you feel? Why do you think you did that? How do you think you could change that in the future?  I can do that on my own.  Hell, I am kind of doing that on my own right now.  Just letting others in on it at the same time.  

It seems silly.  How can you be suicidal but not want to die? How can you have thoughts of ending your life, but know for certain that you will not act on them?  

If I'm not here, that means my parents have more resources to help my brother, and he likely deserves/needs the help more, because I'm a burden to them.  They could be enjoying their time together, but because I'm here, and can't afford to move out they're stuck with me far longer than I think they ever wanted me to be here.  I know eventually they'll grow to resent my presence, and I'll leave with a damaged relationship.  The amount I work, I'm only be home for about two waking hours a day. To me it doesn't even pay to get my own place if I'm not getting married or living with a long-term partner.  I'd basically make enough to afford mortgage/rent, my bills, and very little food.  

So that's where I am now.  Maybe these seem like first world problems, maybe in the scheme of things, I have it pretty good.  I just don't feel like it's ever going to get better.  As many people as I have been a friend to, supported, and tried to connect with, I just don't feel like there's anyone that will see me as someone they can't live without.",09Apr2019,4

13,"Hi,  
I don't usually go out and about to talk about my issues. However.. I'm tired. And worse, I'm making people tired. I came here because I have already been abandoned by my ""best friend"" after she decided I'm not worthy anymore, which is fine, I just wish she would have been nicer about it as she just punished for being ill, essentially. And now I can't afford to lose my partner too. I can sense he's getting tired and will lose him soon if I keep reaching to him for comfort and support. And I just need to let it out. I'm so tired. My body is not holding itself well anymore. My mind is mush. All I am able to do is lay in bed and use the restroom and food... I just order, when I can afford it or live off cheap pot noodles. I lost my will to live and I'm thinking about suicide more often, I can visualise myself doing it and it doesn't phase me. I just don't know for how long I can hold it anymore. I hate my personality, I hate my body, my face, my way of thinking, my inability of remembering, my incompetence. I hate that I joined the wrong course and I hate that I lost my passion to do what I like because of that mistake. At this point I just hate myself. Yeah, there's lots of hate going on and I'm really sorry if this worsens anyone's mood. I'm just so tired, and I don't know if my mind is making my body tired or if my body makes my mind tired or if it's both. I'm not making much sense, I'm just writing rubbish right now, just writing what I feel. Complete exhaustion.   
I wish I wasn't such a whiny baby and I wish I wasn't this weak. I wish I could be cool and calculated instead of ""bubbly  and cute"". Not being taken seriously by people really takes a toll on me as I have massive inferiority issues, and the fact that none of what I say gets taken seriously or in calculation just worsens my state.   
I just don't know what to do, I wish there was a painless suicide method so I can just ""go to sleep"". The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I'm a baby and I'm terrified of pain or a failure that could lead to a potential painful life.

I've had years of on off depression, it always manages to come back when I think I'm feeling alright. Anyway recent events that I've been inviting some friends to cause I figure, hey they like this and so do I, let's give it a shot. Well I feel like they've been avoiding it in someway, whether active or not, not too sure on how to explain it, but planning other things over it and sidelining it. For reference it's a local competitive scene for smash, and I give a good amount of advance notice. I can understand if it's not their thing but one said they were super keen to get into it. This is really just one example, cause I've just felt more and more distant from them as well, I try to spend time with them, we're all at uni second year (I'm doing electronic engineering so my time is pretty packed) and I have very poor messaging habits in that I forget. I also feel like I belong less and less or that I have less to say when I'm with friends. 

Sorry if this is rather all over the place, it's my immediate thoughts that I'm so lost on. I get that weird empty/sad feeling that I've never known how to describe about it. 

Mid tri break is coming up soon so I'm gonna try catch up with them. There are big group get together that happen regularly that I've been going less and less to as I feel more distant or uncomfortable. Uncomfortable may be the wrong word.

An estimated 2.4 million people in the United States abuse prescription painkillers, and almost half a million people suffer from heroin abuse.1 But people abusing opioids also often face the additional burden of depression.

The relationship between opioid abuse and depression is bi-directional, meaning that suffering from one increases the risk of the other. Opioid abuse is defined as using a prescription opioid for non-medical reasons or using it longer or in greater amounts than what was prescribed by a doctor, and opioid abuse has been linked to higher rates of [depression](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.html), [anxiety](https://www.psycom.net/bookstore.anxiety.html), and [bipolar disorders](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.bipolar.html).

20,"Hello all, I'll try to keep it short and to the point.

My boyfriend and I live together. He struggles with depression and lately it feels like it has been worse than usual. For example, I go to work before he is awake and when I get home he is often still in bed, or if he's out of bed he hasn't gotten dressed/showered or even made anything to eat. 

I try to be supportive by picking up some of the household slack (grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning) when he's having low days/weeks but sometimes I worry that by doing these things I am enabling him to do nothing. 

So I guess my question is what has your experience been?
Is there anything that people have done that has helped you? Or what ""help"" have you received that actually hindered you?

A friend of mine is always sympathetic and I didn't really realize until looking up the definition why her words felt so distant and unmeaningful. Know the difference so you can support your loved ones! Empathy  typically provides far more support and healing for a person than sympathy does. Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, ""how can I help you?"" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, ""I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?"" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot. Words are powerful so know how your support influences those  around you, even the slightest change of words can make a major difference in a friend's life.",09Apr2019,1
23,"Advice would be amazing but this kinda feels like a rant too?

So I haven’t been to therapy since I was a kid. Mom made me go. Now decades later, I’ve been really burned out due to recent life events. I feel like a car that only ever gets a couple of bucks in the tank, never full, always running on fumes. I’m having issues sorting through life stuffs because it takes energy that I don’t have and this makes me just want to do is crawl into a hole and pull it in after me. (Suicide isn’t a thought so don’t misinterpret.) So I take a friends suggestion, and get a session scheduled. 

I don’t personally feel like 45 minutes is an acceptable “first session.” There’s to much to cover. You’re bringing a COMPLETE STRANGER into the fold. They don’t know anything about you. Thoughts, feelings, standards, scale, reactions, traumas, nothing. Anyway, like most people I assume, I told her I didn’t know where to start. She said throw it all about there and I’ll sort it. Okay cool! I lay everything out, as honestly as I can. Job stuffs (stress/working night shift,) life, sex life, social avoidance and lack of energy to do any of it. It’s just a snippet and I know I don’t have enough time to delve into how all this crap is connected. So I try to be as blunt as possible. 

Her advice at the end of everything was to get a groupon and go do something fun. Go find my “purpose.” I left feeling ... defeated. 

How the actual fuck am I supposed to go do shit when I just got done telling you that I don’t like people, don’t have enough gas in my tank (ever!) and don’t have the money to spend? Why do I feel like I wasted my time and got nothing out of it? It’s been a few weeks and I tried to sort it out, and have switched back to day-shift (on my days off) because I was planning to anyway. Even with going out and doing activities I don’t feel any different. I’m happy-ish when I’m doing stuff but still feel like I’ve got nothing to give. And whenever I think about her advice it pisses me off with a quickness. 

I can’t tell if I’m way off base, justifiably annoyed or getting in my own way... but fuck it, if I’m going to tell a complete stranger all my woes why not the strangers on the internet too? Suggestions? Thoughts? Wrong sub?",09Apr2019,1

To combat my obesity, I am taking Saxenda injections and am slowly losing the weight however my depression/BP disorder is back in full swing. I've started seeing a Psychologist that does not champion for medication because he said it dulls your emotions making it difficult treat past traumas. Now my family doctor has referred me to a Psychiatrist and she would like me to try taking Effexor along with Seroquel.

I'm completely at a loss and am afraid to try another medication because I absolutely refuse to gain more weight.",09Apr2019,3

27,"Hey guys, it's starting to get warm outside and I'm emerging out of a really long and hard winter. Had a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder w/ borderline tendencies. I had a brutal downturn around last December where I was absorbing a lot of psychological abuse from my boss and had an acrimonious breakup that shattered my sense of self-worth. I had a phase in early/midwinter where just thinking about my boss or my ex would send me into rage spirals that would quickly escalate into catastrophic anger and sadness. I don't know how to describe it. The anger was very all-consuming and would usually end in me feeling defeated and exhausted or stuffing my feelings with drugs and alcohol because it felt so unbearable to deal with. Gradually, the anger just dissipated into melancholia. I've gone through three jobs since February (two of which I quit very quickly because they were both making me even more miserable) and in between jobs there have been days and even weeks when I didn't get out of bed.

So recently I got a new job that's a better environment for me (not really in-line with my long-term goals, but I need the money). I can walk to work, and it's getting warm outside. I had hoped that the sunlight and the reason to get up in the morning would jump-start my system and shake me out of my funk instantly, but it hasn't happened that easily. Shocking, I know. My question is, what do you guys do when you're healing that gives you a sense of purpose? What routines, habits, affirmations do you rely on to help you put one foot in front of the other? I need more focus, more forward momentum in my life. I'm better than I was but still not far enough from the wreck that I was for months. Most days I still feel very sensitive, anxious, and unhappy, unable to concentrate or sit still comfortably and accomplish things that might fulfill me. Right now I'm mostly a catatonic shut-in who rarely does anything and spends hours fretting anxiously over small tasks. I really miss being my best self. Does anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences?",09Apr2019,1
28,"Hi,

I broke up with my GF a about a months ago, she was dealing with depression and she hurt me with some of the things she did, mentally. She lost her Dad due to cancer and we both watched him die, his last breath, you could see how the light went out. She had nightmares and I stood by her side and held her hand. I truly loved her. She got help and got onto medicine and I was so proud of her but she was never the same really. We had our good moments, the majority were good, but the bad moments I just can't forget and forgive, which is why I broke up with her. It was hard to watch her actions and her excuses for doing them, and so long I tried to tell myself this is due to depression but is it? It felt like she stopped loving me fully, with little moments of clarity here and there. I have not lost anybody important to me due to death, but it feels like I lost her due to depression. When I asked for her help or I needed her it felt like I was putting her under pressure, I couldn't have discussion about the relationship or what hurt me, her reasoning for doing those things was always it makes her happy, She said, ""I am not here to make you happy and feel better"". To a certain degree I get it, but it still hurts. Maybe I was too needy. I googled so much about depression. The worst times were when she drank. I tried telling her that she shouldn't drink while taking anti depressants. The worst was when she almost accidentally killed herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I try telling myself everyday to remember the dead, but live for the living but I don't feel it anymore. My Mom left me during times of many operations and medical issues to go out and party with friends, I never knew who her boyfriend was in the moment, different places and face. This was when I was a kid, and it feels just like what  my girlfriend did to me, my now ex but still feel for and worry about is doing the same. Am I not lovable? Why, when I talk in real life, to people I care about and would do anything for, why won't they listen, am I being self centered?

&amp;#x200B;

I know people are of there own mind, and I know it hard to define what's right and wrong, but is it really?

&amp;#x200B;

My Mom once told me, she was thinking about drowning us both due to my issues, well I am pretty proud of myself for what I have done due to my Dad, and me.  Even with all my medical issues I still get up everyday and make my bed and give others love, why is it so hard 

&amp;#x200B;

So many people have hurt me, but maybe I am not looking at them fair enough? I don't know. I just don't know and I want to laugh again, from the heart and love again from the heart, but really what's the point? Hate seems to always win, it feels like it is the stronger force in the universe. Darkness, hate and pointlessness.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go see a doctor, since I barley have any free time. I go to dialysis 3 x a week, which adds up to about 20 hours a week just doing that, I work 10 hours a day and I just can't stand hospitals or offices anymore

Life is hard, I do love life. It is so very special. But it feels like with the ability to feel and think, the ability to love and appreciate, comes a dark side to humans that feels so dominate. I am just rambling and I am sorry. Today was a hard day. Tomorrow is a new one.",09Apr2019,3
29,"I cut ties with my parents a year ago, and have been working as a pharmacy clerk for the past two months to financially support myself. I have had trouble getting up on time for work almost once every week, and it has been problematic. They are understaffed at work, and have put a lot of responsibility on me when I started with zero experience in January. I’m having trouble dealing with the stress, so I haven’t been to work in a few days. I’ve decided to quit, but I don’t know what else to do with my life. I was in college for two years, then took a year off after cutting ties to figure out what I wanted to do. I still don’t know what I want to do. I take Bupropion 350mg and Trintellex 10mg. I engage in therapy through Better Help. My medical expenses are near or equal to my rent. I can’t seem to feel interested in most activities. I just want to love one aspect of my life enough that I can at least get out of bed for one thing every day.",09Apr2019,2
30," 

I have a few close women in my life. Sometimes we're BF/GF, sometimes we're FWB, sometimes we're just friends.

I am at a point where I am beginning to realize that my depressive episodes are almost directly tied to having an intimate relationship with someone. And by intimate, I don't necessarily mean sex, but holding each other, having deep conversations, feeling deeply cared for, etc.

When I say directly tied, I mean that if I get to a point where that's not available to me (say we get into a disagreement and don't talk for a few days) I instantly go into a classic depressive state. Can't focus, loss of interest, deep sadness, crying, the whole bit.

And the instant they come back into my life, I automatically feel normal. It's a drug.

I am a social person, have friends, a good job, degrees, hobbies, family, etc. but none of that helps me overcome this. One night stands don't help so it's not really a function of simply not wanting to be alone. It's only this one specific drug that fixes thing.

I know fundamentally this isn't healthy. I have to be comfortable and happy with myself. My therapist and I have discussed this to no end. My life outside of this looks very normal and successful so it's been a struggle to connect the dots so am hoping this post can help.

Has anyone experienced this?",09Apr2019,9

34,"There sometimes I manage to motivate myself to think positively about it, like the feeling I'm felt then is not exclusive in the past, but I can still have this feeling today,but keep forgetting, and start becoming sad about  not being a kid anymore. I feel like my anxieties wasn't so notisable then, and I didn't have so much to think about. Think a psychologist said that my my brain was is developing slowlier that normal so I might feel like I'm younger that I am. That might be a reason why feel this.

35,"My life is in shambles now - I can take one bad thing at a time but these days things seem to go awry altogether. The worst thing is, my problems are not circumstantial or temporary - I don't see a brighter future for it. 

1. At the start of the year, my relationship with my boss went downhill and our arguments (mostly him giving unsolicited advise about my personality, my clothes, my face that I think could qualify as bullying) culminated into a public quarrel where he told me to be more likeable in front of my colleagues.
2. I used to find joy or hope in new projects and tended to overlook these hiccups in our relationship, but these days even an exciting project does not make me feel better.
3. Because my work life is so depressing, I look for comfort in fast dating aka Tinder dates. What are the chances that I ended up with a guy who is not a straightforward fuckboy but likes to play with my emotion. Probably he is just a polite fuckboy who would take the extra mile to convince me to sleep with him (like buying me flowers, going star gazing, saying good things about me and is ok with me being a virgin) but I must say by starting this as a way to distract myself from work stress, I ended up in deeper shit because I feel so disrespected, disappointed and sad.

36,Ok I’m not really sure where to put this so I thought I would try here any advice on how to help with the situation would be greatly appreciated. So I met a friend online and we’ve been close for a year and I love her so much are care a lot about her well being. So this is where the problem comes in. Her ex friend manipulated her so much and laid down some rules that she had to follow and if those rules were broken she would have to self harm herself which was so upsetting to hear when she opened up about it. So eventually she got rid of this friend and we thought the problem was resolved she stopped talking and I didn’t have any problems with this ex friend until recently. The ex friend has made several accounts trying to ruin my friends life sending around photos of her that my friend was manipulated into sending to her and if she didn’t send the photos her friend would harm herself. This ex friend continues to make these fake accounts and tell my friend to hurt herself that she’s going to make her kill herself etc. and I feel completely lost and don’t know how to stop it all. It’s makes me so angry and I’ve tried so much but everything I have tried the ex friend has found out about and threatens my friend. So please any help on how I can handle this situation would be great. (Extremely sorry if this is not the place to post this and I will take it down when requested),09Apr2019,1

When I wake up, it's painful. My mother looks bad because of me, but I know she wants me better. The past hurts too much, it really hurts. I have been away from morphia for two years, since a very special person died, but I was ungrateful, as always, with her.

lately I want to sleep and nobody understands the reason. I think about canceling my life with morphine, lying down and rotting. I can not feel anything but fear, guilt and sadness.

and some say drugs are for the weak. Well, I'm human, and it hurts. I want you to stop.",09Apr2019,1
38,"(I apologize in advance if ive written something wrong or formatted it wrong or done something wrong in general. I'm rather new to the subreddit, so thank you for your patience)

My depression used to be much worse than this and I'm thankful that I'm slowly reaching the 'okay' stage. I went to therapy, I see my doctor regularly, and found myself someone to confide in. I've gotten to a mental place where, if I try hard enough, I can actually take care of myself pretty decently. 

I was told the next step was to start getting healthy (as I mostly ate insta noodles and occasionally walk up my stairs). So I did. Last month, I started to take every Sunday to plan my week of meals with my confident. I started eating healthy and going for walks. 

But my problem is, I dont feel any different. On the contrary, it feels like I'm slumping back down a hill again. Once again, getting out of bed feels like I'm walking to the gallows, living feels like a chore more than a requirement, and all my progress seems to be slipping through my fingers. Should I give it more time? Should I take it slower?",09Apr2019,1
