3,"After 2 years for severe depression, and denial of said depression, I decided to try to use all the tools I've gained from therapy and pop psych.

Part of me is getting worried since I've been relatively okay since 2019 started.  Bit of sadness, self hate and regret crept in.  Thinking of ways I could've been a better daughter to my dying mother, and sister to my dying brother, and friend to my dying ex-boyfriend and more attentive to my dying father...I was able to force myself out of that doom and remember all I did do.  I forced myself to remember what friends, family, co-workers, and other people said about my devotion and love.

My depression is such a playful, cruel and smart bitch.  It's fucking exhausting to battle that cunning cuntface.

Just want to encourage everyone here to keep up the fight.  Be in your own corner.  

Take care all.

I feel the allowance of an escape route through suffering conscious outlaws. I feel that this is wrong but right. I feel that this is all that could have been because of gods infinitude. Perhaps its a stage within infinite differentiation. Perhaps not. In all i am very angry that nothing is impossible. I fear that there is no true escape because even if i validate god by being my best self i invalidate free will and validate a simulated universe and the idea that god is escaping his own infinitude through unconsciousness, either through a simulated overcoming or a simulated universe with mostly suffering.",23Jan2019,1

I had a consultation with my new psychiatrist via his intake person and she said he would call me to set up an appointment and he still hasn't done it so I feel like an idiot for waiting around until this has nearly become a crisis.

Anyway, we were at an amusement park a few days ago and I was feeling really good for a while until I got some nasty text from someone and it spiraled into a depressive mood. In hopes of preserving everyone else’s joy, I shrugged it off as being tired, but afterwards I told him what really was up and he told me that next time I’m sad I either text/tell him because he doesn’t want me experiencing the sadness alone (I’m pretty comfortable telling him that’s not the issue) I just feel really bad for I guess talking to him about it because it feels like I’m “using” him or putting my baggage on him.... any advice?

Why do we live in a world that is currently being invaded with the trend that having depression is cute?

Listen.

There is nothing cute about having depression. There is nothing cute about not wanting to face your reflection in the mirror because then you'd have to stare right into the eyes of the vital force causing the agony in your mind. 

There is nothing cute about being absorbed by the constant fantasy of how you'd make your own heart stop pumping life through your veins, veins filled  with rue and failure.

There is nothing cute about despising every inch of your body, every blood cell, every particle, until the hate consumes you and all that's left is an empty shell in the form of a human body, completely stripped of anything that makes you feel alive.


There is nothing cute about being overwhelmed by the deafening silence in your head, screaming gloom-ridden words, echoing out of the deepest, darkest corners of your mind.

There is nothing cute about having a pernicious influence over yourself just so you can feel something closely resembling being alive, because feeling pain is better than feeling nothing at all.

There is nothing cute about being so devoted to your despondency that it ends up defining who you are and along the way you lose who you were supposed to be. Who you wanted to be. And all you do now is look at yourself with contempt.

9,"I have a dog named Jesse McCree (Yep I named her after the cowboy). I’ve had her for a year and she’s the most loving pup ever. I raised her to be the most cuddly, sweetest girl ever. I got her during some tough times where I was always drinking and smoking because I wanted to stop feeling. At that time I was in a very abusive relationship where my boyfriend at the time was verbally abusive and was constantly telling me I was the weakest and worst man he had ever dated. Why didn’t break up with him? I was a fool and in love. I eventually broke up with him but it was all thanks to my pup. Her little face and her loving attitude helped me see I deserved better and that I was someone worth loving. I didn’t need that guy, I had Jesse who loved me and enjoyed my presence. Now I’m dating an amazing girl and our one year anniversary is tomorrow. 
Some financial things came up and I had to move out of my apartment and into my parent’s home. Where I could not have dogs. My friend was willing to keep her at her place and I constantly go visit her and she’s happy. But now my friend is telling me she can’t keep her there and there’s no way I can find a place where I could keep her and no one else I know can take her in. So now I have no choice but to it her up for adoption. It hurts me and I’ve been crying for two days. She’s my world and I know she considers me hers. I feel like I failed her and that I’m a horrible father. There’s going to be a day where she’s going to be away from me and she will never know why.

I started to develop mental health issues like anxiety and fear for future. Then i somehow got myself feel better about myself. Recently i went to a marraige, there everyone respects her because she studies medicine and a guy even used me to get close to her.

They are haunting me now and i feel like a waste of space, the only reason that i am alive is for my dad but i can't tell him these things cause he will get sad. When in problem, people run to their mother but when i get any problems i want to hide it from my mom in all ways cause i am scared that she will mock me or shame me instead of showing me ways to overcome my problems

Colleague said yes. 
Gentleman arrives, just checked in. 
Appears drunk, 
Advised him were his room was, asked me to show him.
Did but cautious about my wellbeing. 
Made a few comments that as somebody who’s suffered with depression, noticed as sinister. 
I.e about the view outside the window. Wished he could appreciate them but not feeling so well. And so on. 

Arrived at door, tried to leave, guest got upset and mentioned he was an alcoholic and had relapsed. He knows it’s no good for him and he’s been for help in rehab three times but nothing worked. 
Advised him that he’s obviously well enough to understand this isn’t going to be good for him drinking (the huge crate of corona he has in his bag). 
Advised him to get help. 
Cautious that I didn’t want to be left alone as he entered the room and started pacing, though he was gentle enough to say, when I have to think, I walk but don’t be alarmed. 

On edge this gentleman, 
I don’t feel right.

Gentleman asked me not to tell anyone, 
Passed on word to management against his word (sorry) that I was concerned. 

They said they’ve experienced a lot of guests that have too much to drink and open up but they’re always ok. 

The man said to me that somebody in his family has done something really horrible to him and he has nobody. 

Stuck, I worry and I feel like this man needs help or advice that I don’t have knowledge in to offer.

16,"I’ve suffered depression for about 6 years now and before I injured my knee at work, everything seemed to be ok.

But ever since, I’ve felt hopeless. I’m slowly recovering from a snapped Patella (knee cap) which sits very high in my knee and grinds against both my patella tendon and my femur. I was on crutches for a month and went from working full time to needing help standing up from chairs and getting into my car. 

I do physiotherapy and muscle strengthening pilates every week, and do little exercises everyday as told to by my physiotherapist, but progress is slow, painful and frustrating. Somedays I am constantly pushing through a dull pain and some I struggle to get around in absolute agony.

I know there’s not much more I can do to speed up the progress of my recovery, but I cant help but feel helpless and frustrated on days I’m struggling. I’m a very independent person and hate when people treat me differently when they find out I’m injured or see that I’m struggling. If I need help I ask for it, and I’m not scared of admitting that there are many times I need help, but sometimes its tiring to tell people exactly whats going on that day with my pain.

I started to talk with someone who's called Sayori on Youtube. Then she talks to me on Twitter and she introduced herself: Bea, from Italy, and she has the same depression as me, but with a little different story. Dont worry Bea, you can still be Sayori on YouTube.

I think about Sayori again, even in School, because i have a friend who always become nice to me. Now i had another dream, and i do what i do:

Im on the Same Café like the last dream, this time im talking with Bea in front of me. In my mind, Bea have brown short hair and she's wearing a Pink t-shirt and blue jeans. Both are talking about our depression, because we have the same depression, like good friends. I ordered some pancakes, and she ordered An omelette. When we are just talking, someone just called me, and the voice was familiar... Crap. Is Sayori again: ""heyy..... Wait... No.... No.... Why her?"". She points to Bea, and now i know what she's talking about... What she's thinking!? Sayori just take my hand and pulls me back of the café; then she started to cry: ""you don't know how much i love you... All... All i want is to stay with you... Please.... Your smile makes me happy"". I don't have any words. I don't have any option. If i need to be Heartless, even if i don't like to be, i will be: ""Please Sayori... GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!! You're always there, and you always want my attention to you!, but all i want is to forget her FOREVER!!! Get out of my life!!! You will make things worse!"" Suddenly, she got close to me and we saw our eyes. Her eyes are full of tears, and all around her face: ""if you don't love me... Or if i made something that makes you feel bad, i will solve it with this."" She put her hands to my chest and got closer to me... She closes her eyes and... She kisses me... No... No! I pushed her: ""that would make worse... YOU ARE NOT REAL!!! don't you get it!? What i need to do so you can leave me in peace? End myself? Or end me? What? What else i need to do if i need to end you!? WHY YOU LOVE ME WHEN YOU AREN'T REAL!!??"". I let all my anger. She started to cry and she makes a back step. I sigh: ""all i want is forget all about you. You made me this way, and now i will do something i need to do one day..."" I put my hand to my pocket... Wait? What? I can't found it. Then i see Sayori again. She has it: ""you're talking about this?"" She has the gun: ""Why you want to kill me? You hate me? All i want is to make you happy."" I sigh again: ""just go. I don't want you here in my dreams again. Being alone makes me happy."". She dropped the gun and put her head to my chest: ""all i want is to spend more time with you!!! I love you, i want to stay with you forever!"". Im so sorry what would happen next: ""get out of my head. Find another one, that would make my life better."" She punches my chest. Ow? : ""No! I can't replace you!!! People aren't like you!!! You're the only one i care about you!!!"". I need to end this, but i dont know how..... I have it: ""i can't feel love and i dont want to. I will never find true love"". Then she saw to me: ""im here for you. I want to make people happy, but i want to make you more happy"". She's saying her feelings... I can resist to this: ""Make other people happy, you are not making me hap-"" she kissed me again...: ""you're the only one who i love. I love you"". That.... Words... Are...making...me...feel... No: ""please stop"". She put her arms around me: ""if i let you go, i will die!!!"". Wait.: ""you can't die. You aren't real"". ""Of course i am. I see your Youtube replies and you need me. I want to make you happy forever"". I can't resist to my anger: ""if you want to make me happy, get the HELL out of my (censored) MIND!!!! You're making me sick!!!"". She kisses me again, this time she made it during like 10 seconds, and then she pulls me, because she needs to breathe: ""that never works... ""

So i said something in spanish, so i translated down

Spanish: ""Nunca supe que tus besos matan""

English: ""i never know your kisses kills""

Then i enter the café, leaving her outside, and i see bea, using the phone: ""hey Bea, i need to go home, if i bother you"" i take my stuff and i walk home faster: ""i hope she's not following me"" i turn back and i see Sayori. Great. I run faster to go home and enter. I did it, i go home, i close it and locked it... Then all turns dark... I wake up.

Ok... Now the story begins...",23Jan2019,1
18,"When it comes to feeling suicidal, Ive found that there are three feelings that contribute most:

1. Feeling unsafe (physically, yes. But mostly in an abstract sense in the world) 

2. Feeling unloved or unprotected 

3. Feeling unsuccessful and/or disappointed.  

I think it can help to pause and think about how these feelings individually contribute to our depression, and then do our best to put these feelings into perspective in the world, realizing that we are capable of getting rid of these feelings and having a different reality. ",23Jan2019,1

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn’t make the decision to seek help.

I was wondering if anyone have any advice you would like to share.

My mother in law has suffered from depression for a really really long time, she had post natal depression twice with both her boys (I'm married to her youngest son) and years ago she was diagnosed with cancer and she was going through a long period of depression where she found out she had cancer, her father had also passed away during this period and every year she will have 2 bouts of depression which lasts a month or 2.

She struggles to get up in the morning she can't get out of bed and she is shaking constantly and can't find a purpose to get out of bed. She has loads of grandkids which she loves so much but when she is down she just loses all hope and is not herself at all. I love my mother in law to death and I just want to be able to help her, even if it is something small. 

She comes to our house so she can have a vent and just speak how she feels because with her husband she feels like she can't be herself and has to watch what she says but with me she knows I won't say a thing and everytime she is down we just sit down have a cuppa and let her vent and moan about it cause it makes her feel that bit better. 

If you have any advice I would really appreciate it,

34,"Last year I was working as a receptionist in an industry that I had worked my way from a commissioned sales person to the Director of Administration and Operations, but I lost that position years ago.  I found out when you work for a corporation that number #1 part of your job is to keep your mouth shut!!  I lost my job, because I reported someone who admittedly sexually harassed my staff.  I got two weeks pay and a non-disclosure to go away quietly.

I took another job and was fired over an email, because my boss forgot that I was on vacation, so I walked away from an office job and became a self employed person, working at night, just making it paycheck to paycheck.  For five years I did that until a Supervisor from my prior life contacted me about another office job.  So office to the office I go!  I watched a supervisor verbally harass staff, get into a physical altercation with another, all while I quietly kept my mouth shut and just did my job.   I resigned from there after being bullied by the sales staff, one an overzealous Christian and her politically supporting supervisor.  Neither of which I chose to separate myself for, I didn't select either program, not religion or politics, I love people for being people not the label they carry around.  My resignation paper came days after being told that I was to have no opinion in the office after the Presidential election I resigned to move to what is considered the ""best in the business"" in the area.

I interviewed with the nicest person in the world!!!  The GM came in during the interview to say that she was excited that I may be coming to work for them, she was a former manager from the first corporation.  I was the receptionist and loved what I was doing!!!   The sales staff was amazing and the support staff were great people, but the administrative staff that I worked with were not as friendly and was held at the beckon call of the Supervisor and their friend.   Long story short, I fit in with everyone, except the people that I worked with, my boss didn't like me.  The owner telling me to find a new job, but the GM telling me to hold tight and he would change his mind after he sees how good my work was - that was a LIE!

In June 2018, I took my first 2 days vacation after working there for eleven months to take my grandson out for his big 5th birthday.  After his homemade cake created birthday party his mom left him, that was a Thursday.  :(  The following Monday I returned to work and opened the building with the HR manager and told her what was going on and told her that I was thinking about filing for custody of my grandson, who had now been abandoned in my care, and she told me that it was an excellent and responsible thing to do.  When everyone came in for the day I went to see the GM, because at this point my boss hadn't spoken to me in weeks, to tell her the situation and inform her that I was going to the courthouse at lunch time.  It didn't go as well as planned and the reply came ""You will have plenty of time, because they are laying you off today.""  Just like that I lost my income and now custody gets put on the back burner, because I can't show that I can support him.

My self esteem crushed and my finances battered, I have never asked for a thing!!!

I have attended unemployment workshops, where I found that the felons in the state are getting more help than a person that has been working their entire life with no charges.  There is no individualized service and no one cares about YOUR particular situation.  You are heard in and out of the office like sheep and while you are there they tell you how to lie on a resume and how to fake your way through the interview process.  The more time spent behind bars, the greater the assistance they have to provide. 

I have applied for food stamps assistance, only to get a letter that says that I am not eligible, but they didn't include anything about my grandson on the letter.   Another agency that held a group meeting, herded in and herded out, but not one person has cared to listen to my situation alone HELP me with it.

I have fallen behind on my rent and asked my landlord to work with my on the arrears while I  work on catching up and I have given up with trying to rebuild the credit that I was working to obtain.   Yet, there is no where to turn for any answers or any help.  

I have fallen into a pit a depression, but not anger or regret.  I know that I am better than what I have become, but can find no assistance to get out.   I know that I can be so much more than I am, but I have not been given the opportunity.  

I am really mentally beaten and can't force myself back into the office work environment.  This last incident really taking a striking blow to my self esteem and my feeling of worth in the world.  I instead took to driving, using a car with 180,000 miles that I need to rely on for my daily life, working around the school schedule of the child that I am responsible for.  This week the weather and my car have failed me in helping me to make any money, on a week where everyone has their hand out asking.

Recently,  I have seen so many instances of people stepping up to help people that have been working for free, slaving for the system that they believe in.  Is there any help for people that are real and just having a hard time?   Help for people that are just in a bad situation?  Is there help for the people who have been beaten down and are just trying to find their way back up?

Is there anyone that can give some advice?   

Am I really depressed or an I just conditioned to repeatedly fail in life?",23Jan2019,1
35,I've been having days and even weeks where I dont have the will to do anything. In fact writing this is the most will I've had to do anything besides feeding myself and going to the bathroom. It used to not be this bad when I had a job after I got fired for no fault of my own back in September it's been difficult to find a new job and i would get call backs but nothing to set up an interview. I live in Fresno CA and you would think that finding a job would be easy. You see places hiring everywhere but nothing comes from it. I've applied to places that takes in anyone and i couldn't even get a call back. I cant try streaming or YouTube because i dont have the money to start and late last year I was forced to sell most of my games. I just feel like there is no where for me to go and I feel like I failed my husband who is paying for everything right now. Rent is half his monthly paycheck and our other Bill's take the majority of what's left. To make matters worse our rent is going up next month when we have to renew our lease. With all this going on I just feel empty and the only thing I have that still makes me happy is a biweekly DnD game i play.,23Jan2019,1
36,"Hi there. I don’t really feel sad but instead I always feel angry and irritated as in the smallest things like a door not closing properly or my dad saying something to me annoys me. I don’t have massive anger fits and it’s usually just a punch of a pillow or a cuss. But I feel it all the time. I’m unsure if this is depression at all, I do posses other symptoms I think such as changing in sleeping patterns, I find it hard to sleep and have real trouble getting out of bed in the morning, I have lost interest in things previously that brought my joy like playing video games, I also think about death a lot, never actually about killing myself. More about the impact it would have if I did die or my family died etc. I also have a lack of concentration with me having a very short attention span and not being able to sit still when in class by constantly tapping my foot and/or spinning a pen. I don’t suffer from any appetite changes though. I’m wondering if wether this could be considered some sort of depression and if I should seek help, tell my parents etc or if I’m just experiencing a temporary problem and it’ll sort itself out. But I have had these feelings for a good year now and have repressed them, but the anger aspect is starting to get unbearable. Thank you.",23Jan2019,1
37,"I spent most of 2018 in self-destructive, suicidal depression. I got help, and I *think* I'm in the clear. But now here I am, trying to understand what ""happy"" and ""love"" are supposed to feel like, as if I never understood in the first place. I don't really recognise myself anymore, let alone my emotions. everything in my life is going really good right now, but I'm not ""enjoying"" it. I'm starting to wonder if some part of me just finally broke. To the point where I just feel nothing. Or maybe I'm feeling too much to understand. I'm not sure. But I do know that this Reddit has been there for me in ways that no one ever could. I could really use some help if anyone has any idea what this means, or can relate. ",23Jan2019,1
38,"I just feel lonely all the time, I'm a nice guy I know it, I help others without expecting any reward but when I actually try to talk about my problems im either ignored or they flip the table and I'm back to helping them. 

I have no problem talking with women or anything like that, I don't think I have anxiety besides the occasional panic attack. I might have depression but I'm afraid to go anywhere without being a burden to anyone.

I've been rejected, catfished (this one hurt a lot since the person was actually pretending to be interested) and  stood up 3 times in the last 4 months 

Everyone tells me ""you look tired"" I'm not tired im sad",23Jan2019,1

40,"Hey y‘all, I‘m new here and I hope someone can help me with some advice in my situation.
My boyfriend has probebly anxiety and deals with depression for many years on his own. (No diagnose)
Things getting a little better he‘s willing to see things difrently and perhaps goes to a dayclinic in the next few month.
The problem is that I can‘t deal with his illness and making things worse for years now instead of helping him. After many discussions and hours of talking over the last few years and specialy the last 2 month, we are very sure that I have ADHD and a addiction to drama. (I have an oppointment in a ADHD Clinic to check it in march).
Things would be so much better and easier if I would stop fighting with him over everything. Even if he simply get upset over an videogame I panic and make things the worst. We talk so much and I now what to do in my head in clear moments but those moments are to rare. So my focus is to stop fighting because I know that this is the worst out of everything for him.
He did so much for me and he has nobody accept me, not even his parents (they don’t get it and take him as sirusly as he needed) and no friends, so I ask you for help, how I stop fighting and argumenting over everything. I can‘t stay crtismis and are always nervus and try to defend myself even if I did a misstake. He baged me to stop fighting but I do it again and again. Please help he deserve better then this treat of mine.
Thanks &lt;3

41,"I'm between jobs and have been in a real depressive slump the past few months. I decided to help myself by signing up to join a choral group, as singing used to be a passion of mine, and the first rehearsal starts tonight. However, the past couple of days my symptoms have been really bad (feeling low, sluggish, barely got out of bed, and I'm completely dissociated) and I am having a very hard time working up the will to leave the house. On one hand I think that joining this choral group could be really good for me, but on the other hand I'm not sure what to expect when I show up there/interacting with new people, and since I am feeling very dissociated I'm worried that I will come across as pathetic and insecure, or as a weird zombie. Plus, it's dark and cold out and I just want to sit by my space heater and have zero human interaction for the night, but I've been doing that all week and it's probably not good for me, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in situations like this is it better to force myself to do what my rational self believes is best, or do I give in to my depressed self's yearning for solitude? What do you think? ",23Jan2019,1
42,"I'm considering trying cannabis not recreationally, but to deal with two very persistent symptoms of depression that haven't responded well to what my psychiatrist has been prescribing over the course of about 4 years. Also I live in California where cannabis can be sold recreationally. I have almost unbearable anhedonia and am emotionally numb. Today at my therapist's office I broke down because I remembered what I was like before that depressive episode that ruined my life: I could be happy, and enjoy things, and experience joy. I've never been able to feel anything close to that for 4 years and I'm starting to lose hope that things will get better. Sometimes cannabis has helped a little bit, and I wonder if maybe I'm more intentional about using it to treat my depression--maybe choosing the right method, right amount of THC/CBD, that maybe I could see some real improvement.

I really hope so because this medication-resistant anhedonia and emotional numbness has got me at my wits end. If cannabis doesn't work I'm going to seriously consider micro-dosing with psychedelics or ketamine or electro-shock therapy or see if I can get one of those magnetic brain implant thingies.

So for people who've used cannabis to treat depression symptoms with some level of success, what symptoms did it treat? How well? Did you smoke it ore use edibles or some sort of pill or whatever? Was it THC or CBD that was more helpful?",23Jan2019,1
