0,I just started scratching my face against several things until my cheek bleeded. Sometimes I wish I could erase my face and identity and disappear from the people around me never to be seen again. Do I need help or am I just an idiot craving for attention?,10Jun2019,2
1,Normally on the weekend I feel ok but now I still feel exhausted. Even typing this is hard. Caffeine just makes me jittery. I just want to sleep.,10Jun2019,63

3,"So, I’ve had mental issues for about 7 years now and it hasn’t gotten any better. I’ve tried every option of help, exercise, antidepressants, therapy and counselling and none of them have worked. I’ve been through so much harassment and bullying, going through an abusive relationship that I got out of. Nobody likes me either, I’m a complete outcast and beyond lonely. I contemplate suicide all the time and cry myself to sleep because I’m so alone. I’m not sure how long I can do this anymore. Nobody is supporting me even when I’m so miserable, they just ignore me non stop. I tried to start dating again because being in a relationship actually gave me something to live for but so far I’m unsuccessful because I look horrible. I have no idea what to do or where to go. I have voices in my head insulting me and encouraging me to kill myself and they never stop. I’m addicted to alcohol and can’t put down the bottle. Does anyone have any ideas at all about what I can do?",10Jun2019,1
4,"I’ve never been a depressed person at all but everything is leaving my soul and I can feel it happening and there’s nothing I can do. My girlfriend sometimes comes across as rude and hateful to my family without meaning to, and my family thinks I’m in a bad relationship and won’t stop pestering me about moving on. 

They don’t understand that this girl is everything to me. She’s so good to me and she absolutely loves my family. I don’t know what to do. Nothing helps. Hopefully someone here can help me find something because I’m quite actually losing myself.",10Jun2019,3
5,My little 3 year old cousin just said i was his hero.  He’s such a nice kid and I don’t understand why he likes me. I haven’t done anything but avoid him. This scares me. I’ve been trying to push people away from me so if I do end up ending it I won’t hurt them as bad. The last thing I want is for someone to look up to me.,10Jun2019,2
6,"Just two days ago the third person in my family took their life. I’ve lost my Aunt and my two cousins. It hurts, it makes you feel like you’ve failed them. I’m a big advocate in suicide prevention but I missed the signs for someone close to me. 

I don’t think there’s any one specific program to help people. I just think it takes us all as a society to care about people. Life’s tough, there are horrible things that happen to us on a daily basis . Some people couldn’t even imagine what others go through and burdens they carry. I don’t know what it takes to save someone but I’ll try everything to let my family know I love them. To be there when I’m tired. To listen when my head is splitting from work. To do a better job of reaching out to every member of my family. 

Please if you’re thinking about taking your life call everyone in your contacts , call suicide hotline tel:1-800-273-8255 find a reason to push on. Bad times don’t last forever. I care about you all and if someone has any tips for looking out for your family I’m here to listen",10Jun2019,2
7,"I wish I didn’t fall for people so fast and I wish I could just be friends with people without “liking” them. It’s so hard on me and it’s because I’m always alone and I never communicate with anyone so any chance I get where someone takes the time to make me feel loved I fall for them. I hate myself for it and maybe if I wasn’t around I wouldn’t have to feel this way. Always I get turned down, because it’s creepy and then they move on. So I always fall deeper into the rabbit hole of depression the more I talk to them without being able to express my emotions without ruining what we already have. 

I’m depressed over everything and this is just another cherry on top stacked amongst other cherries that are making me feel like giving up. I wish I was normal so I didn’t love everyone who takes the time to care about me. I wish I wasn’t around to hurt anyone.",10Jun2019,2
8,"I get this way when I get really upset about something. 

Some friends of my boyfriend were making fun of me and saying really hurtful things about his “new life” with my children and I. They really poked fun at me and how he shouldn’t have to have new responsibilities, yet he chose to be with me. Never said he didn’t want to be. Shows me love constantly. Supports me, etc. no issues with us. And they kept saying things like “tell (my name) to stop texting from your phone” and “did your girlfriend approve your messages being sent?”  I didn’t look he showed me his phone. Never have I even taken his phone to text, I was shocked and confused where this came from, I thought his friends really liked me. It’s been a year my boyfriend and I have been dating. These texts all started because he was busy tonight with me running errands and couldn’t make it to his friends new house for a dinner. 

My boyfriend and I haven’t talked about it. Once I saw it I immediately got sick to my stomach and fell into depressive thoughts. Now my great weekend is ending with me in a massive funk. I am too embarrassed to talk to any of my few friends about this. So I came here. 

Thanks for listening. Sorry if it doesn’t make much sense.",10Jun2019,8
9,"I just stared at myself in the mirror for 20 minutes trying to figure out if this is really me, I thought about my life and it doesn’t even feel like mine I feel like I’m outside my body watching everything happen, even my name doesn’t feel like it’s mine, I just kept repeating “is this me?” “is this my life?” Nothing feels real",10Jun2019,10
10,"This weekend was so horrible, I did my best to act like I was perfectly happy but at night the smallest things broke me, tonight it was 2 words that absolutely crushed me, it hurts so much.

11,"I think, that happiness is the one and only thing that matters at the end of the day, and happiness is always achievable, no matter your situation, just like how sadness and frustration is always achievable, no matter your situation. That's why the misconceptions that poor people are less capable of happiness and that rich people aren't capable of sadness is one big misunderstanding. Humans are meant to adapt their feelings and bodies to their surroundings, so something that may seem like not that big of a deal to one person causes someone else lots of internal pain. It's never smart to say that they have nothing to cry about and for them to stop being such a baby. that's uninformed and moronic.",10Jun2019,1
12,"I don't really know how to begin since this is the first time I write about this so other maybe sees it.

I don't know what I want with my life or who I am anymore. I don't feel like I have an identity or a purpose what so ever. I feel like I am useless for everyone around me and annoying everyone.
Most of my friends like to party, get drunk and be loud sometimes. I can tolerate but sometimes it takes a toll on me. I can't handle loud music (especially if I can't control it or someone ignores me to turn it down), I have a hard time with drunks if I don't drink or if the drunks are old enough to be my parents. I kind of stopped going to them since it reminds me to much about my childhood. They know my problems and gives me space but I just feel like a burden to them.
The voices in my head just tells me that they are talking behind my back and telling my boyfriend he could do better and I am slowly believing the voices. I don't know what to do anymore and only hopes it gets better when I start my new job, maybe going to talk to someone with my first salary. I don't want to feel like this and I want to play games with them again. I just want to be normal, even though I never been..

13,"Hello everyone,

I am here just to share something that I have been through. It is not much, some of you guys maybe have more serious issues than I do. But I am not here to compare. Just share. This might be a little too long and I don’t expect all of you to read it, or anyone to tell the truth. I will just write things that are on my mind, on my chest.

I feel alone. Very much so.

I didn’t feel like this before as I have my parents and had some friends. Some girls, some boys. Never had a lover tough which is another topic by itself. I lost most of my friends over time. With lost I mean we got separated by life, everyone doing their own things. I can reach most of them if I want, got their phone numbers. Others, it’s been so long time that we haven’t talk to each other, I think it would seem weird if I call them now. So, I don’t.

Specifically, I had one friend, that I met in my first day in college, in 2009 and we were friends since then. We had our up and downs, some fights, some break ups, but I think we were quite OK. We were bros!

But I had a secret, that I kept from him, and lied to him about all those years. He wasn’t the only one that didn’t know this tough. I lied about this to everyone. Kind of I had to, that I was gay.

The problem wasn’t that I kept this secret from him. The problem is I told him. At least that’s what I think because now he is now slowly removing me from his life. It was first not answering my WhatsApp messages. Then blocking me from WhatsApp, and then from other social media services; like Instagram, Facebook. That moved later to gaming platforms, Battle.Net, Steam etc. He is clearly removing me from his life, and I don’t know the exact reason. I have a guess tough.

I, recently, went outside of my home country to work. It’s a temporary work, and I will be returning back to my country eventually. But he was the last person I wanted to see before I go. The same day my flight is, I did. Not my parents, him. He wasn’t alone, his girlfriend was also with us, but I actually don’t mind about his girlfriend much. But there was obviously something off. Now when I try to remember, there were things on his mind. And I think I helped him make a decision.

I don’t remember exact date, but in October, 18, I told him my secret. He was the second person apart from my psychiatrist and parents, which was 13 years ago, I reveled my secret. First one, a few months before telling my friend, was a co-worker, whom I fell in love (which was very painful for me too because it was unrequited). I didn’t tell him that I am in love with him, because that would only make things more complicated than it is. But I told him about me. His reaction actually gave me courage. He really didn’t care. Why would he? I think that is the best reaction you can get. This led me to believe that, my best friend can embrace me too.

It was quite good at first. I was happy and he seemed, confused, but said things that I expected. He seemed he understood me. At first.

But then, a few weeks later, he was angry with me. He said that, all this time, all my depressed moments, my sadness, was because of this stupid secret? He was angry because I lied to him all these times. I lied about this everyone around me. How much of my life was real, was his question. All my friends in college and high school, I lied. Some guessed it tough. At high school I was called faggot by some which I refused every time. But actually, it was true. Anyway, he told me that he doesn’t want to speak with me some time. So, we didn’t. Around two weeks.

Then he returned to me. Told me that he doesn’t want to stay like this, that it hurts him to be like this and he wants to talk.

That’s the first time I met with his girlfriend, which by the way was also his new girlfriend. They met a few week ago before that day. Obviously, he talked with her about my situation and she helped her to understand the me. Accept it. I think it didn’t work.
During one conversation, she literally asked me about my situation, and I said, yes. So, now we could freely speak about me and my situation when all three of us together. Which we did. She seemed quite OK about it, but I think my friend wasn’t very happy about it after all. We have met a few times more and things seemed on track.

Then I got a job offer outside of my country. Which I told my friend about and wanted to meet him before I go. This was 2 weeks before I went abroad. During this time, until 2 day before my flight, my friend ignored my messages. At first, I didn’t think it was because of me. Because this was a typical behavior of him occasionally even if it is not about me. Happened before multiple times. And he explained me what the problem was before. So, I didn’t think it is related with me. He will return back to me. Eventually 2 days before, I told him I want to see him before I go. He answered, OK. Let’s meet.

1 day before we meet, I went to a gay bar with new people I met online. This was a very different experience for me as it was my first time and I was excited to tell about this to my friend. I was just starting to getting out of closet.

Next day, we met. Her girlfriend was with us. And at that time things seemed normal. But actually, I think it wasn’t. I told them about me experience the night before. And we talked about stuff that I don’t remember actually. My trip, my new work etc. Eventually we parted ways. I hugged and stuff. Told each other to keep in touch.

For a moment we did. He asked me if I arrived at the country where I will work or not, and I replied obv.

And that was it. That was the last time I heard of him. I sent him multiple messages, but I got no reply. I know he was coming online on WhatsApp occasionally and wasn’t reading my messages on purpose. At first, I still thought it wasn’t related with me.

A few weeks later, I realized that now I can’t see his picture. Which means I got blocked. I hesitated to contact his girlfriend about it but eventually I did. And she replied there is no reason for him to block me and he wouldn’t do that, but in fact he did. She said he didn’t talk about me or anything and she has no information which might be true or false, I don’t know. But I didn’t press her about it. I told her that I will deal this later when I come back home. Which literally was my plan.

Then I realized he is now deleting me from other platforms too.

Which made me think, maybe he really wants to get rid of me from his life. Maybe I really deserved it. Maybe I should just let him go. During this time, I met other people like me. And all of them told me that you should let him. That he was not your friend, and anyone did not accept you as you are is not your friend also. But how can someone accept you even you didn't accept yourself? I am confused really.

I still cannot make myself believe it tough.",10Jun2019,3
14,I understand. And helping them doesn't do anything. People will say I am guilty. Murder perhaps. All they want to do is die  their life is broken. Sickness has overwhelm them. They just want to go. I'm the only guy who understands why she wants to go. And I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's her vessel...the only thing stopping me is my love for her. So I made her suffer more by not dying. Sacrificed her happiness for me. Selfish of me from my pov. Tremendous love and compassion can't solve everything.,10Jun2019,8

16,"I'm posting this in the middle of a breakdown. If it's disjointed, please bare with me!

I'm 21 years old. Been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a kid. It's been the biggest defining thing in my life. I was bullied relentlessly through school and I never fit in no matter what I did. Lived in the middle of nowhere with some parents who tried their best, but they couldn't support my mental health the way I needed. I've been suicidal since I was 9, and self harmed for a long time in middle and high school (thankfully I stopped cutting a few years back. Still tempted often, but it's not worth doing it again)

I was always really smart, but school got harder for me the older I got. I had a pretty traumatic bullying situation when I was 12 and I don't think I ever really recovered. My social anxiety got REALLY bad and I stopped going to school often, like I'd stay home more than I'd go because I'd have panic attacks every day. 

When I was 15/16 after a few really hard years living in an abusive house with my mom's ex, we moved out. Had a really hard time financially, so our apartment was really shitty. I'm talking one bedroom basement shitty. The water had a parasite and I got really sick from it, but of course we didn't know it was the water at the time, so it just kept getting worse. I was so sick that I was going to the bathroom 10+ times a day. You can imagine what that did to my digestive system. Being so sick made me even more anxious and depressed, and this made it impossible for me to keep going to school. I ended up dropping out when I was in 11th grade.

I promised my mom I'd get my GED as soon as I turned 19 (that's when you're able to get it here), but... I didn't. I've been putting it off ever since because I'm literally terrified to try, and my mental health has deteriorated so much in the last few years that my self esteem is essentially gone at this point. I have no idea what I want to do for a career, and even the thought of getting a job terrifies me. I spend most days not being able to stop thinking about death and how much I'm wasting my time and how I'll never be a teenager again. I'm obsessed with youth, yet I'm not doing anything to enjoy it while it lasts. 

So... I'm not sure what to do. I know I need to just get my GED but I'm scared I'll fail, and even after I get it and apply for college I'm scared I won't be passionate about what I pick. It might not seem like a lot but it's really daunting and scary. I regret a lot of things and it's hard to stay motivated when I just want to give up entirely. What should I do, and how can I motivate myself?

TLDR: had a hard life, dropped out, now I'm 21 and need my GED so I can go to college and actually feel like I'm not wasting my life away. What do?",10Jun2019,1

So, I know a lot of people have it worse on here, I've been somewhere there, but now that I'm better I can't for the life of me do much of anything. For example I love drawing but now I can't get myself to do it for more than half an hour. I even bought myself a drawing tablet to guilt myself into using it cuz I spent the money or something but that's not helping and I do it even less since I'm nowhere close to used to it. 

I'm in a position where I can't even play a video game properly. I'm pretty sure that's also because of my ADD but I can't even get myself to start and it's killing me.

24,"Hi, I'm 23, no job atm, living alone on welfare, doing lots of gaming/watching youtube. 

I struggle with caffeine, not always getting its amazing energetic effects. I'm on 20mg Lexapro (escitalopram). And don't work out or eat vegan. I eat bread, which also I've read might not be good for my stomach (people are different). I haven't done alcohol a lot as a means of self medicating, but it's safe to say that I become ultimate me when drinking with friends.

I miss living in a dorm or whatever, where the ppl in the hall whom I all knew and had fun with, shared a kitchen. After I left more cool ppl came in and I wish I could live there again. However I just got out of a relationship, so I've barely tried living on my own. But I cant stand noisy neighbors.

I am motivated to get back with my ex though, so I'm very excited to hear what she thinks about getting back together.
We did in fact do it once after breaking up, but she said it just wasn't the time to be together. Though that was due to her being away in a different country for a couple of months at work - so I am in fact waiting for her to let me know when it's an OK time to hang out and talk.

I also try to be with my friends and not wait for them to ask me to hang, as I don't have a job or school like they do. I love them and accept that I may just not be used to living alone, with nothing to do,while trying my best to do errands and get a job ofc..

It's just so unfair that I can't be full of energy all the time and even just do the damn dishes. I keep wanting to be diagnosed with ADHD just to get a cure you know.. But I'm actually pretty in line with the symptoms of at least one type of it, so I'm not just a hypochondriac with ""normal"" symptoms. Right now I'm not that bad so I'm not gonna get into my ""worse"" sufferings.

Sorry if this seems like I'm just complaining.
I hope someone can relate or.. whatever. lol. 

Anyways, thank you so much guys, for answering, reading, sharing, everything.
I love you 3000.",10Jun2019,3
25,"I've been struggling with depression and GAD consistently for a little over 2 years. Over those years, I used fashion and fine art photography as a distraction. When things got bad in my brain, I got creative. Depression was almost my fuel to create. Now, at this time, I lived in a huge city (the DFW area) but I hated my job (I was a graphic designer and video editor for a small organization with NO creative freedom), I lived alone, I had no friends, and I was the most lonely I have ever been. I would spend the weekends getting drunk by myself to drown out my suicidal thoughts. Super healthy I know. I started going to therapy and got on some medication and that has helped a lot. 

Around 5 months ago, I moved back to a small town in Missouri to be closer to my friends and have a slower paced life. Mentally I am in a better place than I have been in years. I have friends, I have a job that I love (as a graphic designer and video producer for a nonprofit with TONS of creative freedom), and I don't feel lonely anymore. 

But at the same time, I have little to no creative drive anymore. When I want to create I just can't find the energy. I have some really great concepts for photo shoots and my friends are more than willing to help out but when it comes time to start planning my mind just can not handle it and I usually just end up watching youtube videos for hours and feeling guilty.

27," Hi all,

I've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.

At first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. I understood that she was isolating herself, so I gave her space and tried to be understanding. We still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.

Now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. I've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. But it's beginning to take a toll on me. She's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but I understand that can disappear). She also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).

I think I need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that I can outline that I need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what I'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather I be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.

Could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?

Thank you!",10Jun2019,51
28,"So, I've been really depressed for the past few weeks, I think it's probably the change of the seasons and that my relationship with my mother is strained again (she's a narcissist and it hits ups and downs). 

Past week things got really tough. I relapsed on my self harm after being clean for several months, and I've been having severe trouble sleeping, trouble focusing at work, and all that. 

I'm scheduled to see my psychiatrist mid August, but I might move it forward to July. Thing is, I'm afraid my doctor will make me go to therapy again and I can't afford it, also I feel I have no underlying issues to address. I usually get a bit of a relapse at the beginning of the fall and with work and everything, I think I can pin point the reasons and I just need to ride out this wave. 

Also I can't reach out to friends. My closest friends are all dealing with complicated stuff (the loss of a parent, and two of them were almost committed because they were so depressed), and I can't burden them with this right now. I just can't. They need MY support and I have to do this without them. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... I'm sort of out of options. I'm reaching out here trying to see if any of you have been in a similar situation and has a clue what I could do.

First it was a simple thought “I wish I  could just eat a bullet” in the heat of a moment, now it a constant  daily fight to rid my mind of the insistent drive to simply be gone or  run away. I wish I could stop being, but I don’t want to kill myself,  but the idea of turning to nothing sounds and feels so comforting, which  is disturbing in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I  guess the hardest part is I feel I can’t seek help. I have been in the  military for 20+ years, and despite the military’s best efforts of  diminishing the stigma surrounding depression and suicidal thoughts, it  still has a detrimental effect on one’s career despite what they say; I  have seen it firsthand. I guess my constant pushing forward is also  based on my career, “if injured, keep moving, keep fighting, close in  and destroy the enemy” BUT I CAN’T SEE THIS ENEMY &amp; ITS ME…

I  assume I am posting this as a way to try and vent, because I don’t know  what help would actually be gained from the internet, however, if  venting to strangers works for some, why not me.",10Jun2019,2

Hi all,

My wife has a history of anxiety and depression (anxiety ongoing, full-blown depression restricted to a period of around \~4-5 months about 5 years ago). She has been searching for work for the past several months, having taken some time to herself after graduating in late 2018. 

The constant application and rejection that characterizes a modern-day job search has really beaten her down, and for the past several months she has complained that her depression is coming back. She is in weekly therapy sessions and is beginning to see a psychiatrist to get back on meds. 

I’m trying to find the right role for me to play as someone who has zero experience in dealing with true mental health issues. She has no friends in our area. She is looking to me to be her caregiver, career coach, and just about everything short of bodily functions. I am in a demanding professional field and if I lose my job we will have no income or access to insurance so that she can keep seeing her doctors. I feel completely lost. Our relationship isn’t great at the moment, I have very little time to dedicate to things outside of work (working 60-70 hours a week) – coming home these days is a second job in terms of trying to make her happy. We argue A LOT.

Short of quitting my job and being a full time caregiver I have no idea how to make her feel better. I am completely lost and just looking for any sort of help or advice in this situation. I’m going to talk to my management today to see if I can work 9-6 this week and see if it helps - but if anyone has any advice I'd be very appreciative.",10Jun2019,2
36,"Hello,  I need some feedback. I regularly suffer from depression, the last time  was last summer (I had to be hospitalized), summers are generally  difficult for me. Anyhow, I'm a student, and in the middle of several  final exams. I've noticed for several months now that my courses were  annoying me (I used to like them), but I've put that on the content and  the fact that I'm turning 30 soon and just annoyed of having to cram  information inside my head. However, something caught my attention this  week. *I don't care*.

A  few days ago, there was an exam for which I had studied (not to the  best of my abilities, but I did it). The exam was much harder than I  thought and as I left the exam room, I just went straight to buy  groceries and carry on with my life, as if this was an insignificant  event.

The next exam is tomorrow, and  although I've studied (at the last minute but I did it), I still  genuinely don't care, while I used to love my field of study. I don't  see myself doing anything else anyway.

Same  thing with food. I've never liked cooking, I've always found that  boring, but now it's eating that I find boring. I'm almost angry at  myself for disturbing me with hunger (while I do nothing). In fact, I'm  getting angry at everything and everyone, even if I don't express it.  And last summer, I had a fourth of my weight because I had just stopped  eating, so this is scaring me a little.

But  I still get out of bed in the morning, I take showers, I wash dishes  (well, most times), etc. I don't work, so my only responsibility is to  myself. And globally I still do stuff. But everything, almost  everything, seems so utterly boring. Boredom everywhere.

Which  is why I'm starting to get a little scared. I'm clueless to my own  emotional state. Do you think these are signs of a (pre-)depressive  state? If so, I'll take an appointment with a therapist (I should have  one I know, but I can't stand them for very long).

Thank you for your help!",10Jun2019,1
37,"Don’t you ever just feel like what’s the point of even things you like about life or yourself if others have already experienced it or done it?

Like i might write a great article, know about x y and z, even secure a job i like. All of those things make you feel good about yourself for a moment. But then i’m like oh wait, this feeling isn’t special? Someone else has accomplished the same if not more today, in the past, and in the future...so why am i enjoying it? 

It’s kind of a dumb question with an easy cop out of “for yourself...?” but at the same time like...what’s the point? 

Like don’t you ever just see the crude reality of things and realize even the wealthiest most attractive people are simply skeletons who happen to be alive and in the end everything they accomplished or felt will be meaningless...? 

Don’t get me wrong i enjoy life usually, and i like happiness, but i can’t escape that thought of just the pointlessness of it all, especially when it comes to the fact that even when you think you’ve done something, you haven’t...?",10Jun2019,1
38,"For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above - I don’t know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable - meaning I’m feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that I’m used to for the most part.
The past two summers I will have a really good day/week/ whatever and then one morning I’ll wake up and feel “hungover” or “in a fog” even though I haven’t done anything to bring this on (like drinking, using substances). Also, I’m quite active physically - so that’s also strange. 

What’s even more frustrating are the physical symptoms- my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot “wake up” despite caffeine and Adderall.

Two summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment- literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said “maybe it was “menopause”. Wanted to throttle him, lol.

In a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed - only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasn’t sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud.

Last summer I wasn’t expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was “just a fluke” or “hormones” but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive- did a lot around the house and generally felt “up”.  The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt “off”.
I was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse.
It took me months to recover Bc I couldn’t find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.

During these spells I literally feel as if I’m drugged - I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if I’m literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative.

I understand it must sound dramatic, but I’ve not been able to find anything (medication wise) that is able to help.

I had a gene site test and I’ve tried the meds listed in my “green bucket” and the side effects were so intense I couldn’t continue on them, not to mention they’re not covered by our insurance- so we paid over $1500.00 last summer on meds that didn’t work.

I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what I’m going through. 

Additionally, I don’t understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning- like “cause and effect”. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal.

Now it’s June and I’m hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like I’ve exhausted meds. options. 

I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just don’t know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do - or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it won’t happen - I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared.

Anyone have experience with this and any tips?
I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year.  I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer -well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary.

A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on - sounds good, but also - could be a train wreck.
Anyway - anything would be helpful. 
Thanks for reading.",10Jun2019,6
39,"I'm young...I haven't done the things I want to do in life yet. I'm relatively healthy physically...I haven't gotten sick for three years despite me being sickly when I was younger. I haven't even reached my 20 year mark...

I'm just a kid.

I'm supposed to feel great. I'm supposed to deal with stuff like school. I'm supposed to stress out about work.

And you know what? That's fine. That's not a problem.

So why is it that...if I don't think I feel great, it's my fault?

Why do I need to be diagnosed with depression or any other disorder to be considered depressed?

What if I don't want to deal with hospitals and clinics and therapy sessions?

What if....I just want to be able to cry out in despair every now and then? Because I want to...and I'm doing so as I'm typing this....and the only one here for me right now...is my eight year old brother.

I can't do it. I can't let him grow up with me looking like this. Not when he's so young.

But nobody else is there for me. Well..there was one person and we still contact each other... But I left my hometown to move to another city far away about 10 months ago...and the people in this new city are boring...If I burden that person with anything else, I fear I'll only be another nuisance.

I don't like to be bored....

And to be a boring person means you are a true pacifist...and you only believe in hope.

I don't like that...

I have to act like I'm one of them for every single moment I'm with them.

On top of that, I don't see eye-to-eye with another member of my family...just last night, I had to set some things straight...and it was all okay until it started all over again.

They left angrily not too long ago...and here I am being caressed by my baby brother

It's not like anything I said was completely okay....but it's not like the other party wasn't in the wrong either...

I'm not one of many feelings. But I do feel desperation. There are tears streaming down my face...and all I can do is heavily breath and scream...only no sounds are coming out.

I have no reason to live for myself...I live for everyone else.

But it's hard to suppress the weaknesses for everyone else when nobody is there to reassure you about your own.

I don't even know what I want from posting this...

Sorry for burdening whoever is reading this.",10Jun2019,1
40,"I've been dealing with CPTSD and depression since childhood. I'm currently on Cymbalta and it has been going great for over a year until recently.


I work a regular office job and every workday, no matter how much I have (or haven't) slept, I feel too dizzy and disoriented to get out of bed. I have been calling in sick a lot lately. I stopped taking my sleeping pills after trying so many different kinds, but now I know they're not to blame. I also suffer from chronic migraine headaches and I've given up trying to find a treatment. 


I missed two days of work this week so far. I sent out a few emails to seem engaged, like I care, but I'm not. I'm scared to lose my income, my SO and I can't risk me losing my job. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I know I have a chance to keep my job after I get the first warning, at least for six months. I am testing my limits with work like a rebellious tteenager rebelling against school. They need my skills, so they're giving me my space for now. I'm scared of them finding a replacement for me, which is possibly unlikely for a while.

i just need to let it out, as i feel it is the only way to get over it - i feel like i should be hospitalized and i really wish i was. i went to some kind of hospital three years ago, it didn't change much, but i feel like it could now. but still, when i think about going two things come to mind : 1 - what if im taking someone else's place? im not suicidal and i do try to function properly (but i would prefer not to be alive) and 2 - i fear my mother would not take it well.  being a single mothers an only child, i already feel like my illness and hospitalization somehow caused (or at least influenced) her getting cancer. she is good now, but i know she worries about me all the time even when im pretending that im doing fine, and hospitalization doesn't sound fine at all.

43,"For some background: I struggle with depression (have since about Freshman year of high school) and lately increased anxiety. I believe the increased anxiety is due in part to lots of turmoil going on in my personal life-disabled Mom had an injury last year that we're still having a lot of follow up medical care for, a move to the next town over into a smaller home due to mold and rodent issues in our old rental and I'm still trying to organize and unpack and pare down belongings. 
I am under a doctor's care and found a medication that I liked, but my insurance won't pay for it as it's expensive and rather new on the market- Trintellix, so I had to go with another called Lexapro. It has helped, but I still have that slight oppressive feeling over me, although not as bad as before. 
I work for a now medium sized MSP that just went through a merger with another MSP last year to combine resources. It was a good move, as now we have resources we can tap into for our clients over a wider area, increased knowledge and experience and no one was let go in the merger because we were both small enough at the time to have little to no double roles. 
I am in a Dispatch role as the Service Coordinator, so it's my job to make sure technicians are working on issues as they come in, make sure they get to the best person to resolve them quickly and handle the person's schedules who go out onsite for troubleshooting or set ups. I love my job. I love my co workers. My boss is nice, sometimes can be a little manic but she's generally great to work with. When I started I had no issues. Now sometimes I have the hardest time getting myself up out of bed and putting in the effort to get ready to drive the 20 minutes into the office. It ranges from just dragging my feet slightly to really bad sometimes where I'm late because I've dragged along so badly. I am always proud of myself when I make it into the office but if there are times when I can work from home the sense of relief I get is ridiculous. What is my problem? My boss is starting to notice and has mentioned how often I work from home and I cannot lose my job. Has anyone else experienced this? What helped you? Any advice is appreciated.",10Jun2019,1

47," I’m here as a person who feels out of options but doesn’t want to commit suicide. I feel so lonely, and it’s crushing me. I’m losing my faith in love (my raison d’etre) and I didn’t realize just how much I needed to believe in *something*. I can and do believe in myself sometimes but sometimes that goes away and I feel empty and alone and unworthy; yet I don’t feel like I truly have anything but myself. I have some friends but none that I would really call a “true” friend (I left my old friend group a couple of years ago and, while I feel I was right to do it, I didn’t realize just how hard it would be to establish a new one), and nothing makes me feel as lonely as being around people but still feeling lonely. I feel misplaced and while I take an odd sort of pride in being different I want so desperately to find my people or tribe or however you want to call it and my eccentricities makes it harder to find that.  

I realized recently though that one of the 2 people I really felt I loved didn’t love me but was attached to me because he needed an emotional connection, he felt strongly for me but it was out of desperation and his own neediness rather than for myself. The other was a family member who now loves me as a duty. Now thinking of those 2 fills me with so much sadness. It used to be some kind of comfort that there was *someone* out there with whom I shared love and now I don’t have a single person I really connect with and believe in, and it’s been 4 years since I’ve had active love in my life. I’ve gotten through it by berating and cajoling myself, and utilizing the spare friend group I have but I feel like I can’t bear the emptiness anymore.  

I don’t know that this will help. After reading the other postings and comments it feels like this might exacerbate rather than help my situation but I have to try something.",10Jun2019,1
