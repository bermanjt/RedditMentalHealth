1,I've been depressed for 5 years now and I really need help. I've struggled with cutting and self worth and self image. I finally opened up to my parents but it honestly didn't make it ANY better. I want help but I don't feel comfortable talking about it with many people. I'm a Christian but not a very mature one at that. My parents want me to read the Bible and find helpful verses and seek comfort and peace in God. While I agree it works i don't know if I'm mature enough to do it. Any advice would help.,10Oct2019,26

5,"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 yo girl that started college about a mouth and a half ago. I've been diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago after noticing some physical pains. The doctor told me I should ""try to live in the present"", and that was about it. I asked my parents if I could go see a therapist, but my mom refused... Now I'm in college and since the end of August, I've noticed a lot of things changing in me. At first I blamed it on the stress of being in college and far from home, etc. But this is persistent and it's getting worse. I find no joy in things that used to make me easily happy, I struggle to feel love or affection to people. My best friend in the world that's studying in another town is going to visit me for a day, and I don't even feel excited... I eat a lot, or not at all, I sleep but I'm tired... 

So I guess I was wondering if this is just me being burned out by anxiety, or if this could be something more ? 

If this kind of post isn't allowed, I'm sorry ! I just don't really know where to go since I don't have access to any real psychological help.",10Oct2019,3

7,"I don't really know what's going on with me lately,I had this whole conversation with my nephew about focusing on his future not girls and popularity, it quickly fades and you spend 4 years of wasting your time on high school hype.I don't know why I went so deep maybe because I didn't want him to fail like me. I quit my job recently and I right now I feel like that was the most dumbest mistake I have made. I had my reasons, mainly the reasons were I let people get to me and fill my head with temporary drama that seemed like it was forever.Everyday was just taking a mental toll on me, it was such a toxic environment that I spent everyday in the shower just numb.I was contemplating my life, who I was as a person and just ultimately hating myself.Now its even worse, two months without a job and I feel like I'm a complete failure.I am 3 years away from 30, I have never been in a relationship and I live with my mother.

I'm always thinking the worst, and how if I didn't have her I would be homeless and everything else that could go wrong with a person. God I love her, I also constantly think about how I could have a horrible diseases etc and not know because I don't have proper health care. I tell myself to take care of myself but I can't seem to stop eating or if I do I go cold turkey or worse just throw everything up.I have the worse metabolism and being chubby has made me hate myself even more. Mainly because dating for me hasn't been easy at all and its like pick a struggle you can't be ugly and fat.

I think food is worse for me overall because I never grew up with healthy eating habits.It was eat what is there because that's what we can afford.Also finishing your plate was a must at our house and restaurants was a family outing, a treat.My life was pretty much backwards, my biological dad told my sister not to force me to workout because he didn't want me to get sick. Even though I really wanted to workout and eat healthy, he didn't care about my eating habits when I was younger but was the first one to make fun of me for it.I just felt like I was set up for failure, I know all of this is not an excuse, I mean people from 3rd world countries come to America and become doctors or something and have a great life with hard work and dedication.I grew up confused never knowing what I wanted to do and anything I did want to do I was told it was never going to happen.I was definitely the low self-esteem kid growing up, criticized at home and in school.God, the teachers were worse than the kids but hey, eventually I learned to tell people to F off. It landed me in the bad school but it was worth it at the time.

I guess this whole rant is basically me venting and also me coming to the realization that I wish I had the mindset to care back then. I wonder if it would have made a difference? If I set myself up like I explained to my nephew I wouldn't have jump from place to place at a young age and I wouldn't have to live the life I do now. I just feel like I am meant to live for so much more.I'm trying not to be lost, I really want a job, I really want to do what I want to do. I want to be healthy but I don't know how to turn all the bad habits off. I want to stop overthinking and just focus on myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I just have this indication that I am 3 years away from 30, I have no one but my mother, thank God and I'm just really, really, really sad. I don't want to be anymore. I just want a job, not be stuck in the same situations even though they seem completely different I know they are not. How do I change?

9,"You know those days when you think about all of your problems and start to feel like “wow maybe I should just kill myself” and then the entire day any time something goes wrong you’re like “well I’m just going to kill myself because I don’t want to deal with this one more thing”...? That’s been me all day today... wtf.

Like seriously, even as I write this I’m like “mm I should get it all out there now because I know I’m eventually going to just kill myself so someone needs to know my story”. It’s really sad because it always ends up getting to the point where you’re thinking these thoughts even when things are going well. You’re just like “I’m gonna do it so it doesn’t even matter anymore.” Then you start thinking of all the ways you should kill yourself and even tho you’re scared out of your mind and know it’s likely not going to happen, you’re so convinced it will. You ultimately accept suicide as your fate and start to imagine how your loved ones will take the news. You think about how they’ll go about their lives and move on from the “loss” of you without missing a beat.

12,"For about 7 years now I feel terrible, but it comes and goes. I have periods where I just want to stop existing and after some time I have the feeling that everything is fine. 
I spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. I have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so I get where she is coming from.
But does that mean that this feeling that I just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? She asked if I ever wanted to hurt myself and I said no because I've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). She said that it probably isn't a depression because of that. Is the feeling of a burnout similar to a depression? How do you know the difference?",10Oct2019,41
13,"Why is it that I've been judged so harshly for being medicated for bipolar disorder and manic depression. 
Depending on Effexor 300mg, Lamotrigine 250 and Seroquel 300x3 every single day for 8 years; it takes its toll. Not to mention Ativan 25x5 and Xanax 2mgsx2 when necessary. Which I never abused because it caused me memory loss. Yet I still had issues with self harm. 
I hate that I'm categorized as mentally ill. Especially to people who don't understand it. My family.
Its not being sad, its mostly lack of enthusiasm. For anything. Its faking a smile to fit in. Its hiding your puffy eyes from anyone noticing you cried. Its emptiness when all you want, is to feel. Anything, even if it is pain. Its wanting so badly to prolong your happiness, but constantly assuming it will fade at any moment, so you relish it like you'll never have it again. 
It's assuming you can't trust anyone. Its assuming you're right and everyones out to get you, even it is something asinine. 
Its seriously tiring, checking on people; whom wouldn't check on you. 
Its agreeing to disagree to save face. Rolling with the punches of what you obviously represent. 
Its numbing the embarrassment, its covering your scars. Its the same sad story you try to forget yet bringing up to remind people, you've moved on. 
It's reassuring yourself you'll be okay, often expecting the worst to happen. Its reminding yourself to the point where you cant eat, until you hear that everythings okay from multiple people, yet fear of being judged for not being able to cope with reality. You cone off as rude, when its the opposite.
It is a feeling of being weak. Its a fear of admitting you are weak. Its a scary thing to say you cant handle day to day function, without validity that you so long for. As a mother. As an aunt. As a family member. 
Then it all goes away. You have no fear. Nothing stops you. You are resilient. Nothing matters and everything will work out. Zero cares in the world. This is where I abuse my mentality. Testing my tolerance and proving to nobodies that im normal. 
This comes in waves that last days to a week. 
It disappears. Its now the opposite. Its steals you and pulls you away. Your mind is over run by thoughts of failure. Times of recklessness. Times of misjudgement. You feel so low to the point where you feel like you will never be worthy. It makes you feel like nothing. You remind yourself that you're nothing. 
Im sorry yet grateful for everyone that stood by me. Even through my empty words, I just can't seem to simplify how I feel. I truly do regret taking feelings for granted. For expecting people to always be there. 
I hate myself for not remembering. I hate myself for blocking certain things out. Things I wish not to talk about. I dont want a sad paragraph to be the epitome of my life. I dont want a certain moment to explain my whole story. I want so much but feel so little. I wish I had the power to mentally handle this. This thing called life. 
Its been several weeks now since Ive had medication. Since I woke up rested. Since my vision was blurred. Since Ive been numb.
Maybe Im meant to be this way. Maybe this is how ill feel forever. It feels so.

14,"Nurturing Parent Schema

A “schema” relates to a schematic or blueprint, everyone has them, and they are the things that run our life. Of course, the goal is to develop healthy, balanced, productive schemas… but those of us who suffer from anxiety, depression and codependency have developed unhealthy, destructive schemas.

For example there's an enmeshment schema, an abandonment schema, an I'm defective schema, a subjugation schema, approval seeking schema and of course, the punitive or punishing parent schema where we become our own critical, shaming, abusive parent. Of course, there are countless other schemas too.

Although not in everyone's case, but in many cases, we find ourselves here reading this because we are looking for help to undo the damage of our abusive childhoods. As a sufferer of social anxiety, generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder and codependence, I think they all have one thing in common, and that is, a marked inability or extremely limited ability to self sooth, self reassure, self motivate, self determine, self love and self worth. Instead, we take our cues from the people around us in our life… if we are treated like crap, we believe we are crap, if our opinion is rejected, we believe our opinions are worthless or even that we are worthless and rejected, if the person we love is not enmeshed and codependent with us, then we feel defective or unlovable, if we don't fit in socially, then we feel it's because we are defective. Basically, we have allowed our view of ourselves to be determined by those around us. Commonly, this is a behaviour we learnt in childhood to survive living with our abusive parents.

Of course, our ongoing challenge is to take our power back, and to refuse to allow those who have not lived our lives to determine how we should feel about ourselves and our place in the world around us.

So here's an idea I'm playing with, if we can modify our schemas and develop healthy schemas, and so many of us are our own abusive parent… why can't we invent our own schema and call it the “nurturing parent schema.” I thought of this when I realized that some of my greatest moments of healing have come from inner child dialogue and reparenting.

The reason our parents were able to do so much damage to us in the first place is because as children, especially as infants, we are not independent yet. Our safety and survival depends entirely on our parents. Infants tend to see themselves as extensions of their parents, if their parents project a safe confident environment, the child feels confident and safe. If the parent is afraid and insecure, the child develops fears and insecurities. As infants, we were programmed to trust and believe the two greatest care givers in our life, the ones that our instinct told us to trust blindly. So if these individuals constantly screamed at, abused, humiliated and shamed us, as a child or infant we came to adopt the view that we deserve this kind of treatment and we develop schemas or internal stories that explain to us that we are worthless failures that deserve to suffer, don't even try because you're a failure who will fail and get hurt. When we were children and infants, believing this lie and living as though we believe it was pretty much the only thing that stopped the abuse or made it pass more quickly. The problem is, as adults we still carry these maladapted schemas with us.

What we need is an internal voice that will give us the love and reassurance and confidence we need… everything we needed from our parents but didn't get… we can call this, as already mentioned, our “nurturing parent schema.”

For those of us who have already tried reparenting, we can now give this part of us a name… it's the parent inside us that contradicts our abusive parents, it stands up for us and tells us that we are good, valuable, loving, worthy, deserving, successful. The reality though, is that most of us do not feel this way about ourselves, so imagining yourself as your own nurturing parent, you can tell yourself exactly what you needed to hear as a child. To make it easier, maybe you can imagine what you'd say to your little brother or sister or niece or nephew if they suffered what you suffered… what would you tell them… then take the time to audibly tell yourself the same thing.

My nurturing parental schema holds my arm and pats, strokes and gently rubs my arm, rocks me back and forth and tells me “shh, shh… everything’s going to be ok” repeatedly, and I'm always amazed at how quickly my anxiety settles. But it's not just about finding the right words for your situation, but finding the right emotion… both finding the pain that your inner child is suffering,  and then feeling love and nurturing towards that hurting child part of you, and then doing and saying with feeling and intent what your nurturing parent wants to tell the suppressed and hurting child in your subconscious.",10Oct2019,8

20,"Hi, I'm 17M, in last year of high school. Because of my education(preparing for college entrance exams), my father lives alone in my hometown and I, with my mom and younger brother, live in another city. I feel like I am a burden, to my family, and my own self. We were supposed to live like this for 2 years. Now 6 months are left. I didn't choose this system of education, my parents did. I feel like I am the reason that my family has to live separately. I used to be the smartest kid at school, but for past year and a half, I am plain average. I feel like I don't deserve anything. Each day is filled with worries, unfulfilled expectations and that I have left my family down. I know I won't be able to fulfill their expectations. I am absolute crap. I am the reason my brother has to live away from dad for 2 years, my mom has to live away from him for 2 years. I am here, wasting everything, time, resources, money, my mental health. I don't talk to my family about all this, I don't wanna burden them with this. Each day is a war, and it ends with my defeat. It is a war in my head, constant tug of war between two invisible parties. Each day I think about switching myself off, but the idea of putting my brother through the misery holds me. I feel like I don't deserve anything. Even when I go out for dinner with my family, I feel I am a burden to them, that I don't deserve their time, even the food ffs. When I cry, I cry my eyes out and when I don't, I act like I am mentally the strongest guy around. But reality is, internally, I have been crying and metaphorically bleeding for a year and a half but I have been hiding all this behind a blank face. I used to love reading but haven't read a novel for 18 months. I think I have anxiety (sudden short periods of breathlessness, sweating and hyperactivity which drains my energy) and maybe depression. I don't dare tell this to my parents. However my best friend knows this. I remember once I scored badly in a test, my father asked me why I was performing poorly. I had a total breakdown in front of him. I couldn't say a word, nor I wanted to. I successfully held my pain for a year and a half but now, it seems to be overflowing. I wanna live no more. I hope that this pain becomes a poison and kills me. I feel guilty for my own existence. Do I have depression? Or am I just faking it? Or is it just stress? To be or not to be?",10Oct2019,1

I feel so overburdened, lost and just going through the motions until either something works out or it all fails. I sometime just wish I didnt exsist, but I know I cant just disappear because my kids need someone they can rely on,but who do I rely on? Who is going to help me? Im not religious and I cant believe in something without proof, so god isnt comforting it just feels like people are using it as a way to dismiss whats real.

22,"I’m sorry I just need to tell someone my story and what I’m going through. Right now I feel like I just can’t keep up the act. Every day I wake up and dread all the things I have to get done, and think of the people I’m going to have to talk to. All I can think about is how there doesn’t seem to be any path or course of actions I can take that will lead to any type of long term happiness. All day I fake smiles and tell jokes, but really I’m just counting down the hours until it’s over. About 5 years ago I tried hanging myself, but somehow my brother knew and found me and cut me down. I then spent a month in a psych ward and got a therapist etc. We tried a bunch of different medications over the next year but honestly most of them made me feel worse and none really had any noticeably positive effect. I tried CBT and all that but I just couldn’t buy in. While dealing with all of this no one ever knew, except my family and a few very close friends after I tried to kill myself. After I got out of the hospital I had to live on a friends couch for a while because my parents said “we think you’ll do better if you live on your own” but really they just didnt want to deal with me anymore. I got a job at minimum wage and worked my way up to manager and got my own place within 6 months, and things were ok for a while. I then ended becoming partners with the owner and opened my own store, and things were ok for a while, but I couldn’t be sober at night, I’d have to smoke or drink or my head would go right back to where I was. But over the past few months everything is turning grey again. I have to force myself to shower and to brush my teeth and most days I just can’t. I can get so much done at work, but I can’t even do basic things to take care of myself. I feel trapped. I want to end it so badly but now there’s employees who count on their paychecks and are barely making it as is. I’ve starting cutting and burning myself again which helps numb the pain a little but I just don’t know if I can go through this again tomorrow. Thanks for listening to my boring story, hope you’re all doing well",10Oct2019,54

27,"The hardest thing for me to deal with when it comes to my mental health is doing things like washing dishes, picking up, and doing laundry. I don't own a dishwasher or a washing machine (small, cheap apartment), so I have to leave the house and drive 10 minutes to wait 2-3 hours to do laundry and wash my dishes by hand. If I had to chose one that I hate the most, it's definitely dishes, and I often ask my boyfriend or mother to help when they're visiting.

It makes me more depressed to think that at 24, I still can't find any motivation to do the dishes. I get around it quite often by buying disposable things (plates, plasticware, cups, etc.), but dishes still stack up. It's been 4 years since I've lived on my own, and now that I work a lot, it's really hard for me to want to do them because when I am home, I tend to focus on my immediate needs like eating, relaxing after a hard week, and hygiene, and whenever I think about doing them I get a sense of dread.

I don’t go out with friends or anything while my siblings do. I see people around me go out and have fun, but I don’t, simply because I have no friends to do that with. 
I have no job, and I’m currently studying to get my qualification to go to college, but even that is going wrong. 
I feel so lost and depressed and I feel like I have no future which makes me suicidal too. I don’t want to kill myself but in my mind it feels like that is the only answer for me. 
All I can think about is what is wrong with me, and why I’m like this. And I keep thinking if there is a god, he probably hates me. 
So what do I do? Because I don’t want to be stuck in this routine with nowhere else to go.",10Oct2019,1
32,"Sorry if this post makes no sense, but I'm not very articulate. 

Earlier this year, I met someone, someone who after a few months of talking to them told me that they loved me, well anyway, after a month or so of believing this, she changed, started pulling away, being distant, not the same.

Now for most of you, this probably wont be a big deal, but when you get to my age ( 38 ) and have never had someone tell you that they love you, like in the way you want to be loved, its a big f\*\*kin deal.

So yeah, anyway, she pulls away... then tells me that she now loves someone else.. someone who was there for her when she was emotionally vulnerable, its as if she was saying to me, nothing I said or did for her ever mattered, she destroyed me.. 

I introduced her to friends, most of who now avoid her, but there is this one friend, who still hangs with her, who still treats her like she did nothing wrong, and this, this is what hurt more then anything she did to me.

Am I wrong to feel betrayed by my friend? 

Am I over-reacting?",10Oct2019,3
