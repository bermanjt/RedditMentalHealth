0,"Lately, fulfilling responsibilities has been getting progressively more difficult for me. Definitely not the best situation to be in, considering I've got insane time crunch concerning school at the moment. I can't be on my A-game due to depression, but if I'm not on some sort of game, I'll end up with consequences and those will definitely make things worse.

How do you folks deal with this? What are some things you do to motivate you to complete your tasks when you would *so* rather be sulking in bed?",29Nov2019,1

2,"I'm not really sure how to put this. I've (m25) been dealing with depression for most of my life. I've generally had pretty good control of my outbursts before and have been able to talk myself out of pit. Lately though, it seems that life has been trying to throw as many bad situations at me as possible. Without going into to much detail, basically I have had so many things happen in the past 3 months that I have not had time to even comprehend it all. Until recently. I think it's all finally crashing down on me. The only light I see at the end of this damned cave I've found myself in is a beautiful smart and caring woman I met at work a couple weeks ago. She and I have been talking pretty much since we met.

I can't tell if I'm falling in love with her because of who she is or because my own depression sees her as a light in the darkness. I really want to tell her how I feel, but I'm worried, given recent events, that when I do she won't want to talk to me. My reasoning for not wanting to seems logical to me however. She recently found out that the last person she dated killed himself, and that she was the last person to talk with him.

That terrifies me. I don't want to be just another depressed person in her life. Yet seeing her makes me happier than I've felt in years. Just hearing her laugh makes me smile, even if I'm nowhere near her. Lately I guess, it's felt like the only time I'm genuinely happy (not just a classic mask for the masses) is when I'm with, or around her. 

I'm sure this isn't the right place to seek advice on going about a relationship. But I feel this is tied more to depression than anything.",29Nov2019,1
3,"I’m currently under investigation by my university for a misconduct issue. Nothing illegally but still serious. I was told today it’s now been referred to the major disciplinary board. I could be expelled, although this is far from certain, I have absolutely no one to turn to. Telling any of my friends will result in everyone knowing which will only worsen my position, I can’t tell my parents for a variety of reasons and if I’m expelled I can’t even foresee a possibility in which I confide in them, yet they would obviously find out. I genuinely think I’ll kill myself before I allow them to find out, 

I’ll find out the decision on the 20th December, I don’t think I can wait that long, there’s nothing I can do to help my case. I’ve admitted everything and cooperated in every way possible, I’m  barely sleeping, just lying in bed all day. I’m not eating, not socialising or anything. I’ve never felt more alone. I’ve tried to access the unis mental health team but I’ve just been passed around, I’ve never been diagnosed wi5h anything but I fit nearly all of th symptoms of depression.

5,"My best friend from high school killed himself three years ago. We went to different universities but remained close thereafter. I have more or less continued with my life, but probably not fully recovered, developing pretty bad social anxiety and becoming reclusive. I have several close friends, but none of them really offer me the companionship of my deceased friend. Every now and then, especially whenever I come home from graduate school, I get incredibly sad and depressed. The only way I can get rid of the sadness is by letting my anger takeover, but for obvious reasons I try to stick with the sadness over the anger. Others around me know about the passing of my friend, but I don’t think they realize how deeply his passing cut me. I remain unable to talk to anyone about his passing, even my partner of the past four years. Even when confronted about how I have been managing the situation emotionally, it feels as though it is physically impossible for me to say anything about how I’m feeling. My body and mind just clamp down. I know nothing will bring my friend back but it just seems impossible to accept his death.",29Nov2019,1

9,"Hi, so I already applied for therapy and I'm on a waiting list. I can't afford to go private. I also don't want to take medication. 

I know how I feel when I'm very depressed, and lately I feel quite ok. But when I start to think about how I lack basic functioning eg making sure I eat 3 meals, sleeping and waking up at normal times, and how I fear applying for jobs, I feel really down. (The last part I have anxious feelings towards.)

So I would like to ask, just how can I start to care about myself a little more? I dream of being high functioning, having a routine, working somewhere, and eventually moving with my boyfriend in the future. I just really feel so stuck. I know that only I can help myself change but it's like I will never care enough to do it.  Thank you very much.",29Nov2019,1

11,"I'll try to keep this short. I have tried everything I have been told and everything I have researched in an attempt to lift my depression and nothing has worked very well. I eat right, exercise, sleep well, go to university, be with friends/family, accomplish goals I set. This is very far from a comprehensive list of things I have tried. I won't type them here because it would take an entire dissertation. I know this claim sounds exceedingly arrogant but if you could humor me I would very much appreciate it. The only things I haven't tried that I am aware of are therapy, antidepressants, and a romantic relationship. I don't really count the last one as an option because I know a romantic relationship would be terrible with someone in my mental state even if I could accomplish such a task of getting into one. But I digress. I have heard some pros and cons of antidepressants but I don't know anyone personally who has taken them. At this point in my life I have made peace with the fact that if all these drugs can do for me is numb my emotions, then I am content with that. But as I alluded earlier, I really don't know what I am talking about when it comes to antidepressants and I would love if someone could whip me into shape on the things I need to know. 

Note: I haven't tried therapy because I know many people who have and I have discussed it with them and it does not sound like something that could help me. Feel free to change my mind on this too.",29Nov2019,1

My life is not bad by any means, I am so privileged. I feel like such an idiot because people out there have actual problems and they are so good at managing them. I am in awe of their strength. I'm just very depressed since I was 17.  And lately, for actually over a year, I've been having really dark thoughts. I want to get better because I don't wanna end up you know... And then I know that would destroy my family which is the one thing keeping me from doing it. 

Idk. I'm so lost and I feel like shit because I'm actually grateful for all that I have but I also don't understand how people manage to do this. I don't get why people are so mean to each other all the time and how they are so complicated. I seriously don't get it. I may understand irritability but I see so much pettiness I don't know how that's possible. I never expected when I was little that everyone was so cold and indifferent to hurting others, I feel a lot of people feel super entitled to hurting people. I don't understand how people live surrounded by assholes knowing it never gets better. Idk.

23,"Unemployed and friendless right now (spent yesterday alone, and only one person outside of reddit even replied to my Happy Thanksgiving messages).  My family is currently paying my rent and bills--but since they believe Satan is the cause of all my troubles, that's really all the help they're good for.  Therapy and medicine has proved somewhat beneficial in the past, but as it didn't lead me back to Jesus, they're doubtful it's any use (not sure if they could afford it or not; they always complain about how poor they are, but then occasionally buy some big ticket item for themselves or send me a pair of $200 sweaters out of the blue).  

Unfortunately, it seems that having enough income to pay for food, shelter, and utilities disqualifies me from any sort of aid from the government. 

I'm trying (and failing) to find another job (and hopefully insurance).  But just looking makes me feel more and more worthless as a person.  I'm qualified for very little and the last time I worked retail/service I ended up with more and more frequent nightmares until I just slashed my wrists after a particularly bad shift.  I know not all jobs are as bad as my last two, but I see things like ""friendly under all circumstances"" and it just reads it's like enabling abuse to me. Don't have a car (or even a license at this point) or I'd probably try food delivery or something similar.

For me depression goes hand in hand with poor mental functions, a difficulty focusing or learning new things, so I really don't see how I could learn a new trade, coding, etc. right now.  Also I'm getting pretty old (40s), which doesn't bother me much (more surprised I made it this far than anything) but does probably influences employers.

This isn't the first time I've been in a bad space, but even if I somehow pull myself together, I feel certain I let it all fall apart yet again.

29,"Hello reddit,
My name is Ahmad and I was born and raised in a muslim family, i live in lebanon. Nowadays I don't even believe that god exists! Excuse me people but let me explain why! I've been doing everything I've been told to, i am not perfect no one is I assume! I made many mistakes in my life that I don't regret doing nowadays! I'm 22 years old, yet I can't enjoy life like others. Why? Well my family isn't the richest, but they taught me how to survive, I'm greatfull for that though nowadays I can't find a reason to stay alive.
I didn't finish my education cause no one pushed me into getting educated, I used to get pushed into religious stuff, not to mention that I am studying free online courses now just to convince myself that I can be something, but being 22 and not having a cent to spend if I didn't work the past day makes it hard for me to believe that I can be something in the future, I'm 22 already !!! I tried everything, I worked when I was 13 :) , work at summer then go to school, until my parents thought that I can work at summer and pay my education in winter, I was a kid, all of what i did was trying not to waste any second I can spend enjoying life cause that's what a 16 yo kid does I believe, never thought of saving money, no one told me that life is hard, maybe my parents being old traditioned is what affected my life.
I always worked in places owned by a family or by a rich person, get paid 350-500$ a month, pay 4$ transportation a day, 3$ cigarretes a day, 5-7$ food a day, do the maths :D
I worked as a waiter for more than 5 years, i am a nice person, people like me when they see me no idea why though :D Once i made 400$ tips in a day, my co-workers got jealous and told the owner that i stole from the cashier, he fired me without even counting his money or checking the security cameras, and i was known as a thief then after he checked the cameras cause they told him no money was missing at the end of the day, he never even called back to apologize, you know he's rich and that's how life works :D I can't confront him im the court because I am not even working at his restaurant nothing proves that cause they don't register your name they don't even pay for insurance companies if anything ever happens to you while working. Not to mention the other bad experiences in other places I worked at ! 
I am not here to beg for money, I am not here to ask for jobs because life means nothing to me now, to survive you need a reason, I have none. But if you're out there trying to quit yours i hope you think about it before doing it no matter what the job is, cause you'll end up being me :D",29Nov2019,1

34,"This isn’t going to work for everyone but I discovered this approach a while back and I thought I’d share it. It doesn’t turn your life around by any stretch but, at least for me, it provided an unexpected mood boost.

So, I was feeling a little down and wasn’t exactly sure why. I decided, “Well, as long as things already feel like they pretty much suck, I might as well do something I hate.” What did I decide to do? Change out the sticky bug traps. We get awful black spiders in the house sometimes. And occasionally millipedes. Ugh. They make my skin crawl. So, to try to keep them from making it to the main floors of the house, I keep sticky traps in the basement. 

Now, I know I shouldn’t look in the traps that I’m throwing out. You know, the ones that are full of dead, disgusting bugs. I know it. But I do anyway.  But, that day, I decided to just go with it and embrace the suck. I channeled my inner 8-year-old girl and groaned, “Oh, yuck, yuck, YUCKY!” Then, “Oh, no, no, NO…why did I look?! What’s wrong with me?!” And, “God, I just looked again!  Auuugh!”  Yeah, dopey and embarrassing, I know.

By the end, I was a little sick to my stomach…but I was also laughing. Looking at a bunch of hideous dead bugs (bleah!) was shocking enough to zap me out of the low-energy state I had settled in. And going out of my way to be ridiculous and thoroughly extra in the process had pulled me to a better place. Plus, I knew that I wouldn’t have to change out the bug traps again for a while, so that was another plus.

Anyway, please don’t downvote just because “depression is serious, that’s stupid and it would never work.” I absolutely know that depression is serious and this is no long-term solution, and for some not even a short-term one. And, yes, it’s definitely a little different in terms of advice for depression but, at least for me, it absolutely did work for that afternoon. Feeling better for an afternoon, or just a few minutes, is better than not.  

So, give it a shot if you’re so inclined: think of something quick and ridiculously disgusting that you have to do. And then channel your inner grossed-out kid while you do it.",29Nov2019,1

36,"I'm writing this to hopefully inspire/motivate those of you on this sub-reddit that might need it. 
I am only 19 for reference.

At the age of 14, I was diagnosed with depression. I had a relatively good life at the time; I definitely could have had it worse. But no matter what, I was constantly tumbling down in my head, the dark tunnel vision was never-ending.

I tried to talk to people during that time, school counselors and doctors, but it never seemed to get anywhere in the end. In fact one counselor left me worse off than I was to start with. And still the rocks crumbled.

It was like that till just after my 18th birthday. I was finally able to try an NHS provided therapist for CBT, now that I was an adult. After just 3 sessions I had discovered more about myself than I ever expected to. I figured it would just be a waste of my time again. Thank God it wasn't. 

Now just over a year later, I can tell you all, that from the bottom of my heart I have never been happier. However, it wasn't the therapy that brought me into my light. You don't just go to a therapist and instantly heal. It takes time, strength and effort from within yourself. 

Over time I have grown in confidence and knowledge which is not instant unfortunately, I wish it was. I made some big life choices recently. 4 weeks ago I was at college working towards a hairdressing qualification (something I've wanted to do since such a young age). Today I finished my first week as a Business Apprentice for a very very cool company. And I can't stop smiling. 

If you asked me 4 years ago if I saw a future for myself, I probably would have broke down crying due to the sheer thought of having to make a decision like that. I recognized that I was unhappy, and I got to the root of why and made an executive decision to change it. And I am glad I've had the confidence to do so. 

I'm not sure why I've written this, or who for. But I just wanted to let you know that people aren't lying when they say 'it gets better'. There is always a door to lead you to your own personal light. I am an avid believer in following your gut because my gut instinct has never let me down so far.

I am not healed. I am not perfect. I am just trying best. Sometimes that's all you can do.

And as a little side note, if you feel as though your therapy isn't working, it's likely that you don't feel a connection to the person helping you. It's hard to open up to someone that you don't feel comfortable with. If it's possible, try to seek a different professional until you find someone you feel comfortable with. 
I wish I would have known the first few times. 

Please don't give up and know that I am rooting for you",29Nov2019,1

I brought up what i have been noticing and asked what she thought about it. And she replied something along the lines of 'im completely over this, bye'. Just out of the blue... i cant comprehend what just happened. I dont know where this came from. I just think i wasnt enough for her, and she probably has better guys lined up waiting for her. Ive relapsed into my dark self. Shutting out everyone and not treatung myself well. I cant feel pain anymore and my mind is in a state of uphoria.

I always struggled with depression since I was very young (elementary school) and it’s been apart of my identity in a way. I just feel my heart being very heavy and everything just sucks. I’m having a hard time looking at myself in the mirror and being happy with what I see. Mostly emotionally which is a suppose because it’s always been physically and emotionally, but right now I’m having a hard time dealing with what’s inside. Every mistake I make or when people treat me like I’m the bottom of the food chain, it all gets to me. Especially when it comes from people I love the most. 

I’ve taken medication before but it gives me a “numb” feeling. As if I’m not really there or really feeling anything. Which was easier to deal with emotionally but it hurt other aspects of my life (sex, enjoyment in things, etc.). I’m not sure if I should just go back to the medication again or try something new but I’m at my wits end. 

So any suggestions on how you deal with clinical depression that’s last for what seems like my whole life, please share.
