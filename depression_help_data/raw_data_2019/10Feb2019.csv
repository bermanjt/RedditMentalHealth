1,I lack the confidence to tell my friends or family that I'm depressed and I'm too anxious to get help that I desperately want. I am only 17 but I have no will to do anything with my life currently and don't think my life serves any purpose to society. Any advice on what to do would me very greatly appreciated.,10Feb2019,1
2,"Like many of you, I’ve been going through it recently.. I’ve been in a job that feels like a colossal waste of time for the past year and a half - it leaves me drained because I am not mentally stimulated or challenged and dispassionate about everything else.. 
this job made me move to a new state where I don’t really know anybody and I’ve had a hard time making reliable friends.. and I’m missing my friends back home 
Recently, I decided to end a friendship with a very emotionally abusive individual who I’ve had in my life for 10 years.. as much as I know it’ll be good for me in the long run, I’m feeling empty and alone.

I’ve been trying to make things better - I’ve been applying for jobs back home (nothing yet), I’m seeing a therapist, I’m on anti-depressants, I work out twice a week (trying to get that number up by it’s hard), and I have a few creative outlets.. 

the thing is that no matter what I do, I still feel sad &amp; I feel very stuck... nothing really excites me anymore and it’s difficult for me to find the energy to do things like work on my photography or research more jobs.. 

I don’t know what else to do - any advice?? ",10Feb2019,1
3,"This shit is hard guys. I had a baby a year ago, and I've since gained a lot of weight. When I was nine months pregnant, I weighed 150lbs, now I weigh 175lbs. I feel disgusting, fat, and ugly. I love my son and I wouldn't trade him for anything in the world, but I miss by pre-baby body. I used to be beautiful, I used to be skinny, I used to feel so confident with myself. Now I'm 175lbs, I can't find anything that fits me,  I have stretch marks everywhere and I hate looking at my reflection. I hate trying to get dressed because it just reminds me of how ugly I am. My stretch marks are almost an inch wide on my stomach.

I also don't have a job right now, I can't get a babysitter for a few reasons so I'm stuck without a job, as a single mother, living at my mother's, and I don't have a car or the money to get one. I hate this, I feel like such a burden and I feel like I'm stuck here.

I barely even leave the house now. I hardly talk to anyone. I have never told anyone about this because I feel like I would just be dragging them down too.

I see people I went to school with on Facebook, doing amazing things with their life. I see them getting their own place, a new car, in amazing relationships. I see it all and it makes me so jealous of the life I could've had. If I hadn't have gotten pregnant, I would have my own place and a car by now. I would have money to go do things.

I feel so guilty for feeling these things, because my son is my everything. I love him more than life itself, and yet part of me wonders what my life would be like if I didn't have him. ",10Feb2019,1

6,"This is the first time I’m being really and truly honest and I just really need some help preferably from maybe some older folks (I’m 20f). I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was young due to childhood illness among other problems but it got much worse in high school. When I was 16 I was sexually assaulted and faced family problems shortly after, i honestly don’t know how I got through high school because I was also facing bullying at the time (I haven’t spoke about this before out of shame).  My family pushed these things under the rug, making me believe it was my fault. I have so much shame, so much sadness. I feel like I have to move on now but I’m constantly reminded of the past I tried so hard to recover from. My life is much better now, a stable boyfriend and hobbies but no matter what I do my depression and anxiety grows. One doctor suggested that I might have bipolar one but the results were inconclusive. I have limited access to therapy (only through my university) and so I haven’t had stable therapy in a few years. I’ve been on lexapro for 2 years  and I feel like it does nothing. 

I’m a sophomore in college now and I honestly feel like I’m losing my mind. My condition has gone from manageable to unstable and I can hardly get myself through the day now without overwhelming fear and anxiety among other things. I feel like bottling up those feelings then and not having anyone to tell may have caused some sort of..  break now that I’m an “adult” on my own. I’m scared. I’m scared one day I won’t be strong enough to not harm myself. I just want to be happy again. I feel like a burden to everyone, when I’m alone all I do is cry. Please help. Someone just.. tell me you’re here and you get it. ",10Feb2019,1
8,"How did I know I am depressed..?

Here’s how I feel..

I am gaining a lot of weight, in my eyes I’m really not sure why.

I cry at night for no reason, I always think I’m just too sensitive.

I overthink everything my friends say as a joke.

Example:

Friend: oh you should really stop eating lmao you might turn into a balloon.

Me: he’s calling me fat I know it.

I want to go see a therapist or doctor but I’m too young to do either without talking to my parents. 

I loose interest in everything social and only stick to my main friends and constantly shut myself out.

I have my happy days but most of the time I’m crying.

If anyone knows what’s happening.. please help and tell me what to do..",10Feb2019,1
9,"Hello all,
My husband suffers with depression and anxiety.
It has always been there he tells me.
We dabbled in swinging for a little bit and I took a relationship too far which opened up a huge can of worms = depression.  It’s been over 5 years since that awful day but we’ve worked through it.  Or so I thought.
His depression and anxiety was far too difficult for him to then handle alone. 
We saw a therapist for roughly 2 years.  He’s been taking medication for about 4 years.
Our daily lives consist with him mostly being over the “affair” with exception to when I happen to stay up later than usual.  
Other than that his depression is all over the board.
I don’t know how to help him.  
I’ve asked what he needs / wants and I get no response.
I’ve tried being overly loving with extra hugs and attention and just being fun silly in an attempt to change his mood.
We started this shitty journey roughly 5 years ago.  These days he’s openly annoyed with our 6yo daughter fairly regularly or spends 80% of his time in a secluded room playing games.  He rarely interacts with her.
He also has a super short fuse with our 2 dogs to the point where he will shove them away (not in a rough manner) to the point that my daughter has started doing it or doing similar things.  I have explained to her more times than necessary that it’s not okay to treat the dogs like that.  But my husband does it so it makes it super difficult to explain it all. FYI I did put my foot down with my husband and tell him that he needs to stop it and that our daughter was mimicking his behaviour and so far he’s been doing better but...
We don’t have a happy life by any means. 
Our daughter is 6. 
She doesn’t ever see her parents laugh together.  Ever.
I try so hard to be silly with my husband whether or not she is around us and he just sits there in front of his computer.
Or he’s basically absent while spending his time in the garage playing games.
I’ve brought up that I don’t think sitting in a garage drinking and smoking will help but he thinks that it does.  
My experience with his depression says otherwise. 

So what the hell do I do?
I know that I opened this door that lead him to this excruciating pain that he’s unable to live with.  
I will always have that guilt that I live with but it’s at the point where my daughter is either mimicking his behaviour or she’s not trusting him with stuff because he’s left himself away from anything.

I do love him in so many ways that aren’t there anymore.  I keep saying to myself that the man I married is there somewhere but he never comes back.

At what point do I decide to walk away or take a break? 
I by no means want to end my marriage.  I love him so much and am always waiting for him to come back to me.  I miss the man I married so much that it makes me feel sick seeing what has become of him.

I’m just stuck right now.  
I’m living with him like we’re roommates.

How long do I go on like this?
I want him but I don’t want to be unhappy forever.  I don’t want him to be unhappy either.

I don’t know what the hell we need.
I guess I just wanted to rant.
I don’t have it in me to add more to the story.  There isn’t much more..

I’m just afraid of where my life will end up if I agree with this cycle.

10,"Imagine being a paper women walking and every life issue puts a cresses in your paper skin. Imagine walking... and getting hit again and again and letting it happen until it becomes hard to walk. And being forced to stop walking, so paper women tries to straighten her paper skin so she can walk again. Getting herself flat enough to walk again just to repeat. How long can I do this til I give up. My emotions do not matter to anyone beside me. That alone leaves me hopelessness.

12,"Hello everyone.

I will provide you a little background information. I have this online friend. I have never met that person but  they are still very dear to me and I would consider them very close. For the last few days they have been very depressed wothout any clear reason. This would happen from time to time but there would be something that would upset them and the period would not last as long as it is now.

I have tried to speak about it but they do not seem very open. I tried to give them space and it still doesn't work. I did my best to distract them from their thoughts but it was a failure. I don't even know what to do anymore. 

However,the worst part is that they have started to be very hostile to me. Every aspect of me seems to be flawed to them. My appearance (I can understand that, you can't please everyone with your looks), the way I respond, my lack of arguments and opinion (they claim that I am not suitable for a decent discussion), even my education seems to not be good enough for them even though I am at university. I have become a bit scared to talk with them because I have no idea how they will react and they seem to have completely lost interest in keeping contact. They still do but it seems forced.

I am, let's say, not the happiest person myself and this is affecting me quite a lot. It has come to the point where I am considering ending the friendship. I really do not want to leave them in such a situation, I want to help, but it is bringing me down too. At this moment I can't stop thinking about their words and other times they have hurt me in one way or another throughout the time we have known each other and it is definitely not helping.
I know this is very selfish but I really do not want to go back to the stage I once was in. And maybe it would help them too? After all spending most of their time online might have taken its tool.

So my questions are:
How can I help my friend? 
Or would it be the best to step back in this situation? ",10Feb2019,1
13,"(Posted this somewhere else already, but then came across this sub) 

Hey all, just really needed to share this with someone, so here we go. 

I've been depressed for quite some time now, and it feels like it's never really going away, as it's also not the first period of depression for me. One of the things that happen is I get very insecure.

Something that happens is I always collapse right after I've hung out with my best friends (we always hang out in the evening). That can be just because I wasn't ready for bed yet and then feel lonely, but when we've met up with five or more (like yesterday), I simply get insecure afterwards about how much they like me. 

The thing is, I don't think they don't like me, but I just feel a bit left out sometimes. I always feel like they have more fun without me. That's why I usually prefer hanging out with just one of them, instead of a group. Then I feel like I actually matter. 

Now it may sound paranoid and all, but I actually think I've good reason to feel that way. Over the summer, I was travelling through Latin America with a close friend for a few months, and as we were in Peru, we were joined by another close friend for a few weeks. I was with my two best friends, but I've never felt so alone in my life. It was the two of them, and I was sort of there too. That's what it felt like anyways.

Don't get me wrong, these are all very good friends I'm talking about and I love them very much (maybe one of them even more than I'm supposed to be - I'm gay - which would influence my rationality in all of this badly). I know they love me too, but I just don't always feel like I belong, and that makes me sad. 

Problem is, to conclude, that I don't really know how to address this issue with them, and it's probably for the best that I don't. I don't want to ask for attention, and I don't want them to try and make me feel more part of it (which they would probably do, cause they're awesome), as it should be natural, without interference.

Anyway, I hope it all made any sense (apologies for any language errors, I'm not a native speaker), and it feels good to get it out of me.",10Feb2019,1

17,"Recently my boyfriend (the only person I’ve talked to about my seasonal depression) told me that he thinks I’m too emotionally dependent on him. I understand why he says that (as previously stated he’s the only person I’ll talk to) and I understand that he said it because he’s worried. But it makes me feel like I can’t talk to him either anymore. 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to be emotionally dependent on someone but I can’t do this alone either. I’ve cried myself to sleep so many times since he told me, I’ve wanted to self harm again so badly, and I can’t talk about it to anyone. I tried telling him that I just feel worse and all he said was “I don’t know what to say”. 

I guess my reaction to what he said just proves that I am emotionally dependent on him but I just need someone I trust to talk to, but recently my best friend has become someone I barely recognize. I don’t have anyone else to talk to, now I don’t have anyone. 

I recently made an appointment to go see one of my college’s guidance councillors, but I haven’t had my appointment yet. I guess I’ll see what comes of that... ",10Feb2019,1

26,"Just a bit of a rant. It’s not really that bad of a thing but I just wanted to talk about it. 

I know I don’t have a bad life by any means but I just feel so sad and lonely. I’ve been trying to take better care of myself. Just eating better and dressing better and trying to find a relationship in hopes that It’ll make me feel better. I did start talking to this one girl and when I asked her out (over text) she just ghosted me and is just avoiding me. I wish people would just be more honest. I want to tell her how shitty it made me feel and how hurtful it was. rather than just being honest with me. It’s like dehumanizing the fact that she doesn’t even think that I deserve a response or a explication as to why I wasn’t good enough or anything like that.

30,"This pass couple of weeks has been an emotional Rollercoaster for both my husband and I. Besides having a 4 year old boy, whom barely listens.  We also now have a 2 month old girl.
We are in a house with 9 other people. Housing knows this because they are the ones whom put them in the other rooms. 
I've requested more room since finding out I was pregnant but was told it would cost housing too much to put us in another place,  since no one here is moving out anytime soon,  and are not helping us find our own place. 
Everything started when we got a letter from our housing staff saying we were over in PG&amp;E, about 400$ over. This is because they house does not stay warm at all and the heater is running constantly to keep the chill barely off.
So I went on a house/apartment hunt and nothing has come through. 
I've looked to get a job, nothing has come through our of the 10-16 applications I've done. 
The last straw was recently when my husband said he would help me with cleaning the house, I'm the only one who cleans the house up after 12 people including my little family, but he decided to play games all morning as I'm becoming more depressed knowing the house is getting worse and laundry isn't even going yet. 
I have a hard time trying to communicate my feelings,  even to my husband whom I don't hide anything from. He's constantly asking what's wrong but when I try to tell him,  it never comes out right, I'm never happy anymore and I break down crying. I love my husband and kids,  I hate snapping at them the way I do. 
I've thought about suicide at least 5 times today. I've tried to talk myself or of it, saying it's going to get better and think of how the kids will miss you but it doesn't help.. is there something majorly wrong with me? I've already written out two notes, one for my husband and one for his and my family..",10Feb2019,1
