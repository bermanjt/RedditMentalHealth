0,"Hello. I am a 26 [M] suffering from a very rare autoimmune disorder where I get ill from sex / masturbation. I am considered good looking, and I'm intelligent and athletic. But I am afraid of the stigma of what my condition entails when entering relationships.

I am a virgin who has never been with a woman - fear of the bitterness of knowing about the truth to my condition.

I don't enjoy living with this disease anymore. It has stripped me of my basic psychological desires as a heterosexual. 

I have been rejected by multiple doctors due to lack of research and rarity of the disease. I just want to be happy like a normal person. ",28Feb2019,1
1,"Hi everyone, I want to preface this by saying I have a good life. I‚Äôm newly engaged, I have friends, and close family. But, as many of you know, that doesn‚Äôt always equate to happiness. I‚Äôve been in and out of depression for years, and lately it‚Äôs felt like my happiness is a precipice that I‚Äôm always teetering I the edge of. It‚Äôs really easy for me to instantly go into a downward spiral. 

Today, I was enjoying my lunch at work, having a decent day, when suddenly I sat back down to my desk and noticed I kept checking my messages via text and various social media apps, none of which were being returned by my friends or boyfriend. When this happens I can get caught up in my own head about being unwanted, and I instantly started to feel myself spiral. I texted my therapist about an hour ago, who ironically has not answered me either. Just looking for some support and encouragement so I don‚Äôt get deeper into this downward spiral. Thanks üôèüèª 

Tl;dr: I get lonely and anxious when friends ignore my texts or messages. Starting to downward spiral. ",28Feb2019,1
2,"So, I‚Äôm younger and in the age to where people who are sad say they have depression. I‚Äôve been suffering from depression for three years now. I have been diagnosed by doctors and stuff like that and I‚Äôm on pills but they aren‚Äôt working. My dad is verbally abusive and calls me fat, ugly, etc. My mom drank a lot (around the time my depression started) and she would get really drunk and then try to run away. She got arrested and spent time in a mental hospital. My moms been starting to drink again and she got scary drunk like she used too. My pills are making it to were I don‚Äôt have any appetite and I haven‚Äôt ate anything in 3 1/2 days. I‚Äôm still not hungry and I haven‚Äôt slept in a day or two. I (like many other people) have attempted suicide and have self-harmed and I just really need help. For me my depression as times were it goes for weeks without really affecting me and it comes back twice as strong as it‚Äôs ever been. My brother is really mean to me about basically anything I do and I just want to leave my house and never come back. But I have 6 years till I can drive and then I need to go to college. My ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù are leaving me left and right and I just don‚Äôt know what to turn to other than a blade. I feel like a blades been me best friend for two years. If anyone has any tips or advice it would be appreciated. Also I‚Äôm only in my first years of middle school so I can‚Äôt do that much. Again, if anyone has advice for anything or different ways of coping I would really appreciate it. Thanks",28Feb2019,4
3,"How do you know if you have depression? I have told my mom if Its okay for me to talk to a doctor or therapist but she blows it off sometimes, so I'm scared of asking again. 

And I don't want to be like those edgy teens that self diagnose.

I space out a lot, no matter what, You can talk to me and I can be in another world instantly. I caught myself staring at my wall one night because I was daydreaming. I also am exhausted ALL the time. No matter what I can be exhausted but still wont be able to sleep sometimes. It's really hard for me to make friends as I feel that Im useless and burdensome.

Somedays I even feel numb, I think about death a lot and get paranoid to even sleep. 

I blame this all on being a teenager sometimes and blow it off but I recently found a reminder in my calendar i don't remember writing that planned my suicide. I hate feeling this way, I can't even keep my grades up in class because I dont understand anything and feel stupid and like such a disappointment. I am distracted easily and I just want to be normal, not some spaced-out-weirdo. I want to make sure that what's happening isn't serious and just part of being a teenager. But if it's not im going to try my best to talk to somebody. I genuinely want to change and be helped. ",28Feb2019,4

I'm always in a constant state of exhaustion, and no matter how hard I try I have someone who is repeatedly reminding me of how much of a shit person I am and I have no clue how to properly express my feelings without just yelling and crying. My mind is filled with self harm thoughts consistently and I don't know how to make this stop, I can only listen to so much meditation or calming music, I can only repeat affrimations so many times, why is nothing working. I'm in this downward spiral of this blackhole and yet I see myself falling down it but I don't feel like I am, I'm becoming even more numb than before, everything and everyone around me is continuing on in their everyday life while I'm stuck here feeling left on pause why can't I press play, why can't I escape this feeling...will I ever escape this feeling üòî",28Feb2019,6
5,"For those of us, who as a result of childhood trauma, suffer from codependency, depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or feelings of unlovableness, our view and understanding of what love is, is likely not the view or understanding of others who did not suffer childhood trauma.

An infant or child has an underdeveloped sense of self and other. Therefore, when parents divorce it is common for a child to blame themselves and internalize the marital breakup as being their fault.

Similarly, in an abusive childhood, on a visceral level, a child is taught that he is worthless, unlovable, defective, lacking on some fundamental level. An infant or child may not even consider that the parents abusive actions are not deserved. 

When such a child survives the trauma into adulthood they may learn that the way they were treated was not right, however, no amount of logical reasoning easily removes the deeply imbedded feelings of worthlessness, defectiveness, shame, guilt and unlovableness. Why? Because the child has learnt a core belief on a deep primal and emotional level. The child does not question if he is lovable, he KNOWS in his core, without thinking, that he for a fact is unlovable, worthless, defective and that he should feel intense shame and guilt for talking about it.

Is there hope? Is there a way to undo this terrible damage? It seems that it is not possible on a purely logical reasoning level. 

This has been my personal truth my whole life and I am now 44. In deep discussions with my wife I confirmed my suspicions that my view of love is not the view of love of those who have not suffered childhood trauma. For those without childhood trauma, love is not something that completes them, it adds to and enhances the complete individual that they already are.

On the other hand, for those of us who are survivors of childhood trauma, at a core level we believe we are defective, unlovable, worthless, incomplete. Our adolescence taught us that love is the thing that we need in order to fill this inconsolable pain in our heart. We fantasize about love, we fall in love with the idea of being in love, such aspirations fill us with a sense of longing and desperation to ease our internal pain. 

The only problem is, is that all too often, this does not happen. Even if we find someone who truly loves us for who we are, they never seem to be able to fill that chasm in our soul. The reason for this is because we were taught to believe, and we thoroughly believed an incredible lie our entire lives. What is that lie? The lie we were taught was that we do not deserve consistent love because we are worthless and unlovable. As a teenager we become desperate for the love, attention, validation and approval of others and we take over the role of our parents and we tell ourselves that our feeling lovable and worthy depends entirely on someone else finding us lovable and worthy. Therefore, we spend our time looking for that special person to complete our defectiveness‚Ä¶ and of course, in our imagination we find them from time to time‚Ä¶ but after the honeymoon period wears off and each persons individuality sets back in, we are again left with this gaping hole in our very being that our partner no longer seems to be able to fill.

These are things I have only come to grip with this week. Like everything, I expect it to take quite some time to heal and to learn new coping strategies. Now when I hear a love song I think, ‚Äúhmmm‚Ä¶ that's a good enmeshment song.‚Äù Yesterday I listened to a long list of my favorite desperate love songs from the 1980s,  songs that triggered in me that sense of desperately needing someone to fill the hole in me where love is suppose to be. With every song, while the emotional memory of defectiveness was triggered, I gently reminded myself that this emotion is a lie‚Ä¶ so far, this has been my strategy‚Ä¶ not to simply identify and correct internal dialogue, but to connect with the emotional triggering memory as intensely as possible while doing so‚Ä¶ today I feel much better, and able to collect my thoughts and share them with you because sometimes our view of love is not in fact love, instead we have a foundation of self hate that we want others to fill because our parents did not.",28Feb2019,30
6,"I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post! I suffer from insomnia, migraines, chest pain, muscle pain, the list goes on and on. My body is a broken temple, and I am but nineteen years old, yet the doctors claim nothing is wrong with me. Not a day goes by when I don't consider suicide due to my physical maladies.

My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didn't want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my step-father who is an anger-addict. I don't have any friends. I've had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I can't even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud!

I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesn't matter. I'm broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. 

I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm going to take some medication to gain me three or four hours of sleep. I know nobody will read this, so who cares? Pizza! Pineapple! Carl Jung! Dead babies! Quantum Mechanics! ",28Feb2019,18

I can't remember the person I used to be, she seems so far away. It's almost like I've lived two lives, the then and the now. Sometimes I sleep in so late, I end up leaving the house without brushing my hair or my teeth.

I've been dealing with depression since 2013 but I never really got professional help because my mom is always too busy with work and she also said the she doesn't want me to take pills or antidepressants. To be honest, I'm very disappointed in myself because i used to be a really smart student and all my teachers had high expectations of me. But ever since my dad died I just became a fucking wreck. I hate myself because all I do now is drink and I even drink alone a lot (I live in the Philippines which is a 3rd world country so alcohol is fairly easy to get). I also smoke about 10-15 cigarettes a day and smoke weed from time to time. I have 3 tattoos and about 40-50 self inflicted wounds on my arms. I cut myself and then when it heals I cut it again. I know you people probably think I'm crazy and I've lost my mind and I can tell you that I also think I'm losing my mind. I just want to end my life sometimes. I don't feel like there's anything here in this world for me. I pray and pray and pray but no God ever comes and helps me with this shit.

I was actually hospitalised a month ago because of my panic attacks.

10,"Literally I‚Äôm such a lazy piece of shit that I can‚Äôt even make myself go get a glass of water and swallow my antidepressants on any sort of consistent basis. Or I forget about them entirely or forget whether or not I‚Äôve already been taking them. So I frequently suffer from withdrawal, often times I don‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on and I have no idea why I‚Äôm suddenly so completely distraught over everything and I‚Äôve very nearly killed myself just because of really bad withdrawals. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll start feeling bad and getting this specific headache+fatigue and I‚Äôll remember how I laid in bed for hours staring at my phone thinking ‚Äúget up and take the antidepressant, you don‚Äôt even have to get a glass of water, just swallow it, asshole‚Äù and I‚Äôll realize I‚Äôm about to withdrawal and I know that if I just take the goddamn pill now, maybe it will lessen that. But I still don‚Äôt take it. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not against taking antidepressants. I don‚Äôt think they will change my personality. I don‚Äôt have bad side effects when I take them. They don‚Äôt even leave a bad taste in my mouth or anything. I just get paralyzed by this inability to do anything but lay still, and maybe watch Netflix. 

I can‚Äôt clean my room, I can‚Äôt do any homework. I skip more classes than I attend. And to some extent I get that. But it‚Äôs the really really little things that require almost zero effort that I‚Äôm still unable to do that really make me feel worthless. Because there‚Äôs no reason I shouldn‚Äôt be able to do these little things like feeding myself, texting someone back, taking a pill, maybe even just sitting in lecture, feeding my cat on a regular schedule and keeping his water bowl full (though I do feed and provide water for him more than myself)

Every time I set up a doctors appointment, I forget until after the date passed or I never wrote the date or the place down or I sleep through it. Or I decide not to go but don‚Äôt even call to say I‚Äôm not going.

I‚Äôm never going to get better because I‚Äôm never going to let myself try to get better because I‚Äôm not willing or able to do the barest minimum in order be better. Even if there was a magic pill that made everything in my life completely okay, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get better. And the antidepressants make such a big difference if I did take them every day, I would really be much better off. But I can‚Äôt take them.

I genuinely can‚Äôt function in life to any capacity and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing preventing me from being normal and functional but me and I will never be able to change that because I can‚Äôt get out of my own way so that I can get help so that I won‚Äôt be like this. ",28Feb2019,4

16,"I have always had the idea of ""just get over it and change it"" when I would hear other people deal with depression, but boy I was wrong. My mother dealt with it and it just spiraled into a shitty life that I was thrown into. After leaving school everything felt great. I had no worries and nothing could knock me down and I rode that wave of confidence for over 8 years, however within the last two years I hit rock bottom. I watched my mother died and friends that were in abundance have fell in numbers(just because life goes on). I lost a job, and all my money at the same time.

I really don't know how to start this. I am sorry if this will turn out to be just a bunch of sentences with no consistency, I am not great at expressing myself.
Back in December, I've turned 25 and I am this point that I really don't know what to do. I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety last year spring and the only help I ever received from NHS (this is UK healthcare) was CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy) which were just bunch of young girls reading from slides how to make daily changes in life and etc. Basically useless. I am waiting for them to put me into the therapy because that's the only thing I think it would help, I hope. But I still don't know if they will. 
I would try to find myself a private one but I have no money. I am working 16pw nightshift job that barely covers my monthly expenses. 
I would like to find a new job but working full time in retail terrifies me, people terrify me, and to find something else it's kind of impossible because the highest education I have is a High school diploma. I've dropped out of the university twice already because I could not handle it and it the programs I've chosen were not right for me. Still, I am applying but no luck whatsoever and even if I get some agencies calling I straight assume that they are scammers or I freak out and bail on the interview. 
I've completely loosed the will do to anything, I have no interests in anything, I used to play games, watch movies, draw etc, but now I am just an empty shell with no passions or interests. I am stupid literally, I can't even try to force myself to do anything because I don't know anything, I am stupid and useless and I can't do anything right.
I am so lost and I don't know what to do. And I have no one, I don't have friends, no family, I am all alone, no one to push me. I practically never leave my room (I live in a shared house) except two days of work and groceries. 
I am so fucking emotional and I gave up on myself. I understand everything that's going on but I don't know how to get out of that empty shell of a man I've become.

I wonder if anyone will read this, and to those who will ""thank you""
I would love to hear your opinions or any tips on how to start living again.

Shes not a chad, nothing like that... just a k-pop loving human. At first i thought everything is okay, but then it kept getting worse. We are in the same class so that means we should be able to talk everyday right? Yeah, no... We have different 'squads'. She is always with her friends and i am with mine. Our class is not one of the most supportive ones either. If there is a couple i our class, the couple will be teased and made fun of for months. So the only talking we really could do is in the morning and after school... and through our phone of course.  One day she was feeling sad that i am not with her that often. I said i would try to change and be with her more. I said i didn't go to her because i didn't want her other friends to be intruded like ""Hey, I'm going to stand here with my girl now."" I said i will change and be with you, for you, and wont care about them. So, i tried that... and i realized... it's pointless. even if i was next to her, i was quiet, because she was talking to her friends. And as i said different 'squads' so i didn't understand anything and kept quiet. Later i realized i was just sitting there, uncomfortably for minutes. She has a best friend in the same class... they spend all of their time together. And then i realized.... i cant even do the most simple of tasks. While she looked happy with her, i started believing she isn't happy with me. While everyone in our class, even the 'Chads' can make her laugh.... I, myself could even get her to smile. I feel so useless. . . she fell in love with me, with such a weak virgin! I... love her, but i feel so... so useless.  .  .

The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable- nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA- even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF ""It will get better,"" and ""You have nothing to be depressed about,"" or ""Everything will be fine because it always works out.""

To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I can't look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself- internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself- and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head.

The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.

I'm a creature of habit. I like predictability and a routine. I know what to expect.

That's not how my day has gone.

First, my day was thrown off with a late start getting the children to school. We ran behind. 

At my dr. appt., I was surprised with a student nurse. I've been working with one doctor for a while now because we're  trying to figure out whether or not I have Crohn's, UC, or Celiac Disease. Having to explain things I wouldn't have had I spoken to my regular doctor first was a stressor. 

Then, a friend (kinda like a mom/family member) of my husband's &amp; mine had to tag-along with him today because her car is being worked on longer than she was expecting. So, now I don't feel like I can go home for lunch without them being there. I use my lunch as a quiet time to defrag in the middle of the day. I don't get much 'me' time otherwise. I could've really used it today because I have to teach a class tonight. I've been on the go all day, and it's not going to end any time soon.

Lastly, I've started my cycle, so I'm hormonal af. I haven't handled today's changes with any kind of grace.

I mentally freaked out when I realized I wouldn't be having a peaceful lunch. I started withdrawing from my husband, in an angry way: slipping my check under the door so he wouldn't come into the office, telling him to leave me alone, blocking his phone calls, etc.

It's not his fault, but I can't stop making it bad. I'm telling myself that I'm being irrational. There's no reason for me to be acting like this, but I want to make it worse. I don't know how to calm tf down.

I  want to learn to be OK alone. I need to accept that I will continue to  be alone, and the constant struggle of fighting this reality is a source  of constant pain and sadness. I want to put it behind me and learn how  to be a stronger, happier individual without support from a romantic  partner. I need motivation that can be driven by something greater than a  desire for a romantic partner. I need to figure out how to just tell  that part of my brain to be quiet, and to seek joy and motovation from  other things in my life.  


Until I can reconcile with the  alone-ness, to view it not as loneliness but as a fact of being, I don't  think I'll ever be able to move out of this depression.  ",28Feb2019,3
28,Hi. I'm not doing okay. Feeling hopeless. ,28Feb2019,5
29,"Really quick. This is long. And it doesn't really fall under any of the flairs since im not here to give advice or ask for help. It's more of a thought dump than anything but I was hoping 

I've spent today cleaning my home in relative quiet and it inevitably led to a great deal of self reflection.

Before I start, I wanted to make a few things clear

What this post is:
1. A call for everyone on here to reach out and talk about anything they are going through. I, along with many others, will listen and respond to the very best of our ability. Especially if any of what I have said relates to you in any way. 
2. Something to contemplate on your own. You don't have to read the whole thing or respond. 
3. A spilling of thoughts I've been cultivating for a while now.

What this post isn't:
1. A means of gaining pity points from people. I don't want your pity. I want your unfiltered opinion and honest feelings. 
2. A contest entry for shittiest recent life experiences. I'm not trying to one up anyone. I know there are people out there who have gone through so much more than I have. I won't belittle your experiences if you won't. What happened to you isn't as important as how you felt and reacted afterwards. 
3. Advice

One more thing. I am sure as hell not a perfect person. I've made a comical number of mistakes in the past few years. But haven't we all? So let me ask you. 

What is depression?

To me, Depression is taking pills twice a day which make you feel more numb than normal.

Depression is the feeling you get after you wake up in the morning and realize that your oldest and assumed closest friends have abandoned you. Given up, without compassion or remorse, because they dont understand and aren't willing to try.

Depression is disappearing off the face of the earth, only to return and have to pick up the pieces over and over again, even though it becomes more and more difficult each time. 

Depression is spending time, blood, sweat, and tears on someone who treats you poorly and manipulates you into submission, but staying because you think it's better than being alone. 

Depression is that feeling when you know EXACTLY what you need to do to make your life better, even if only a little, but you won't do it because you are convinced you will fail before you even start. 

Depression is that feeling that you will never find true happiness because you fear that you have already destroyed your own capacity for such feelings. 

Depression is that feeling when you have given up on everything in life but your breath and heartbeat with those not far behind. 


Luckily for me, I'm getting past a lot of what I mentioned above. I've got a lot of amazing people to thank for that. It doesn't mean it's gone away completely. And it might never go away completely. At least I feel a little more prepared for it than I did a month ago or 6 months ago. 

What I've inevitably concluded is that yes. I experience very difficult symptoms of depression that probably aren't going away completely. But it's not who I am. It's just a part of my life experience. It fits in with all of the beautiful and amazing things that I get to see, hear, touch, smell, taste, and do on a daily basis. 

Much love",28Feb2019,2

31,"Hello. Like many others that come here, I need help. Or I think I need it. Or I need someone to tell me how to help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm a student, 26 years old, currently working on my thesis (on human reliability analysis \[HRA\]) for my mechanical engineering degree. I really like this career. I have studied it for years, and though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, and I had some courses I really disliked, I passed every one of them. There were semesters where I spent most of my weekends at the university, where I didn‚Äôt see my friends for months and I slept like 2-hours most days; but I liked it there: the pressure, the difficult tests and all (mine is one of the top engineering universities in my country). After finishing my courses, I started working on a thesis about fluid mechanics and heat transfer, heavily focused on simulation of turbulent flow. I liked it. Before going for engineering, I thought about getting into science. And this felt like science, it was a cutting-edge investigation, heavily funded. But I couldn‚Äôt finish it. Suddenly, I didn‚Äôt have the structure of periodic test and a schedule to keep at uni. I had more ‚Äúfree‚Äù time that I knew what to do with it. But also, I started having problems with my thesis, specifically, I didn‚Äôt have the pc necessary to do the complicated simulations I needed to get my results. My Thesis Supervisor wanted to help but couldn‚Äôt get me the pc I needed, although he tried.

&amp;#x200B;

During this period, depression hit me hard, and I let this go on for several months. When I finally got myself to talk and tell everything to my Thesis Supervisor, I had already lost a year of my life. He understood completely, he was very supportive and kind, but I just couldn‚Äôt work on any thing related to fluid mechanics again, which was his area.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, and not long ago, I went to another professor, with whom I could be friends with (I think), if we weren‚Äôt student and professor and didn‚Äôt have so much age difference. Anyway, he understood what I went trough and offered me another thesis, on HRA, on which I‚Äôm currently working. This was a little before the holidays, and he encouraged me to travel or something, to clear my head. But now I‚Äôm back, and I must schedule a meeting with him soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Beside this, I have to tell you about my personal life. After a long while single, I have a girlfriend now, we have been together for some time and it‚Äôs going great. This relationship is my peace of mind and source of happiness. But my life at home isn‚Äôt great. We are not doing well on money and my parents fight a lot. They are also tidiness maniacs, which I‚Äôve always hated. We have talked several times, and I know I‚Äôm not young, I should be working right now, and I think many of my mood problems would go away if I was living on my own, or with friends. But to do that, I need to finish my thesis, and I can‚Äôt find the will to do that. I thought the source of my depression was the hard times at university, and that it got worse when I couldn‚Äôt finish my previous thesis; but now, after I got another investigation topic and even after some great holidays with my girlfriend, I still can‚Äôt seem to find the will to do the research, to write about what I have read. Instead, I play some stupid game on my smartphone or watch series on Netflix. I don‚Äôt even like playing games too much or staying in bed until late, but still every time I try to work, I get sleepy, I play without really enjoying the game, or lose my time on memes or other web pages I don‚Äôt really care that much about anyway. Seems like anything goes before what I really have to do, but in my mind I‚Äôm all too conscious about what I have to do, yet it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm hitting an invisible wall every time I open my thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I thought I would feel better when I got past the difficult courses at uni. Then I thought I would get better after changing my thesis. I thought I would feel better having a partner. Even when things with my family are perfect, I don‚Äôt feel so good.

I know this is not as bad as other people‚Äôs situation. I know I could be doing a lot worse, but I don‚Äôt need that right now. I need to find a way to motivate myself to read and to write.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm not sure what I came looking for here, but maybe I just needed to write this whole thing down and hope someone would understand and say something helpful. Or maybe just posting this post, will help me understand myself a little bit better.",28Feb2019,5
32,"I recently moved to another country for a well paid job contract I am almost alone I have the support of my best friend with which I work with. I speak only english and not the local language, I always been a bit shy and withdrawn, I've been depressed in the past for a very long period of my life around 10 years. Mostly because I had around me shallow people chasing after drugs and money, doing bad stuff, was hard to ditch them and get out It meant i had to be alone for the most part, at some point my life got another good turn, which seem to have healed those issues. for a few years I was very good and I said I am not going back to the dark place, even If i am sad ill just wait it to pass I wont over think or make it bigger or cause my self mental breakdowns..  
But despite the money I get this period, I have these thoughts one side is it makes me to sad we are here for a limited time, and from the other side I feel like I don't get enthusiastic about anything aside of feelings/sex/technology and eh weed ( which I used to do often but been long time I m not smoking) this other side of me feels everything is pointless and can't find meaning anywhere. I try to not think about it and for the most part it works. I get on with my daily life. but when I am really alone.. I kind of struggle here and there in the corners of my mind.",28Feb2019,4

34,"I really need help. I moved back in with my parents at the beginning of the month and I already owed hundreds of dollars to the Electric Company from my old house.  I've been unemployed for the past 3 months and have really been slipping into a bad depression (I'm bipolar 2 with infrequent manic episodes also have ptsd). Since I owe the EC money I have so much physical anxiety about picking up the phone and calling them to turn off services. I'm sure by now they have already shut them off, but I don't know how any of this shit works... are they gonna keep charging me? Is there likely a repayment plan? I just really feel like no one set me up to be a fucking adult and everything is so overwhelming I just retreat into myself and smoke weed/ watch anime/ pokemon/ wahtever. I guess the silver lining is that I have a roof over my head no matter what... but god I'm stressed and I have basically already given up. 

Oh yeah, and my student loans (DIDNT EVEN GRADUATE FFS) have gone delinquent and yesterday I bookmarked the deferment form I need to fill out but god for some reason it's anxiety inducing to actually fucking do anything about it. I guess maybe since my parents always got into screaming matches over their financial woes when I was growing up I have a lot of anxiety about money. I would really rather just end it all ",28Feb2019,2
35,"I'm 25(f) years old, I have an amazing boyfriend &amp; family. I absolutely love my job &amp; yet... I feel something is missing?? I've been battling depression and anxiety since I was a teen and have been put on 125mg of zoloft but thought I was doing better and the end of last year I went down to 100mg. I also changed my birth control from the depo to the nexiplan! I just feel lousy and dont know what to do. Should I go back up to 125 of zoloft or should I stop doing this type of birth control and think of something else? I feel like I'm rambling and I'm sorry for that! ",28Feb2019,2
36,"(Besides people love you, and that kind of stuff)

I really see no point in the whole affair, and I reached that conclusion mostly logically, but my depression certainly helped with that realization",28Feb2019,2
