If you listen, can you not judge me? I think I do not need criticism because for 13+ years I have been criticizing my own thoughts. Right now, they barely make any sense especially that you don't know how my life is and everything isn't black and white. Perhaps you will understand me better if you have a clinically diagnosed mood disorder as well. 

I'm just really scared. And thoughts are racing.

I have an appointment with my PCP tomorrow. New insurance, I’ve only seen her once before. I booked the appointment because I am physically sick, but i also have been considering psychiatric help in the form of medicine.

Should i ask my PCP for antidepressants? How do i ask her?",13May2019,1

3,"I've attempted suicide 5 months ago.

Before this, i met a girl. She already told she is with me because my suicide attempt. Don't know if it's pitty or some form of guilty - the thing is, I didn't do this because of her. I fell in love, and she too in the meantime, and have proven it in many ways.

It's great. She is everything i wanted in my life - someone to trust and know that'll be by my side in every aspect of my life. But i guess, we both know it's not forever. We are different in so many things - and I can't be who she wants me to be most of the time. I feel it, she don't even have to say I'm a burden. I know she is tired.

So, I've been dragged down again. It's comfortable to be depressed, I don't have to face anything. It's like my heroin.

Why I feel so suicidal and don't face it? Is it normal to be like this? I barely understand my emotions, I'm just so numb.",13May2019,10
4,"So, I keep running into issues where I tell my boyfriend I really need to talk, but he'd rather play video games than listen. He runs to other peoples sides, though, when they are going through a rough spot, I finally asked him why he'll drop everything to talk to his depressed friends but won't for me. He simply said, ""Well, they are depressed, and you're not."" First, observation is how the hell do you conclude that not having depression means I don't need someone to be there anyway. But secondly, I realized he really doesn't know... I didn't think I was hiding it so well... We've been together for about 1.5 years, and I'm a cutter only 7 months clean, which means he's been around them and he's seen them.  But he really doesn't know that just 6 months ago I finally attempted to kill myself, it was a first for me, the lowest I've been in my life. I was so alone then, no one to confide in, so worthless, so hopeless, so strongly believing it can't get better, and might as well end it now.  I have so many days where I have to fight with myself not to cut, try to convince myself it's not worth it.  Tonight it's so low again, and I want to cut to die... but he still tells me I'm not depressive... How do I tell him?.. How do I tell him without him not believing me bcuz I hid it so well?... How do I sit alone tonight with no one to talk to and not decide to die?...",13May2019,1

6,"i've lived in a very isolated situation for the past 2.5 years and my depression keeps getting worse and worse. i live on a farm in a rural area. i'm not completely alone- i live with my sweetheart and my parents live in a house nearby. other than these three people, i rarely see anyone. all of my friends live thousands of miles away. as a queer person, it's very hard for me to deal with having no community. 

my friends all think i should move but they don't understand how important the plants and animals that i take care of are to me. i've worked really hard to build my life here and i don't want to give up on it. 

i try to rationalize that lots of people live in isolation in situations similar to mine or even more extreme. they get by and probably many of them are happy with their lives. i wonder if the problem is that i don't like myself and don't enjoy spending time with myself. 

advice on how to cope with isolation and/or how to learn to accept myself would be much appreciated.",13May2019,1
7,"A few days ago I had a discussion with my guidance counsellor about my depression I am no longer suffering from and during that period I told him how I self harmed once (I didn't use a knife, house some sharp house keys and even then I didn't cut deep because I didn't want to die. I needed to feel pain, not death) 5 months ago. 

Alot has happened during the periods from then to now however I recently opened up to him about that which I was hesitant to before because I was worried something may happen. I was right.. He says that he may contact my parents if I'm in a dangerous position where I would hurt myself or others. However, I am not. I haven't been having any thoughts about self harming or felt remotely close to how depressed I was back a few months.

Do you have a volume control for your emotions?

I was talking to a friend on the weekend. He told me that his emotions are either on at an extreme or they're not on much at all.

He said he would either be feeling quite numb about life, or he'd be in a rage, in absolute love for something, but none of the variable in between.

I thought about that and wondered how I am with emotions. They're either on maximum volume, or I'm feeling quite calm and content,

I am grateful for understanding my emotions

*This is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years. I have been posting a video daily on Youtube and Depression on my journey to get out of Depression 'Gratitude Bridge'*",13May2019,2
12,"In all honesty, I have no idea why I'm here. I've spent the past 19 years dealing with my own problems in any way I could conjure up in head. Sarcasm and comedy to deflect anything that made me feel uncomfortable, procrastination, you name it. And yet, just recently I feel like my life has been spiraling downwards non-stop. And non of those coping methods seem to help and all of a sudden, I come to the realization that I really need help.

You see, ever since I was a kid, the universe just hasn't been kind to me. I never had any friends during primary school, and those that stuck around me, only did so because they were close relatives, or because they were family friends and only did so out of respect. I was bullied and pushed around for being black, for being scrawny and small, or for just being myself. I ended up leaving the country of the primary school I was in and moved to another country. I realized that I had to change who I was if I wanted to make any sort of friend, and so I did. I ended up developing a different persona. Throughout my days in middle school all through until my last day in high school. I lied about who I was just to make friends or any kind of a connection. Ultimately I winded up forgetting who I really was in the first place. And here I am in the second semester of my first year abroad in university, and I've never felt more alone. 

All throughout high school I carried so much guilt for lying about who I was in front of everybody, I've lied about things I'm too ashamed to confess to others, because telling them the truth now would harm them and myself as well and after leaving I promised not to lie to myself or anybody anymore, but I'm here and I've slowly come to the realization that I just don't know who I REALLY am anymore. Throughout this entire year I've never felt more miserable, betrayed, and just...alone. My academic performance has never been lower,  and all of my ""high school friends"" are gone now. I don't speak to any of them. And the people I'm around right now, I just can't seem to get attached to them. It all just feels as though they're taking advantage of me. I'm studying in a Non-English speaking country and it just feels like a lot of the people that surround themselves with me only do so to improve their speaking skills or something to that effect. 

And here I am just sitting in my room and I'm just...sad. You know, you read a lot of stuff online when you're alone, and the internet is just teeming with blogs and articles teaching you how to ""find yourself"" or telling how you should learn to ""love yourself"" before loving anybody. How can I when I just despise myself? How can I when I have absolutely nobody to turn to? How can I when I've lived my entire life lying about who I was like some sort of psychopath just to make any kind of connection?

13,"You know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you messed up makes you want to crash you car into a tree in the hopes it'll kill you?

Well I've sort found a good way of coping with that. It is very simple. Just say out loud to yourself: ""I don't want to be thinking about this right now. Let's think about something else.""
At this point in my recovery I'm able to just think it in my head when I detect some toxic thoughts and move on. But starting out it was quite hard. I would say this sentence in different variations depending on where I was and what I was doing. 
When I was driving I would say ""Hey, let's not think about this in a car."" Or I would district myself with a ""I wonder what's on the radio. What stations are good? I hope 105.3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now. Or maybe I should listen to pop music.""
If I was walking down town it would be ""I should go to the library"" Or ""I wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now."" 
Basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion. You don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity. Take a neutral stance on your state of mind and surroundings and comment on that. Overtime it can become a good habit that can stop panic attacks before they happen.",13May2019,140

17,"Hi, (m36) as the title states, my depression is gone. My head is not foggy, and I don’t want to die. I don’t desire to sleep all day.

The state of my depression was not telling anyone I’ve had it or getting any help. I work a miserable job at 80hrs a week 365. It made matters much worse. Every morning I wanted to put a bullet in my head and it’s all I would think about. I wouldn’t let myself ever touch s gun because the desire to off myself was so strong. A few afternoons I was planning on it but what stopped me was the legal ramifications for the owner of the gun I had access to. After 18 years I had enough of the hopelessness and suffering. 

So what changed. So many articles seem to be disconnected on what to do to help yourself out. Workout, social interaction, diet, etc. they are kind of right but It’s more than that. First I quit smoking anything that needed a flame. Habits need a substitute most of the time. So I picked up a Ciro vape, then eventually two more so I would always have access and not buy a pack. I still smoked in-between so don’t expect any rapid change. I felt the smallest amount better but still depressed.

Next I went to the gym. All I did was sit on the stationary bike and pedal. Being overweight, some days it was 10 minutes, some it was 30. The point is I didn’t have to know how to workout. I didn’t feel any better. This is key. It took two months of this, 5 days a week, if I could even make it, for two months strait.  I felt miserable the whole time.

I knocked out Most, not all, fast food, carbs and sugar. Taco Bell, Wendy’s, McDonald’s. I have no time in the day so these were easy pickups. I opted for qudoba, chipotle bowls with no tortillas or rice. Note I still ate burritos and fast food but not as much. The depressed can’t be expected to have a mountain of willpower. No soda. Still felt like dying. 

I have no friends, no work friends, no time and a distant family. What time I did have I spent sitting at a pc. I didn’t talk to anyone about my depression and didn’t go on medication. 

It took about three months of mostly unsuccessfully trying to do these things and Boom!! The fog of the depression war is gone. I have energy, I don’t want to die. I’m still at the same job with no friends but I’m better. I’m not saying this will help your situation but it did mine.

It takes at LEAST 3 months in my opinion before you even start to feel better. These articles don’t state just how difficult and for how long you need to do things before seeing results. 


TLDR: I’m better

3 months of:

Limited junk food, sugar, and carbs (thank chipotle salads)

20~min on a stationary bike 3-5 days a week

Substitute all smoking with 3 charging ciro vape sticks.

Still wanting to die the whole time. 

Still in shitty job with no friends. 

Ps: It sounds like all the other lame solutions but it is what it is I guess.",13May2019,28
18,"Hi.

Just having a particularly bad time atm and thought I'd write a post. I have a few questions for people that have overcome depression. I'm gonna describe my situation a bit first. I think there are ways to break out of this cycle because I've watched others do it before, so I'm hanging in there. 

I broke up with the love of my life back in February of this year. We were in a long-distance relationship. We'd met through creative writing and for almost two whole years I thought he was my soulmate. We were compatible in every way. We started our transitions (female to male) and supported each other through the hardest aspects of Hormone Replacement Therapy (your emotions and the way you process them - it changes quite a bit with your hormonal makeup). We had projects and dreams in common, and we'd been fighting tooth and nail to manage to spend more time physically together. After awhile however, I noticed he was starting to constantly put himself in dangerous situations. He'd also start lying to me about important *and* trivial things to the point I was wondering if he was under-estimating my intelligence; I could see right through him. My friends started taking notice of how I was playing the role of savior far too much and putting my ass on the line for him in ways that didn't make sense for my own well-being. I was exhausting myself trying to get him out of situations he put himself in by his own choice.

It took a little while but I finally understood what he was - a sociopath by definition. I.e. putting on various masks in order to give one the impression he's the love of their lives. Further proof is how he cyberstalked me for months after I said we were done, creating fake personas to get in touch with me and going as far as creating a ''woman'' with a tough marriage background I chatted with for a month. She tried to convince me to give him a chance. Busted him red-handed realizing it was him all along just trying to win me back.

When I finally convinced him to leave me alone by threatening to call the authorities if he continued to try to contact me, he sent me a goodbye letter and didn't contact me again. Fast forward a few months and I'm sitting here still completely alienated with the fact I just lost the last two years of my life trusting someone I wish I knew could not be trusted. Besides, we were considering getting engaged.

My day to day is completely invaded by anxiety, depression, and feelings of being dissociated from the world around me. I'm a ''functional'' depressed person I would say, even though I guess the word functional is subjective. Being trans, ace, and homoromantic, I've been struggling to believe in an improving lovelife that isn't 90% defined by disappointments. I struggle to let friends in because it feels like whenever I do, all I hear is a bunch of lectures about how I need to change my mindset overnight. It feels like whenever they need someone to hear them out about a problem, they contact me, but when they're doing okay, they toss me out of their lives like I never mattered. I have one person in my life that isn't like that. We're both depressed at the moment and sometimes I ask myself when they recover, are they going to leave too? It's not like I deserve them.

Also, the job situation. I struggle to find anything worth continuing with. I struggle to have faith in myself.

I have the project of moving to the big city to try and make it in acting. Only way I could do this is by getting a job but facing constant petty rejection from employers. Having a hard time being patient or understanding with the world because it feels like for the past 47586445 days or so, I've been bottling up my feelings to be strong for others.

Also, I have family issues. My mother's dead, my dad's obviously ashamed of me, my brother's this over-achiever that legit always has a project going on and not a second in his entire month to talk, I feel like I'm just trailer trash compared to them. At this point I write RP characters from the wrong side of the tracks just to evac my feelings of alienation and being perceived as a failure constantly.

I spend most my days writing cos I have no clue how to motivate myself to get out there and be around people. Got told yesterday by my coach in what used to be my sport (before I got depressed) that I don't have the mind for it and should turn to my other passions. This rejection from a guy that used to be my brother feels personal, even though I'm aware he's right - couldn't perform while in a fog of pessimism... it just hit hard.

Keep in mind I'm on two hours of sleep, but I feel like it'd be difficult to fathom some sort of reason to think it's worth asking for medical help with all this. What change would it make - taking pills to numb the feelings just to pretend I'm okay?

No idea where to go from here...:/",13May2019,1

I have been diagnosed with depression when I was 22 and I never got therapie, only used lexapro for a year when I was 29 and all it did was killing my sex drive. Now being 30, having had failed 3 startups that I founded and moved to another country which fucked up things even worse. I lost my job and there is no real good job opportunities for me. (Especially in germany, entrepreneurship is stigmatized and seen something like misfits does. Cant even get interviews) Now with everything is sucking even harder after all these years, I think about trying meds again since therapie is expensive and I will be broke very soon.

Even though the last med was useless, I still think that maybe something will help.
