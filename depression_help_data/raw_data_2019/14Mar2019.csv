0,"So, something serious happened today. I am feeling sorry for someone that did something horrible. People are judging me because of it. I really feel like trash, I don't know how to feel about myself. ",14Mar2019,2
1,So today I met with my school counselor to talk about college. We looked at grades for a while as well as GPA and class rank and I’ve gotten so fucking stupid I can’t even believe it. I always prided myself on good grades pretty much until high school when my depression got considerably worse. Combine that with 2 hospitalizations (one lasting 3 months) and it’s a recipe for Bad. Fucking. Grades. I just feel like I’m gonna have to settle for a college I don’t even like so what’s the point. There’s a 50/50 chance that I won’t even be able to go to college. If I can barely get the energy to shower how am I going to be able to manage classes. I’m so lost and I feel like I have absolutely no purpose right now.,14Mar2019,3
2,"Hey, I know I'm pretty young for this stuff (16) but I've been feeling useless and unwanted for years now and I can't seem to find anyone to legitimate help, my parents won't believe me, and constantly say how I need to ""cheer up"" or ""work harder"" when I can't ever get motivated. Everything kinda started with cross country, I was the slowest kid on the team and everyone laughed at me and nobody seemed to care that I wanted to quit, in fact they seemed happy. The same thing happened in high school where I was bullied and almost quit marching band because ""I should get cut"", or ""you're not good enough"" as soon as I made drum line. A singular person got me through that year, though he graduated later that same year. I thought maybe getting a gf would help, it did for about a month, then it didn't. It started to kinda go downhill from there, getting to the point to affecting my grades because I would only want to sit at home and play games, sometimes even just not, and ignore my work for however long until my parents started yelling at me, blaming every single escape I have from this horrible world for it.",14Mar2019,3
3,"I’ve been struggling with depression for most of my life and recently it’s been getting really bad.  Since my mood is all over the place, I think having something to help me track it will help me better monitor my mood and give me more to report to my shrink.  Does anyone have any mod tracking apps they would recommend?  Something that’s relatively easy to use and can help me find a possible pattern (similar to a period tracking app for example).   Thanks. ",14Mar2019,3
4,"I have a very minor case of depression. Or I think so; I self-diagnosed myself so idrk. I'm a junior in HS. Not too popular but not too hated either. I'm about 5'10"", male, not too good looking but not ugly. I'm a little socially awkward so I don't like things like walking down long hallways where I see someone who doesn't like me or talking in class when someone who doesn't like me is also in the same class. Anyway, I recognized that I am becoming more and more stressed everyday because of build up with work and the upcoming prom. I have a prom date, but because of my confidence being quite low and my reputation with one of her friends (a guy who doesn't like me because of misunderstandings, I'll call him Bob) we really are only going because it was situational. See, I didn't really want to go as a friend, but it seems like I will be anyway. All that aside, my friends were also sort of spreading rumors about me. See, I had gotten into trouble for leaving the school without permission a few days earlier and given detentions for it. The next day, I was absent because I was sick (and I was.) My friend (I'll all him John) took it upon himself to tell the whole grade that I was suspended. Obviously, when people I'm friends with say something like that then other people, like Bob, believe it. Then Bob, and others who dislike me, would spread even more rumors. Anyway, since John and Bob are friends, John sometimes tells Bob things that I say but delivers it so that I sound bad. This is causing me to have trouble sleeping (I already have a history of insomnia from when I was younger), and I feel tired all of the time during school. There's only one person in my friend group I could say I honestly trust and I just don't know what to do. If I break things off with this John guy, It'll cause more misunderstandings and just make my situation worse. This whole thing is just making my life a mess. And add school, SATS, college finding onto that and I can barely think correctly. Oh, and I forgot to add- my parents no longer love each other and will divorce once their financial situation is in the green. So I really do feel like I have nowhere to turn to. That's why I'm here- what should I do from here? I don't think my depression is so bad that I'd start abusing drugs or self hurting (at least not yet) but if I keep going at this rate I'm afraid of where I'll end up.",14Mar2019,2
5,"Heya,

I’m a guy from Belgium and a few months back I met this wonderful Swedish girl on Fortnite. Me and her have been pretty close since, talking pretty much every day. After talking for a while she let me know that she has depression, has been for a while and there’s not really anything that caused it, it just happened.

As I’m a guy who tries to help people a lot this made me really care a lot for her, i felt her pain and couldn’t imagine how hard it must be for a 14 year old. We talk a lot of the time, game with eachother and I try to make her smile as much as I can. I give her compliments when I can, also just tell her that I care for her and that I appreciate her so much and I really do. 

My number one wish right now is just to see her happy, she goes to this special school right now and only has like 2 hours of class each day with an exception here or there. She takes several naps every and other than that she doesn’t go out of the house unless her parents force her to. 

She has a lovely dog that gives her a lot of joy, but has very strict parents who argue with her every now and then about things like her not wanting to go to school and she tells me all the time that her parents sometimes don’t understand how impossible things are for her.  She breaks down sometimes and doesn’t want to continue life at all, I don’t really think she’d attempt suicide because of her family, dog, etc.. 

I just wish she was happy and every day I tell her how much I care and that I’ll be there for her but I worry about her all the time that she won’t be here anymore one day. 

I don’t know much about depression but I’ve picked up a book recently to understand it better. I was just wondering, is she going to wake up one day feeling better? Because as of right now I feel like if she just keeps doing what she’s doing now, she won’t improve much? It’s obviously very hard for her to do things but other than going out sometimes because her parents force her to and going out for walks with her dog, she doesn’t do anything else. She also takes  pills for depression.

I’m desperate for help and want to see her better. 


TL;DR - friend struggling hard with depression and I feel like with what she’s doing right now, she won’t get any better, absolutely desperate to keep her alive. wondering if I can do more for her (probably not other than being a friend to her)

6,"So for me, my depression comes and goes in severity. It's always around to some extent, but some days are worse than others. The last few days have been worse. 

And on my days when it's worse, loneliness is my biggest thing. I feel empty and lost. I feel like I'm missing someone in my life to be with and that I'll never end up with anyone. Like I'm not someone who's worth loving.

I've heard the ""work on yourself"" and I've been doing that for a long while now and feel pretty complete other than this loneliness. I got my own apartment now, a job, friends. I feel pretty set up. But it hits me a bit when I come home to an empty house and no one to share about my day with. 

I've tried online dating, but I either get no responses or when I do, they ghost me after a few messages. That hurts because it feels like it reinforces that theres nothing about me to love.

I've been trying to get out and do more social things to meet people. That old advice of do group things to meet new people. Well turns out the things I like to do no girls are at. For example, I've been going to my local comic book store to play cards every week and haven't seen a single girl there. Made some new friends, but no girls.

I had been seeing someone I met for a little while, but she's so busy that it doesnt seem like she has any time for me. Pretty much no talking and we've only been on a couple of dates. So that makes me feel like she's just uninterested.

So here I am. Stuck in feeling that I'm not going to get anyone to share my life with. I feel like im not going to get that, or if I do find someone who agrees to date me, they're not really going to love me. No one is going to do nice things for me at home. No ones going to pick up a little something at the store for me because it reminded me of them. No one is going to write me a cute letter because they know I love getting mail. None of that. So that's how I sit when I'm having a bad day. 

What I'm asking for here is someone's advice on how to feel better about this on my days that are more down. Any advice on how to date when I'm like this would be helpful as well, though I know this isn't a relationship sub. I appreciate any help.",14Mar2019,3
7,"So a little background. (I am 15 btw) Back in December, my parents told me that they were thinking about getting a divorce. I thought it was a good relationship before that so I didn’t expect this at all. I was devastated by this. Since then, a lot of things have just been going wrong. My grades have been dropping, I cry basically every night. I don’t have much friends so it makes school even harder. Nobody really talks to me so I feel so worthless and alone. A couple of weeks ago, they told me that they would stay together, but this feeling has not left me. And just a couple of hours ago my mom asked if I was depressed and I said no. I don’t know why I said that because I really do feel depressed and terrible. I hate myself so much for saying this. I don’t really know what to do right now. If you read this far, thanks for listening to me because certainly nobody else cares. Also any advice on what to say to my mom would help.",14Mar2019,5

11,"this year has been the best year of my life. after spending the majority of my life severely depressed, (socially and non-socially) anxious, and suicidal at times, i finally found some joy. i’ve grown up in a small town where i had nobody and nothing. i finally made some friends, moved into a program where i finish highschool at a community college in the city, got into a relationship that isn’t abusive and is going somewhere, etc. etc., and i have been so happy. but last quarter i failed a class and my mom told me if i did it again, she would make me go back to my old highschool. away from everyone i care about and back into the environment that almost drove me to suicide quite a few times. i told her i wouldn’t survive going back and she basically told me “tough shit”. my environment now is so supportive and loving and wonderful, and suddenly i’m failing a class that ends a week from today, and everything is close to being ripped away from me. 

if i went back, i would almost certainly try to kill myself. i feel like my life is falling apart. i’m worries if i go back, my boyfriend will leave me because i’d be so miserable and see him so much less. i love him so much and he’s the first man i’ve ever really loved, the first one who hasn’t abused the shit out of me. i’m worried if i leave our school and he leaves me, i’ll just let myself get destroyed by abusive people again. 

how do i turn this around? i’ll do anything to save my mental health. after years of therapy and soul searching, i finally felt like i was escaping mental illness. but now it’s so fucking close and i have no idea what to do. ",14Mar2019,3

14,"It's been (as contradictory as it may sound) blissful and empty for me during these past few days.

To be brief, I'm in a diabetic ketoacidosis, with 45 mg/dL of ketone in my urine. I've lost about 10 lbs during the last 2 weeks. I've had frequent nosebleeds (around 4 a day). I can feel my life withering away. 

I'd like to thank everyone in this sub for allowing me to feel cared for and loved during the last month or so, while my family has ostracized me, and I've disconnected with the few friends I had to avoid their judgement and to avoid hurting them (if they care for me). 

I just don't think that life is worth living. The potential happy days ahead of me do not outweigh the misery I have to deal with every day. I'm just not good enough, I guess. 

By no means am I the unluckiest man on this planet. I'm just too pathetic and weak to deal with my problems, so I'm taking the easy way out. 

I don't deserve the few good things I have, nor the things I desire, because I'm not willing to fight another day for them. I'm just too weak and to tired. 

I have been sleeping 19 hours a day, when I used to barely sleep 25 a week. I've barely eaten, despite my huge appetite (I used to eat over 4k kcal a day) that seemingly disappeared. I've lost most my muscle mass that I've built up in the last year or so. I think I barely weigh 50 kg now. 

Despite that, it has been the most peaceful and blissful days of my life. Thanks every one. And in the slim chances that any one of you are reading, I'd like to thank you, Hong Jae and Jung Bin, for being my only friends, to a pathetic human being like me.

15,"This is kind of a backstory but also ranting, if you can offer advice or help me in any way that’d be appreciated.

I’m an 18 year old college student who’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Due to depressive episodes, it’s really hard to leave my bed some days, and I can’t always go to class. I’m failing a majority of my courses and if I fail this term I will have to surrender my scholarship (the only way I could get into college was with a scholarship, I come from a low income family), and if I lose the scholarship I will have to drop out.
If I do drop out I have nowhere to live, and will be homeless. I’m living on my dorm until April then I was going to move home, but my parents and I got into a fight (more on that later) and they kicked me out. I don’t have any backups, I’ve asked family and friends about living there, but they don’t have the room. I’m terrified because come April I will be homeless with little to no support.
My dad is a chronic pill popper and my mother is an alcoholic. My dad abused me for eight years of my life, and my mom (who was abused by him) couldn’t tell him off without her getting hurt. My parents are extremely jealous that I got into college with a scholarship because they didn’t have the opportunity, and it causes a lot of fights between us.
I have a few close friends, but I don’t really talk to them. I might have pushed them away when my depression got worse (after a suicide attempt in October) and they’ve just been distant. I rarely talk to actual people anymore. I’ve become dependent on discord to talk to people and be social, so not really fun. I go days without saying a single word.

I’m worried because I am 14,000 in debt, no place to live, no job, and no help with my depression. I’ve been constantly thinking about suicide and it seems like the best option. I get the whole “life is good you shouldn’t kill yourself, it gets better” but it hasn’t gotten better, things get progressively worse and worse and I’m just sick of it, and need motivation to keep going, but I have no one to give me motivation.

In the same time as my therapy break started I've had another argument with my parents and I really needed somebody's support, since the whole argument made me feel like my parents don't care about me. Ever since I gradually started feeling awful, as awful as in the worst times of my depression. I stopped going to classes, I started ED behaviors again, I have suicidal thoughts, I've been ignoring everyone who tried to talk to me. I self harmed for the first time since May last year. I don't know what to do now. I've had short therapy breaks before but they never made me eel so lonely and helpless. I guess timing was better then.

30,"Tried posting this on r/depression but got no responses. 

Throwaway account - I’ll be brief with the backstory. I was very depressed as a teen, in college i got a lot better mostly due to my relationship and friendships. Im now 25 and 6 months ago my relationship and my closest friendships fell apart, my SO and I are trying to make it work but my depression is back worse than ever and hasn’t waned in the last 6 months despite many things getting better (got a new job, I’m moving away from the house where my friendships fell apart, my relationship is realistically on solid ground albeit still healing). Im considering professional help as Ive never been in the hole for so long, but I have concerns:

1. I want to be a sperm donor (not sure if I will have kids but I have decent genetics and passing them on is important to me), would being diagnosed with depression or seeking psychiatric help restrict me from doing this?

2. Ive had repeated intense suicidal thoughts at least one week each month: I’ve never attempted but have always had these thoughts, they are more intense and more regular now due to the depression being back. I don’t want to be on suicide watch - or be legally restricted from anything. If I tell a professional about this, will they be forced to act or put me on a registry or something? How will this affect me.

3. I have a “healthy” relationship with drugs. I do not abuse any substance by my personal definition and comparison of pros vs cons, but I want to be able to openly discuss usage with a psychiatric professional, i don’t like lying or being dishonest and they have a profound effects so not disclosing it feels weird. Again will they be forced to take some sort of action or put it on a medical record if I admit to it?

(For context I am speaking about mild weed - a few times a week &amp; hallucinogens - a few times a month, maybe once a week in microdoses) Sometimes small alprazolam dosages (&gt;.5mg) for panic attacks or coming down off of hallucinogens.)

I'm wondering if anyone has good tips for dealing with these types of thoughts. I find that I can hardly think about dating most days because when I do these thoughts seem to take over my mind and put me in a crummy mood for the rest of the day.

32,"Hi so yeah, like there are alot of ways to numb yourself. 

My depression always forces me to eat before i can calm down. I think this is caused by how my mom used to make me deal with my emotions. Which make it hard for me to do it now in a healthy way. Usually she’d give me either candy or make my favorite food when i was growing up. Making it now very comforting, but since my depressive episodes have bin acting up again over the past year. I keep eating and eating. Even when my stomach hurts. Im constantly nauseous and i feel disgusted with myself. 

I snap at friends or either hide how i am truly feeling. When confronted i break easily, i am pretty much flunking out this semester of my bachelor. Because of all the stress around my future and qualities, competentions and able to get through life.

I am growing older i need to take more responsibillity for my actions. But al these responsibillities just make me so worried.

34,I wish all of this sad stuff would end soon for me. I feel dead to the world and that there is no light for me. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I always feel left out with my S.O.s friends and ignored. I wish I wasn't so quiet eaither I feel like my own personality is ruining me. I feel drained and numb these days. I wish something would change. I feel alone and I just want it to stop. I feel like I've lost all touch. ,14Mar2019,6
35,"I was recently placed on the drug 4 months ago and noticed a marked drop in my libido and sex ""ability"". (Idk how to describe it...) My husband is very kind about this whole issue, and doesn't push sex, but I'm just wondering if this is normal? I feel better mentally on the drug, but at the same time I'm feeling so crushed because we used to be really intimate and now it feels nonexistent. He says it's okay but I know the lack of sex makes him feel bad. 

Does anyone experience this? And if so, any advice? How to deal? 

I want a good sex life with my husband but I don't want to live life so depressed. I hate this. ",14Mar2019,2

37,"I feel so low, I've split recently from my partner of 6 years, we have three children together and shit has got heavy. For me. I'm finding it harder to care about the impact my death would have and the more nights I spend alone crying, well, I still care enough to be worried. I don't know what to do and I'm waiting for a phone call from the local quacks, but that won't be until the 24th. I'm alone and I'm scared and I want my mummy. I haven't had one since I was three and I don't know what ok feels like. ",14Mar2019,5
39,"I’ve battled depression for sometime,mostly undiagnosed.My background and culture means that these things aren’t talked bout and usually get the old ‘just don’t be’.Im feeling really down almost like I’m drowning and I feel myself sinking inevitably into a hole(what I call my depression)I can’t talk to people mostly because of the lack of people who will listen but also I don’t know how.I feel selfish like I’m a burden.I work and do things a normal functioning person does even though I don’t feel that way.I just need some support or advice to get me through it ,I don’t know what else to do.I want to cry but I can’t ,not infront of people or where people can hear me ,I feel ashamed to be depressed ,almost feel like what right do I have and I know that’s just mostly from stereotypes and stuff.I just want some support or advice ,I’ll take any.Thank you x",14Mar2019,3
40,"I've had really bad depression for years now and its starting to hinder my school life. At first the work of school would help me take my mind off of things but now it's enveloped me so much that I can't think or work straight. My eating has become little to none and my ""friends"" have been ghosting me because they don't know how to deal with it. I just need a place like this for venting and support. Anyone else willing to talk me out this deep spiral?",14Mar2019,3
