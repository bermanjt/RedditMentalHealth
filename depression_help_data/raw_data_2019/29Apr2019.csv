5,"My ex bf suffers from PTSD, anxiety, depression, OCD and it is approaching the anniversary of his brother's suicide. May 7th is the date. 

I don't know who would ever encourage him to move to the same area in which this tragic event happened knowing his struggles with his mental health. What kind of ""friends"" would ever support this?! This seems like such a bad idea. 

He is someone who has written about a deep struggle over the loss of his brother. I am beyond worried that this will cause more trauma and deeply effect him more. As someone who loves and cares about him, I would have told him to truly re-think this move and encourage him to grieve in a safer way. This seems very unsafe to me.

I feel like this is a very unhealthy way to deal with this whole situation. No JOB is worth causing yourself more suffering. It is a constant reminder of pain to live there. There are  jobs everywhere else, why is he choosing to do this to himself?! I am so overwhelmed with sadness right now. I am so worried he may end up harming himself since he has spoken about it on reddit before. He has spoken on reddit about life not worth living now that his brother is gone. And has expressed thoughts of ending his own life because of the tragedy that occurred. 

When I found out he moved there, I was horrified and shocked he would ever do this. I really hope, more than anything, that he doesnt end up doing something he will never be able to take back. I cannot imagine the pain another suicide would cause his family. 

I love this man more than anything and I am so worried.

This is a bad idea isn't it? Him moving there?",29Apr2019,1
6,"Hi all,

Title is pretty simple. Anyone have any good techniques for facing negative emotions--especially criticism? I'm sure this comes from an overall fear of rejection but little things that logically don't bother me affect me emotionally. 

 For example, my Reddit comment a bunch of strangers apparently think I'm an a** for saying. I don't agree and feel confident in my opinion. My intelligent side says I do not care. But I'm also crying a little. Why?? Is it because people usually love me and the second I annoy or make people dislike me for a second I fall apart?

Or my work review that is 95% GLOWING and only mildly critical. It hurts. Why fixate on that? 

It's really easy to fixate on the negative the second I'm alone. But I can't be around people ALL the time. Especially since I live alone.

What do you guys do when alone? My go to is distraction which can be helpful in the moment but it has led to avoidance tenancies in my life that have hurt me. Binge eating and not thinking. It's unhealthy-- it will kill me slowly. But to avoid my negative feelings, all I want to do is sleep or eat :( 

Tips?",29Apr2019,1

9,"(So before anybody say anything, yeah I know I made the choice to use again and no that's my mistake to live with.)  So my mother passed about a month ago at the age of 46ish ( I know I'm terrible cant even remember own family members ages) anyway since then there has been alot going on at home and I dont really do well with sudden change as is, I've been just feeling like an emptiness or maybe just deep dread constantly to the point my chest hurts, and I dont have many outlets I can explore to distract myself a couple days ago I finally gave in and decided to eat a bunch of adderall thinking it would kill the ""VOID"" only to feel worse off for it. I feel like I'm PLUMMETING and there is nothing I can really do to stop everything I've worked so hard for over the past couple of years from crashing down around me. At my job they are being more up my ass then normal and idk if its cause I was out for a week from my mothers passing or because maybe I've been messing things up cause I'm stuck in my head or what? I have to move from my home very soon and I've made it very clear to them I cant work the 12 hr days they are wanting me to and do that at the same time but they won't give me the requested time off to do so. On top of that I was supposed to pay off my probation last month so now I get another 11/29 that I have to ride out and be extra ""good"" because with everything going on money is tight and I can't pay them right now. I had planned to be back out on my own again by the end of the year after I settled all debts that junkie me racked up and now I have to find one with in the month or I'll be living in my car or a motel and I have a dog who Is a very well behaved dog and I would hate to lose the one thing I look forward to seeing when I come home at this point. (I need to know how to make this empty, hollow, dread whatever you like to call it feeling go away I have no time for fun right now I have to much to do) and I'm already at the point of not enjoying things I normally would, lost appetite, lose of sleep schedule, feeling unable to shower when I get up because it seems to much I still do the best I can everyday though washing wise even though I tend to forget oral hygiene often lately and I've let my home become a pigs pin and I hate myself more for it everything is just so fucky right now I want to end it all or self destruct and I'm really trying not too its just so hard!!! I'm not good at coping I dont hold the life skills of your ideal adult and I feel like it's to much to learn all right now ( I really dont want to be the ""FAILURE"" again) 

TL;DR; to much in life all at once, I dont have time for fun right now to much to do. I relapsed thinking it will kill off the ""VOID"" was wrong I dont cope very well and most importantly!!

10,"Hey folks been a while since I've posted and wanted to check in.  3 years ago I went thru the lowest point of life after going thru two attempts on my life and being locked up in jail and the mental hospital, seizures that caused 2 years of debilitating night terrors.  I made a drastic change after trying to build myself back up laying down in bed for 2 years. I made a ""quantum leap"" moved across the country and molded myself into a new routine and life has went from thinking I could just end the game anytime to never wanting to lose power and have a terabyte of storage.  I can go into more detail if wanted as I'd like to but dont wanna bore or push anyone off. Always remember theres someone or something out there in the world willing to lend an ear or shoulder to cry, bitch, complain, yell, whatever it may be that u need off your chest! 

One thing I've always told myself that kept a glimmer of hope in me always is what Joe dirt taught me.  ""Keep on, keepin on no matter what!"" ""Lifes a garden, dig it"" and never know what tomorrow will bring and I always think I'm missing something so gotta wake up and see what's up!

15,"
My best friend and I have known each other for 3 yrs. We met in jail and after we got out of treatments we met up went to meetings and talked all the time. Well after a yr of sobriety we relapsed for a little bit. He ended up going back to treatment and I kept using. He got out blocked me for 8 months then talked to me again and around that time i was doing heroin and meth all the time i overdosed lost 4 good friends and the other friends i had all grew up got married or had kids my best friend has 2 kids and is married as well.

Well 2yrs ago I started suboxone was still using on n off then the start of this yr i really started to sober up and only take my meds. He helped me get into the best psychiatric doc in our area and I've seen her for about 4 months now and tried a couple meds.

My best friend has always been the one who tries to keep me going and sometimes I get angry because he always mentioned religion along with his words of wisdom. Over the last 4 months or so I've really hit rock bottom.

I told him about how every bday since ive gotten out of jail ive stayed at home and cried alone and he offered to do something with me that day. Then went on vacation the whole week of my bday and I watched his dog. 

My attitude towards him keeps going downhill because ever since I met him he always says well do this or that. Everytime I ask him to do something hes busy with his kids and wife. He doesnt work stays at home with the kids all day and she makes candy for a living. I know she doesnt like me and that probably factors in to his decisions.

Idk the last 4 weeks I've been really depressed and told him about me figuring out how and were I'd hangmy self. He always says something that'll keep me going and say that we will do things and I snapped I said cuz I want to die now cuz i have no will to live or go on now you wanna do things what's different now then the past 3 yrs you were less busy when I first met you and only had one kid now your always busy and claim again well do things friends do? 

Well yesterday was his day and he was home with only his son and I offered to rent some movies and hang out celebrate his birthday because his wife is with there daughter at the hospital cuz she has a lung infection well he basically changed the subject and didnt reply for hrs so I freaked out on him and said you always say were going to do this or that but in the last 3 yrs we havent done anything except use drugs for a month together and you broke my car left the next day to treatment blocked mentor how long and offer to do something on my birthday and then go on vacation and I offer to see you on your birthday and you blankly decline.


Idk lately I just want to say things to him that will hurt him because hes hurt me for so long and the things he did when to me when we used. Well I guess I'm asking is there any point in keeping a friend like this around even if it is the only person I talk to? 

I know me always talking about how I want to die and have no faith or joy in anything and being negative has probably weakened our friendship bit the more n more I think about it I feel like if he really cared like he says he'd make time to have a cup of coffee with me at least once a week. Hes mentioned coffee before and I agree and then something always happens. 

Fuck i just want to make him cry and point out everything shitty hes ever done his life. Kinda like the time when we used and he begged me to bring him to meet this chick where when we hot there I got put in one room while they fucked next door and he got high and I ended up leaving him there throwing his clothes in the trash and telling his wife where he was.",29Apr2019,1

When does smiling become too much smiling? I feel like if I talk to any of my friends that it will make it worse because I'm supposed to be the perfect kid with no problems and is good in school. Hell, I've even turned down girlfriends for my grades. I don't want to tell my family because my brother would ridicule me, and like he needs more material to talk down at me with. He has a superiority complex and I problably have one too, but a weird one.
 I do alot of boxing and get scrapes on my arms. Whenever I need motivation or more energy I put one of my hands in a fist and grind it against my other arm either for the adrenaline or any feeling at all. I don't know if this is borderline self harm but I guess it wouldn't be my first.

19,Hey guys I’m new here but I have a recent story I’m really struggling with. So some back story my best friend is mtf trans and we have been friends for about 2 years and were roommates most of that time we have been through suicide attempts from both of us and all kinds of ups and downs. So the other night I brought this girl home and we were hitting it off. Well friend apparently had a thing for this girl also and didn’t tell me. Night runs long and we have a good time. Girl decided to stay the night and she slept in my friends room since both are girls. I start hearing sexual noises and slapping about 20 mins later and about 3 hours after they both some out and girl has bite marks down her neck I asked about it and they both said she had them when she got there. Well we talk and all through the night friend promised me nothing happend. I walk to the bathroom which you have to go through friends room and both are almost naked tangled up in blankets asleep. I lost my shit but wanted to see if they would lie. I woke friend up and we go out side and smoke a cig I ask one more time did anything happen and friend calls me crazy and denied promising me it was nothing. I got pissed and left. Well fast forward to the next afternoon and friend shows up at my parents house looking for me and admits to everything I went the fuck off about how could she lie to me like that and how it wasn’t even about the girl. Now I’m having trouble I don’t wanna lose this friend but I don’t wanna get pushed over again since this friend has done the same thing before. I ask you fair reddit people what should I do.,29Apr2019,8
20,"From Mid December to March I witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. I've been working with my own therapist lately and I've come to the realization that during her depression, I went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame I was feeling.   


I feel totally inadequate as a person. I wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, I wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, I wasn't strong enough to save her. At the lowest point in her depression, She started cutting, drinking and smoking. She also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as ""toxic"" when things were good.  


I tried my best to support her with what I knew at the time. I always told her she wasn't alone and that I was there for her, I encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. When she asked for space, I tried my best. I never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), I avoided her triggers (the one's I knew about). I do have regrets though, I know I could have been a better listener. I tried to fix things for her even though I know now that I couldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

In February she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and I did that for her. It was the hardest time in my life. I was so scared for a number of reasons and I constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from ""she's having fun without me and doesn't want me"" to ""she's going to commit suicide"". We met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and I was in a bad place. I felt totally rejected and I was very vulnerable in front of her. I cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. I know she wasn't in a place to support me, but I was a mess.  


After a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. She broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. I also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that I would be better without her in my life.   


After 6 weeks I've gotten to a point where I understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. I'm grappling with serious shame because I continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways I've acted since breaking up. In the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and I was able to comfort her until she calmed down. After calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. I talked with her after this and told her I'm always here to listen and support her, but I couldn't hear her say ""I love you"" or go back to being in a relationship. She apologized and since then we've barely talked.

&amp;#x200B;

Through friends, I've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. She's on the road to recovery without me, and I feel like I'm still in a downward spiral. She won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all I can talk about. It feels like every interaction I have with people,  I twist into a narrative that I'm a bad person. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, I can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. I'm feeling jealousy whenever I think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then I feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery. It's a viscous cycle.",29Apr2019,74
21,"I don’t know who I’m writing this too, or for what reason I am writing. I only know that at the moment I am not happy with my work life. People here have grown untrustworthy, and duplicitous. I miss how things used to be here. I miss the simpler times, when people were all on the same page. It would appear now that this workplace has evolved into something different. Something negative. People smile and talk to me, but I don’t trust them anymore. Most here are only looking out for themselves, no matter what. It’s not a nice feeling. It’s dragging me down.

 I stay though, I look busy in the office, I keep my head down and earn my money, which is good money. But there is a growing sense of discontentment in me. Something here is not right. There is no-one to talk to. There is no-one to trust. How do I break this vicious cycle? I find it strange. The falseness of everyone here, the vacant expressions. How can someone be expected to work in a place like this? There is just no support, no-one cares. 

People here are like robots, going through the motions of the day, counting down the hours till they can go home. What scares me the most is that I find myself turning into one of them, and I don’t want to. It’s not what I want to be. I’m capable of so much more, but I find myself chained to this place because of the security the paycheck provides, and my family needs that security. It’s my job to provide it for them. I wouldn’t earn what I earn anywhere else…Believe me, I’ve looked.

You have to constantly watch your back. People here delight in finding mistakes. They love a good drama to get their teeth into, they adore focussing their negative attention on others. The mentality is that if they are negative about other people, then at least the focus is not on them…they are not the ones who are getting into trouble. You have to be on your toes and alert, or you could be next in the firing line.

The mental strain is immense. It’s not healthy. The secret meetings people have with the boss, under the guise of ‘work’ but do nothing except make you feel paranoid. The shifty looks afterwards, the half-truths when you ask ‘how did the meeting go’, the false smiles because you know that they will throw you under the bus to advance their own agendas. It's making me ill.

The silences that linger on for too long. Those are the worst.

I tried to make small talk, anything to lighten the mood, but there’s only so much I can say. Only so many clipped answers I can take. People here don’t care about that, they don’t want to make small talk. Why would they talk about someone else when all they care about is themselves. So I stopped trying.

I feel trapped. Totally, utterly, and irrevocably trapped.

Why do I still get the urge to cut myself even though I know how stupid it is and how ashamed it makes me feel afterwards? Why am I like this?? I've been like this for as long as I can't remember. I'm so tired of myself and the way I am. Every now and then, I'll get better and I wont feel like so sad but as I've learned, it always comes back. It's *always there*.

I just want to know whats wrong with me and why I can't have a normal life? I'm trying so, so hard and it just feels like nothing works. Everything feels pointless. 

When I was younger, everyone said it got better. For a minute there, I thought it did.. but it hasn't. It's gotten worse. Because now I'm not upset about stupid high school stuff. Actually, sometimes, I'm not even upset about anything. The storm cloud just decides to pour randomly. It's worse because I am aware now how stupid it is that I feel this way despite efforts to help me not feel this way... I want to be happy.. If it gets better, when does it? When will I feel like I'm enough? When will I feel ok? When will I feel normal?

I'm just so tired and bitter and angry and I can't help myself. Maybe I'm afraid to get better? Maybe I'm scared because I don't know who I am without this? I don't, though.. I don't know who I am. I've been engulfed by this dark twistiness for so long I've forgotten what made me who I am. I used to draw and paint and I was damn good for how little practice I put it. I was a *natural.* Now... I can't even look at my art supplies guilty. Guilt. Is that what I feel? Why guilty? Why do I feel so guilty about my art supplies? I've let myself down. I let my younger self down. I can't remember

27,"Hello. When my depression is flaring up badly i find no energy to look after myself. I know my depression is bad because my flat will be an absolute tip, mess everywhere, dirty dishes and laundry piled high, dying house plants, overflowing bins and spoilt food in the fridge.
I'm trying to find ways to help myself keep my flat tidy whilst I'm mentally unwell.
It's becoming a source of discontent between me and my bf (we don't live together, i live alone) because he is really sick of the mess. He helps out where he can, if i cook, he'll do my washing up, he helps me do my food shops and reminds me to take the bin out, he'll clear up small bits of mess, sweep the floors which I'm grateful for. However there's just a lot of mess that he trips up on and gets upset about because it makes his stay unpleasant. I want to keep the place tidy for both of our peace of minds. The mess is stressful for both of us.

28,"Hi everyone! I am new to reddit, literally this is my first post. Anyway, I have been struggling with depression for awhile now. No one really believes me (other than my doctor) because they see me as an upbeat and always happy/positve person all the time. But they don't know how sad I feel and how much I don't want to be around humans like ever. I pretty much only go to work each day. I never have energy. I wish I could just stay in my bed forever. Some of it may be my weight (I'm 5'2 and weigh 228lbs). I am embarrassed to leave my house a lot of the times. So I finally had the courage to talk to my doctor and she prescribed me two antidepressants which seem to be going well. I seem to be happier, even my boyfriend noticed that I am less bothered by little things. I feel better overall. I am happy that I am on them. I was even able to lose 15lbs on them which has made me very happy. But the issue is, I still don't have energy. I still don't have the will and want to get out of bed. I don't want to leave my house still. It's bothering me a lot. 

So anyway, I feel happy and I want to continue taking the two antidepressants, but I want to ask my doctor if I could also start Adderall. I am very nervous to do so because of the associating stigma it has around it. Like she'll think ""you only want that to sell it"" or something. Also, I do not have ADHD. I want it to help lose more weight and to feel awake again. What do you guys think? I think i need a stimulant along with the other stuff. Please respond, firstly, I really don't want her to just flat out be like ""no you cant try that"". Can she do that? Also, I don't want her to think I am crazy for asking for it.

29,"TL;DR create positive affirmations for each day of the week to begin building an overall more optimistic mindset. Here's my example.

I just started my first full-time job that will possibly turn into a career as a 22-year-old. I've worked part-time in office jobs while I attended college full-time so I'm used to being able to leave early/not have 40-hour weeks M-F. I'll admit, it has been depressing to get used to in these last seven months I've been here. I honestly feel like I'm wasting my life away in an office without fresh air; a prisoner to the economy, especially while trying to keep my head above water here in costly Southern California.

However, I've found a method to help me ""live in the moment; appreciate the present."" I basically see every day as it's own little holiday/event. This prevents me from seeing every weekday as a mundane prison.

Let's start with today, Monday, most people's least favorite day. I say, *""Happy Monday,""* because I'm blessed enough to have a job to resume after the weekend. It's also oddly comforting that others dislike Monday's because I feel like I'm not alone.

*""Happy Tuesday,""* because it's almost Hump Day! Nearly halfway through the week, not quite yet, but it's also not Monday!

*""Happy Wednesday,""* it's officially hump day. You're halfway there, you've been strong enough to complete two days, and you're going on three!

*""Happy Thursday,""* you're almost to Friday, and in my case this is the final day that you're required to wear uncomfortable business-casual clothing (we get Casual Friday with jeans &amp; sweatshirts).

My favorite, even more so than Saturday, ***""HAPPY FRIDAY!""*** Everyone is happy that it's Friday, maybe some people have begun their weekends early, I'm in my comfortable, favorite clothes. We've worked hard all week and we've made it! I make a big ass deal out of this and celebrate myself. Maybe order a pizza or have a cookie. You **deserve** this happiness. Make some plans to watch a good movie at home or go out if that's your thing. This is what you've been waiting for, enjoy this WHOLE day, even if you spent eight hours of it in your office.

*""Happy Saturday,""* this is your day off, maybe do some chores while you have the time, make your living space comfortable and pleasant/peaceful. Or just take it off and do some self-care either mentally or physically. Take that day-trip you've been saving up for, or stay home knowing it's a frugal choice!

*""Happy Sunday,""* this is normally a difficult day for me. I find myself reevaluating my choices and consider making changes to have a shorter commute, save money, be closer to my family, etc. The most effective way for ME to really fight any negative Sunday scaries is to get out of bed, shower and physically take steps toward productive actions such as more chores, maybe even go on a walk to get myself outdoors. Sunday evening I try to center myself and channel all that I'm thankful for to begin the next week on a positive note, seeing it all as a new cycle to begin, working toward my FAVORITE day, Friday, and starting it all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, this is what really helps me get through this time and motivates me to keep on keepin on. I really benefit from looking forward to something even if that sort of defeats the purpose of ""living in the moment,""... I hope I helped someone out there. You're never alone in this. Friday will be here soon enough, and the cycle will repeat itself :)",29Apr2019,1

I’m in senior year and I’m preparing for university exam and this exam is really really important and they’re gonna ask all subjects of high school 

Anyways that’s why I need to study I know I need to study but my body is just not working, I just lay down at my bed doing nothing. Everybody is pushing me to study but I just CAN’T. I don’t wanna do things like playing computer games or going to a mall etc. I don’t wanna meet with someone. My mind is like a hell to me. I think I overthink things. I’m really stressed and I’m using antidepressants and also I have ADHD I really don’t know this is the right place to post this stuff. If it’s not the right place pls tell me where I can talk about this stuff",29Apr2019,1
31,"I have this little problem...and is not little but an huge problem...i act and talk like somebody i know is not the real myself, like i have created 2 different versions of me, like two persona, 2 exageration of the 2 sides of myself.
One is like a kid, annoying, childish and i act like a... kid so i do what a kid does and i force myself to laugh to every joke and to be Happy and playfull like a kid, this persona comes out when im at school most of the times and everyone tells me i am a kid, i think you get it. 
The second is the opposite, i lose my will to live, i get tired, angry and something i punch walls, myself and have self destructive behaviours and get depressed and annoyed but luckily i haven't touched anyone yet and this second side comes out when i am stressed or annoyed by something.
All the times i act like one of the two persona im concious and i keep asking myself why im doing it, and i cant controll it, im slowly getting hated by everyone, my self too! 
And now that i have realized what is my biggest fear, being judged and criticized and that's wha people always does to me, i think i can get trough this and be again myself.
So guys if you have a problem it could help you to find out what's your fear and fight it, like me.
Don't criticize me for my bad english but english is not my First language.",29Apr2019,3
32,"I’ve debated a long time if I should make this post here or not. I never wanted to call myself depressed, because I feel like I have no reason to be. I have a wonderful family, the most amazing girlfriend, I’m decently smart. Why should I be depressed when there are people out there going through tougher shit than me? It makes me feel guilty. But I just have this heavy blanket of disdain and dread for my life which I continually screw up. I had a full ride to the college I loved. I fell into a funk and never left my dorm room. Had to leave after the first semester. Now I’m back home going to a community college, all was going well, I was feeling good. Then my stepdad forced me to get a job that I hate. Since then I’ve missed classes and I have missed papers. Finals are coming up. I don’t know if there’s even a possibility I’ll pass. I don’t know what I’m going to do. The part i hate the most is the disappointment I’m going to see on my mother’s face. I have so much going for me but I continue to sabotage myself. My room is a complete fucking mess, I can’t make myself clean it. The only reason I do anything is because I have to go to work and I have to put on a face with for my girlfriend. She knows somethings wrong but I tell her it’s okay. She will think it’s her fault and she’s wrong. She is one of the few things to keep me from falling farther. I don’t want to hold her back though, she has a lot going for her and she needs other people like that in her life, not me. Just another thing on this mountain of shit. I don’t know what to do. I’m not suicidal, but I do think about leaving. Just out of the blue, out of everyone’s hair. They would be sad, but better off. I would ask for help, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t think my mom will completely understand and my stepdad and real dad are definitely not an option. They are the type to see it as being a pussy, and honestly sometimes I do feel like I am. This is just a rant, but if one of you who read this would like to talk or offer any advice or if you just want to rant too, that would be nice.",29Apr2019,14
33,I been really sad a lot of the time and I always extremely bored i have nothing to do ever and it’s always like that. I don’t want to label myself as depressed because I have nothing really to be depressed about.

I told my boyfriend about my suicidal thoughts and he gave me this hard hitting speech about how if I killed myself he would become depressed and just wouldn’t have the motivation to move on... he then ended it if with “DON’T FUCKING KILL YOURSELF”  and at the moment I honestly felt like a peace of shit for even thinking of it... but the next day was so bad.

38,"  

Here we go…

24 years and it still feel like stuck somewhere. Barely can remember any good memories from my childhood beside maybe playing jump rope with other kids. The most vivid memory is when I was a kid in my bedroom boiling in anger about being sent for punishment.  


Point learned, hated them to death. I was so mad that I wanted to kill someone, then somehow along the way to high school, it went from anger to others, to anger to my own stupid trash self. Then to thoughts about why the fuck I am still alive if nobody even need me, seriously. I could just end it and nobody would care, but I couldn’t even try since I despise pain. So then it went to thought about how to die without it being painful, I don’t know, hanging? drowning? Did read that it was as painful but I was too much of scaredy-cat to even try that.  


Somewhere along the way, I don’t remember why I start writing poetry and the likes, but although I hated studying it was more comforting being at school since the moment I got back home it felt like a nightmare. Don’t get me wrong, I do not think that my parents are that bad compare to others stories I seen out there? I think it mostly come from the constant remarks all over my lifetime and now it just stuck in my head.  


“Do the dishes since you do nothing else in the house”, “Why you failed class, you didn’t study”, “Don’t embarrass me”, “Why would you sleep at a friend house, I didn’t do that when I was young”, “Why do I need to explain to you, you should understand it without being told”, “You won’t sleep until your done studying” and it goes on.  


Coming from a student who always get C’s, once I read home I got no motivations, except if their no one else in the house and I live with my mom. The dishes pilled up, it my fault. The laundry is not done, its my fault. Your fat, stop eating,;my fault. Why is there no dessert? ; I didn’t buy any, guess its my fault. Why did you buy dessert? ; You say not to buy any… but I guess it’s also my fault. Even giving good advices get thrown aside, at this point because she doesn’t listen, she is going to lose both her house and all the hoarding she is keeping here. I also got no bedroom, well there is one but there so much shit in there that I can’t even get the energy to empty it. And then, empty it where? The whole house a cluster fuck. First panic attack I had when alone at home was because I had a bad mark in highschool. Also had to redo my 2nd year twice.  


Failed College classes too often, so I was dismissed. Mom sent me to another province to live with my dad  cuz I was useless weight I suppose. I got my retail job, I had more fun talking to colleagues and random strangers than my family. But as someone who never really broke the routine of \[School to Home\] or \[Work to Home\], I found it weird and usually declined if there was an event that was outside the workplace.   


Got back to my home, thought Its more of a hellhole at this point, transferred workplace so I could stay in the company, Now I learned my sister was complaining about how useless I was in the other province but I mean nothing can surprise me at this point. I applied to university. First semester went great, 2nd was eh, now it been downhill since then. I even got 2 F’s! If even the university dismiss me I think ima lose it Doesn't help that I still get blamed for anything. I though of talking to a psychologist, just because I think talking help. Yet whenever the next day come by, I’m like nah why waste the dude time, there more people that urgent help and who said I was depressed?

TL;DR

Maybe depressed? For like my whole life?

Parents are hoarders and they can’t take advices

Bunch of issues (ex: overweight, dentist, doctor)

I can’t study, I can’t concentrate

Home feel like a trash can

Life is a pain

Ain’t suicidal, but I don’t mind if death come soon.   


I could write more but I think I wrote too much...

Well even typing this, it felt like my mind was telling me it is a waste of time, so Sorry if it is to anybody.   .\_.""",29Apr2019,1
39,"Hi, just a bit of context before my question, I tend to struggle with anxiety and depression. Its not always, sometimes I'm fine, but it comes and goes. Sometimes it comes really hard as a form of  anxiety, which messes up with my head and I am just unable to keep doing my office work. I am currently being treated for chronic gastritis. I don't consider it lethal but it worries me sometimes as its ""chronic"". I also have other personal issues, but its not life threatening so far. One day I was just thinking too much about it as I had a severe gastritis episode on the weekend. This probably triggered an anxiety attack and I was just unable to keep typing on the screen and I cancelled a meeting. I messaged a friend telling her how I was feeling. According to her point of view, my problems have a solution, so she didn't see anything wrong with me. I assume she thinks is no big deal. I told her the thoughts that were going through my head, being ""I feel this has been a horrible month"". Then I said, ""I'm starting to think 'I don't care anymore, its fine if get whatever illness, no one is going to care anyway'"". She responded: ""I'm upset, I won't listen to you anymore if you keep that attitude. You never see what good things you have in life. I hate Emotial Blackmails and really, thats some way to make someone feel bad. If you have something to say, just say it. Nothing has happened to you. Eventually, when something bad happens to you, no one will believe you. Learn to appreciate the good things you have, I better stop. Bye""

After that, I just apologized and that was it. I did not mean to blackmail anyone. Was I really in the wrong? I don't understand. I thought that I was supposed to share my problems with my friend(s) so I could feel better about it. Am I really blackmailing by saying these things? I think its easier if I just wait for it to pass instead of freaking out and trying to reach someone out.",29Apr2019,1
40,"I'd like to give me background a little bit. I'm 20, and I've been on my own since I was 16. I have been suicidal/depressed since I was around 10-11 years old. I started hanging out with 'the bad"" crowd and smoking ciggerettes around 12. My dad let me get drunk as young as 8 years old. And regularly when I moved to his house when I turned 11. I started smoking weed shortly after cigs, and started drinking extremely heavy when I got put on probation at 14. My girlfriend around that age (14) cheated on me several times and I had such low self esteem about my self I went back to her every time. I didn't want to go to the beach with her the next year, so she took another guy (obviously she was talking to him way beforehand in order for a 15 year old to just be allowed to go to the beach with another family). But a week after she started hanging out with my friends and I wouldn't have been able to handle my friends being with her. I popped my first Xanax that day, actually about 5mg. And ended up sleeping with her. A few months later we find out she's pregnant. She swore up and down that the baby was mine because they used condoms at the beach. So I stayed with her, took care of her and was there for the birth of the baby. Got a paternity test and she wasn't mine... My teenage years are such a blur so I'm sorry if some of these events are out of order. When me and this girl first got together she told me she was a virgin, as was I. Then I find out she's been with 1 guy(fine whatever) then it was 2. Then it was closer to 10 with most of them being 20-25 years old (she was 13). She cheated on me with a few of my friends and obviously some grown men. My mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2012. I was 12-13 at the time. But anyways, between the time I was 14-16 I tried killing myself many times. I had a 12 gauge Remington beside my bed for a few years. I was close many times. The time that really opened my eyes I had finally decided it was time to go. I put a shell in and chambered it, put it under my chin and pulled as hard as I could. My entire body was numb, cold. I switched the safety off. Me and my dad had a lot of problems because I was smoking weed (helped a lot with my depression and anxiety). And he was okay with me drinking til I pass out but not smoking marijuana. He grounded me for a month for having a pipe in the house. My anxiety was severe and it was driving me crazy being inside. So I started sneaking out and he caught me. I ran away with no money. Just a pillow and some clothes. Got caught about a week later and was grounded for 6 months. And the suicidal thoughts got really bad. Soon after I got kicked out. With no where to go, I turned to the same girl earlier in the story. We lived together for about a year before we split up. When we split up I got into Ritalin and pain pills (never got addicted but it definitely eased the pain). A few months of nonstop smoking weed and partying with friends I went back to her. I was never really that great of a boyfriend to her because of all of the lies and cheating. But I loved her to death. Here I am at 20, wanting to kill myself. I have my own little boy he's a year and half, and I'm raising the other little girl as my own she's almost 4. I had a good job welding and I left it and no where else will hire me. My GF had to get a job and I just lost myself. I've been unemployed for almost a year. She already left me. But I got her back. She is going to the airforce and I think she's going to leave me. I don't do any drugs or alcohol at this point in my life, I chew tobacco though. I just don't know what to do. I don't have my driver's license because I never had anyone to take me driving. I think my GF is just staying with me because she knows I'm depressed and my mom isn't doing well. My mom actually just got diagnosed with another form of cancer (breast cancer) and they think it's too late... Sorry for giving my whole life story, I just don't have anyone else to share it with. I don't want to leave my kids behind but I definitely don't want to live anymore. I'm not a very good father anyways... Idk anymore.... I don't have it that bad compared to most, I know. But I just can't do it anymore.:/",29Apr2019,1
41,"I'm in a dilemma. I feel so anxious and upset all the time but on paper I really have no reason to.

I (f30) work an office job. It's not by any means difficult, if anything it's monkeys work, but it's super busy and super high pressure. This means I usually have to work long hours at high stress  - usually about 50 hours per week (37.5 is standard work week in my country).  But I'm well paid, I have incredible benefits. I live in a nice apartment in the most expensive part of town. I have tonnes of friends and a wonderful boyfriend. Sounds perfect, but I feel like this is the greatest waste of life. 

I don't have time to see my family or friends. By the time I get home from work/run errands/ cook /clean /wash I have no time for hobbies or to spend with my boyfriend. I can't afford to leave my job because I will have to move outside of the city and dedicate circa 3 hours to commuting every day, plus I would have to give up my health insurance / pension contributions. I feel like I'm racing to the weekend to just catch my breath so that I can pour another week of my life into the corporate black hole. I feel like I've spent my 20s trying to keep my head above water, just surviving until I can get to retirement at which stage I might finally start to live. Then I'll have about 10 years to live before I probably die.

42,"This is hard for me to do because I feel as if I don’t really know exactly how to explain things, and honestly I feel too I have trouble letting go of things that I have to try to overcome. 

First I’m 25 years old and have never been in any form of relationship at all. And it’s not for the lack of trying but a lot of timing, most women I try to engage with to see if they even want to get coffee or anything seem to already have a boyfriend.  Recently though I reviled my feeling to a wonderful woman that I have a huge crush on and... she was kinda enough to let me down easy saying “I have a boyfriend but I don’t want that to stop you from talking to me.”  I do appreciate her doing this and still wanting to have a friendship with me, but right now my mind is trying to keep calm, trying not to weird her out or trying not to ruin a friendship we have.

Every time she comes to the store I feel the happiest I’ve ever been in a long time. I just fear that the line of obsession will rear its head and cause me to go even stupider than before. She is dealing with a lot in her family and I bumblingly say “if you need a break or anything I’d like to help.” She was off in a rush to deal with said family problem but afterwards I kept remembering she has a bf and she is dealing with a lot right now and your not help but becoming an annoyance by doing stuff like that. 

As I said I’m having trouble moving on because to me she is someone worth fighting for. She a social work helping people. But unfortunately I don’t want to keep opening my heart this way or trying to fumble around figuring out what to say to the next person.
