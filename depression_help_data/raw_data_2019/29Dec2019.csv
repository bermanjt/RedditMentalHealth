2,"So I have been a recovered depressive for a while. I’ve actually been happy for the past couple of years (was in a great relationship, got a new job, etc.). My relationship ended in April, which was tough, but I was still doing ok. Now this past week has been terrible. I broke my finger and had to have surgery on it so I’ve been stuck at home with my parents, not able to do much. I feel like nobody cares about me. Nobody has even offered to come see me after my surgery. If I got cancer, would anyone even really care? I feel so alone and lost. A couple months ago, I stopped taking antidepressants because they weren’t helping me. I went off of them slowly under my doctors watch and had no withdrawal symptoms. Now my parents won’t shut the fuck up about me needing medication even though it never helped me in the first place. On medication, I was still cutting, depressed, and suicidal. Them acting like medication will solve my problems is making me feel even worse. I’m very depressed and angry and don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’ll fully relapse into the worst depression I’ve ever had, but I’m feeling really terrible right now.",29Dec2019,1
3,"We hangout 4 times a week, I really like him and he really likes. But for some reason I was and I don’t know why. I feel weird when he’s gone. I’ve liked guys before and been in a relationships but this one is weirdly different and idk what to feel or do. Why do I feel sad. It’s not the regular sad it’s the ugh sad I’m frustrated and everything is pissing me off the only time that I feel good is when he’s around. How do I make myself feel good when he’s not around. I wanna be around him all the time but I know that’s not right and need to give him space what do I do?",29Dec2019,1
4,Hello everyone I'm new here. I hope that you guys and girls can help me. Support from strangers always seem to be better than people you personally know... Maybe it's the unbiased aspect of it. Anyway. I am diagnosed with more than just depression but as we know sometimes depression can cause memory issues and forgetfulness. In my home especially I am asked to do things and sometimes I forget to do it or don't remember being asked at all and then I normally get yelled at or I get a bad attitude directed at me. I have tried to explain why I forgot it why I forget but it doesn't seem to work. Have any of you had to try and explain this problem to people? I wish I could get people to understand. Anyone have any advice on how I can do this in the best way possible?,29Dec2019,2

7,"So my depression/anxiety has been getting progressively worse. It’s gotten to the point where I find myself crying for no real reason except that I somehow upset myself with imagined feelings like for example, my friends hate me which they most certainly don’t. I’ve also found myself to be heavily disassociating and feeling like I’m not even real.

I know I need help but I’m stuck in the spot where I cannot get professional help because I have no insurance.  I know there are other options like online therapy, but I’ve had issues with that in the past because I won’t find time to respond, and plus I do better face to face. 

What else can I do?",29Dec2019,1
8,"Every day I wake up and I'm always feeling low. Every day feels like a hellhole that I have to claw my way out of. 

Most of the time I feel like I can't function as a human being or get out of bed. Let alone work on schoolwork like I'm supposed to. I don't think I've learned anything this year in algebra but I have the ACT this year. But I can hardly muster up the effort to study or concentrate. Even though I worry about it constantly. Even just going outside takes a tremendous amount of effort.
When my depression gets really bad, I tend to have a floaty, dissociative unrealness.

My dad died from a drug overdose recently (we don't know if it's a suicide), and my dog is getting a lot of medical conditions caused by aging, so I'm struggling because of that.

I'm also battling severe gender dysphoria (I'm trans) and I constantly hate my body because of my sex characteristics (I was born female). I constantly want to claw off my chest or just take a knife and cut off my chest, and every time I get gendered as ""she"" by my family hurts. 
Even though I like typically ""girly"" things, I want to die because I was born female.
I don't think I necessarily identify as completely ""male"" but I don't relate to myself as being female either. Because I'm not sure I want to fully transition to male, it makes me scared to tell my family to use the right pronouns for me. (The people in my family are all conservative christians.)
Even though I'm suffering, I feel like I ""have to be doing this for attention"".
The fact that I'm going through this makes me feel like a freak who doesn't deserve love. 

And the family I live with often say things like, ""You should feel grateful because I came all the way out here to pick you up when I could be watching the ball game"", or ""you should feel grateful that we put food on the table for you"". At the same time they won't allow me to get a driver's license or a job while I'm living with them.
It makes me feel like a burden all the time. I feel like a burden because my parents had to take care of me as a baby. I feel like I don't really deserve that kind of love or attention.

All this along with my regular depression (I'm on antidepressants). Every day I wake up and every day I want to die. Every day I feel worthless, I feel hopeless, I feel easily agitated, and my mood can switch back and forth minute to minute. I can feel somewhat decent one minute and the next I can hate the world, and hate people, and want everyone to suffer and hurt in the worst way possible (say, a drive by shooting) before throwing myself off a cliff.

And everyone around me is saying everyone my age fakes their depression for attention, and that 16 is too young to have depression. 
I feel aged past my years, like my brain is aged past it's years, and I want to just pass away or be euthanized or something, to find some peace and to stop hurting.
I don't know what to do with these feelings.",29Dec2019,1
9,"I can’t talk to anyone I know because of personal reasons and the people who do know me don’t listen or aren’t supportive. So I had been through a good relationship, I had felt happiness again, and then, shortly afterwards, I did something that I hadn’t meant to do. I don’t want to type it here but I’m willing to talk. 
So I’ve apologised over and over tried again.
And I don’t even know what I’ve done. 
That person was really close, I could talk, get stuff off my mind, and then I get thrown back in the deep end. And I can’t pull myself back out. 
I keep telling myself that I’m over it, but the feelings stay the same and every time I don’t think i just automatically go back to that time.

10,"So I had been struggling for a while, and then I started feeling better after I became friends with someone who I could trust completely and had feelings for, and we were dating for
A bit.

I can’t talk to anyone I know because they either don’t want to listen or help or I can’t trust them.

Everything had been going so well and then I just got dunked back into the deep end.
Now this person doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore and won’t explain properly what I have done. It’s a long story , but if anyone asks, I’m happy to explain.
So I’ve slipped back into a ‘zone.’ 

And I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen at this point, I’m not looking forward to anything. I can’t forgive myself either. I don’t even know what I’ve done.
Even when I don’t think about this situation, I replay things, and even then I just have the same repetition of feeling and thoughts.

11,"Guys, I'm running out of time.
I have extended my study for one semester and Dec 31th gonna be the due date for me to finish everything (according to our academic rule, this is my last chance). I've been trying my best to write my paper this past 3 months, but every time I'm trying to write stuff I went to freeze mode, unable to do anything. My heart would beat like crazy and tho I was taking my prescribed meds, I still couldn't do anything other than just go to sleep because it's to painful to just sit and study. I'm super mad that it's the only thing I can't do. I can do any other thing (I can function a bit okay), but not about studying.
I'm so hopeless about finishing my paper. I'm not sure my supervisors would accept/give me chance though they know that I have this mental problem.

This is so embarassing since I'm not even studying a very complicated subject, yet this thing is very important to me. I know that this is also my fault that I was not trying to seek further help, because I was simply too afraid and having financial problem to do that, I skipped my therapy, and not even trying to reach any of friends to help me out because I was too embarrassed.

Hi everyone. I've never posted here before, but I feel like you all would be the best ones to ask about this. Also, I'm on mobile, so sorry in advance. I've been feeling extremely depressed and anxious for about the past year now. However, these past couple months have felt extremely agonizing. I've used self-harm as a coping mechanism on and off for about 10 years now when I have panic attacks or when something makes me feel guilty or upset, and I really really want to find a better way to deal with my emotions. Does anyone have any recommendations or things that have helped them stop turning to self-harm to deal with these feelings? Thanks in advance.",29Dec2019,1
15,"So I sent a msg to my ex gf, she struggles with severe depression and ptsd. We didn’t have a bad breakup or relationship, she left because she didn’t feel anything anymore I guess, still not really sure. 

Anyways after about a week of not talking I reached out just to tell her I cared about her and not to forget that when she was feeling bad. Anyways, she replied saying that I was still really important to her, even if she wasn’t able to love me, or anyone right now. 

What does this mean? We dated for 1.5yr and it was a very loving relationship, only the last month and a half did it go downhill. I understand that sometimes one feels empty, and nothing. By not being able to love Im wondering if this is just like girl code for I don’t like you friend zone type stuff or if this is an actually symptom of depression? Being unable to actually feel anything, I guess if you feel numb in general the feelings of love would be numbed too? I know I shouldn’t get hung up on her or wait for her, even if I do truly love her even when she can’t love, I’m just trying to better understand.",29Dec2019,1

17,"Just broke up with my girlfriend about 2 months ago. It was completely my fault, I was incredibly insecure with myself and started talking to random girls online. Unfortunately she found out more than once, and she left because of it.

Other than that, she always thought I was perfect for her. I loved her completely. And I was so patient with her. We did everything together, really, and it was a great 6 years. But now, as I'm going to therapy to find out what the hell was so wrong with me, I realized that while I loved her 100%, I didn't love myself. I was always so anxious to make her feel loved that I wasn't focusing on what I wanted. Sure, I was happy, but I was blind to the delusion of me being happy by making her happy.

I even had plans to marry her.

But, as I said, my actions led to the worst outcome I could ever imagine. I feel like I lost it all. No just her, but her family. Her friends. Her world. And now that I realized my mistake I vowed never to do something so stupid like that again. And this therapy is definitely helping to bury my anxiety. Still, I'm incredibly depressed. I'm just still grieving with the loss, and damn, it feels impossible to forgive myself.

Like I said, the therapy is helping a ton. And I'm also talking to people I know, friends of mine, coworkers... and literally everyone of them have been extremely important. I turned into a fresh gym rat, too, and it's really helping me find myself in such a dark time in my life.

I'm pretty sure there's something else I can do. I need to turn my life around. I want to be happy again. I want to move on. I want to know what it feels like to love myself. What else do you guys suggest? I'd love to hear what you guys like to do to fight your depression.

23,"Hey there guys. 

Right now, I’m in the best relationship I’ve ever been in. He wholeheartedly loves me and showers me with the support I need to get better with my depression. 

But the reason why I want to break up with him is because our sex lives are so different that I’m unhappy with the sex we have. I’ve always wanted something steamy, but I have something so casual. 

So it pains me dearly to leave a man behind in the dust because of sex. We’ve tried to change things for the past year, and the progress is probably at a solid 3%. 

I thought I was gonna marry him, have his children, enjoy my full life with him because we truly are best friends. 

I’ve heard the statistic that sex is only 3% of a relationship and if that’s the case, I’ve been trying to settle for semi decent sex for the past year but it’s really taking a tole on me. 

Now, there are other red flags that I’ve experienced so I don’t feel as guilty as if it were just about sex. I don’t wanna go thru them but just know I’ve seen about 4 red flags that were breakup quality alone.

Now the reason why I’m here, is because I damn well know I won’t be able to function without him. My family is shit at depression support, I’ve moved away from all of my friends, and I’m on my last leg right now from falling into a deep depression spiral. 

I’m convinced my depression is apart of executive functioning disorder and that my anxiety can be cured by working out. However, I can’t get myself out of bed recently. It’s getting worse since it’s basically dark when I wake up and dark when I get home. I’ve stopped taking care of our dog and the responsibility has fallen onto his shoulders. 

I don’t know how to handle my life without him. When I first met him I was in a deep depression and he was the light at the end of the tunnel. I was laughing again. Truly, laughing. 
Now, the tunnel is reappearing and I’m slowly being pulled in. 

Please help.",29Dec2019,1
24,"Have you ever heard “Just you are still alive, it means a lot to someone.”?

Do you understand the meaning of it?

I’ll tell you a story. Once upon a time. There was a girl while she was riding a motorcycle in the rain back to her home. She saw a homeless man who was wearing torn clothes walking in the rain. At that time she didn’t think anything. But when she arrived at her home. She asked herself if he would be cold or have a fever. She decided to return to him with a large towel. She rode a motorcycle there around 10 minutes until seeing him. That places they were at that time were very dark and lonely. No one was there except them two. But she didn't feel scared of him at all. His body is very foul. His eyes didn't show anything. At first, she thought that he was dead. But he was still breathing. so she covered him with a large towel and left. She told this story to her sis and she forgot about it. One day she felt that she was worthless. Therefore consulted her sis. And her sis talked about this story. She completely forgot about this. Her sis told her that she was crazy for daring to do that. And this story made her think she is very grateful to that homeless man. That made her felt that she has value because of him. He may be just a homeless man that everyone dislikes. Or maybe somebody called him trash, but for her, she thinks he is her god. He lets her know how much value she is. But she can't tell him and maybe he'll never know how much he has value to her.

And of course, you may not know how much you have value to others.

Let's continue with the second story. Once upon a time, she was sitting alone in the park that she had just come to for the first time. Then suddenly there was a boy who seemed to be the same age as her, he talked to her. He knew that she came here for the first time. And she seemed to know that he was not all there. But she didn’t care or mind him. They talked for 2-3 hours before she left. She couldn’t remember what they were talking about. But at that time, she was very happy. And his conversation is different from others. And she was confident that she couldn't talk about this with usual people. And after that day, she just knew the truth that he has bullied by his friends at school. And was disgusted by many people because he wasn’t just usual like everyone. And she just knew that where she sat that day was the place where women were raped. And she was confident that he talked to her that day. He wanted to help her. For her, he is a hero and her important friend. Of course, she doesn't have a chance to tell him. And he would never know.

And of course. You'll never know what you did, how much does it affect someone.

Let's continue with the third story. This person was her junior and he is a moron. He was close to her mother. That made her knew him. Everyone said he was crazy. Do not mess with him at all. But she didn't care about people's speech. But she liked his actions. He didn't cause anyone to trouble. He was just himself. He could do whatever she wanted to do but couldn't dare to do it. One day, she saw him singing in the public. And that day she had a singing competition at school. She wasn't confident in herself that she could do it. But when she saw him sing without caring for anything. Even though his voice may be bad. But he made her brave enough to sing on that day. She was thankful to him and thought of him as her idol.

And of course. You're just yourself, it makes someone dares to do something.

Do you know Robert John Downey, Jr? If you know him, you probably heard about ""a cheeseburger of Burger King"".

And who made the cheeseburger for him that day? Maybe that person is you. You are saying that you are not involved in someone's change?

And many others. The street sweeper made me run today in the park. The person who eats alone in the cafeteria makes me dare to go alone. People without a job that made me know that why should I study hard. If you think that just being alive, it cannot be useful to others. Maybe you are wrong.

And all the messages that I wrote I'm going to tell you that you are very precious. at least just for me. No matter who you are. Just being alive, I'm very happy. The reason? There's no. When you love someone, do you know why? For me, I don't know. And didn't want to know the reason as well.

And of course, I'm your friend. I can listen to all your problems as if I am your close friends. If you have something uncomfortable. you can talk to me, I'm not a mentor. But I'm ready to listen and feel together with you like your best friend. Don't hesitate to hit me up.

P.S. Sorry if I reply to you late but you can be assured that I will definitely reply to you.

27,"I’ve been seeing a medium for 10 years now..on and off. She has always told me things that have either been extremely true in the moment, or have come true within a few months. I’ve trusted her and have even recommended her to many friends.

For example one of my friends just saw her and she knew about a family aunt that had passed away from killing herself. My medium knew about the aunt and knew the way she had committed suicide. This is only information that a very few number of people know..

On my last reading we were discussing my family’s history of dementia. I told her I was always worried that either my mom or my husband would come down with early onset like other relatives had. She put my mind at ease by telling me they wouldn’t— but she told me something else disturbing instead. She said I would have to worry about cancer. Not now or early on in my life but later in life.

I have anxiety/depression and SAD , I don’t know how to handle this information she gave me. I keep thinking about it and it pops up in my head at least a dozen times a day. 

I don’t know what to do or how to cope.. I know my mental health is deteriorating because I’m abusing more substances. I already upped my medication recently..

30,"Is my depression just a point of reference? Is this just the way I see the world? Im starting to think this isn’t a disease anymore, or rather, a curable one. Seeking a cure through drugs is futile. It will always just be a mask for my pain, whether that be weed alcohol Zoloft or CBD, its all just pain relief. Have the events ive lived in my short life combined with the dreadful state of consciousness Ive been endowed with, left me disappointed, displeased and depressed by the world around me, by what im living in, and of the person I am. Has my failure to materialise my desires before left me brutally scarred with such a wounded self confidence that I will never be able to repair it, forever isolating me from the outside world. Did I play my cards wrong? Is this it for me now. I don’t think theres a logical argument in my mind can make that theres any hope for me that cant be easily refuted. People say its just a matter of putting mind to matter, but they aren’t the ones who consistently fail, let alone be consistently self aware of there failures at every moment of existence. I am logically gifted yet socially useless, therefore redundant. My service to this world will never serve to service me or my happiness. Just other people. Suppose im selfish for wanting anything more.

I will never be loved by anyone because I cannot love myself. I was taught to hate myself. That made me look inwards at a young age and now I can never look back. The world is brutal merciless and unrelenting, that’s the harsh but unquestionable truth. If there is a god, he is undoubtably evil. Looking for a reason for the outcome of events that is your life will never lead you anywhere. You only exist to keep on existing, that’s the only point, regardless of the quantity of suffering within your life. Suffering and pain are only signs of a non ideal situation, or rather, the failure to live up to ideals. Life cares not if you will ever achieve them. I don’t want to hear that things will get better. Even you know they wont, lets be honest. There may be brief moments of happiness, but the suffering will always be there. TILL YOUR DEATH. Suffering is the default state. Regardless of everything ive typed above im not giving up. I recently took mushrooms and came to the conclusion that im ignorant for assuming that anything will ever get better without hard work and self-maintenance and improvement. I have started getting active again, reduced and become more conscience about my drug usage while also increasing meditation, but honestly its hard to stay on track because as im an inherently lazy prick and am constantly lethargic and trapped inside my head. I guess im  just scared that deep down I know im right. That its all downhill from here.

31,"I think I’m stuck in a depressed rut and I feel like I need to take action before I go further downhill. I really can’t be bothered to take care of myself lately, I have no social life beyond working and seeing my boyfriend 2-3 evenings a week, I’m close to my mum but that’s it. 

I find social interaction completely exhausting and overwhelming and yet crave it so much. The time off over xmas has left me realising that I just have no drive anymore. I’ve just sat and smoked weed for days in front of the tv/ computer and everytime I try and do something productive I give up because I either feel ill (I do have a cold atm) or just don’t feel like I know what I’m trying to achieve anymore (trying to clear up my house). 

I was going to the gym and eating healthily in November then I went through a stage where I wasn’t eating much at all so stopped the gym in fear of making myself faint (had a weird turn and fainted which freaked me out) I just can’t get myself back into it. 

I have all these great ideas of things to do to help myself but I have no clue how to do it. My boyfriends a total antisocial introvert so he’s not really much help, I need to do this in my own time for myself. 

I guess I’m asking how can I motivate/ drive myself to do something and not just feel hopeless all the time? I’m on antidepressants atm and have been slowly decreasing my dose for the past couple of years, this is my first winter on the lowest dose... do I up my dose again until I’m back in a better place? 

Also, how do you not feel guilty about relaxing/ doing something for yourself? I realise I always feel bad about spending time doing what I want but I don’t know why.

I can't recall any current event in my life that would elicit such a reaction. I mean it. I do have it good than most (in the present) yet somehow my depression keeps on thriving. It has gained me this mental block and now I can't think clearly or at all. My creative energy seems dead. I want all my connections/relationships to end because they don't feel like anything. Even art lost its appeal and I'm not good at anything else.  
The world around me looks so dull and all I have done is mimic this bleakness instead of searching for good things because I'm scared of the possibility that I won't find any.  
I want to learn how to enjoy things again or enjoy enough to produce something.   
Any advice is welcomed",29Dec2019,1
37,"After 4 years I have another girlfriend again. She is an amazing person. We've been friends for a while but only started dating a few days ago. I should be really happy because obviously she cares about me. But I just can't get the fact that one day she will leave me and I will be alone again. We met today and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look happy and focus on the fact that she was with me at that moment, all I could think of was that she was going to leave me. Not today. Not next week. But someday she will and it will all be for nothing. Yeah, I'm young and there is ""so much in front of me"" doesn't change the reality that I will be left alone.",29Dec2019,1
38,"So I'm 17, have been depressed for almost 10 years now and I really don't know if I will live past new year's Eve.
I really can't explain my whole situation here because that would be a loooong and personal post.
Normally it's not like I want to actively die. But lately I've been especially lonely and had mood swings. This could be caused by a medication to treat depression I am taking at the moment.
I want to do something on New Year's Eve but I am way too anxious to ask anybody.
I feel apathy and have built an emotional barrier towards almost everyone I know.
At the moment my plan for that night is to drink and jump off a bridge somewhere.
I really don't know what to do at the moment.",29Dec2019,1
39,"I'm needing advice, there's this boy (I have a crush on him) that used to be my best friend two years ago (we just started talking less and less) and I'm planning to come out to him after school starts, however I dont know how? Should I just say I'm suicidal or something else?
(Last year I told him sometimes I wanna kill myself and he said not to worry and that he feels like that sometimes too, If that helps.",29Dec2019,1
40,"I don’t even know what I want in life anymore. I don’t feel like I particularly like anybody, or anything. I feel like I do things just to fill a void. I’m young and still have options, and I want to do something creative but have no talent, nor am I sure I’d even be happy if I succeed. I just don’t don’t what to do with myself",29Dec2019,1
41,"I’m so tired, no matter what I do. Everything is exhausting, getting dressed is exhausting.  thinking about starting a career is so overwhelming.  I work in retail right now, and have to be happy and friendly for that, and I don’t think anybody around me knows how bad my depression is right now.  I tried telling a friend, and got the classic “don’t think that way / just be happy” thing 
I don’t know where to go from here, I’m on medication that I can’t really afford, and isn’t really working. No insurance, and I can’t pay out of pocket for talk therapy. I go to the gym pretty regularly, but endorphins aren’t enough to ~fix~ clinical depression. Are there any good resources to find therapists in my area that are income based, or dare I say, free? I want to get help, but again, everything is exhausting so here we are!",29Dec2019,1
42,"I'm only 19, but i've felt this way already for almost two years now. I'm in therapy already but it doesn't really seem to help me. I'm on winter break now from college and I really really do not want to go back. I've already transferred schools once and i'm not doing any better at my current school. I'm terrible at making friends which probably has to do with my depression, i've actually been told that someone did not want to be friends with me because I was always in a bad mood. Also my friends back home seem to be drifting away from me as well. It just always feels like no one is ever interested in hanging out with me. I feel numb all the time like i'm not even participating in life and it scares me because I don't want to look back and realize that i've wasted my life being terribly sad.",29Dec2019,1
43,"i’m sorry for anyone reading this. i mean, i don’t expect anyone to, but if you are thanks, i guess. you’re helping me feel heard. i didn’t know where else to post this, i just need it out. 

do you ever just feel numb? like no matter how hard you try to feel happy, you can’t? even the sad feels distant. like nothing is going right and no matter how hard you try to experience an emotion it dies after two seconds? 
i feel so empty and like i can’t do anything right and i’m getting real sick of it 
as i type this it’s been 4 hours since i tried to start cleaning my room. i’ve moved clothes. that’s it. how am i supposed to be happy when i can’t even make a happy environment for myself lmao.",29Dec2019,1
44,"Do any of you guys feel like your close friends and family get mad at you and make you feel like you’ve done something wrong for being depressed?

As someone who’s mostly depressed because  it’s been over 2 years since I’ve worked and I haven’t been able to find work.
I feel like I’m being blamed like I’ve done something wrong for this. 

I’ve been looking for work for 2 yrs and it’s been a real struggle and I keep getting denied or no calls back constantly which sinks me into deeper depression.

I feel worthless and horrible about myself because... it doesn’t seem like I can find a good fit for a place to work like nobody likes me. So I feel like shit.

Anyways, then my family gets mad at me for not figuring it out yet. 

Trust me I wish my lucky break and stroke of opportunity would arise. Like tomorrow.

I don’t know how to please anyone and all I want is a job so I can get back to living again and not feeling depressed and not having people angry at me for being a failure.",29Dec2019,1
46,"How am I suppose to end my life when I'm too much of a coward to do it? I'm serious when I say that I really have nothing to live for, please don't mistake that I don't love my children because I do, with everything I have in me since the day I found out I was having them. I want nothing but the best for every one of them but I am not the one that can give them the best life they DESERVE. I have a husband who is the most amazing person in the world and I drive him crazy with my addiction, fears and depression. He doesn't deserve the kind of stress and mental abuse I put him through and probably would be happier with me dead, he acts supportive and that he understand but I think he's truly not happy at all. He works his ass off and struggle most of the time to make ends meet, to make sure we have everything and I think it would be a blesses to him if I got out of the way so he could enjoy a very less stressful life and hopefully with someone more stable than me. As much as it hurts me to think or feel this way about him being with someone else at the end of the day im NOT making him or his life any better at all.
Im 29 (almost 30 in April) I haven't work in over 6 1/2 years even if I could work (how will I explain my lack of résumé?). Therefore I have no career to look forward too, nor any foreseeable way of making a difference in this world, especially when I'm too afraid to even drive (don't have car nor do I have a driver's licenses)
I've tried to look into school but the cyclical nature of my addiction, depression and phobias have made it all but impossible to even try and graduate college.
I alienate everyone I come in contact with because of my own phobias and the second I feel like I'm being used, mistreated or I feel like someone is gonna hurt my feeling I try too hurt them and cut them off. so people dismiss me as being a snob. Or a bi*ch... And if I end up having a ""friend"" I push them away and blow them off because of my depression. I have a ""therapist"" been like a ""friend"" we text daily  and see each other a few times a month for the past 2 years or so but at the end of the day she gets paid to be a ""friend"" and im sure our friendship would end the min the money does So im all alone Besides my Husband, I have no friends. There really is NO future for me. I don't see ME doing anything to make this world or even the people that are in ""my little world"" any better but the problem is my fear of the pain involved in dying. I don't want it to be drawn out and/or painful. A gun would be quick, but I know for a fact I wont have the balls to pull the trigger. Even jumping off a building would take too long. Pills? I have plenty, but with my little addiction I've probably build up a resident and even if it does do ""its job"" bad things can happen before they finally finish you off or it doesn't and I end up really ""messed up"" 
I'm not ""crying out for help."" I don't need/want to be talked ""out"" of anything. I've went through therapy, countless drug thing and also I've tried to ""man up"" but i still end up right back to this feeling. I don't want to hurt anymore or feel like Im nothing and NO-ONE knows the kind of pain I go through and I can't adequately explain it to anyone.  I mean how do you explain the feeling of wanting to end your ""my"" life.",29Dec2019,1
