0,I have been struggling with depression and I have type 2 bipolar - I don't have the money to buy books (which I prefer) so I have been listening to a lot of podcasts. Any reccomendations for a good self-help or mental health podcast? Thanks.,28Jun2019,2

3,"I'm a 28 year old female. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 and depression shortly after that, then about two years ago I was diagnosed with GAD.

I have always been pessimistic of things directly affecting me or my life, but I try to remain optimistic of things for people around me. 
I strongly believe that if you want things to change, then you make the effort to change them. However... now I am lost.

I go through periods where my issues are manageable, but sometimes ""manageable"" is really just me ignoring them.

Those ""goals"" I haven't reached?
- I didn't finish the degree I wanted. 
I left school because of a shitty relationship I was in and a shitty living situation with said person. 6 years later and I'm finally applying to colleges again.

- I dont have a kid.
And yes, I want one, but I don't have health insurance for it or the income. I work too much and I'm emotionally unstable.

- I dont have a job I see as a ""career"".
 The company is small, there is a ton of nepotism, very few benefits are offered, but there are some.
So what if we dont have health insurance? You get to call in sick as many times as you want (you will only get paid for 3, but hey, you won't lose your job). 
I'm reminded regularly of how valuable I am to the company, but let's face it - I'm drowning. I am so tired of trying to keep workers there and happy when I really am not. I work 9+ hours a day, 5 days a week. I will skip meals, I will be bothered during my break periods and ultimately work through them. I will watch other employees get away with murder, but I have to tell my team to stick to the rules. 
I make a meager wage of $16/hour to manage a a small team, work in production, make sure deadlines and quality standards are met, make sure employees that aren't family aren't abusing the rules, help with customer service, tech and machine support, shipping and receiving, and learning the quoting and job management software so the owner can take time off.
Currently, my employees are mad at me because I told them I had to discuss the restricted cellphone policy with the owner because they want more time on their phones. 
I spent years being bullied by my ex - because he is the son of the owner. They took my two cats and were only willing to give one back when it was no longer convenient to keep it - YEARS LATER.

I admit, I've got a lot of grudges about my job and the people I work with. Maybe I'm just burnt out? Why do I stay? Because my best friend works there, because I have empathy for the owner, I'm afraid of change, I cant find anything I'm interested in changing to. I've convinced myself I need the company as much as the company needs me.

I take it home, bitch to my husband, and then find things wrong with my marriage. I know I have a happy marriage, yes, I wish I got more of a helping hand around the house, but really I would rather just have an easier, part-time job and take care of the house. We can't afford it. 

If I bring it up, I'm afraid of making my hubby feel inadequate. 
I don't know how to change my job or myself to make things work - and I have tried. 
I don't know how to brave change and get a new job, let alone tell my boss or best friend I'm going to quit.
I have tried applying to other jobs, but I keep convincing myself I am no good enough, I won't make enough, or I won't enjoy it.

God bless my husband for trying to tell me to go for it, but then he always goes in to, ""you're going to just end up with the same kind of crappy coworkers and customers, and you're probably going to hate that job too."" It really doesnt make me feel any better, but I know he is just trying to be honest with me.

We can have a kid - then go into massive debt. That freaks me out.

I can quit - then rack up debt till I collect myself and find another job. Also freaks me out.

I can go to college - I'm terrified I will fail.

I think, the icing on top of it all, is this immense loneliness I have started to feel. I work with so few people, and most of the ones I deal with treat me poorly. I don't see friends that often and I'm worried about complaining too much. I just kind of... word vomit on my husband and I'm afraid of losing him because of how negative I am.

I'm sorry for such a long post, I just.... don't even know how to word everything or what to do. Even if I fix the job problem, what's to say I wont find something else to focus on negatively?",28Jun2019,1
4,"It was a pretty stupid thing to do, and I’ll be the first to admit that, but for some reason my brain was like ‘take more and you’ll get better’, but right now I’m feeling SO awful; sweating a lot, feeling horribly anxious, cannot sleep and feel really nauseas.

Any tips for how to feel a little better? Or best to just ride this out?",28Jun2019,1
5,"I feel like I’m losing myself and everyone I love. My depression makes me so unnecessarily irritable and I hate it. I fucking hate myself so much. It just feels like everything in my life takes the worst possible turn and as much as I try to find something to be positive about I’m not getting better. I’ve lost almost everyone in my life. I have 2 friends and only one of them really understands me but they’re going through something similar so it’s hard to be there for each other when we both want to die. I feel like I’m pushing my own family away now. Today my mom said she thinks I hate her. That’s so far from being true, I love her and my family but I can’t open up to them about this because they don’t take it seriously. I can’t do this much longer.",28Jun2019,1
6,"When I’m down- I mean suicidal, I think of little things that I’d miss- like my cats licking my arm or kneading me. My dog resting his head on my legs, seeing bats at dusk, sunset, early evening light, trees,  etc. these are the things that keep me going.",28Jun2019,3

10,"I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for nearly 8 years. Most days I have a hard time just getting out of bed. I feel as if my life isn’t worth living. As a teen I turned to drugs and drinking to self medicate. Currently I take anything I can find to make me feel normal. I’ve only tried lexapro to help curb my depression but it didn’t work at all. Weed and cringe videos is currently my favorite way to feel good but it’s expensive as fuck not to mention illegal where I live. I’m posting because I’m looking for a permanent solution. I’m willing to try just about anything. I feel like I’ve lost myself to depression and I want to get back to who I really am. 

What can I do or take that’s safe and will help me long term.",28Jun2019,2
11,"I told people I loved today that I loved them. And I feel... a lot better. I cried. I don’t get to cry that often. It was nice to feel their concern, to talk about me being depressed, and I feel okay right now because I’m reminded that I even have them. They care about me... it’s so nice to remember that and feel that. My roommate got me dinner tonight. Even though it was a hamburger and I don’t eat pork, it was so sweet that he did that even though I barely talked to him at all today. I was encouraged at work today to go for a leadership position I’d expressed interest in. I’m really going to be okay and I do have things to work for.",28Jun2019,3
12,"It's been 5 years. It's been 5 years of the exact same shit. Peaks, valleys. Whatever. I'm blank. I'm screaming but none of these words resonate. I want to go in depth but I don't want to. I don't know anything.",28Jun2019,1
13," I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I have no idea where to ask this.

Started chatting with this girl from tinder, we've had a few phone calls over the week and a bit of texting but I began to notice she was going through some rough times and she showed a few signs of being a drama queen. Anyway, we've chatted a bit and had some flirty banter over the phone but iltimatly I feel that maybe I should give her a pass, I dont need the drama but today she messages me while I was at work and wanted to chat.

I said I couldnt and then she plays the - fine, leave me like everyone else - kind of line. Knowing she is having family troubles I asked her to call me and after some tug of war she finally called. She was crying and long story short, she is having a very bumpy times with her family and it sounds like there are a few trouble makers.... But she started saying things like; she dosnt want to do this anymore, she dosnt want to go on.

Now, its possible that she is being very melodramatic/drama queen but I'm worried. I told her we could hang out if she needed someone to talk to but ultimatly she should talk to someone professional and sent her a link via text to a big line councilors center with a 24 hr line and everything for depression and that sort of thing.

I'm worried. She thanked me and has tried to call. Should I cut contant immediatly? I dont know where she lives or anything so I cant intervine but I'm a bit scared and I dont know how to deal with this sort of thing, I'm not trained.",28Jun2019,1
14,"At this point I just feel that the whole world is against me and I have nothing to live for (DW I'm not suicidal, just really searching). People have left me and I'm blamed for everything. For the last two months, nothing good has happened to me.",28Jun2019,1
15,"Well, I've come a long way but I am better than I've ever been. I think. I used to really think about suicide like everyday, but now not even once a week maybe even once a month. I dont think about it often, probably only did recently because of stuff going on in my personal life. But I am doing a lot better now. I'm over something that really broke me down and I feel all the better for it. I did think about something today though, I was thinking about how hard it was to get to where I m today, the military and like two people in my life really helped me not even make an attempt, though it was mainly cause I wouldn't be allowed in the military with scars. But my friend, and my mother. Without them both I may not be here at all. It was a little scary all of the things that had to happen in my life to be here today. I wish. Could thank them both more. I wish I could really show them both how much they mean to me. It's crazy. But yeah I'm doing a lot better now in fact some days I'm really truly happy. And I actually have dreams now, I used to not have any. Because of some really bad stuff in my childhood, I developed PTSD and severe depression, I used to get beat for crying so I for a number of years I couldn't cry, eventually and gradually I started getting better, still have the PTSD but I'm a lot better, new people are hard, and it's hard to trust people but... I'm happy and I've got more emotions than happy and angry. I'm just thankful I guess, and thanks to those of you guys who were there when I wanted to rant and get any type of positive feedback. Or just an answer so thanks. It's still really hard but. I'm happy. Oh right the dreams thing, one, I used to not have dreams I think it was my brain making sure i wasn't having any nightmares because of all the stress so it just blocked them out, Maybe i dont really know. But now I have dreams, and they are so fucking wild I had absolutely no idea like I had heard about people having weird dreams but I will have some weird dreams. And it's so obvious it's a dream yet i don't know that until i wake up. I had a dream about giving somebody a hug which was weird because I woke up still trying to give someone a hug. There is still this weird thing... I dont know why but whenever I lay down I cry. Not like sobbing or anything just a tear or two rolls down my face I could be laughing or reading a book and I just happens. Anyways thanks for reading!",28Jun2019,1
16,I try being hopeful. I go into every day thinking ‘this is gonna be a good day. Shit is gonna turn around for me today’ but it just ends up being shitty or shitter than the last. It’s been years of this and I’m just so tired. I ready to just give up,28Jun2019,5

19,Lately shes been distant but today is when i really noticed.  I just got back from a week long camping trip and i texted her first thinking that we would talk about all the weird things that happened but instead she told me that her battery was low and that we would talk tomorrow.  I know its not that much of a sign but we rely off each other to live because we both have crappy lives.  I really wanted to talk to my best friend especially after spending a week with people i didnt know.  I was really sad when she said that and shes the only friend that likes to talk on the phone or text.  Other than that she always wants to come over and she hasnt or just talked to me.  And i hate it because it makes me feel like all i do is care for them and try to be a good friend to everyone and cheer everyone but it hurts me because whenever i show weakness everyone expects me to happy and no one is there for me when i need them.  Shes the only person that i can talk to just straight up and she gets it.,28Jun2019,1
20,"I have Exactly 3 friends. That's not many, but they are good friends. Now here's a thing. Whenever I meet a specific one of them, I can't stop feeling like he doesn't like me after all. For no rational reason whatsoever. He's really nice, but I always feel like I'm annoying him. A while back, I was told that this might be a sign for depression. 

Whenever I think about the possibility of having depression, I think of 2 things that are quite similar in nature. First of, I keep thinking that if I were to tell people about my thoughts, I could bother them with something that doesn't turn out to be depression after all. I'm actually constantly thinking exactly that while writing this. Second, I keep thinking that by seeking help, I'd be making Fun of my sister, who was in care for clinical depression for 2.5 years, and all the other People that I consider to have have more serious Problems than mine.

In addition, I don't feel depressed. People tell me depression makes you feel unconfident, never Happy about what I accomplish, and generally unhappy. Except for maybe a lack of confidence sometimes, these symptoms are missing. I'm feeling generally Happy. At least I think so. 

I don't want to be depressed, being in the middle of my trade school schooling, but maybe, if it turns out I am, I'll have to face it.

I don't know if I am. 
I'd really like to hear your opinions.",28Jun2019,1
21,"Hi 

I’ve been suffering for about a year from PTSD, major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I know not everyone is a medical professional but I’d appreciate some advice.

Recently I’ve been experiencing symptoms like a strong belief there’s someone behind a door in about to open who’s been sent to kill me or a sensation in my lower back which is reminiscent of that when someone stands right behind you. 

I have also been not hearing but I don’t know if you’ll understand - like when you have a song stuck in your head - I have my brother and mom telling me to “shut the fuck up” when I’m alone in silence. 

Another one includes me whole heartedly believing someone is outside a window and will pop up right in front of me.

I am worried that I’m going into psychosis and would like advice on what to do next - I feel as if people are out to kill me because I’m weak and worthless and no one will notice that I’m gone.

I just hate myself, there’s always an underlying feeling of sad all the time (normally brought to the forefront when something even minor is wrong and at night?) I just feel like shit, I’ve thought about killing myself and how I’d do it and I want to but I’m also afraid of doing that. I’m just confused and I hate myself.

24,"I've created a dummy account for this post because I am frankly ashamed and embarrassed by myself and the state I'm presently in - not to mention my brother would kill me if he saw this. Anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 years old with a college degree in art, which I spent four years studying for. My 19-year-old brother did a couple years of science in college, and has a decent job but is presently taking time off work for health reasons I will be getting into. My brother and I both suffer from depression, and I have anxiety in addition. My brother may or may not have some additional issues, and I personally have a feeling he is on the autism spectrum (I think he might as well), but the depression is the big one. We're both on medication, and have both seen therapists. Or psychiatrists, whatever one. I know there's a difference between each one but I forget what it is. Either way, important thing is I've been to a shrink and so has he. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last month, since finishing college I have been in what I can safely call the lowest low I have ever been in. I haven't been able to find a job. I've signed up for sites like Indeed and [Jobs.ie](https://Jobs.ie) and I've been sending CVs and cover letters to various employers - I'm trying to get my career in art on the road since I've got the degree and it took me four years, but even something pat-time like a fast food restaurant in the meantime will do. I used to work retail and found it to be a horrible trigger for my anxiety, but at the same time I'll gladly take it over the place I'm currently in, because at the moment I feel completely and utterly worthless. I feel like a freeloading sack of shit. What kind of 22 year-old lives with his parents and relies on them for money? There is a job-seeker allowance in our country but it's means-tested and I don't think I'd qualify because I live with my parents who both work. Having said that, I don't know if I could live with myself if I did apply - I already feel like a massive freeloader and a leech on my parents, I don't want to feel like I'm taking handouts from the government as well. Not to say that you're a freeloader if you're on unemployment benefits, just my own self esteem issues will twist it around on me if I do it myself because that's simply how my shitty brain works. So I've chosen to stay away from that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sleeping pattern is currently non-existent. I'm writing this at 8 AM, having slept for about four hours. Some nights I sleep for three or four hours, some nights I fall into a fifteen-hour coma and miss a whole day, some nights I stay up altogether and don't go to sleep until the following night. This was the sort of thing  I did as a teenager once in a while because I was at a party or had friends over; now it's a twice weekly thing, and it's purely because I simply cannot sleep. I'm probably gonna go back to bed once I'm done whining to you guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is in a similar state - I really don't like talking about mental health since it's a bit of a sore spot for me, especially with people I know closely. I can let loose on the internet behind an anonymous screen name, but sitting down with a parent or sibling to have a good old heart to heart is frankly terrifying to me. I know it's not a good way to be, but it's the way I am. So I don't fully understand the inner workings of my brother's head, but suffice to say I'm extremely worried about him. My brother is a brilliantly intelligent and creative individual, and while we're polar opposites in some ways, we're extremely similar in others. Ever see Better Call Saul? Chuck and Jimmy always reminded me of us two. He's the logical and somewhat stubborn but undeniably intelligent one while I'm the more outgoing but probably less mature one. We butt heads a lot, but in the end I love him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it breaks my heart to see him in the same boat as me, sleeping all day and staying up all night. His room is in squalor and stinks - not that mine is much better. He often goes days without showering. We've also reached a low point in terms of physical health, I guess because we've both sort of given up. His diet consists of pizza, frozen chicken nuggets and an honestly alarming amount of Coca Cola - we were left to go grocery shopping recently because our parents went away for a few days. I picked up a ton of cookies and ice cream while he bought about four or five large bottles of Coke. We got fresh meat and ingredients for homemade meals - those ingredients were left to go stale and thrown in the trash and we ended up ordering pizza. As for those large bottles of Coke, my brother went through them in mere days and next thing I knew, he'd gone out and bought four more. If this is raising your eyebrows I'm not surprised, and I want you to think about how it makes me feel - I feel as though I'm essentially watching my brother slowly kill himself. And I can't say shit because my diet is not good either. We're both apathetic and lack self control, but rather than just embrace it and have fun with it I guess I'm doomed to self loathe. I make him answer the door when pizza gets here and I refuse to order by phone, because I'm embarrassed by how often we order out and I feel like they're looking at me like the fucking slob I am.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is skinny as a rail, I think he probably qualifies as underweight. He's a hell of a lot skinnier than I am so I'm not in a very good position to hold an intervention and get all teary-eyed about his diet choices. However I think it's safe to say that the amount of sugar he's taking in is a horrible thing, especially with a history of diabetes in the family. When I tried to breach the subject with him he stubbornly said that the alternative was going back to alcohol - he used to drink quite a bit, which also worried me and my parents a lot. I tried reasoning that there is a lot of middle ground and that there's more beverage choices than alcohol and carbonated soda, but he doesn't want to hear it and turns down every option I suggest. In the end I didn't know what to say but it's been eating me up inside. Again, I feel like he's slowly killing himself and I'm just watching. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's taking time off work because recently he found that he was bleeding from the ears and nose. The doctor penciled him in for blood tests which aren't for a couple of weeks, and according to the Internet (pro tip, do NOT google your fucking symptoms unless you want to get reeeeally anxious) it could be anywhere from ear drum damage to head trauma to cancer. I tried suggesting that maybe it was time to make a lifestyle change - again, I'm in no position to judge because my lifestyle isn't good either, but I'm seriously worried about him. Either way, that conversation didn't go far.

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, I'm not massively overweight but I'm certainly not healthy - I definitely have the body of someone who doesn't work out, and enjoys pizza more often than recommended. My brother says it's called a ""dad bod"". How do you do, fellow kids. I briefly went to a gym and didn't dislike it, but at the moment I can't afford it because I'm unemployed, and my motivation is completely gone because of the way things are, so I can't even bring myself to just put the dogs on a leash and go out for a jog or something. I found I like fruit smoothies, but I don't even feel motivated to take the five minutes to mix stuff in a blender, blend it for a minute and then clean it. So here I am, living on pizza deliveries, fast food, coffee, energy drinks and general junk food and candy. Again, I feel like I'm killing myself. I'm sluggish and drowsy, I'm anxious, I'm badly out of shape and I get sweaty and out of breath worryingly quickly. But when I have a moment of worry I instantly begin to talk myself into the whole ""ah, there's way fatter and unhealthier folks out there, it's not the end of the world if you have a whole damn tub of Hagen Das, even if you just had one two days ago"". I've considered the possibility that I have an eating disorder because there isn't a pattern to my eating; I tend to skip breakfast and then binge a ton of junk later in the day and in the middle of the night. But I don't like feeling as though I'm making excuses because in the end, the fact of the matter is my lifestyle sucks and I'm ashamed of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's amazing how much I've romanticized just the idea of normality. I don't want an amazing life of riches and fame, because frankly if I got that I wouldn't feel like I deserve it. I just want a 9-to-5 job, the motivation and self control to keep my diet under control, and the ability to sleep eight hours and feel rested and satisfied. I just want a normal life. I don't like anything about my life or myself. I don't like feeling like a freeloader, I don't like my diet, I don't like my weight, I don't like my personality or appearance. And I don't like seeing my brother in the same boat. But how do I get him out when I can't even get myself out? I'm a failure of an older brother, and person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel completely lost. I'm scared, and frustrated, and going insane. Every day bleeds into the next, things that happened yesterday feel like a week ago and things that happened weeks ago feel like yesterday. My memory sucks, I'm self loathing to an extreme degree and, though I promise I'm not going to do anything self destructive (I'm too concerned about my parents and dogs), I think about death a lot. Again, I'm not at risk of acting on those thoughts so please don't panic, but I'm not gonna lie, I have had these passive sort of ""why am I even alive"" thoughts. And I ask, how can you blame me? I feel completely worthless and ashamed of myself. I can't find a job, and I know I'm looking but I fear I'm not doing enough. I just don't know what to do. About my unemployment, about my diet. I'm worried for my brother's wellbeing, and I'm worried for myself.

What do I do?",28Jun2019,1

26,"I took my meds this morning, and I've been feeling good the entire day until up to about half an hour ago when the usual thing blankets over me, but it's a hundred times worse, since starting my meds I just take the opportunity to go to bed before the meds wear off, but after not experiencing the depression it's suddenly much worse, and it's so suffocating that I can't stop crying. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you guys tend to overcome this? Is this common?",28Jun2019,1
27,"I know how everyone feels here, I understand all of you. Even though I don't know you individualy, this place at least, helped me, knowing I'm not alone, knowing that I can speak my mind without having someone explode over how stupid I am, and how much people will miss me. I'm still new, both to this sub, and to reddit.

But all I want to say is, to all of you here, all who will still join, is how I try to go around with deprssion and suicidal thoughts. Mine began a while back, with the death of my mother and realising how I actually was never loved, at least that's how I see it, after she passed, I was in a weird stage and that finding a reason to continue without her guidance, was a bit challenging. My parents were devorced, and my father and I treat each other like brothers. I never called him ""dad"" unless a special occassion.

And this carried over to every relationship I ever had, even though I experimented with both men and women, it was weird.

And then I met a girl who took everything away from me, I was the happiest little chipmunk I could be, I haven't felt sad or depressed or hated. And then, we drifted apart, because I didn't give all of me, cuz I was stupid, and happy. And then came the worst, where I attempted 4 seperate suicides, by different means, and every single time, someone stopped me, either a friend, or my current gf, who understands how I feel, and she's pretty much the same, so we walk through mud together, day to day.

But, I'm not happy, and I have a feeling, that I never will be again. And ever since last year, I've lost the drive I had. And just got comfortable with what I have. I had nothing at one point, a house that was collapsing, no electricity, no water, no job, no money, no family except my dad who was abroad, who would send me some money now and then, and my step siblings, who, even though they're young, tried to comfort me in their own little ways. 

But through all of this, through the nothing and into today, I had my cats, who as dumb as they look, always try to cheer me up. Unfortunately, one of them passed, which also pushed me down, but my other cat, Haley, always tries to make me smile. She sits with me, calls me to the fridge when she hears my stomach rumble, sometimes tells me to go to bed when she sees I'm up too late.

It's strange how much I love that cat. Even though I feel like I want to off myself every single minute of my life, she always brings me up, and just, makes me hang there for a while, and calms me down.

I'm sorry this is a bit long. But, I don't want to look as though I know what I'm talking about. I know all of us have different types of depression, and thoughts, but I'd just like all of you, to find an animal, or person, or an object, and just, get familiar with it, and try to get through. There might not be a light on the other side, but we are all different, and we all have our unique ways of life, and that is a beautiful thing, don't you think?",28Jun2019,2

29,"I’ve struggled with depression since I was 14 and after I was molested by a family member. I tried to commit suicide shortly after but was found by my older sister.

Growing up, it wasn’t nearly as bad as it is now that I’m an adult.

I’ve been in therapy for a little over 1 year. I’ve been going through a lot with work and a very long relationship ending due to his continuous lying/cheating.

I’ve struggled a lot with passive suicidal ideations with no intent. As of the past 2-3 months it’s been ideations with intent. When I was visiting my parents, I tried to get into my moms gun case. Had I been able to find my razor last Saturday, I would have hurt myself. I've been super open and honest with my therapist. After Tuesday’s session, she is worried for me. She wants me to look into checking myself into an inpatient treatment program.

I can’t get in to see a psychiatrist until the end of July, but I am scared to wait that long. I’ve gotten rid of everything in my house that I could hurt myself with.

So I looked into it and I really think I need it, but I am very scared to take this leap. I’ve got all of the support in the world from my family, my sister will take me to the place and make sure I’m okay, make sure everything is fine with my apartment, and offered to take care of my dogs at her house. I’ve been isolating myself since Tuesday, not really answering the phone for anyone and my therapist has texted me every day asking how I am, while getting basically no response from me (which I feel insanely guilty about).

I don’t know if I’m asking for the push I need, or just to vent, or something. Sorry for the ramble.",28Jun2019,3

31," I'm reposting this post because I want to share my experience with  depression and help you understand how I managed a couple of months ago  to get through it. I've been depressed since I was 15, lasting about 6  years until I finally came to understand what it is. I had no will to  live, contemplated suicide and had no purpose in life or whatsoever and  the truth is you don't need really need one. Basically to explain I need  you to understand what thinking and feeling is. Feeling something is  reacting to external action through thoughts that make us feel and  react. The way we do that is natural but if you control your reaction  then you control what you think and then you control what you feel. What  you feel is your choice. It is and will always be and if you say you  can't then that's that's your ego not allowing you to do so (important  to note that I don't talk about physical feel) . It's really hard, I  know, I'm already talking about things that are hard to visualize but  please allow yourself to understand that everything you feel can be  controlled through thinking. If you choose to be sad you will be sad, if  you choose to be happy you will be happy, your mental state is a  choice, What. You. Believe. In. Is. A. Choice. ( important to note that  not everything we believe is also true) I believed I was depressed,  because of it I allowed it to eat me from within for years basically  disabling myself from feeling other emotions but I believe it was a good  thing for myself because it built me. Believing things can be  dangerous, it directly affects your body and brain and modifies you,  this is how worse it can get. It can get so bad that no matter how much  help you get from outside it will be useless so the deeper you get the  harder to get out. I don't advise you to take small steps doing small  things or anything like that. I advise you to choose to stop believing  you are depressed  because it will keep being real if you keep believing  in it. The mind is the most powerful thing because we have a  consciousness and the worst thing about it is the ego. We will  ultimately die and return to the ground and your consciousness will  cease to exist and so you will live this short life the way you choose  to. So i'm asking you, WHAT DO YOU  CHOOSE?",28Jun2019,0
32,"I’ve been looking back on my life, and at all the times my so-called friends would spit me out and abandon me. I’ll admit, I’m not perfect. That brings up a question that has left me wondering: can depression make us terrible people? I’ve been annoying at times, and I don’t think I’m an asshole (probably a very boring person).

My hypothesis is that our disinterest in things and our apathy telegraphs to others that we can’t provide any kind of return investment in friendship, so we are isolated. I may be wrong, but this is based on my experiences.

33,"I am a very private person when it comes to my feelings.Been this way since i was a kid as there always seemed to be something going on within the family and i  didn’t want to add to their problems so i think that’s why i kept to myself and pushed my feelings aside all these years plus there really never was anyone to talk to except this person im about to talk about or at least i thought i could.Been this way for 5 years now.Until recently i had to open up to this person when my depression really got much worse due to a undesirable situation i was in which i don’t want to specify so as to stay annonymous in case...Basically,i opened up to him/her who is one of my parents.Lets call he/she x. I told x just a little bit of what i was feeling but not everything and i tried to low key tell him/her i think of killing myself on the daily without actually saying it.I now realise how much of a mistake that was.I promised myself to never open up to anyone ever again(at least in person).I don’t think x understands how hard it was to open up like that even if i told her little.I even struggle to tell my therapist anything and i don’t  know why its so hard(stopped going btw).Things were much better when was more emotionally detached from my feelings.to this.Our relationship used to be great and now i can’t even look at x in the eyes...Just the other day x said how he/she feels bad for the people with illnesses who are sick and didn’t choose to be like that and is the reason why he/she didn’t pity me.I didn’t ask to be depressed now did i?For somebody that constantly has been denying  that i am depressed although i have been diagnosed by a proffessional,it just adds to the thoughts i am constantly fighting with in my head that i am fine although deep down i know that not to be true.Its impossible to get rid off.This person is caring and really loves me but as i have come to realise,just because someone loves you dosen’t mean they can care for you when they have enough going on.This person constantly makes sure to remind me of that aswell...saying how he/she is struggling with this,that ext and still is functioning and has also told me in the past that she can be having so many problems but x  still puts on a happy face and still tries making conversation (when im really overwhelmed i just stop talking but am not rude).Like i have been keeping quiet for years now and he/she encourages to keep doing it?This is the last time i will ever talk about my feelings with anybody.I didn’t open up to anybody before and sure as hell won’t now after this.Tbh,looking back there really wasn’t anybody there for me or somebody i could talk to about my feelings... climbing back into my shell for this time for good for now i am truly alone,at least before i could maintain the delusion that at least one person was there for me but now know that not be the case.it sucks.Sorry for the lack of details i know its ridiculous but as i have said i don’t talk about my feelings ever and wish to remain as annonymous as possible.so bear with me...",28Jun2019,1

38,Hello everyone.To start off i am a private person when it comes feelings.I have been depressed since about i was 12 years old.I kept my problems to myself since i was a kid because i never really had anyone to talk my problems with and there always seemed to be issues in my family.Start of this year my depression got really severe.I could no longer keep up and it was obvious i was struggling so i finally decided to open up to my mother.The one person i thought could help me and would always be there for me...I opened up to her but i told her very little tho.This has been the biggest regret of my life.She has no idea how hard it was to open up to her.I regret it because our relationship used to be fantastic but know in the little time she talks to me i can’t even look her in the eye...that’s how upset i am.Things were much better when i lived in my own shell and i promised myself to never allow myself to make the same mistake again.To give you an idea...The other day she was telling me how she dosen’t pity me because there are other people that are sick and they didn’t choose to be like that.This hurt me greatly.She thinks i chose to be depressed?I know she loves me but as i have come to realise just because someone loves you it dosen’t mean they will care for you when they have enough going on in their own lives.another thing is that its bad enough i constantly have thoughts in my head telling me i am fine and denying that i am depressed(although i have been formally diagnosed)without my own mother thinking im just lazy...It breakes my heart knowing what i know now about her...i don’t know if our relationship will ever be the same and its my fault,28Jun2019,1
39,"For context, 

Firstly, My depression is not clinically diagnosed yet and it comes at random times and some types of actions and events trigger it. When it is not triggered I’m all go and is just enjoying life. 

Secondly, I know what my parents are doing are solely for my own good. But there overprotectiveness is suffocating. It’s not helping me with my depression either. What triggered my suffocation and depression right now is because of a comment I did on face book a few weeks ago and I forgotten it already. 

I was watching a funny skit on Asian fathers and about their tough love and stuff like that and in that video the “daughter” got angry at her dad and yelled at him. And without thinking much I just casually commented if I did that to my dad I’ll be dead as a joke on how strict my parents are or normally how strict Asian parents tend to be. And it was like during Father’s Day so it was some time ago. Now the triggering part was my mom recently came across this video and saw my comment and is now scolding me through my comment because I was “gossiping about my dad online”. I wasn’t even think much of it. It was just a casual comment joking about the strictness of Asian parents. I wasn’t bad mouthing my dad or anything. HOW DO I TELL MY MOM THAT!!! I’m typing this before I go to bed. How am I suppose to face her now!!!

Things like these, micromanaging whatever I say or do is making me feel trapped and I wanna END IT ALL!! 

But don’t worry I may be suicidal but I still have some kind of motivation to go on. I still have goals I need to achieve before I die. But I really need to tell them about what they are doing is actually harming my mental health. 

Last night I kinda had the opportunity to tell them about my condition. I was able to bring up the topic on me seeing s therapist for other none serious possible mental issues I have suspicion on. My mom told me I can tell her anything. She can listen to me. But I chicken out. How am I suppose to tell them that they are the biggest cause of my depression along with other small trivial matters that I am able to handle. I had the chance to tell her but I got scared. I can’t bring myself to tell them about my depression because I’m afraid that I’ll make them sad. 

They’ve done so much for me. They’ve given up so much for me and how am I suppose to tell them that they are the biggest reason for my depression. 

Another reason I end up never telling them is because they hate crying.  They get angry whenever they see me cry because when I was younger I tend to cry at every small matter. But i was able to control that when growing up but there were so many stuff I controlled that even now I end up crying a lot when something I didn’t like happen. But now the reasons I cry is not because of the small matter that just happen but because that small matter triggered my depression and I wasn’t able to pretend I’m ok. Which lead to them being angry at me and sold me even more. When I cry I can’t speak properly and they won’t listen to me anymore. 

Idk what to do anymore. The answer to my recovery is right in front of me. I just need to tell my parents and they’ll be able to help me by I can bring myself to tell them due to reasons above. And in return it is making me feel trapped and feel suffocated in my own home. 

Any kind of advice will be greatly appreciated.",28Jun2019,2
40,"TW/ sexual assault

I have been sexually assaulted multiple times over the years and raped a few months ago. I was getting better for a while and actually felt like I could move on with my life, but right now I’m crying at least once a day and have nightmares multiple times a week. I’m diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and PTSD and I just feel like there’s no hope of getting better. I know this is just irrational thinking but it’s hard to feel any different. I can feel my ED creeping back up as well as relapses with self harm. Sobriety seems impossible but while I’m out of town and can’t use I feel like I’m falling apart. I don’t know what to do. I’m dissociating at least once a day and I just want it all to end.

I’m going to therapy weekly but it doesn’t seem to help. And I’m on meds for MDD, GAD and nightmares. Might try EMDR, but my therapist suggested residential, but I can’t just go away for a month. I know I’d get so much worse. And also one of my sexual assaults happened in a mental hospital so I’d like to stay away from another possible situation like that. (I’m 19 and have been hospitalized 3 times, twice as a minor and once with adults which is when I was assaulted; I was already terrified of having to be in with adults) Part of my trauma comes from home so I feel like no where is safe. Home, and a hospital, two places that are supposed to be the safest of safe spaces weren’t safe for me, so now it’s like no where I go is safe.",28Jun2019,1

And numb. 

And I can’t change anything. 

God, what I would do to be happy for once. I’ve been diagnosed. I’m on medication. I’ve gone to counseling. I talk to people about everything, even though I lie about the extent of it.

43,"I've suffered for years, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and most likely ADHD.

I've tried to commit 3 times. Thinking about a 4th and final. 

Last time was 2 years ago. I was found by police and put in a mental health ward for 2 months. When i got out i met someone, managed to cope without medication because it never worked. It was great. I thought about Karma how things have to be bad to get the good. Thats what kept me going. 

2 months ago it all came back, worse than ever, except i had someone to support me. Or so i thought. I broke up with her last week, because she didnt understand. I could never talk to her about my feelings so when i needed to the most, i couldnt. 
Now i have no one to support me. Parents and siblings dont understand. I lost all of my friends that i thought i had. I've got no one to talk to. I've gone to councelling, ive got a referal to a shrink. Its not going to be enough this time. Why should it. No one cares. To them im not someone to care about theres always more people than just me going though it. Least they have people that care though. Family, friends, that understand. Everything that im doing, to try and get better is for me alone. They dont care if i do. 

I feel nothing anymore. All of my emotions are gone. Yet i feel every single one. Anger, regret, guilt, sadness, depression. All of them i feel, yet i dont.

I didn't take enough pills to hurt me and won't, I just feel so alone and needed to say it to someone. The problem with depression is when it hits (me) it's so isolating. It's so overwhelming.
