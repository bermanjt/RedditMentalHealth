0,"So yeah like, I’ve been dealing with this shit for a long time and one of the things that kind of sets me off is like in a crowd of people, I feel like everything they’re laughing at and talking about is just so over used I guess. Like maybe it’s just me being a pessimistic asshole but it’s like these people just repeat each other and copy whichever you tuber they’re watching that day. Like nothing seems genuine it just seems like people are wearing body suits and saying whatever is widely considered funny. Like I just want to know cause it might just be me being pessimistic but I feel like shit because I can go a whole day through high school without laughing at a single thing. It’s just so fucked that like everyone is adopting this like Adam Sandler impression where they make weird sounds and shit and I just can’t find it in me to laugh because it’s not funny and if I do I feel so phony because I was being fake. Do you think this is just me being an insufferable cynic? Or do you think it My be my depression? And finally has anyone else felt like super fucking alien like I have?",12Mar2019,1

2,"Never been diagnosed with anything, but I do have a family history of depression &amp; feel as though I might have dysthemia or something of the sort. I've never been a very energetic or happy person so I can't really put a marker on when this all started happening, and it's not that severe. ( I've been around people while theyre having depressive episodes &amp; i think i have an ok idea of what it looks like)

I've had jobs now throughout high school, gotten pretty good grades up until uni (when things started getting worse), and in general am a functioning person. But focusing takes so much energy, everything just feels like a chore, it always feels like Im doing something wrong, and I cant remember the last time i was genuinely excited about something &amp; not just being excited for the sake of someone else. It feels like theres this big swath of fog between me &amp; the real world and nothing is really tangible.

On and off, through the years, I've self harmed a bit, drank a bit more than the usual, not eaten, the classic stuff. But it's never really gotten in the way of my life &amp; Im a private person so no one really knows.

I'm 18, and for the last year or so I've just started freaking out anytime anyone asks me or talks to me about my future. I don't know what I want to do with myself and I just can't imagine living the rest of my life like this. if there were no repercussions i would just call it quits rn.

In the past two weeks i havent really eaten, havent gotten out of bed, havent gone to class, drinking, started picking my skin and scratching,  and every day have had some sort of passive suicidal ideation. I have a doctors appointment in three days (unrelated) and am thinking about asking about medication/treatment options, but it hasnt been very long and the last time it was this bad was a quite while ago so im not sure if i should just try and let it pass.

idk i think im being dramatic. sometimes i think bc ive seen these things in other people ive just started to mimic them in a weird Munchhausen sort of way. but im averse to attention so maybe I just do it so i can have an excuse for being like this &amp; pity myself? A part of me wants this to get worse and i dont know why. 

o well this was just kinda nice to type out thanks if you took the time to read it. godspeed to all of you &amp; lots of love",12Mar2019,2

I am reaching out because I need someone to ask me the questions i dont know i need to be asking myself. I need guidance through this patch of my life.

7,"I am just clueless about what life is and what is the purpose of it? I have been struggling with depression for approximately 2.5 years with no respite. Just had a false hope in between wherein I honestly thought for a while that I had beaten it. But there it is, I am back in the rut with no hope. I wasn't the happiest kid growing up but at least I was focused which helped me to keep myself distracted from this. And some may say, it all paid off as well. I graduated from an Ivy League school last year and got a job at the Wall Street.  A good career, a comfortable life? Wasn't this supposed to be the key to happiness ? I cant even remember when I had my last laugh. I break down at any time of the day, can't sleep properly. My family is on a different continent as well. I just feel extremely lonely. Tried to compensate for it by trying to find a companion but what is even the point of it? Why to destroy someone else's life as well by bringing her into my life. Until now at least I had some goals but now I just feel like wrapping up my stint in this god forsaken world and just leave. Everyday has become a struggle.

8,"I was hospitalized for about two weeks after my ex boyfriend broke up with me (it got messy). I had to come home after my hospitalization and within a few days I tried to kill myself. The thought of suicide had NEVER crossed my mind until...well that day. My parents and I argued and it was too emotionally exhausting. Especially after just being released. That was a month ago.

I have no interest in soccer anymore and want to quit the team. I have a restraining order on my ex boyfriend. My friends are constantly walking on eggshells around me. My parents look at me as a huge disappointment. My family sees me as a failure. My pastor tells me I’m going to hell. 

My father says I’m the reason my mother cannot sleep at night. I’m the reason why she’s missing work getting less hours. I’m the reason why she cries. I’m the reason why she almost got fired. Me. Me. Me. Me. 

Do you know how that feels. To have all this blame? To have nobody? Not even the damn church to talk to? To be the cause of the family falling apart because of a romantic relationship I was in? To smoke weed and say I’m a drug addict and tell the entire family that.... ‘drug addict’. Imagine your grandma hearing that, “your granddaughter is a drug addict.” I’m not even a damn drug addict.

After I moved into my dad's, I still could not share about my depression, but I got much better. I became more happy more often, and my grades went from barely passing to straight A's despite having 3 APs.

24,"21 years in my life, I've never had any close friend at all. Therefore, I've kept it all to myself forever, and never speak to anyone because either they're faking their care for my story (which is very obvious based on my experiences), or they don't care at all.

All started when I'm 8 years old, I had a friend which his father said, and I'm quoting this from my classmates that ""his father doesn't want me to be his friend"". I'm mentally scared from that, thinking what had I did to him wrong or anything. Because on the previous day, he seemed alright plus he gave me a present for no reason, than on that day he left the school and moved to another district.

I'd swore from that day, I will not have any other best friend, and I thought that swore stayed with me. I had 2 bestfriends during my middle school who bith had cut connection with me just because I moved to other school. In highschool, I had one best friend that stay in contact with me until now, but not as frequent as before (since he's in the other college, and he has his own life). He contacted me once in the blue moon.

Now, I'm in college, and I seriously regret my decision for dumping myself in a circle group of what I considered ""friends"" previously (6 in total). They only texted me whenever they need my help, and stay quiet until the next favour. They went out together to shopping complex/cinema/elsewhere minus me. I felt belittle by this. Whenever I asking for favour, they never reply to io (the latest is for 5 days of silence, but everyone seen my message as soon as I send it to the group chat).

Maybe that's karma punishing my own behaviour, but why it should be the entire time? Why this bad omen following me everywhere? My paper presentation were horrible, my public speaking went all to the dump, my relationship with people in general is sour and went south. I'm really clueless.

30,"My wife and I were married in mid October. She is my favorite person. We tied the knot on top of a mountain in the Adirondacks. It was a beautiful day. After the wedding, she started showing some signs of depression, which we chalked up to the fact that we were still living with my parents. Soon after Christmas, she started getting a headache that wouldn’t quit. Then came double vision. After maybe three days of vision problems and maybe a week and a half of a headache, I took her to Urgent Care on January 16. A series of tests and grim-faced doctors revealed she has a very aggressive, high-grade, incurable brain cancer. She’s currently in the middle of an intensive 6 week treatment period of daily radiation and chemotherapy. We were told originally that hair loss would be minimal, mainly confined to the areas where the radiation was focused. I guess her doctor was wrong because this week it started falling out rapidly. The same doctor said it will likely all fall out this week. She’s also started getting incredibly tired this week. I’m of course her primary caregiver, so I’m tired all the time as well. She knows almost all there is to know about her cancer - the name, the gravity of the disease, the fact that it’s incurable - but doesn’t know the statistical nightmare of the thing. 21% of people with her diagnosis are alive one year after diagnosis. 5% are alive 5 years out. The location of her tumor, and the fact that only about 50% could be surgically removed make her long term odds even lower. She was so optimistic when she was in the hospital that we chose not to tell her these statistics for fear that depression would keep her from living her remaining days. I don’t know if was the right decision or the wrong decision, but it was the decision we made. Now I don’t know how to cross that bridge. She just turned 32. I’m 33. We were just about to start our lives. She worked a shitty job to support my way through law school. I had just recently passed the Bar. Nothing gives me joy. I’m just stuck watching this train slowly barreling toward us, and I’m unable to get out of the way. I’m starting therapy on Friday, she’s starting Thursday, and I’m hopeful that that will be a positive step, but my grief is really getting in the way of my life, and hers.

31,"Hey

For anyone out there who is jobseeker who is depression, the best advice I can give you is don’t associate your mental illlness/depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety with your current situation in your life without a job. All that does it turns into vicious cycle and you become defined by status in life, rather than seeing depression as illness at the end day. 

Otherwise you will end up in cycle where every time you are struggling with say self harm, eating disorders, psychosis some idiot says “once you’ve got a job a purpose you will be cured” so we force ourselves thinking we are gonna get a job and get absolute nowhere or end up getting a job and still having depression and some idiot says quit or suck it up or doesn’t believe that you can have a job and depression at the same time or you are too lazy can’t be bothered.and will quit and choose day time telly and be delighted 😀 your a dole person

Remember Depresion, anxiety, ptsd, bipolar disorder, ptsd are illnesses at the end of the day are not lifestyle choices they are not words to describe feelings about status in life.
A person with illness is person with illness that happens to be jobseeker, 
If you are struggling with sucidal thoughts, feelings, self harm issues you are human are struggling and it’s not because jobseeking.

I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for so long. I get these waves of suicidal thoughts because nothing is worth living for. I am at the top of my meter for stress. I got a cat as motivation to help how I’m feeling, while he does help when I’m with him, I can’t help the way I feel when I’m not physically with him. 
Naturally, I’m a very sensitive person and very in tune with everyone/everything around me. I hate to admit it, but I’m a people pleaser. I would rather myself be internally stressed than cause conflict with someone. 

As of lately, things have progressively gotten worse. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years, and recently he found out that he has ocd, anxiety, and progressing towards depression. While I’m trying to be supportive towards him and let him vent to me, I’m in a very hard place because it feels like nothing I say or do can make things easier on him. Seeing my bf go through everything is killing me. I feel so worthless and just think this world would be better without me. 

My self-esteem is non-existent because my mom left me when I was 4, dad found a new woman 2 weeks after my mom left. My dad made my stepmom a bigger priority in his life than I ever was.

34,"Hey Everyone!

So, I was recently diagnosed with Depression around early February. And it was triggered for some reason after I smoked and drank at my friends house (Not an abuser of these two substances whatsoever). I woke up the next morning feeling different...Like I couldn't concentrate on anything, my head was in a ""fog"", and I was just very confused. So, with all these symptoms going on and not knowing what caused these to so abruptly occur, my anxiety SHOT through the roof and had several panic attacks after panic attacks due to the fact that I had no idea what was wrong with me.

I kept grabbing for answers such as: Brain Tumor, ADHD, Schizophrenia, Low Blood Sugar, and the list goes on an on. But never did Depression cross my mind until I started having thoughts of just wanting the pain to stop. And then I started doing research on trying to make sense of my symptoms, and that's when it clicked that I may be depressed. (Also Depression is somewhat common in my maternal side of my family). So, I got prescribed with Lexapro (10mg at the start, but now 20mg). And Lexapro did help with my anxiety but I have zero energy to do anything. It takes a semi-truck to drag me out of bed in the morning (Lol.) and I'm still having difficulty concentrating, which is my biggest concern at the moment.

I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now, and I would say its done some improving but I'm not ""back to my old self"". So, with that being said, does anyone have any tips on struggling with Depression? I've learned that strategies from other people that are going through similar situations help a lot!

5 months ago i had a flat with my brother, a job with my dad making furniture. i fell out with my brother because hes a narcissistic dick sometime who only argues with you to get you angry and turn it back at you by playing victim (though hes still my brother and i love him). i also have high functioning autism to top things off so i have some issues anger, anxiety, ect. along with all of that i have suicidal thoughts on the daily with a sense of not fitting in to this world and wanting to just die because i honestly feel like it would just be easier for everyone who is in my life to not put up with me.. i long for any sort of relationship but self destructed and cut my self off from any chance of a relationship because of a deep set fear of getting hurt over and over. im to the point where i cut off most off my emotions so i dont break down crying every time i get flashbacks ect. honestly the only reason why im still here is because i feel guilty to putting my mother though so much. also a weed addiction because it the only thing that lets me think happy thoughts without dread ect. like i was high for almost a whole year, wake and bake bongs with a cone of about .4gs. id smoke about 2-3 gram a night, 2 months after moving in with my brother 2 years ago. still smoke and really dont plan on stopping because its the only thing that stops me thinking of different ways to kill myself. i really just dont want to be here anymore. but im moving in 3 weeks to where i have a friend so hopefully i dont fuck this up again because i really wont be able to come fucking it up again.

(yeah sorry for getting depressing kinda just ended up this way. im trying to stay positive, and feels god to get this out even if it just a bunch of strange peps on the internet idc) thanks for reading idk﻿",12Mar2019,4
38,"I’ve dealt with depression for years, this year I feel like I’ve gotten a better handle on it and made some good strides in my life. 

However when it hits me, it hits hard like I have no energy, trouble sleeping, and lack of motivation. I try to make myself do something when these episodes hit, but I’m not sure if that’s the best thing to do. But I don’t think simply laying on the sofa until this feeling goes away is better. 

What do you do to manage it? ",12Mar2019,1
39,"**So, I have been reading the book** [**Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D. Burns**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46674.Feeling_Good)**. I have made some notes which have helped me. I wish to share it, hoping it might help others. I would also suggest reading that book. It's a really great book.**

&gt;Sooner or later, the clouds have a way of blowing away and the sky suddenly clears and the sun begins to shine again 

* All your moods are created by your “cognitions,” or thoughts--negative thoughts that flood your mind are the actual cause of your self-defeating emotions
* **Feelings Aren’t Facts**: Even though your depressing thoughts may be distorted, they nevertheless create a powerful illusion of truth. Unpleasant feelings merely indicate that you are thinking something negative and believing it. Your emotions follow your thoughts just as surely as baby ducks follow their mother. But the fact that the baby ducks follow faithfully along doesn’t prove that the mother knows where she is going!

# Cognitive Distortions

1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
2. OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
3. MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that colors the entire beaker of water.
4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject positive experiences by insisting they “don’t count” for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences
5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.
6. MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else’s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow’s imperfections). This is also called the “binocular trick.”
7. EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: “I feel it, therefore it must be true.
8. LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: “I’m a loser.” When someone else’s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: “He’s a goddam louse.” Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.
9. PERSONALIZATION: You see yourself as me cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.

# Start by Building Self-Esteem

&gt;*First, you cannot earn worth through what you do. Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness. Self-worth based on accomplishments is a “pseudo-esteem,” not the genuine thing! You also cannot base a valid sense of self-worth on your looks, talent, fame, or fortune. Marilyn Monroe, Mark Rothko, Freddie Prinz, and a multitude of famous suicide victims attest to this grim truth.*   
*Nor can love, approval, friendship, or a capacity for close, caring human relationships add one iota to your inherent worth. The great majority of depressed individuals are in fact very much loved, but it doesn’t help one bit because self-love and self-esteem are missing.*   
***At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel.***

**“Triple-column technique”** can be used to restructure the way you think about yourself when you have goofed up in some way. The aim is to substitute more objective rational thoughts for the illogical, harsh self-criticisms that automatically flood your mind when a negative event occurs

* Make three columns with headings: Automatic thought, cognitive distortion and Rational response
* **Column 1 (Automatic thought)**: Write down all those hurtful self-criticisms you make when you are feeling worthless and down on yourself. *For example, “I never do anything right,” and “Everyone will look down at me.” Write these thoughts in the first column.*   
Just as fast as these thoughts cross your mind, jot them down. Why? Because they are the very cause of your emotional upset. They rip away at you like knives tearing into your flesh. 
* **Column 2 (Cognitive Distortion)**: Using the above list of cognitive distortions, see if you can identify the thinking errors in each of your negative automatic thoughts. *For instance, “I never do anything right” is an example of overgeneralization. Write this down in the middle column.*
* **Column 3 (Rational Response)**: You are now ready for the crucial step in mood transformation—substituting a more rational, less upsetting thought in the right-hand column. You do not try to cheer yourself up by rationalizing or saying things you do not believe are objectively valid. Instead, try to recognize the truth.  
If what you write down in the Rational Response column is not convincing and realistic, it won’t help you one bit. Make sure you believe in your rebuttal to self-criticism. *For example, in answer to “I never do anything right,” you could write, “Forget that! I do some things right and some wrong, just like everyone else. Let’s not blow this up out of proportion.”*

|Automatic Thought|Cognitive Distortion|Rational Response|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*I never do anything right*|*overgeneralization*|*I do some things right and some wrong, just like everyone else. Let’s not blow this up out of proportion*|

It is crucial to write down your automatic thoughts and rational responses; do not try to do the exercise in your head. Writing them down forces you to develop much more objectivity than you could ever achieve by letting responses swirl through your mind. It also helps you locate the mental errors that depress you.

40,"I'm 17 turning 18 this december. My girlfriend is turning 18 this december. I want to propose to her on her (and my) birthday, I know it's only march, but I had a six thousand dollar custom ring (I saved up for two almost three years to afford it) made specifically for her. This is where depression and anxiety comes into play. Anxiety is telling me she's gonna say no cuz I'm so stressed, anxious and sad all the damn ttim and that she only tells me what I want to hear. Depression is telling me that she's only dating me out of pity because ""sad boys aren't loveable and can't get a girl (or guy)"" and she doesn't actually love me. Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt that she truely loves me with all of her heart, but anxiety and depression are getting in the way of me proposing to my dream girl. What in God's name do I do?
