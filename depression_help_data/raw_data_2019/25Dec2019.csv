1,"hope this is the right place to write this. 

i have been suffering from depression for more than five years now - it is managed so far. i tried some medications, currently on cymbalta 60, and generally i am all right. some days are worse than others, but i think i learn how to cope with it. what i have been experiencing for the last couple of days, though, is new for me, and i don't know what to do.

i am currently living abroad, and have to be here for a couple of months. my mom, 69 y/o, suffering from mild dementia and generally doing well, has just had a severe UTI with the symptoms of delirium. since I heard about this, I cannot stop crying, cannot focus, cannot stop googling about all the medical conditions she has. she is now at home rested and treated, and my sister is saying that she is doing better and mentally more stable, but I am afraid that she is now in the next stage of the dementia - even though i know it cannot happen this fast, and she will be all right once treated. i  sometimes feel my heart is beating so fast, having trouble breathing, and keep texting my sister to ask how she is doing. i had a video chat with my mom just this morning, she was doing better though sleepy, but i just keep thinking the worst - that she is now worse than before, she has to stop working and eventually even forget everything. i don't have anyone with me right now - i am kms away from home, cannot talk with my friends and family most of the time due to time difference.

i will talk with my therapist once i go back home - we talked about my mother's condition a lot obviously, but she was good - working (less than before, but still), socializing and just doing normal as a 69 y/o. 

i don't know what to do to distract myself. with the holidays and everything, i will be home (alone) tomorrow, it is not good for me as working usually keeps me busy and distracted. what should i do tomorrow, sometimes i feel i cannot breathe.",25Dec2019,1

4,"Based on what I’ve read online, it seems as women often say that they want to go on a break in order to eventually break up. We had a long conversation, and she said that she’s considering breaking up for a clichéd reason, that she needs to find herself or something. I tried to ask her questions to better understand her position, but her answers were vague. It seems as if she’s seriously considering breaking up. 

I’m devastated. This came from nowhere. Everything seemed fine. We were even planning to take a week-long vacation to Hawaii.

I’ve had depression for a while. I’ve noticed that I tend to be less depressed while in a relationship. I want to be with my girlfriend.

I don’t want our relationship to end, but I realize that I’m powerless to sustain it. I don’t know what to do. I want to die.",25Dec2019,1

9,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time now. Apart from the occasional episode, I can usually manage it quit well. But knowing I’m facing another Christmas alone while everyone else is off with their families. Is just really destroying me at the moment. Feel more alone than ever. All I want is to know is that someone really cares. I really finally see exactly how a man who is financially broke as fuck but has a loving family around him at Christmas is richer than someone with all the money in the world but spends it alone.",25Dec2019,1

What helps for your depression aside taking meds.

12,"All I can think about looking at parents Christmas tree is that i will.never have this. All i want to do with my life is drink and forget / indulge in my present negative emotions. Like I see someone like once a m6but that doesn't help at all. all I can think about are what the fuck is wrong with me and how I'm never going to ve rid of this. It never ends; there's always something that makes me feel like shit all the fucking time.  I am probably an alcoholic but that doesn't stop me. Drinking just makes me feel better even if it doesn't if you guys understand. I dknt know what to do, because this shit keeps on happening and I dont know how long I can keep on doing this.",25Dec2019,1

14,"Hey I just need to get some words off my chest, because I'm extremely in pain. My parents are divorced for 10 years. He made us goes trough hell, and he is one of the big reasons I got so depressed this last years. I loved him so much when I was a kid, I saw I'm has an idol at once, but he turned out to be a disaster to my mother/s rest of the family, and ended up leaving me with no support. I was mostly raised by grandparents and I got many personality traits from my grandfather and none from my mother or grandmother... Maybe some agility traits like cooking, handling with work and such but 0 personality traits.
This 10 years, all the shit went trough me, like SERIOUSLY! It looks like I have the fault of everything that my father made (didn't paid for the divorce, asked money yo every member of my family, gave me no support, betrayed my mom, made me almost lose my home, went to London for a job and completely fucked his car and stopped paying it so my mom had to... Like more than 20k out off the blue... He got a girlfriend in the begging off the divorce ended things and then the women for revenge called some men to fuck his house (thank you lady i wish i could do the same), and beyond imagination...).
This same 10y I get the usual comments ""you look exactly like your father"", ""you are like your father"", ""you act like your father""... I got depressed and hide my feelings till this year. One of the shittiest year so far.
I can't get rid of my father from me, I will be always on his ""shadows""... Everything. I tell people ""to fuck off"" more often, thanks to my psychiatrist, but now they use that in their favour because they know that hurts me and makes me fragile. I don't know what to do any more...
I don't expect to anyone had the answers for me but maybe if someone is out there with the same issue... we can help with other grow from this.

Sry (in a way) for my childish act but I can't grow without dealing with this first.",25Dec2019,1

17,"I’m a senior in high-school, about to turn 17 and please excuse my grammar, English is my second language.

I recently got off a long term relationship with a girl, we were together for 2.5 years and she dumped me because we just didn’t fit. We broke up twice, the first time I came back to her and told her that I’ll fix everything but I managed to fuck that up just like everything in my life. I’ve never achieve something that I should be proud of, I’ve messed up everything I’ve touched, I have bad grades and I’m not athletic. The only talent I have is crying, and I’m not even the best at that too.

But back to the subject, 2 months after we broke up, I fell in love with another girl that is in my friend group, she’s very flirty, we flirted a lot this past week, but now she’s doing the same to one of my friends and he’s also my best friend. 

I try so hard not to hate my friend because it’s not his fault, it’s not her either, I don’t control but I also don’t control my jealousy and my anger.

Please someone help me.",25Dec2019,1
18,"Tl;dr: depression came back to me and I don't even get the time of day from family which makes it worse

So this is the year I break, I hate Christmas, every single year I have to spend it with family that is constantly judging me, breaking my stuff, leaving my room a mess, annoying family stuff etc., anyways, what I would at least look forward to was that my parents got me something I asked for because I barely asked for anything but year after year I've been getting less love, gifts, etc. from them despite me being the main reason the house isn't a mess or burned down, I didn't really care much but with my depression coming back I really just hoped they'd at least say they love me but guess what they didn't and they instead got extended family we don't talk to much any attention, expensive gifts, and more, all I got was a broken heart, the feeling that I'm being disposed of, and a broken door, I know people have it worse than I do but I just really wanted my family to show they care, even if I got no gifts I wouldn't have minded if they showed they care but they don't, sorry for such a long rant",25Dec2019,1
19,"I'm cynical and nihilist. Also I cry to make me fall asleep. I said to my mom that I hate being alive because every second of my existence makes me feel literally pain, except when I'm very high.

For the generalist doctor it was obviously a depression. He sent me to a therapist and he said I have severe depression and generalized anxiety.

Fuck that, I know I don't deserve happiness because decided so and he is a real cunt. Fuck you God. I don't need to be happy. Yes I'm weak, but I'm stronger than my pain. I WILL live in that pain my entire life and work so the people who are able to feel happiness will have a great life. I will wait for the blessed day of my death but not fucking suicide and make my relatives sad.
I don't even want to write this. But I'm doing it so people stop lamenting on their live when I live in a constant suffer but don't kill myself even if death is the only thing that can fix my pain because I want to bring something to society.

You don’t want me around and that’s fine, I don’t expect you to or anything! I wanted to honor you when you said you need time for yourself, and I got the message haha. Just a few things I wanted to say before you leave entirely though! I care, and always will even when we don’t talk. I hope you find cute doggos and a reason to smile everyday! Every time I see a big cute doggo I think of you lol, I saw one that looked like Gus the other day, it even had a bandana! I know that you think you aren’t good enough for anything and that nobody should ever care about you because you don’t see the good in yourself but only the bad. Well you are good enough, always. I see how much good there is in you (there’s so so so much), I see when you have the bad days too, and I loved all of it unconditionally. Anyways, I know you don’t feel anything for me and that’s okay! I’m glad you found the strength to make a choice to leave when you’ve always been scared of everyone leaving you. 

You have the sweetest soul, a heart full of love and caring. You’re smart as hell, strong af and a fighter. You’re super cute too !

23,"My friends name is Clare, she (mtf19) admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital because of her depression and suicidal tendencies a few weeks ago. A big reason for her depression is the fact that she is trans and hates her body, her trans-phobic father isn't helping much either...

She is an amazing person that i really admire and just wish to have a happy life.

I kinda ""stole"" my now boyfriend from Clara and I still feel terrible about it.

Long story short:

\- Me and Tim met -&gt; got close -&gt; Tim broke up with Clara -&gt; we became a couple -&gt; Tim and I met with Clara -&gt; Me and Clara started doing things without Tim (became friends(?))

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can help me with the following:

Am I in a position to help/support Clara?

* I suffered from depression and social anxiety for the better part of my life and had no friends for like 10 years (still don't have any), that is why I'm not sure if me and Clara are really friends or if she is just an acquaintance of mine and I think too much into our relationship  (would it be stupid to ask if she considers me a friend? or even hates me for stealing her bf?)

What can i really say to her?

* I know what depression is like for me but i cant even compare to how much she seems to suffer right now.
* Literally what do i reply why she tells me that she ""just wants to die"", I have have barley any ""conversation skills"", and that's beyond my capability, best i can come of is ""please don't""

Is there anything i can do to not be overwhelmed by everything?

* i have two weeks till my exams beginn, I feel terrible for Clara, I feel terrible about myself, and everyday feels like one day closer to my old self and i just fear becoming that miserable me again

I just recently have started hating myself and I don’t know who to talk to. I’m amongst the “popular” crowd so all of my friends are insanely attractive and get girls with ease, all of my friends have had sex at least 5+ times while I remain a virgin. I never really cared what I looked like until about 6 months ago when I started getting pretty bad acne. None of my friends ditched me for this; it’s not like I was Prince Charming at the beginning, but I often catch them looking at my forehead instead of my eyes etc... I started hating everything about myself . My big nose and the way it scrunches when I smile. My not perfect teeth. My fucking acne. My big forehead. My annoying voice. My annoying face. My fucking everything. Whenever I see a mirror or just taking pics on Snapchat I just want to punch something. To make matters worse my 2 older brothers are models and beautiful people and so is my mom and father. Like I’m a complete fuck up, I fucking hate it and I hate my life, I’m not even depressed I just hate my life. And I’ve reached puberty so I won’t have that “glow up”. I don’t even know why I’m saying something on here I just wanted to find help.",25Dec2019,1
