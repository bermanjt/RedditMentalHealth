0,"(I think) I've felt depressed since 2 years because of study, family, relations, future work, etc.

Wednesday 8, I posted a thing here and was given some advice (thank you) 

Friday 10, I decided to go to the hospital. And I was admitted right away.

Still, during the hospitalisation that lasted 10 days, I didn't feel better.

They treated me with Valium and then started antidepressant Monday after admission.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm back home, with my own depressive habits.

I don't want to talk everyone around me, even my best friend because I'm feeling guilty of being their burden.

It seems that I repeated everything to everyone over and over again. Every time I've talked about myself is even causing me more depression but still with no solution... 

Reaching for help is very tiring for me. And I'm tired of this shit in my head right now. I just want to get back to my work and be happy with everyone around me.",29May2019,35
1,"So usually I have mild (manageable) depression and I can still deal but these past few days have really messed me up...

I graduate hs this year and am super stressed about next year/life decisions... but the past few days that stress has gone away after a few mental breakdowns.

 Now I have an empty feeling, but instead of the usual its like even bigger of a void... i feel on the verge of tears 24/7 which is weird because I pretty much don't have enough emotion to cry, I havent been eating very much and my head hurts and feels spacy all the time... idk why its so much worse then usual, also things are generally more painful wtf

Gonna talk to the social worker at my school, but if anyone knows wtf is going on or has any support/advice that would be greatly appreciated",29May2019,1

3,"(this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go)

I'm an 18 y/o dude. I'm starting my first year of college this August. I've been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but I'm afraid of what might happen if I do it.

We're all Christians (my family's Catholic). I know a lot of people I care about won't approve of me when/if I come out.

I project myself as this ""straight"" guy who's ""just an ally/supporter"" for LGBTQ rights. I've fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of same-sex civil unions online &amp; offline.

It's been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dad's also the president of our Catholic church choir. He's also VERY outspoken about being anti-LGBTQ. 

I find it hard to come out to my family because we're super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin (female) came out, they recommended her to go to ""conversion therapy"". I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my uncles/aunts.

I won't be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors I've just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. It's ironic that it's hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. 

Still haven't catch up with a friend/church leader from church/school. I feel bad for ghosting/avoiding friends from this church I used to go to (Born Again Christian). The last time I went to that church was July 2018. There's this one friend, let's call him ""Matthew*"", who used to be my youth group leader and is also a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race and Queer Eye. We both went to the same school (same grade but different strands) in Senior High. However, I'm not so sure if he'd react positively if I openly accept my bisexuality since the church he serves in has made anti-lgbt preachings. When we graduated Senior High School on April last month, I messaged him &amp; promised we'd catch up with each other about life since we haven't talked/seen each other at church for a long time, but we still haven't done it and still haven't talked to each other ever since.

Maybe I might come out as bi to a few close friends soon, or maybe not. I've noticed my teacher from 11th grade seems to be an ally and I even consider him a great close friend, so he's definitely one of the first people I'll come out to (IF I decide to do it).

I think to myself that some things are better left unsaid, but these unsaid words are killing me, and they've been building up in my head for a long time.

It's hard to be yourself when you're not what most people want/expect you to be.

I've been thinking about leaving this Earth, maybe write individual notes to each of my friends/family before I go. The only reasons why I still haven't pursued this is because I don't want to hurt my family &amp; friends, and I'm afraid of dying without fulfillment (for now, at least).

And even if I come out to a few friends, what if the word comes out and it got spread to some people until it might reach my family/friends and they avoid me? It's just hard to wrap my head around.

There's always those things &amp; thoughts bringing me down. I consider myself an agnostic now. I just want to be accepted but I fear the people/family/friends around me won't take it well. I don't know anymore.",29May2019,1
4, A series of continuous fuck ups has left me(20 f ) attempting to coast through life as numb as possible. I'm a college dropout who moved back in with my parents and can't seem to keep a steady job due to my overwhelming anxiety and depression I'm also in a bit of legal trouble. I just can't bring myself to get it together I don't know what it will genuinely take for me to pick myself up and dust myself off. I've had to attend two funerals within this past week and it has left me completely drained. After the funeral today I was hanging out with a friend who offered me some coke in hopes it'd make me feel better. I hate to admit it but I LOVED the way it made me feel. I can already predict that if I make this a habit it won't end well for me. I'm afraid if I don't stop myself from running my life into the ground soon I'll eventually come to the conclusion suicide is the only way out of this mess I've made for myself.

I've just been kicked out of university, for the second time now, I couldn't bring my GPA high enough to stay in. I am currently working as an entry level accountant but this news just broke me, I don't know what to do, how to feel or how to move on, I'm a complete disappointment to my family. I haven't told my parents yet but I know it'll break their hearts. I don't know what to do.. And I've been getting dark thoughts and anxiety attacks to the point where I puke.. I feel so lost and broken, I come from a strict family that values education above all, so all my life all I thought about doing was how to make my parents happy and at every single turn, all I've done is the opposite.

8,"I went on a 5150 hold a week ago, and stayed in a facility for three days. A few months prior I was experiencing behavior I’ve never really experienced before. I’ve maybe gone through a mild bunch of those feelings maybe 3-4 times throughout 32 years. During that time I was diagnosed as Borderline. I agreed with it at the time, but now that my mind is a bit clearer I think that I was wrong.

Or if I hold a friend as one of my closest friends, but they see it entirely differently, such as just seeing me as a normal or somewhat distant friend, I'll go through the same phases. I think about this a lot, and it just seems so petty. Really, I'm making a huge deal out of nothing, when it should really just be taken as a grain of salt.

14,"So I posted once before and after reading some comments on here and through some of my comments on my last post, I started thinking and realized I have no idea how boundaries are supposed to work in a case of depression.
I usually handle depression by revealing it to my close inner circle and not really talking about it to my more peripheral friends (which i guess i have quite a lot) so to say. Some closer friends know about it, but the people I actually end up leaning on are my parents and my boyfriend; those are the people I'd call when id be feeling completely empty. Most of it right now is just emotional support since I live in another country now on my own and get a scholarship (not allowed to work because of it tho). I also have never mentioned to my parents I have occasional suicidal thoughts and have had attempts. I still try to not cross certain lines.
I also go to therapy regularly. 
In the past, i usually kept most my darker feelings inside, so the whole sharing thing is something that happened in the last two years.
But there is a strain on my relationships, especially with my very optimistic boyfriend. Recently after a fairly bad week, he did confront me with ""lately you've been so depressed I feel like i can't even talk to you anymore"". He said he never thought about breaking up, but I have my doubts about our compatibility. There is something deeply hurtful when he says he wouldn't break up with me because he's sure Ill change eventually. I admit changes are needed, but I also don't want my partner to try and change me, but to accept me. 
Another relationship i royally screwed up is the relationship with my best friend of about 6 years, where i isolated her because of my own jealousy, following a complicated or maybe petty turn of events depending on how you look at it. It's eating me from the inside, but I also feel hurt because it felt like i was there for her in her darker moments, but now im here and she's not. 

Does anyone have any concrete advice for handling relationships when you are depressed? How much can you actually lean on people? How do yo not hurt people you love when you yourself ate unstable?

Should o break up with my boyfriend if we have such different temperaments? Is there any hope for actually repairing damaged relationships like with my best friend?",29May2019,1
15,"Sorry, this is my first reddit post, I'm fairly new to the community. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

Like (presumably) a lot of people, I felt as if I was incredibly smart growing up. I was able to start school early when I was younger, I had a near perfect GPA, I painted, I played multiple instruments, and my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools. My future looked really bright.

However, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that I really was not in the right state of mind). I couldn't get up to eat, I cried at random times at school, **(warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) \*\*** I began to harm myself a lot (like I mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and I was just deep into depression. I tried to commit suicide multiple times, **\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

Like I've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.

Luckily, I did well enough in school before all of this happened, so I was awarded a scholarship to let me go to community college for free— so I didn't completely self-sabotage my future. So I've been working on transferring for the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm so distraught. I feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain. I slur when I talk, I developed a bit of a lisp, I can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, I even forget letters when writing (for example, I would write ""oadside"" instead of ""roadside"" or ""mozzera"" instead of ""mozzerella""). I feel so, so disappointed in myself and it's ruining my self esteem. I even had to say the phrase ""I want to know what I originally got on my essay"" three times the other day to my professor because I couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal?? Like I said, it's ruining my self esteem completely, and I feel like I'll never be the person I once was. I'm starting to relapse back into my depression because I feel so worthless, and I feel like I don't know what to do. I've tried reading more, downloading cognitive supporting apps (like Luminosity?), and I've been sleeping okay and drinking lots of water. But I don't know. Has anyone experienced something like this and was able to rework themselves back to the person they originally were? If so, how did you do it?

Or am I doomed to plummet even further than I am now...

17,"Im in a pretty bad place now. My mother kicked me out about 3 weeks ago. I took the money out of my bank account that she trusted me to keep for tax evasion and spent it all on myself and hotels as an act of rebellion. I’ve been living in hotels since i got kicked out. Today i got a message from my friend that my mom messaged him about the deregistration from parental home. That means there will be no more benefits from the government financially.
I skipped my last appointment with my psychologist because i heard from that friend that my mom was going to ambush me there and take away everything i had on me by force with her boyfriend and my uncle.

18,"**If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts consider:**

Learning to control my thoughts &amp; actively choosing the thoughts I think, rejecting negative thoughts, instead of going along with whatever pops in my mind, it gets easier the more u practice it. This is not meant to be the *""big solution to depression""*, but it still helps suppress depression &amp; suicidal thoughts for long periods of time, which is a great improvement from being severely depressed on a daily basis. I learned ""your thoughts determines your perspective &amp; your perspective determines your mood &amp; your mood determines who u become"" taking my mind off myself also helps.

**Another thing that helps:**

Pursuing new goals &amp; finding new interest. Having a new purpose for living, having something to look forward to &amp; a worthwhile reason to get up in the morning is 1 of the biggest struggles any person with depression have imo.

Lately i keep having dreams where i bump into my ex boyfriend and he traps me in his flat and attempts and sometimes succeeds to rape and sexually assault me.
My ex never sexually abused me or abused me physically, we did not have a happy relationship however and he used to emotionally manipulate me. I am terrifed of meeting him on the street and lately he has been on my mind because i found out he is engaged and i keep seeing pics of him on social media.
Then i had a dream that i bumped into my dad on the street and he was trying to flirt with me and touched my bum so i had to make an excuse to walk away. My mum kicked my dad out the house when i was young because he was an alcoholic, we have not had much of a relationship since and he disappeared for ages before adding me on Facebook.
Its worth noting that 1 of the people who sexually assaulted me as a teenager was also a person who abused my family for a long time, i have a lot of trauma from those years and had trouble getting into relationships because of that trauma.
Im not sure why i am now having violent dreams of assault. Other than seeing pics of my ex, I'm not sure what has twiggered such nightmares.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling very depressed lately (obviously?) and I feel the need to vent to people on the internet because I feel like if I talk to anyone in my personal life about everything, I will too much and I do not want to burden others with everything. In short, I will use bullet points to keep things organized and easier to read.

Triggers for my depression are the following;

* Mainly that my grandmother recently alerted me that the cyst growing on her kidney has increased in size and has become abnormal in shape. She is having a cat-scan done to determine whether it is cancerous or not and we will know next week. I understand that things like this happen, that it may or may not be something to worry about, etc. it's just making me a nervous wreck because there's a possibility that something terrible can happen from this. 
* My current job status is uncertain. I am working at a job that is sort of dealing with the profession I am going back to school with (I'm on my 2nd degree after I decided the first path wasn't feeling as good). I've been searching for a better job or one dealing with the field I am interested in. I've been job searching for a while, several were very promising and I am MORE than qualified for basic entry level jobs. That's the problem, I am too qualified and no one can afford to give me the pay I require to pay my bills or the hours needed. I left a good paying job for my current one and I am regretting this decision, more so since (see below) and now I am in need of a job that pays more so I can pay for schooling and not take out a personal loan which will in turn, cause me to have yet another debt and bill.
* I applied to my old job, understanding that my position was filled but knowing that they were shorthanded in all the kitchens so I would be an asset. The boss above my boss (and the one in charge of hiring and pay) told me that my kitchen was fully staffed (its not, he was lying) and that he needs me in another kitchen that I am not experienced in and that I am not really interested in going in. I do need to make money, yes, but I also would like to be doing what I love and what I am good at because it brings me joy. I do not feel comfortable in another kitchen and I was offended that he only sees me as a ""body"" to put in a position simply because he ""needs someone with a brain in the kitchen"". I cried at the sort of interview and told him it was because I was nervous. It was really because I didn't expect to be given that ultimatum. Also, they cannot pay me the salary I had when I left (even though he could easily open a position for me, he is just cheap and all the money he saves during the year he gets as a bonus so do the math here). That is upsetting since I will be commuting an HOUR from my home to go to work and I need a higher pay to offset that.
* I am on my 2nd degree, returning to school was a hard decision and it has been difficult but I am able to make really good grades and maintain a full time job. I recently found out that I was nearing the max hours and will not be able to receive financial aid after this coming year, leaving a full year of tuition (roughly $8000) and an internship ($15000) needing to be given out of pocket. The financial situation is stressing me out a lot as I still have my normal bills to consider.
* While I was at work, the dogs I am dog-sitting ate my milano cookies and made a mess. They seem find but not only am I out of cookies to soothe me, I had to clean up dog puke on the couch and I have to watch them to make sure the 2 cookies they ate (I don't think they liked them and only had 2 before giving up on them) don't kill them. 

Advice is welcomed on any of these things, I am pretty level headed and I understand that life sucks. I understand that it is unpredictable and that I will mess up and learn from my mistakes. It is just very hard for me right now. I binge applied to a bunch of jobs (probably 3, I exaggerate) because I was so insulted and mad. I really don't mind a commute, but it would have to pay well enough and have really great benefits. A few places I applied to offer tuition assistance so that will make up for the lower pay I am expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

I am on medication for anxiety/depression, but during times of great stress like now I usually have to ask for an upped dosage for a month or two to get me through. I will be able to have temporary insurance (hopefully) in July so then I will talk to my doctor about this, I just cannot afford to do so in the time being. I am lucky most of the time because I can usually get out of these moods and make myself more cheerful, but this is just hard right now.

31,I have been battling depression and anxiety since my mom passed in 2005.  I have been in and out of mental health hospital many times. Also in 2005 my boyfriend got addicted to pain pills. He got off and did good. 2017 we started fight for my custody of my grand daughter. Also a woman that worked with my boyfriend fell in love with him. He started talking to her. He argued over it a lot. He also was drinking and being aggressive toward me. This was very unlike him. I found out he was still talking to her and asked him to leave. He convinced me to give it another try. Since the middle of 2018 it’s been horrid. We argue all the time. That woman is the topic of most arguments. In Feb of this year I found out that he was starting taking pills again. He said he was depressed and needed help. Things haven’t been the same. I was on a great combo of meds but had to be taken off one because of heart issues. Since then I haven’t been the same. Recently the company he works for sold out to some one else and he is loosing his job. My friend that I used to talk to is having stress seizures. She don’t call me or text anymore. Me and him argue all the time. He says he isn’t taking pills anymore but I am not so sure. The past few days face book has been bad for people being mean to other people. It’s more than I can take. I was sort of attacked on my own face book for having an opinion about sexual assault. I deactivated it. Now my boyfriend is in the hospital sick and will have to be here for a few days. My grand daughter is always saying she is mad at me or don’t like me. She talks back and smarts off and she is only 4. I had a support group I posted in on fb but it even because a place of hurt because people were attacking each other. Now I have no one. I feel so defeated.,29May2019,1
32,What can I do as someone who has issues with depression and possible anxiety disorder but can't afford medical insurance let alone uninsured visit to therapist?,29May2019,2
33,I don’t what to do. Nothing makes me happy and I’m so tired of being alive. I’m always so stressed out and sad and tired and angry. I hate talking to people. The things that used to bring me joy don’t and I’m just really sad all the time. I think about suicide all the time and I have come really close to actually doing it but then I get scared at the last moment. One of these days however I might just actually do it and that just sucks. I have nobody and I feel so empty. I don’t know what to do.,29May2019,5
34,"Im sorry but this requires a bit (a lot) of context.


A couple of years ago I was an army cadet in the British Army Cadet Force or ACF (it’s a youth organisation funded by the ministry of defence and has existed for hundreds of years) and I absolutely ducking loved it! It was my life. It was everything to me. I was quiet and had little to no confidence but the army cadets brought me in and gave me a second family! I’d go every Monday and Wednesday uniformed ironed (myself) and boots shiny with polish (and effort) I wheat on every camp I prioritised this over school and my own personal wellbeing I’m also planning on joining the army (cadets is why) but towards the end of my time at my detachment i was really depressed and wanted to die but I put all this behind me and vowed to not miss one cadet night or camp for a year! (Almost did it too) and I was trying to get a promotion to lance corporal alongside one of my friends and i put in everything (I also told them I was struggling with my parents breaking up ETC) I also went in one the worst day of my life when I woke up crying wishing I was dead and I still went in and did my bit (it was also my birthday) and at the end of the year all my hard work and effort lead to nothing I didn’t get promoted and it fucking destroyed me two years later and I can’t let go. Some of my best memories and great friends but I put in **EVERYTHING** and it all when up in smoke. 
I even thought about shooting myself with a rifle on a range weekend but decided against it because I didn’t want other cadets to have that be their last memory of me with the back of my head missing.

I just can’t let it go. And it’s tearing my head apart again.",29May2019,1
