0,"First, just to get this out of the way. Yes, I am seeing a psychologist. Yes, I am on medication. Yes, I realize I have to ""be the change"" and all that other BS. I know I may come off bitter, angry, and suicidal, but that is because I am bitter, angry, and suicidal.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is I just feel less and less able to care about anything anymore. I feel dead inside. Soulless. I have nothing in my life other than my job and I hate my job. I have no education or training, so I am doomed to keep getting stuck in the same sort of work in the same sort of companies until I do something to change that, but I have, NO DAMN IDEA what I want to do with my life still, at 40 y/o.

&amp;#x200B;

I got divorced in 2017 and it pretty much destroyed my ability to trust or believe I will ever be capable of maintaining another relationship ever again. I am miserably lonely and haven't had any luck, other than bad luck, with online dating apps. My psychologist has encouraged me to keep trying, so that I am putting myself out there, but I just get nothing in return from these apps, other than fake accounts catfishing me. I am discouraged and feel completely inadequate.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no social life, I just have never been good at making friends or finding a place I feel that I belong. I just always feel like I'm an also-ran in every social event I attend. I am there, but I am not present. Again, I feel very little inside. I have tried reading self-help books and other such posts here on Reddit, but it all either seems like such obvious advice or it just doesn't make an impact. Nothing seems to help me gain any sort of confidence in myself. I feel like an impostor, I have nothing to offer and no business talking to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm miserable and can't sleep. I feel disgusting and useless and nothing helps motivate me. I have nothing to look forward too and no real belief that I ever will. I have become so pessimistic and cynical that I really have lost faith in everything. I don't know what it is that has kept me from just killing myself, but the thoughts are always there and I can't earnestly convey these feelings to anyone without fear of offending them or just getting some platitudinous bullshit. I often feel like this is going to be my last year of life and I don't really care if it hurts anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish there was something that actually worked to get these feelings gone. I have no passions or interests. I feel lost.",21Apr2019,2

5,"Friend, you are not alone.

I've been struggling with depression most of my life, even had some suicidal ideologies. I wish there was some pithy quote I could share from my own counseling that would flip a switch for you and make it all better, but it doesn't work that way. I'm writing this as much for myself, right now, as I am for you.

That voice in your head playing on repeat, telling you things will never get better? That tightness in your chest that feels like your heart is slowly being crushed within you? They're lies. Maybe it's a chemical imbalance, maybe it's something else, but it's not the truth. You may not be able to will the darkness away, but you can recognize it for what it is and stand up to it.

You are not a prisoner in your own life! You have agency; you have within you the ability to overcome. There will be wins, and there will be losses - learn from both and know that you are just that much stronger today than you were yesterday.

You've been dealt a crappy hand, but you get to decide how the story goes from here on (sorry for mixing metaphors).

You have value, you have worth and while you may not feel like it - forgive me if I get too preachy here - God loves you so much, even in your darkest hour, that he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for you. You are THAT special.

The world is brighter place with you in it. Your strength and your fortitude may go unnoticed by all the unburdened folk out there - but I know how strong you really are, and it's inspiring.",21Apr2019,25

10,"Hello, this is somewhat of a comedic post. I'm in the middle of getting my nails done and I have come to the conclusion that the rest of the people getting their nails done probablly feel just as bored out of their minds as I am! I must occupy my time by writing. But some people enjoy reading magazines (or talking?) I am one of the quiet types of people so I usually stay rather silent because I have social anxiety but I do not mind when other people talk out loud in public. I enjoy being there to listen in some cases because growing up, I wasn't allowed by my family to have many friends so I am not the best with social interaction. I wish I was better at this stuff! I am trying to make small talk with the sweet lady doing my nails but I feel so awkward. And embarressed over my leg hair. I haven't shaved but that's because I have been to cosmetology school and we were taught in school not to shave before getting a pedicure because shaving takes off the first layer of skin and makes it easier for people to get an infection etc. Regardless, I still feel self concious about how long my leg hair is whenever I go to get my nails done because I feel bad other people have to see it and I feel bad that the lady who does my nails has to massage lotion into my leg and touch my hairy leg! :'( I normally shave before going though to save myself the embarressment. But long story short, after going to cosmetology school, I have heard stories and I do what I do because I do not want to get a skin rash or an infection of some kind. I have made small talk before with the people that do my nails letting them know that I learned in cosmo school that it was better not to shave before hand and they seemed to agree with me and didn't seem to mind me having the hair. Though, I secretly wonder if it grosses them out but they just pretend that it doesn't. I've had to massage and wash scalps before that were kinda gross to me that I didn't want to wash before, so I can relate on some levels. Regardless of how ""gross"" something is to me though, I take cosmetology seriously and pride myself in helping people look and feel their best selves. I try not to discriminate against anyone because I don't think it feels right. That hasn't stopped people from discriminating against me in life based of what I looked like though. :/ I've had some terrible encounters with that. But even though those encounters hurt, they  made me stronger, and they helped me realize how crappy it is to treat people like crap, so I try my best to get over my phobias enough to help people. I enjoy my work and I wonder if others do too. I feel like some people just care about money and they don't care about actually making the customer look good and that breaks my heart. But I want to hope that there are more people out there that are kind than not. :') So when I get my nails done in public, I always try to be kind despite my anxiety even if the person doing my nails does it wrong or something. I hate being a negative person. So here I am, sitting in a pedicure chair, getting a pedicure, despite my intense anxiety.",21Apr2019,2

15,"I am from Russia. When I was born, I was put into an orphanage where I spent the first two years of my life. Then I was adopted by an American couple along with my biological sister. When I arrived in the US my very first friend was this kid who I‚Äôll call Kev. Kev was a nice kid. we both had attention deficit disorder, we both liked Lego. That was all we needed to be friends. But as the years went by, me and Kev grew distant from eachother. Fast forward to 8th  grade. Me and Kev never talked anymore. Our sisters had some sort of rivalry with one another, but Kev must‚Äôve taken offense that I wasn‚Äôt taking a side in the situation. he would knock my stuff off my desk when he walked by, mess with my stuff(steal my pencils or something) causing me to get lectured in front of 21 other kids about the importance of being prepared because I didn‚Äôt have a pencil. This caused me a great amount of embarrassment. This issue peaked when he basically told me I was a loser in front of another 20 or so kids. Then when this made me sad, everyone was like, ‚Äúwhy are you such a downer, Nikt0?‚Äù
 That is the main aspect of why I have problems trusting others.

21,"I don't really know what to do or even who to be anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is a current fact of my life. The state at which I exist in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I open my eyes upon waking and I am immediately in a reality that I don't really want to be in, for more reasons than I have energy to list off. I don't really have energy for anything beyond basic survival at this point, and sometimes, not even that. I guess that's clinical depression, or so I think. I've never been officially diagnosed on the record by a therapist or anything that constitutes as a professional. I talk to myself sometimes, or maybe a lot, but I'm usually none the wiser. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't really classify myself as a ""lonely"" person, per se. Maybe in an ultimate sense, a cosmic one, but not on Planet Earth. I have a lot good friends, and a serious girlfriend, though family members seem to be few and far between but that's been a normal part of my life since my consciousness took flight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know.  Being alone is actually pretty okay most of the time. My space, my vibe, my world. Just a lot of me. Which could seem selfish, but in an era where the life of everyone is everywhere, it's nice to kind of step back and fade to black.

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere along my youth, around junior high, I lost the ability to operate on autopilot. I stopped being able to just.. not think about who I am, where I am, what's going on, what will happen, what could happen, how I got here, how you got here, how we got here, where the universe came from, how it came from, what's beyond it, and blah, blah, blah, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is called anxiety.. or so I think. The nightmares, insomnia, panic attacks (even in my sleep!), derealization, depression, dizziness, heart palpitations, inability to eat, trust issues, suicidal thoughts and swirling black hole of chaos in my stomach would lead me to that conclusion and diagnosis, anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just fired from my job, again. I've had three or four in the past year or so. I couldn't once again bear the thought of getting up for just one more day to do the same thing I do every day, at a place that I hate. An incessant, infinite rotation of familiarity. And so I just stopped going. Decided to sleep for a week and woke up to the consequence of my self sabotage. I suppose it's not really a big deal. I work mostly shitty retail gigs that pay minimum wage, and so it's not like I lost a career or a passion. If anything, retail has consumed my light &amp; passion, which involves a lot of writing and music.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent my whole life growing up around nothingness in the Midwest, and I left when I was 21. I sold all of my things, even objects of passion, like instruments, and I jumped on a plane to Southern California. 

&amp;#x200B;

I planned the whole move in a week. It was the most irrational, terrifying, anxiety inducing, beautiful, adventurous, freeing thing that I have ever done. And it worked out great, for a while. I got an apartment right next to the ocean. You could see the waves and sailboats from my driveway. I somehow ended up escaping everything thing I had ever known and building a life for myself in a place nobody I ever knew made it to. Sort of became a hometown hero. The one who found a way out. Moved onto something better. Left the shitty neighborhood with the crack addicts and the gunshots to the land of legal weed and palm trees. But I didn't even graduate high-school. Never had the energy for that, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew what I was worth and what I came from, which wasn't much of anything, so what the fuck was I thinking?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 now and everything kind of fell apart. Stopped being able to hold a consistent job, or show up on time, or even show up most of the time. I worked my way up to a manager position and even that didn't make me take my life seriously, which ultimately disappointed those around me, who are also victims of a slave ship and soulless corporate machine that they still can't see. 

&amp;#x200B;

No amount of expectation or responsibility helped me view my life as anything more than an intricate joke, even in a beautiful place that I had dreamt about for my whole life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three months late on my rent (about -$4,000) and evicted May 1st. Back to the Midwest. Square one and not a thing to call my own. I think about suicide every single day now. I try to talk to my friends about it, but I don't feel like they ever really understand - that I feel suffocated and helpless and I don't see a way out. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, I only **think** that I'm depressed. That's just my completely uneducated opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

27,"I've never been particularly social, but I've always wanted to be. About 10 years ago I was a lot more than I am now, had a few friends I'd go out of town with and stuff.

Gradually the friends just moved on and we didn't see each other anymore. Looking back it's surprising how much I used to do compared to now.

Lately most of my weekends consist of sitting on the computer or doing a few things around the house. Even after I didn't socialize as much, I enjoyed going to garage sales or flea markets on the weekends. Lately I've been doing a lot less of that. I just feel tired and lazy, and I'll have all these thoughts of things I wanted to do but I just don't feel like it. Partly I think it's because I recently got a new car, and I don't like the idea of doing extra driving and putting miles on it when it's not necessary. Just going to town is about 10 miles so a trip just to go to the gym puts 20 miles on the car.

I'm really OCD about that kind of thing, so this could be part of the reason I don't go out as much.

I have only one friend that I hang out with anymore. It used to be we'd meet up almost once a week to watch a movie or go to dinner. Now, it's more like 4-5 times a year at most.

I feel like I don't have the drive or interest in going out to eat or movies. There's a lot of places I'd like to go out of town, but it's sad because I feel like I don't have a friends group to go to them with. Though when I mentioned this to my friend they said they'd be happy go tag along if it's something they would be interested in. But again, most weekends I just feel really tired.

My friend has offered a few times for me to come over and play video games with some of their friends. Some I know but haven't seen in years others I've never met. But the idea of doing it just seems like so much. What if I mess up on the game, or say something stupid. I over analyze social situations so badly anymore, that I don't want to go.

About a year ago I stopped attending the church I used to go to, and I think this may be coinciding with that. It was a long drive to church and I think at first I was just tired and wanted to rest for a while. But a year later, instead of starting to do things more often on the weekends, I'm actually doing less and less than when I was going to church 3 times a week. It has not helped me socially either. I mean, it has decreased the social situations I'm put in but it hasn't helped me. I'm actually hiding from people and ignoring them more. When I would walk or run I used to wave at people, now I keep my head down and sometimes don't acknowledge them unless they say something.

The part about not doing things that cost money like eating out or movies, could partly be because I'm trying to save up for a house. So there may be a mental block causing me to subconsciouly not be interested in those things.

I do genuinely enjoy doing those activities though, so otherwise I'm not sure what happened.

There have also been issues at home between my parents and have been for  a long time, so the stress of that could be causing this. Frequently on the weekends though, I wake up feeling lethargic. This morning for example, I woke up at 6:30 went back to sleep for what seemed a few minutes and woke and it was almost 8. I also wake up feeling sore or in pain. This may also be due to a lack of sleep.

Anyone with similar experiences please share. I think not doing things and being around people is making my anxiety even worse.",21Apr2019,3

For the past few months I've stopped feeling love. This goes for my family, my friends, even my boyfriend. I still appreciate them, but I can't feel the love for them that I used to, even though nothing has changed...

Could it be just a symptom of my depression? My meds? I'm terrified this won't ever change...",21Apr2019,2
31,"So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on what‚Äôs been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. 

Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others (particularly women) for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up.

All through the conversation, it didn‚Äôt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless.

I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.",21Apr2019,49
33,So long story short I'm in one of my spirals and it's the worst it's ever been. I'm going through a move and it's the end of the semester so it can't come at a worse time. I have no energy and no motivation and I don't find joy in anything I do. I don't even know where to start. Any advice would be appreciated.,21Apr2019,3
34,"Hi. I won't say my name, but I'm a 21 Brazilian college student. I don't even know where to start, I feel like I have so many things to get off my chest... Well, I think that my worst problem, like I said in the title, is that I just can't seem to get happy. Like, ever. Talking to my mom these days, she told me that since a very young age, I was never excited about anything, nothing could really make me jump out of enthusiasm. I cant' remember of ever crying out of happiness or gratitude, or even out of sorrow. I don't feel like I really can have feelings, unless the one of feeling sorry for myself, and kind of frustrated for not being able to feel things I wish I did.

I was never a very social person as well. Never got a boyfriend, never had a long term friendship. I think is very common, especially to girls, to have a friend to talk to every time you feel sad, or to share cool things that happened. A friend to come over spend the night and have pajamas party and these sort of things. But not me. I'm not used to share what's going on my mind with anyone, and to be fair, most of the time I don't even feel like there is anything going o my mind. I'm on this current state where I feel like there is no point on anything, and it's like I'm living my days just waiting death to come.

I'm almost 22, and I don't think I have ever done anything to myself, to improve and grown. I'm not good on anything, I don't have hobbies anymore, I feel like I'm broken somehow, like I've got no talent, no knowledge, no one to care about me, and like I'm just some waste of space and matter in the world, and, even though I'm not gonna kill myself, mostly cause I've got no courage, I think that it would be for the best of the world if I just ceased to exist.
Thank you if you managed to get here, I admit that me myself offer feel like telling me to just shut up and stop being so stupid and annoying. But if somebody can tell me something to help me to stop feeling this way, and somehow get my shit together, I would appreciate very much.",21Apr2019,13
