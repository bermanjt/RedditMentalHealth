Hello.

Have been dating my LDR girlfriend for over a year, we've had our ups and downs like any other couple, she struggles with her depression sometimes.. and Im worried that eventually shes going to give up on the relationship because she believes she isnt offering me enough. Have any other depressed people or couples gotten through this? I tried talking to her today about why she does offer me lots.. but she still doesn't believe me. Its so tough sometimes dealing with depression, and I can't always tell if those thoughts are because of the depression itself or if she's worried we wont work out. She makes promises all the time about our future and us moving together.. she wants to come live with me in a few years, but we know given our situations with school that we have to wait. We talk every single day. She truly does make me happy, we get a long so good and can talk endlessly, Ive never felt so understood by anyone in my life until I met her.. I even told her this as well.. Thoughts please?

tl;dr: depressed gf sometimes doesnt believe that she has lots to offer me.. when she really does.. she offers me so much but she keeps doubting us.. I worry that she'll pull the plug on the relationship, but I cant tell if its just because shes feeling depressed about it.",19Dec2019,1

Maybe it's on a day like any other, with nothing planned, that everything will finally over because that moment is waiting for me. I'm definitely going crazy, losing notion of reality, not seeing resolution for anything... I hate myself, I can't stand to wake up every day with my reality, my  meaningless life nothing make sense anymore. I have nowhere to run unless I run away from myself.... 

I was a happy childhood, some wonderful parents who continue until today to do everything for me. I went to high school and college without major worries. At 18 I met my daughter's father after seven years of dating we got married. He was probably the only person who truly loved me. He was good for me, it helped me, it encouraged me. He was always there. After six years of marriage our daughter is born. I've never felt so happy. I'd look at her and believe I'd get everything in my life and that everything would only be okay.

But that didn't happen. The marriage fell apart when my daughter was six. She lived with me. (The father has distanced himself to this day.) In pre-adolescence she began drinking, doing drugs, dating older men (all related to drugs and alcohol addiction). I did everything I could, alone, to rescue her from that life. She only studied until eighth grade and she has tried to continue her studies, but she never finishes any. She’s aggressive for me. 

She is now 19 and since she was 15, I have done nothing but live around her in the sense of being able to help her, but it's been all in vain. I was always there, but nothing worked or will work. Her dad, like I said, doesn’t give any help. The aggravating factor of the whole situation is that I find myself without working for the last past year because I was completely depressed.

In November 2018 I made my first suicide attempt, in April this year I did the second. My condition has worsened. I lost the ability to pay my bills.....the car is in the garage there is no way to keep it circulating without money. I lost everything. Everything I believed in one day. I no longer have emotional, mental and spiritual resources to endure this. Waking up every day is the biggest torment of all. Who can I live another day like this? Now I know I can’t.

When we gave up, we know when the time has come.

· I needed to share these feelings with somebody. I’m sorry.

Note: sorry for my english",19Dec2019,1
4,"Depression hit again, I was so happy because I was handling it perfectly for one full year, but it striked again and I feel hopeless, I feel dark, I don't want to be awake nor asleep, I can't find myself.

5,I (18M) can’t express any emotions and haven’t been able to for months. All I want is to sit in my room and just cry and I can’t for some reason. I’ve tried everything playing the saddest music I have getting drunk/high you name it. I just want to be able to let out all the stuff I’ve been balling up and I can’t. Please what is wrong and what can I do.,19Dec2019,1
6,"I just feel really shitty right now. I’m 14 and over the last week I’ve been feeling worse than I ever have in my life. I’ve always felt like a failure in almost every aspect of life throughout middles school, but then I at least had hope of things getting better. Then high school came along and for a little while things got better. I got an amazing girlfriend who I was actually able to make happy, which really boosted myself esteem and I felt like all my Suffering worth it. 8 days ago she broke up with me pretty much out of no where. And I was the normal amount of sad at first to lose a girlfriend who I really cared about and was actually a good person who I’d been friend with before we got together. What really got me feeling shitty was when all the same shit that would happen again. I’d do bad in tests, parents are mad at me, I make a fool of myself at school, etc. If I still had Sophia (the girl) then I would have been able to talk to her and feel better as we did when one of us felt bad while we were together. But then it hit me that I couldn’t do that anymore. I was alone with no one to talk to. If this was middle school I’d have at least had hope for the future, but I was out of hope. I just started feeling depressed with no end, it was a constant feeling of sadness that lasted a couple days, it eventually morphed into a sort of numbness where nothing made me happy or upset. Now instead of feeling numb I have an even more intense sadness whenever I think about anything that used to give happiness. I just haven’t felt remotely happy in over a week and it’s killing me. I k ow people say I shouldn’t worry about girls but I really miss having a girlfriend I could talk to and someone who actually was happy to see me and eager to help. Today I had my first suicidal thought and I really just don’t know what to do. I need help",19Dec2019,1
7,"I'm feeling really really alienated and like I have no real friends. That voice in my head has been telling me how worthless I am and how inadequate and untalented I am. Today it's been especially laying into me about having no real friends. I feel like everyone around me is faking and I just don't know how to relate to people.

My parents feel like the only people who understand me. Which makes me feel like more of a failure somehow.

I want to hurt myself right now but I'm willing myself not to.",19Dec2019,1
8,"I used to practise these things when I was in depression, no matter what     but start to pretend and behave , one day you would actually start    feeling those things which you used to fake. And that’s the first step    of getting out of a depression by yourself but make sure YOU want to  get    out of depression..

Here are the things I did. I started practising this every damn day.

I try to write down my diary and track my mood. Think that:

1. I     want to feel okay. I want to wake up everyday with smile on my face.  I   want to wake up everyday filled with a hope knowing that everything    will  be alright.
2. I    want to feel lovely, I want to feel what it’s  like to be someone who    matters. Someone who counts for something who  will forever remain a    memory.
3. I    want to feel alive. I want to  feel sun’s warmth above my head and   grow  like a flower that always  experiences spring. I want to feel what   it’s  like to be the best version  of me.
4. I    want to be in love, I want a love that makes me feel  free like a  bird   flying towards the blue sky. I want a love that comes  from me.

It    works for me and I feel relaxing after writing down. It is hard to   find  a suitable app to write conveniently. Finally, my best friend   develop  one for me, named '[Stars Diary – Journal, Mood, Note, Password](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sognarestudio.stars)'.

It really helps me, I express my feeling with music and photo and capture them in app. Release my feeling from my brain.

If    these things are not helping  you, never hesitate to consult a    psychiatrist, not because you are crazy but because you are sick. You    have just a little high fever, which you  wouldn’t be able to cure    yourself.",19Dec2019,1
9,I keep finding myself falling back into the pit that I have found myself in many times for the last 10 years. How do I stop making myself feel crazy? I’m so sick of feeling terrible and almost killing myself. I just want to be happy and appreciate life for more than a day at a time. I’m too close to the edge and need help.,19Dec2019,1
10,"When I was six/seven years old one of my cousins molested me. At the time I didn’t really know what was happening, she also introduced me to porn. I developed a deep addiction to pornography (weather or not porn addiction is a real thing is a matter of debate but I have a highly obsessive personality so I’d say I was addicted.) In grade school I was never terribly popular and got beat up occasionally, and picked on pretty often. In middle school I was picked on a lot too. I would never say I was bullied as it wasn’t like a daily thing but just every so often I’d get beat up or yelled at/threatened. That’s not to say I had it all awful either. I met my best friend around this time and he and I are still very close to this day despite going to different colleges in different states. When I was a freshman in high school I had my first sexual experience and it sort of made me realize what had happened when I was a kid. I fell into a deep deep depression, and began self harming obsessively cutting and burning mostly but also hair pulling. That summer I was home alone a lot and I tried to work up the nerve to kill myself. I’d sit in my car parked in the garage for hours trying to convince myself to just let it run. I never could. At the start of my sophomore year I began to date a girl who I loved dearly. She was perfect. We dated until my junior year, when she said she only wanted to be friends. We stayed close friends for awhile and then she found out I cheated on her once while we were dating. I recognize what a shitty decision I made and take full responsibility for it. She never wanted to speak to me again and we haven’t sense. It still hurts me, because she was one of the few people who knew all of this. She and I never did anything adult, we didn’t kiss for the first six months we dated (she was very conservative). I knew I really loved her, and I ruined it all with one mistake. For the rest of my high school career I just fucked around and avoided serious relationships. I made good grades and got into a college out of state. My hope was that I’d be able to leave everything behind once I got to college. I just finished my first semester and i loved my studies so much, but I still feel so empty. I’m on medication for my depression and I don’t feel sad anymore or angry I just feel empty. I feel like everyday means nothing, like I could skip a year of my life and things would just be the same. I want it to end, there are moments where I really do want to die, but deep down I think I just want to feel something again. Some kind of wonder or joy or love or anything I just feel some empty. In someways i think that’s so much worse than being depressed. I don’t know what to do anymore, it makes me so uncomfortable to express my feelings face to face. The prevailing feeling with my father and I is that men shouldn’t express emotions even though we know that’s bs. I just don’t know what will make me feel complete again. I’m really afraid nothing will.",19Dec2019,1
11,"So I've never been to psychiatrist or been diagnosed with depression, so I actually never say I have depression.

But due to very specific situations in my life (health, family and eventually as a result my academics) I've not been mentally well for about 5/6 years now. I'm in my 3rd year of undergraduate(engineering) at a reputable University with shit grades (failed twice and barely passed others). Among other illnesses, I suffer from an autoimmune disease (incurable) that made me hate myself. I literally wake up and go to sleep thinking about how much I hate myself. I am tired 24/7, extreme fatigue is apparently a symptom which makes sense. I stopped treatment twice (because of side effects and waste of money, and a few years later it became active again and worse than the previous times). My family situation is horrible, don't talk to my father anymore. I am expected to support a lot of people in the future, not just immediate family members, and I am constantly reminded of that. I want to do that, because those people are the reason for everything positive in my life. I'm just not sure if I am capable.

Now why I don't call it depression is because 1) I don't think I have enough knowledge to diagnose myself 2) I KNOW why I feel the way I do, and if these things didn't exist or get solved the next day I'll be good 3) I often feel 'fake' because generally my life outside my 'self' is pretty good. I just tell myself I've been sad for such a long time because I wanted live my life a certain way and I don't like the idea of having to compromise with that. In the end, I just became completely uninterested.

Now, coming to my main point, I know I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. If I die naturally for some reason I won't actually know it beforehand. So the point is I have to keep living my life no matter what.

Right now, I live a very unhealthy life. Don't remember the last time I cleaned my apartment or ate healthy. I smoke a lot. Can't get myself to do things I was interested in a few years ago. I'm as pessimistic as one can ever be. I was a very ambitious person who now feels stupid because I feel like I'm so far behind on everything I can't catch up, if I ever manage to START catching up that is.

I tried many times to get myself out of this, but fail everytime because I'm SO uninterested if that makes sense. I feel like living not healthy=kind of makes up for my shitty life like I'm taking revenge on myself or something. I like the thought of just wasting my day in the morning, and then regret it at night. Living in a loop.

Anyone who's been in a similar situation, how did you manage to get out of it? Really sorry for the long post and to those who read all of it, thank you..",19Dec2019,1
12,"I (21F) have had PTSD from a domestic abuse family but I went to a therapist for help and I’ve gotten so much better from it. 

I feel sudden surges of loneliness from time to time and I can’t shake the feeling off even if I go out and hangout with friends. I’ve been active in student government, clubs, and often will push myself to go out with friends. I’ve also had social anxiety but I’ve gotten better at it with my therapists help. 

Some times it feels like a darkness that consumes me and I usually hide under the blankets, turn off all the lights, and just cry. It’s just I have such a difficult time feeling connections with people and it might come off as fake to some of my friends. I feel like I’m never close with any of them. 

I started a gratitude journal lately and that helps me a lot. I appreciate all my friends, my SO, my family, my therapist. And I am grateful for any advice you can give me. 

I want to change this so badly, I hate this feeling of loneliness. I just don’t know what to do.",19Dec2019,1

15,"I’ve never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger &amp; my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety &amp; often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down &amp; depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often &amp; struggle to stop.

I just don’t want to let anyone down &amp; I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly I’m scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. I’ve never reached out for professional help either and don’t have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. 

I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but it’s so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all.",19Dec2019,1
16,"Emotional Support Animals are loaded topics. I know. Before I start this I just want to make it known that I'm well versed in the laws surrounding ESAs (where they are permitted, their purpose, etc) and would not be seeking this option if I didn't feel it would be helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the fall I'll be going to a college across the country, which is exciting, but it also means I'll be leaving behind my (already very small and limited) support system. I've struggled with severe depression since I was a preteen, and after suffering emotional abuse most of my childhood I have an extremely hard time asking for help or comfort. When I do move across the country, I will be leaving behind the few people I consider closest to me as well as my psychiatrist who has been treating me for the past two years. Currently, I have an Australian Sheppard who I have relied on for comfort for a lot of my childhood but because he is so old it wouldn't make sense to remove him from his home to be with me in New York. Knowing that he provides comfort and motivation to leave the house during ruts is what is prompting me to really consider this as an option. If I were to pursue this, I would look into adopting a low drive dog that I would train for the months leading up to the move. I know that for me with my aversion to touch and my depression that having an animal would provide much needed physical and emotional comfort, and most likely tasking when I need it. I am just afraid of seeming like an asshole. If anyone has advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",19Dec2019,1

19,"My depression is a bit different than I've become accustomed to, especially with the added S.A.D. this year. My meds are keeping me above a baseline, but my lack of focus/numbness is making work really, really hard. I also have ADHD (inattentive) which I am STILL waiting on my insurance to approve a medicine for and have not yet received medicinal treatment for.

In short, I work at a Civil Engineering firm, and I do very detail-oriented work. Lately the tediousness of it all has made getting anything done almost impossible, which leads to an increased lack of focus, and raises anxiety for fear of deadlines and guilt.

I have been using my PTO when absolutely necessary, but I'm not getting enough of a rest in between work days. Just getting out of bed every morning feels impossible (I've been getting in at odd hours/leaving early, etc) let alone commuting and working a full day. I'm doing everything I can to hang on in 'survival mode' but the work place doesn't really care about all of that...

I'm wondering if any of you have had to deal with this situation - specifically having to bill time to individual projects when you don't feel you're making much in the way of progress on them. How do you get through professionally?

20,"Hello, yes sorry if this sounds like a weird question... but every winter I have noticed that I become very depressed. I tried asking for help from my mom and sister but they seem to brush it off and forget. I feel really embarrassed and ashamed bringing it up over and over again so I stopped and thought maybe I’ll be fine, but I have strong urges to harm myself. 

Since I was 12 I had harmed myself on and off for years. I am 19 now and haven’t harmed myself for almost a month. I have been trying to stop, but every winter things seem unbearable. I have tried googling, but as you can imagine that does not take you very far. 

When I was 13, during the winter of that age, I tried running away from home, and I remember at 15 writing suicide notes to my family during winter. Every winter it’s like this. I feel very silly saying that because I don’t know how a season can make me feel worse in this way. 

During winter I also end up eating a lot more sweets and comfort foods and end up gaining weight. Which really makes me feel even worse. During this time my boyfriend also broke up with me (but we got back together) and I still think about that a lot even though we are very happy together right now..

I really want to see a professional about this but I am worried about how expensive it will be. I already have 2k+ hospital debt. And medicines that have been prescribed to me for other illnesses I can’t even buy because I simply cannot afford it, so I have gave up on seeking help there.

21,"I was stressed out and depressed for almost 3 months. Why? I was trying to accomplish a task that is very much like everyone of our struggles and it was just so difficult.

I was tired of the constant rejections, angry at all the no replies. Overwhelmed by all the things I didn't know. 

The only diary entry during this ""short"" phase of life was one wondering about taking my life away. 

I was scared for my health and stayed sexually away from my SO. I kept promising myself good things if I accomplish this task of mine. Concert tickets, restaurant trips, fun times in general. 

In the very end of this stressful stage, I just realized that the sleep-deprived, love-starved person I had become was my own doing. I said to myself, I need to take care of myself, regardless of whether or not my goal is achieved. I was doing everything in my power to achieve my goal and I needed to recognize this person who was being brave in spite of having no support. 

I made small changes like : cooking to eat healthier and tastier food, exercise and make a big deal out of it by having my SO cheer for me, go out and smell the fresh air. Talk to friends and spend good times with them. Taking a shower and feeling fresh. Picking a hobby and experimenting.

And a few days after these decisions , I got to check off my task :) mission accomplished. And all the concert tickets and restaurant trips and fun times? They were always there for me, and attaching them to my task made their significance zero after I finished my task, because there are new tasks waiting to bog me down! 

I honestly have no idea if any of this made sense. It hardly makes sense to me. I still struggle with self-love, especially when I'm failing at somethings in life. Start small.

These feelings and thoughts started coming up after my grandpa died. (I have not been exposed to a family member dying ever before, so it disturbed the **fuck** out of me.)  Since then, I couldn't enjoy the seasons or holidays without constantly thinking about my inevitable death. I am terrified of dying, and am terrified of the eventual day my mom will die, my little sister, my dad, my dogs. I see my family as something that will always be with me forever and that it will always be like this. We will never know if there is an afterlife, as much as I like to think that its true, I still question Gods existence. I want big answers from HIM if he is out there, I try to see it in things but I know that.. its most likely just a coincidence of some sort. I want to live with my family forever. But at the same time, why not just kill myself? The world will eventually go away one day and take humanity and life with it- everything will be erased and forgotten. I used to have small panic attacks in secrecy when I used to get so over-whelmed and scared. I constantly think of it. Every day. Every night when I go to bed. Sometimes its not even just about doomsday, but weird things. Im not intentionally physcing myself up, but I am often anxious or think of disturbing ideas. I worry about things watching me in my window when I sleep, enough so that I will get up and shut the curtains and look around the house to make sure things are safe. Or what if someone climbed on the roof and got in my moms bedroom? What if my dog got left outside on accident and someone snatched it? What if my dad kills himself tonight? What if.. constantly. Sometimes the anxiety and sadness is mild, sometimes its so constant it physically makes my body hurt and crawl. It wont go away, no matter how much I want to stop thinking about it it's on full volume in my head most the time- they are so intrusive and I hate it. It feels like a constant mild head-ache, but also feels like a fuzzy numbness at the same time. I try to be happy for my mom, my sister, my friends (they're more my sister friends), but the constant sadness washes over me as soon as I get a moment to myself to think or I am in lala land.   


I have no friends, other than a few close ones online. I miss my old best friend, but due to stupid petty drama- his mom has kept him away from me. Selfish bitch. He was my one and truly good friend since 1st grade. I had trouble making friends, considering now I was really weird as a kid and did some stupid shit but I was never mean. I always tried to be polite and if I ever was rude, I never intended to be; (i sometimes didn't use my head). I always have tried to think about what I said before I say it, since so many kids never did when it came to me and hurt my feelings a lot. I didn't wanna do that to someone else. (Sorry I ramble.) Anyway, he was awesome. He was the first friend i made that didn't back-stab me or hurt my little sister like some sadistic monster. Most of every 'friend' and even family member turn into something rude. They take and never give. They get just a little too comfortable and show their nasty sides to us..  except my old BFF, who was fun and nice to my little sister and family. And me. We used to go to the pool together, play at each others houses, draw, make lego fortresses, etc. We were so close. I don't understand why I attracted so many toxic people, but he was the good apple. I miss him so much, but I am scared to confront him and to try and restart the friendship since its been around... 3-4 years..   
The friends I have now I cant relate to much. They are sweet and fun, sure. I love that, I appreciate them. But it's so hard to talk to people I cant even relate with. All they talk about anime and musical shippings and petty critiquing (mainly my sisters doing). It's not bad they like that, they can love that stuff! But its so difficult to be around people I cant connect with.. I just sit there trying to make small talk and jokes but they don't seem to care. I like to tell stories of funny stuff or weird things in about family but the more I tell them, the more I realize they give not a fuck. Not a laugh. Not an afterthought. I wish I could meet a friend, or just someone with the same interests as me, someone who is kind and that I can talk to. I miss the feeling of going over to a friends house- or being in a different house from your own at least. Sure, I have a few friends like that online but I need a physical, social outlet.. Im so sick of being here cooped up. I dont even bother interacting with them anymore, as shitty as that sounds. I want to socialize but I know im a third wheel. I know Im not very fun, even when i try to be. Instead of being in a room with them, I sit on this computer all the time..  


\^ yeah. Im on this computer all day. I school online, which the first few years I loved but its so.. tiring now. Haha, how is it tiring that I sit on my ass all day? The school is fine-ish, but my computer is shit. I am grateful for it, but it sucks having to do school when I am constantly feeling unmotivated, tired; like shit. The computer never cooperates, surprising for a Mac- they should be running damn good. I have tried everything to get it to work faster but hey, my family is always stricken with bad-luck so of course it doesn't work. This makes school agonizing. I am often lazy or unmotivated to do work unlike how I was a year or two ago. Doing schoolwork is such a hassle that I am at the end of my rope for patience. I am starting to break down in ways I have never had before, shaking and sobbing uncontrollably sometimes. Not to mention what they put on my day and their broken system- with tech issues on top. (The teachers of mine don't cooperate together to make a nice schedule of work for their students, they just throw whatever work on the day and expect them to do it without thinking "" Huh! What if they have 3 essays due that day? What if they have overlapping video calls with their other teachers? Oh well, whatever"" kind of mentality.) The stress of having to tell your teacher for the 10th time ""Sorry I missed our class video chat! Tech issues"" and knowing that they're thinking i'm some scuzzy flaking kid probably playing video games is driving me nuts. I know they're tired of this bullshit and so am I, except i'm being honest. Assignments and overdue work will randomly flood my days without warning, because their automated system is shit and always decides to tell me when I need to get work done or that I actually HAVE WORK to do days and days later! So a lot of the time, I don't even know theres a god damn essay to do or existing! We cant afford a new computer either. --- And not even the school is the issue. Im kind of addicted to this thing. The town I live in is boring as hell. I cannot drive comfortably yet, especially since it is the winter. My mom cant drive often because she needs to stay off her foot (she had surgery). So, a lot of the time we're stuck at home. Being on this thing is both a form of escapism and a bit of hell. Doing the same thing over, and over, and over again every day is driving me nuts. Its giving me even more time to thing about the bad thoughts in my head while I sit here, doing nothing productive other than school. I do school, draw and watch YT. Over. And Over. And Over. I wish there was an outlet somewhere, that I can leave and get out. I want to find a new hobby, but I don't know where to start or if we can afford it. I am useless sitting here.  


Heres something! My parents are getting fucking divorced. Way to go dad! Thanks a lot- perfect timing for ALL of us for you to cheat with some slut! Oh? You told your side of the family? How marvelous! Your drunken mom will surely have fun with a gossip fest of twisted bullshit and lies to make her special golden child, YOU, look great! Oh! Did she tell everyone and convince them to feel the same too? Oh fun!- Wait! Did you also antagonize and villainize my mom too, just for a bit more fun? This is great, thank you dad so much for making YOU look like the victim in the bullshit YOU did to my mom. Lets see! I hope the world fucking knows how mad I am at you for the following!  
\-Verbal and mild physical abuse to me and my mom  
\-Impulsive lying and manipulating  
\-Fake 'sweet', 'quiet', 'funny' dad facade!  
\-Taking 50k out of the bank with my mom before she found out you cheated to ""spend on remodeling our kitchen"", only to spend it on a bunch of wood-working tools. Sneaking out late at night on a 6 hour long trip to go to the west coast to pick up the machine without informing my mom and not coming home? Cool! Oh shit, wait! You NEVER helped redo the kitchen? You just used the excuse 'its for the kitchen' to buy your several thousand dollar machines for your personal wood-working job? Nice, we're in several thousand deep.  
\-Putting my mom under stress or making things 100x harder than they need to be in the courts? Fun!  
\-I know you text your GF (who he has said nothing about) when you take us out on weekends, I see you hiding your phone under the table and texting her hearts the entire time you're out with us. You're not thinking about us. You're thinking of her.   
Awesome, thanks dad.   
You may not be the best dad but to know that you gave up everything for some girl breaks my heart. When I was younger, i was oblivious to the bad stuff he did and only remembered the good things. He made us a zip-line in the back-yard, or would pick us up ice-cream sandwiches, or flip us upside down and have us walk on the ceiling.. I miss those memories. I miss the memories of being small *(i'm only a teenager, sure, I am still young but I miss old memories)*.  
The magical, mysterious and warm feeling of Christmas morning with you and our family, the smell of vinegar and candy on easter day, a warm, smokey summer afternoon with ice-cream as we garden in the side-yard. Or those special starry nights when my parents threw a party, where they decorated our vine infested back deck with twinkle lights and bosa nova as they served our friends food. It sounds cheesy, but those times were so magical for me.   
He gave it all up and I know a part of him doesn't regret it. 

Please, I know this is a lot. I have no where else to tell this. I know maybe, i'll regret posting this. Maybe i'm wordy or too descriptive. Maybe ill regret even sharing this.  
 But, I am very honest with what I say here, even though I don't word things very well and often ramble. I have been sitting with my anger and anxiety for too long. Can someone please tell me what I should do? If it's something more or just teenage angst? I need to have others perspectives, I keep to myself too much and I need a new set of eyes. Thank you so much, if you read this.",19Dec2019,1
28,"I don't know if this belongs here, because I've never been formally diagnosed with depression, but my brother and sister have anxiety and depression and my family has a history of it. So... I'm 15 and I'm just not happy, not motivated. I block out all my emotions except for humor unless I'm alone. I take piano lessons, and my piano teacher gives me compliments on my playing and  its goten so bad that I don't even smile anymore, it's like I feel my emotions are a burden on others. I'm not sad enough to hurt/kill myself. I am mormon so I learned the value of life very early. But, I am just not happy. What should I do?",19Dec2019,1
29,"I have a little sister, just a few years old. Anyone else get really emotional when talking to them or even just look at them sometimes?
I get really emotional when I see that she’s growing into a “real kid” because I just see how happy and curious and just what a good kid she is and I don’t ever want her to feel how I do. She still has a chance and I wanna do anything in my power to make sure she grows up and stays the way she is; happy and healthy.",19Dec2019,1
30,"I was doing good this year, I had a baby and wanted to be better so I actually went to therapy to try and better myself. They’re we’re days where it was hard but I never let it get to the point. I haven’t felt like this in over a year but yet this feels comfortable, I’m not sure if that makes sense. I’m really trying to stop myself from all the self harming things I use to do to make me feel better so instead Im writing this to get it out my head. I always write in my journal but I wanted to try something different. I kinda want to go to sleep, I think I’ll do that for now.",19Dec2019,1
