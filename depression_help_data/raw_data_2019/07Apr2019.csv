0,"So right now, I have an 12 year old cousin, that well call L, who is struggling in all aspects of life. This is gonna be a long one, but, I need help. Also I live in California and she lives in Oklahoma, and I drive there every summer. She is severely depressed, has been to three therapists, and has been suicidal since the end of fifth grade, so about May 2018. She’s also a lesbian, which will come slightly into play later.

So we’ll start with her school. She started sixth grade in August, and since then has ran into noting but bullying. There is one kid, who would grab her ass and steal her school work in class, and if she didn’t give him the work, he would threaten to grab her ass again. She faced this until Christmas break. She also had no friends to vent to at the time and used me. After Christmas break, she got some “friends”, and everything started getting slightly better. Then, yesterday, two boys went around the school telling everybody that she sucked their dicks for a dollar each guy. She started crying and her “friends” decided to laugh at her and thought it was funny that she was suffering. I was furious. I found one of the kids YouTube channel and am considering texting him and telling him I’m gonna fuck him and his little friend up. She doesn’t deserve this and it’s extremely sickening and sad to know that these children get off on ruining people. Her school has done absolutely nothing due to a “lack of proof”. It’s fucking disgusting. 

Now her home life. Both her parents are extremely busy with their jobs and they don’t have a lot of money. She has a sister who is about a year younger than me, she is 15 I believe, who we’ll call H, who is a complete bitch and insensitive person to L. Recently, H got caught with a boyfriend and got caught doing “things” (I’m not going into detail) with him. She got her phone taken away. Like I said, L is gay, and H has been extremely abusive towards her about it. If L doesn’t let H use her phone to contact her boyfriend, H will tell their parents that L is gay (they do not know yet).

L has been texting me all day and currently is texting me about how she’s going to commit suicide and should’ve done it when she had the chance. I need help, URGENTLY, I’m very worried she’s really going to do it this time. Please, I need advice on what to do. ",07Apr2019,4
2,"No one fucking wants me around. I’m forgotten majority of the time. All my friends ignore me unless they need me. I’ve been single for 3 years. Everyone who I’ve had a thing for either uses me or acts like they like me back, just for them to leave. My BPD and depression makes everyone run away. I’m clingy. Im obsessive when it comes to random shit. I’m afraid of trusting people. Everything is wrong with me. I’m so fucking done. I just wish it would all end. No one wants me. No one ever will.

3,"Short story long, I'm an almost 23 year old female who moved 400 miles from her whole family to be with her soulmate who moved 1,000 miles from HIS family to make it in Southern California as a fighter.

I've been living with him in a tiny, shitty studio for almost a year that we pay $1,450/mo for. I make $19/hr but after benefits about $12/hr and he works part-time so we split everything but I'm so sick and tired of working my ass off to have all of my money sucked out from under me from these terrible SoCal living costs. I'm paying off credit card debt from putting myself through a city college for my A.S. (I got but it's pointless), my card is at its limit due to car emergencies, etc. in the past few months racking more onto it.

I love my coworkers and job and am actually on a path to be promoted to the accounting department (currently a receptionist) and I love my boyfriend more than anything, but I've been so apathetic in the past few weeks.

I have a hard time believing in my boyfriend's dreams since they're sort of make it or break it. Our studio is too small and lacks storage so our clothes and things are splayed out everywhere and it's an absolute train wreck. I'm a neat freak and I'm craving to 'nest,' and have a comfortable home life but I literally cannot afford more storage shelving or a bigger apartment. I'm in this rut, I miss my family, my grandparents' health is declining rapidly, I wish I could be with them, my parents' divorce will be final this Monday so I'm mourning my whole childhood watching them keep up this awesome family unit.

I'm SO incredibly blessed in so many ways. I try to eat healthy, I started going to a gym that my work allows access to, I'm trying to manifest happiness. It's just not enough. I feel like my body is 1,000lbs (not body image, just physically hard to move when depressed), there's a dark cloud over me, I'm isolated and rid of any motivation to clean or take care of anything this weekend, causing me more stress. I barely feel hunger.

Honestly most of my stress is financially-related. Every cent I make goes to rent, food, fuel, or debt. No savings, how the fuck am I supposed to save up to buy my own house someday? I feel like this whole economy/market is out to get me and everyone else making less than $50/hour. How is this a way of life? I crave nature, open pastures, trees. We have beaches here but they get old after a few sunburns and sand where you'd rather it not be.

I'm aware it's all in my head. I can choose happiness, I can choose not to get mad when literally every person in Southern California cuts me off while driving, or runs me down with their shopping cart, or glares at me. I can choose happiness as I'm alone every night in a shitty, tiny studio while my boyfriend is training his ass off for a dream. I'm tired of this and I need a change but I don't have enough money for a deposit on another place, any other place I can find is at least $100 more than what we're currently paying. I try to go outside and on walks but nothing can help at this point. I don't understand what life is supposed to be about but it sure can't be working to make money to pay off this everlasting debt until you die.

What else is there? How can I find it in my situation? Does anyone else see how fucked up this cost of living is? I want to move to Washington state where my boyfriend is from but he's years away from reaching his goals down here in SoCal.",07Apr2019,3
4,"So I have probably had depression for over 10 years now. It seems to come and go and during the tougher times in life, it gets harder.  I have had suicide on my mind a lot and have several plans.  I wish to find someone I could talk to and vent to with an open mind.  I have A LOT going on in my life and the following is long, it is just a summary of everything that is happening to me.  I have seriously been struggling for about a year now and the most reliable and consistent people I can talk to is the online chat with the suicide hotline.  The phone calls are not reliable for me and will cut me off after about 20 minutes. And they don’t seem to want to listen they want to just pass the puck and give the issues to someone else.  

I have always struggled to try to make good friends because they always end up blowing me off or leaving and never staying in touch regardless of what they say.  I don’t trust guys because I have been backstabbed a lot and just have a bad history.  I do have a select few who have seen me go through a lot but nobody that I can truly consider as a friend.  

For example, my best man at my wedding doesn’t speak to me anymore, ended up leaving directly after the ceremony and then I was alone outside of my wife and parents (who were pathetic at that time).  I never received a toast nor any speech about myself.  He also ended up getting engaged this past year and I never heard about it until about a month ago from a mutual friends Instagram post.  I also have not received an invitation or anything to his wedding. So I know where I stand now and this is from someone who I thought was close to me. 

I am going through issues now with a career where I have applied 300 times to places across the country and have not received a job yet.  I am fully qualified but it is a career where if you don’t know the right people then you won’t get a job essentially, with the exception of a select few places. I have worked my tail off and have done all that I have been asked but been disrespected by those who consistently move up and don’t have anything positive to say about me. I have also never made more than 1,000 dollars a month while trying for my careers.  I am a college graduate and paid my way through school. This last year I made 5,000 dollars on the year.  I am trying all that I can do but financially am struggling.  I have looked for help with this to expand my career and have not come up with anything.  I feel truly miserable, pathetic, and like a failure case of all that I have gone through.

I have also had struggles with my SO.  Fitness is an important part of my life and I love to be active.  I know I can still get out and do stuff having a bike but I don’t have anyone that can do it with me.  She is significantly overweight and probably is at risk for diabetes.   I fear a separation might be in the future but I am not feeling cared for with actions or loved even though I understand she has long hard days it is nothing compared to what I went through during my busy stretches.

5,"To those of you suicidal and have them thoughts, please let go of them. Suicide doesn’t help at all it’s actually moving the pain even more. Think about, all the pain you have right now is making you weak, suicide even though sounds like the right thing when you are finished, you are forcing even bigger pain in you. All of you who are reading this are strong, mentally and emotionally. You don’t need to commit suicide. The pain like I said before is making you stronger and preparing you for your future no matter how old you are. All these problems even though they are bringing you down are making you stronger, trust me the results will show when you see after a while. The devil is playing with your mind, then nasty thoughts are hard to get out of your head and I understand, but please give it time. Once you show the devil how you are coping, results will be seen and you will be in a even happier place. ",07Apr2019,0
6,"I always thought if I got my shit together that it would make me not feel depressed.

I’ve went from being an alcoholic with a toxic abusive relationship, no job, no ambitions, horrible health... 

To independent highly functioning adult. I’ve got everything I ever “wanted”. But it’s not enough. I’m still so fucking depressed. It’s beyond frustrating. I feel like a crappy spoiled child who is complaining but really this is TORTURE. It’s torture looking at how good I got it yet feeling nothing. Nothing but empty. 
Empty pain... all the time.

I can’t even get off anymore. Sorry if that’s TMI. But organisms don’t feel like anything anymore. I am horrified that I can’t feel happy. It’s shocking if I’m able to genuinely laugh. I don’t feel the warmth of love... even though I see it all around me. People love me why the fuck can’t I feel it??

Feels like I’m faking through life now. Everyone thinks I’ve got it all together but I’m just as much a mess as I was years ago in my worst times... same shit inside but now I’m shiny on the outside.

Idk what to do anymore. Tried counseling, tried anti depressants for a year and it didn’t do anything but make me more suicidal. Everyday I’m trying to keep it together. The only thing keeping me alive is my pets. Literally. I would gladly kill myself if I didn’t have these beautiful loving selfless creatures that depend on me to live. I wish I could feel the love more. I know they love me and I love them but I’m so ducking sick of feeling numb.

I have moments of clarity and they are horrifying to me. It’s scary to see “oh my god this is how productive, amazing, wonderful I could be all the time!” But too bad I go right back to being depressed. Sometimes these moments last for a week or so and I’ll think I’m finally getting cured... then it’s back to ground zero. Every time I fall again it feels harder to claw my way back out.

Idk what to do. Here it is, Saturday night. Spent 90% of the day doing nothing and feeling nothing. Slept, ate, did some chores, repeat. That’s my life when I’m home from work... can’t find the motivation or drive to do much else. I’m so tired of feeling nothing... 

Can’t even cry. It’s so bad. 
Feel like a psychopath not having emotions all the time.

Should I try meds again? 
I’ve thought of stopping birth control... but I’m scared I’ll go back to being a lunatic with mood swings. The BC seemed to numb me. But it could just be coincidence. (Btw not dating and don’t want to. Zero interest in sex so IDC if I stop BC.) 

I hate counseling and that’s not an option. I’ve been through so many damn counselors and I hated all of them. I don’t have the time or patience to do that... 

I know I probably need to see a doctor. Maybe I have something causing my depression. Idk... I’m just paranoid and hate going to doctors. They always seem uncaring and just want to throw me on some meds for every little thing. 

Sorry I’m rambling... I know deep down this is just another scream into the void. But who knows. Maybe someone will have a comment or something that helps me feel a little better or has any idea what I could try. I’m at my wits end. I really don’t want to die to depression someday but I’m scared it will happen. Maybe not anytime soon but someday when I’m old and don’t have my family/friends or pets anymore. 

Thanks guys. ",07Apr2019,3

8,"I’m 22 male and I’ve been dealing with depression since I was 10 years old and basically from ages 10-18 I was taking some form of anti depressant and it wasn’t until I was 15 that I had found a combo that finally worked kind of. The problem that came with it was I was on a heavy amount of Zoloft as well as taking busporine and Remron and they basically turned me into a numb disgusting human and the side effects were awful between the brain zaps, low appetite and sexual issues it created for me. When I was 18 I decided I wanted to not feel that way anymore and I quit cold turkey which I know your not supposed to do and honestly with the withdrawals I felt I will never do that again. Unfortunately the depression has come back really hard and I don’t know what to do I’m so scared to take anti depressants because I never want to feel what I felt then but I also don’t really know what exists anymore. I’m feeling worse and worse every day and I’ve lost motivation to be alive and I don’t mean that in the sense of I want to kill myself but more in terms of I find it very hard to get out of bed and I just feel like wasting away or the constant feeling of I don’t deserve happiness and that no one likes me. I also feel like no one listens to me I feel like I’m always repeating myself and I know I’m not talking low it’s like people jut don’t care for what I have to say even if it’s something important. Any way the real question is if anyone has an idea of a medication that doesn’t have such bad side effects. I’m also realistic and understand there isn’t a miracle drug that I take and has no side effects and that on top of taking the medication I’m gonna have to push myself to try and feel better. I feel like I’m gonna lose my mind if I don’t figure something out.",07Apr2019,1

10,"For a while now I’ve been very sad, upset, and depressed, but this time it’s a different kind of sad. I’ve dealt with many types of sadness’s but this time it’s just different and it doesn’t make sense either. It’s an empty sad, it’s a numbing sad, nothing feels right, kind of sad. I’m living but I don’t really feel alive. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t wanna be be here. I wanna sleep and never wake up, my dreams are better than reality. 

Also, all I have are nightmares and in those, I lose the ones I care most about because I push them so far away from me that they’ll never find a way back. 

And in addition to that, I just pretend to be happy so that nobody questions me anymore, nobody can help, nobody but me, but I don’t care, not anymore, not again. Like, every time I rebuild myself, everything just crumbles and I’m back in the same place I was before, empty and depressed.",07Apr2019,1

12,"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to start. But the fact I am here now writing this is proof to myself that something is wrong with me. I'm not sure if I should begin with my childhood and work up to now or if I should just flat out say what's bothering me right now. But more or less, I think about killing myself; at least once, every day. When I wake up first thing in the morning I feel a gaint rush of anxiery and dread over the fact that once again, I did not die in my sleep and I have to somehow live today. Every night before bed sometimes I imagine my eventual suicide and I smile because I know that's probablly going to be one of the 'happiest' moments of my life. I get so nervous thinking about killing myself though even though the concept beings me peace, because I was raised unity christian growing up so I am worried I will go to hell if I do commit suicide. I also fear being stuck in 'purgatory' if I do commit suicide (which is almost just as bad as hell) if not considered actual 'hell' in some religions. I stay up at night fearing going to sleep sometimes as well because I have such vivid and intense dreams. I even dream about attempting suicide in my dreams and when I have those types of dreams I usually wake up and immediantly run to the bathroom to go vomit. What else can I say? I have Ptsd from surviving an armed robbery at my work and I have survivor's guilt because I feel bad for surviving it and not being able to just go back to my ordinary life now.  (Instead now I have ptsd and I fear even going outside to the groceey store. ) I feel guilty because the other girl that survived the robbery is fine and seems to be living her life and traveling and is unafraid (where as I have trouble even going outside period after what happened to me.) I feel like if I couldn't just bounce back and act 'normal' like her, that perhaps those guys should have killed me that night when they were pointing the gun at me to rob my place of work. So I have survivor's guilt but I also hate myself. I really hate who I am. I hate my looks. My voice. My choices in life. Everything basically. I am a 22 year old female and I have thinning ultra fine brown hair that's not very thick at all and I am so self concious about my hairline and lack of thick hair that I don't even want to go out in public or even be seen because I feel so disgusting and ugly that I have had random teenagers point at me in public and make gagging noises over my appearance. I know I am not always ugly because I have actually modeled in the past. The thing was I used hair extensions and make up to hide my discolored anorexic looking skin and acne, and to make my hair look as beautiful on the outside as I felt on the inside.  Then my hair started thinning out so bad that I couldnt wear hair extensions anymore and I am at the point where I should probablly wear a wig but the ones with realistic hairlines cost like $500 and I don't have that right now. My hair is also right now dyed this ugly ass copper penny color (auborn brown color faded) and my brown roots are large and they blend into the copper tones like an ombre but i know my hair is ugly. I went to cosmetology school but even I can't figure out how to fix my hair or make up. I thought I was alright at make up for a while and then I went back and really looked at my photos and that's when I started even hating my face with make up on.  I have gotten to the point where I hardly even wear make up because I know it doesn't look good on me. I just have an ugly face. My acne is bad and the make up doesn't hide it completely.  I feel like whenever I wear make up I just look even more ugly. Like the make up is enhancing all my insecurities. I have stretched ears too and I know people think that shit is gross so I am self concious about the fact that people probablly take one look at me and judge me to be homeless based on my outfits/lack of nice hair and make up and name brands. So on top of my ptsd and depression and anxiety, I am pretty sure I have some body dymorphia thoughts affecting me and how I see myself. I actually don't like to look in the mirror for too long because I actually get depressed seeing how ugly I am. I just imagine myself to look better than I actually do so when I see myself and my true ugliness, I get dissapointed and I hate myself for even trying to pretend to be pretty. That's another thing that I suffer from: Imposter syndrome. I suffer from feeling like a fraud or imposter most days. When I worked at different jobs like chipotle, and target, I still felt like any moment they were going to find out I wasn't really as great as they thought I was and they were going to fire me. I always fear people finding out that I have anxiety and then getting rid of me because of it. I try my best to hide it, but my ptsd is so bad that I have had to quit jobs due to my anxiety over being fired for attendence or something. I worry a lot. I compare myself to everyone else in the world and I think I am an imposter that is not as good as other people even at the things I love to the point where I don't even want to do the things I love anymore because I think I suck and that anyone can do it, probablly better than me. I used to have so many dreams and hobbies and now I just think I suck at everything to the point where I just don't want to exist because I don't think the world has any room for me. I feel like I don't deserve to live here on earth because I am such a loser. I feel like it is already too late for me and I will never amount to anything. I fear I will spend all of my life or the rest of my life in a mental hospital if I ever tell anyone these thoughts and feelings that I have so I try to keep it to myself but it's slowly eating me alive. I wish I could die. I don't want to be here anymore because I don't think I was ever meant to be here. I think some days that I was meant to kill myself. I feel like I am just another human taking up space and contributing to global warming. I just over all don't see any value to my life at all. I've let my depression and ptsd take over to the point where I don't sing anymore, write lyrics or draw or do anything I once dreamed of doing. I've deleted my social medias for the most part so I have nothing to do all day. I smoke weed and watch anime and that's how I have been spending my days but this isn't how I want to live my life and I know that but each dat that passes where I don't accomplish my dreams further puts me into a pit of dispair where I feel like committing suicide because it is too late for me to live my dreams. I worry I am too mentally ill now from what I have been through to ever actually accomplish my dreams and that concept alone makes me want to kill myself because I can already imagine myself being 80 years old and still watching anime and having no life and feeling the way I do now, and if that's what my future has in store for me, then I might as well just end my life right now. I don't have really any friends and I am too scared to go out and make them because I don't think anyone would ever want to be friends with me anyways because I am so nerdy and weird. I don't even know how to communicate anymore. When I go out to the store to get a sandwhich, I try to make small talk but I don't even want to do that. I don't like social interaction anymore even though I crave it sometimes from all the social isolation I have put myself through. When I say I don't know how so socualize anymore I really mean it. I go outside and idk wheather to make eye contact with people or weather to look down or if I should smile or not when I pass by people or if they think I am some homeless drug addict for doing that. I get so mentally stuck on what other people could be thinking of me that it makes it hard for me to talk to people in real time and keep up with their conversation or even know what to say to them and I worry that my face and eyes are giving away how scared I am to even be socializing and I worry it makes me vulnerable and an easy target. Okay, now, let me add that I grew up in an abusive home enviorment with a narcissistic dad and narcisstic mom. They were verbally,  physically, emotionally and sexually abusive to me growing up and even now they are still abusive so when I see them on holidays it is very hard on me because they say such hurtful things to me. I think that's why I care so much about what other people think, because my own parents told me I deserved to be sexually abused because of what I looked like. I had rainbow hair from age 17-21 and a septum ring and my own parents said that that made me look ""mentally ill"" and ""easy to take advantage of"" and a bunch of other hurtful things. To be honest the rainbow hair was the only choice I ever made for myself that I actually felt was mine and it made me happy. I also did it vwry beautifully because I went to cosmetology school so it was really beautiful. I'm sad my hair is too thin to allow me to dye it anymore but I used to feel good about myself when I looked that way even though my parents hated it. Looking back now, I still think I look ugly in a lot of different ways. Now, I must also add that I have an eating disorder. I currently weigh 132 or so but I'm a size small in everything. I used to throw up every day multiple times a day and I weighed 94 lbs. That's when I got a medical marijuana card and that helped me eat food again and stuff. My eating disorder is anxiety related so it doesn't have anything to do with body image. I just feel so stressed all the time that it's hard for me to eat anything because I am afraid it will make me feel sick and I will throw up so I am pretty thin because I hardly eat and I am very self concious about my eating disorder problems and the health problems that come with it. I am now also self concious about my teeth because from all the vommitting my gums have been receding and I am afraid to even show my mouth smiling because I am so self concious that my mouth looks like a drug addicts mouth or something. I do smoke weed but I didn't think weed could cause gum problems or teeth problems. I'm afraid to go to a dentist and find out how bad my mouth is. I know I need to go, but it's just one more thing to add to my endless list of things that are now stressing me out. I am sorry to ramble on and to make this post so long but since I haven't been established with a therapist yet, I have no where else to vent this and no one to say this to. I have to let it out somehow; so here were are. Anyways, after saying all this and seeing that this is my life, I feel like killing myself because I hate what a pathetic loser I am. I hate that I am not making music like I want to and instead I allow my mind to put me down so much that I consider committing suicide almost daily. I wish I could ""just get better"" so I can live my life again and make music and have my dreams happen. But I worry a lot that maybe my dreams were never meant to happen because I was born disadvantaged mentally (with anxiety and depression and phobias) I'm worried that because my mom and dad made me, I have their problems genetically passed to me and because of that, I am worried that some of my anxiety was passed down to me so any idea that I had growing up of me ever being a singer or an artist one day was foolish because I was born with the predisposition for anxiety so I was never meant to fulfil my dreams and me even dreaming them was stupid to begin with because people who are mentally ill like me can never accomplish anything/or it's extremely hard for them to accomplish things because their own mind is their number one enemy. That's basically what I worry/think/feel all the time and that actualization alone makes me want to kill myself the most because I feel abolsutely foolish and worthless. Worthless from birth and foolish for ever thinking I could ever be otherwise. This feeling...all these feelings are hell on earth for me and I can't take it anymore. I have created a hell on earth for myself within my own mind and it is horrible. My own thoughts on myself are so self sabotoghing that I can't do anything anymore. I've lost interest in everything. All my dreams. All my goals. Even hope of me feeling happy on my next birthday is dwindling. I don't even feel happy when I eat food, I feel depressed. I don't want to go inside a mental hospital because I know it will make me feel more sad and I won't eat the food there. I'll only eat the strawberries if they give them to me because I just don't like food. I know all this is affecting my health. I just don't know what to do about it. I already saw my doctor recently and she gave me a refferal for therapy and I am currently on a waiting list but my anxiety is so bad I haven't even called back to see if they can get me into an appointment. This is my life. It's shit. And I know I shouldn't be complaining because some people out there have it way worse than me so I feel like I don't deserve to have this platform to even tell people how I feel. I feel like I should just suck it up and move on but I can't.  I really want to just end my life already and stop taking up other people's time. If I've gone 22 years feeling this terrible I don't think I can survive anymore. I want to end my life but I am scared of going to hell if I do so. I'm not worried about hurting people by ending my own life. You can't convince me anyone (including my own family) would even miss me or really feel much pain past the initial shock of hearing my death but secretly everyone in my  family would be happy to see me dead because I don't think they like me anyways. I haven't talked to any of them in months,  some of them years, and I haven't seen friends either. I've been trying to make myself dissapear and fade into the background of people's lives for a while now. I used to be an instagram model until one day I realized everything about my life was shallow, empty, and meaningless and that's when I decided to just delete my instagram and fb...and myself. I don't think anyone hardly noticed my disappearing on social media because I had only 2 messages from people asking about it and those people don't talk to me very regularly anyways. I didn't have many followers on my instagram so I don't think anyone missed me much. I made this reddit over a year ago to post a story about how I almost was abducted into sex trafficking but it was too hard on me with my ptsd to re live what happened by telling the story again so I haven't finished my first post ever on the subject due to that. Anyways, I don't expect anyone to read this post or even see it. I don't think anyone will respond either because I don't think my life is that valuable compared to other people. I bet there are people out there that will see this post as proof there is a mental health crisis in america and that I should just end my life already if I am already in this much pain. I guess what stops me from killing myself is the fear of 1. Going to hell and 2. Possibly regretting it because I could have changed my life and got better somehow and braved the storm. :/ those ideas hold me back but it doesn't stop me from wanting to end my life when I am faced with any minor setback. I hate that aspect about me. I wish I wasn't like that. Anyways, I am sorry for making this so long. I wish this wasn't my life and that I did not feel this way but unfortunately, this is how I feel and I have to let it out somehow. I hope life can get better me. I hope I don't have to kill myself. I hope I can feel 'happy' again for a long time and have it be genuinley real. I hope I can get past this stuff and make my dreams come true but as each year passes I lose more and more hope that things could ever be better each time. I do not know how much longer I can take of doing nothing with my life. I'm sorry this post couldn't be happier. I'm sorry I exist. I'm sorry I exist at all. I'm sorry for complaining online and for doing nothing in real life to feel better other than crying. I'm sorry I am so weak and pathetic. I wish I could be stronger. I wish I didn't feel this way. I'm sorry.",07Apr2019,59

14,"Alright so this is the first time i’ve ever written something like this anywhere publicly. I’ve been basically paralyzed sitting in my room for the past 4 hours because i can’t get myself to move. I have so many thoughts just scattered and this probably isn’t gonna make a total lot of sense but fuck it. I’m 18 and i’ve been depressed for a couple years. maybe even longer but i probably didn’t even know. I’ve had an anxiety disorder since about 3rd grade and this combination of depression and anxiety is something that no one should ever have to experience. I have a void inside of me and nothing can fill it and i mean nothing. i started exercising last summer and it’s been about 8-9 months of consistent exercising 4-5 times a week. It’s probably how i’m still alive rn but I don’t think i’ll be around much longer. I’m currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist but still haven’t found the right med. I really just can’t do this shit anymore and i know it sounds like you’ve heard that cliche saying from many ppl but i truly fucking mean this shit. it’s the most debilitating thing i’ve ever experienced and it gets worse and worse. Im not sure if this counts as a suicide attempt but a couple months ago, i was at a kickback and i tried to drink as much as i could before it was all gone. Keep in mind i’m a super lightweight who gets drunk after a couple beers. i had about 10 shots and a couple gulps of vodka and i was absolutely destroyed. I started crying and i felt like the biggest pussy ever since alcohol can really bring out what you’re feeling like at the moment. i remembered i felt a little suicidal and so low before i drank so that’s the reason. not totally sure if that counts as an actual attempt but whatever. OCD is something that is right under depression as it’s a cycle of horrible fucking thoughts over and over and over. Suicidal ideation can last more than 5 straight minutes and that’s something that’s considered hospital type according to my doc. i told him the thoughts last about 10 seconds but it’s really more than 2-5 mins. I’m a guy and i feel like a pussy doin this shit but idk what i’m even doin at this point. i’m a rock bottom self esteem even tho i’m in pretty good shape and I wish i had enough will power to kill myself. i think i’ll be able too pretty soon so i’m praying for now. i feel like the most isolated person ever even tho i have a few ppl i talk to. nothing will ever full this void and it’s the most numbing feeling ever. idk if anyone can relate to me with my shitty description and i appreciate it if u somehow made it this far. thanks and peace",07Apr2019,3

17,"Today I told my significant other that I have depression. 

Quick background: I'm 30 years old and for my whole life I have struggled with depression and severe social anxiety. My issues stem from my childhood of having a father and that side of the family emotionally abuse me consistently by telling me I would never amount to anything or that I will never be good enough or when I would tell them what I wanted to be when I grew up they crush my hopes and dreams. My parents are split up. My mother would always work to support me and I would hardly ever see her which led me to be a bit of loaner and have to teach myself how to do things. My parents had split custody of me and would always play me against each other by telling me hurtful things about the other. I never really was encouraged to do anything and would often withdraw myself to my room and play videogames. I had friends here and there but never anyone to really talk to. I was always that person who would help everyone else and never helped myself. Fast forward to my junior high years my depression got so bad that I went into my mother's bathroom and scarfed down as many pills as I could find in an effort to end all my pain and the pain I felt I was causing my family by existing. This resulted in me passing out for what seemed like days but in reality was only a few hours. Later I tried again but also failed. 
Fast forward to my late 20s. I was finishing up my BA and going into law school (my mother's dream not mine) when I got with my now fiance. This caused my depression to retract and be less prevalent. During my law school years I struggled to pay for classes, my mother was financially hurting from going through a divorce and my father was no help so I decided to drop out. This began to put a strain on my relationship of 5 years, as I struggled with trying to figure out what do I do know for a career and how will I provide for my fiance. I became more and more depressed and anxious. 

Fast forward to 2018. I became withdrawn, I constantly fight with thoughts of suicide and would talk myself out of it by thinking of my fiance. We began to grow distant from each other and would have blow up fights regularly, I would say I'm going to change but would fall back into the same routine. This past month we had one fight to which she said that she couldn't have anymore fights like this. For me that was a huge wake up call, I knew that this relationship was literally the only thing keeping me going so I decided either change or check-out. I began making myself more vulnerable and began voicing my feelings(something I have never done my whole life, when I was child my feelings didn't matter to anyone and if I cried I would get hit for it) so tonight I decided to tell my fiance that I have depression. After I told her we didn't talk about it. For some reason I was hoping that she would ask me questions or give me a way to talk about it, but she only asked ""why"". She knew I suffered from diagnosed severe social anxiety, but I never flat out told her about my depression. 
My question to everyone is: I want to give her information on how to help someone struggling with depression and I want her to understand or at least learn about depression, but I'm afraid that it might strain our relationship to the point of no return and me being hyper sensitive and an emotional wreck lately I feel like I would not be able to continue without her.",07Apr2019,1
18,"I hope it’s ok for me to ask for help here. My bf has clinical depression and I was well managed but since he started work a few months ago has just not been able to cope. In the last few weeks he has started having breakdowns where he suddenly gets exhausted, can’t look at me and can’t really speak. When he gets to that point the only thing to do is for him to go to sleep. 
He is on meds and is seeing a psychologist. He does regular light exercise and eats pretty healthily. We have a really open and communicative relationship and have been living together for well over a year now. So I don’t think that specifically is causing stress. 
I just don’t know if I am doing enough to help and what I should be doing at all. I feel like he is doing all the things he should be doing and still he is really struggling. 
He seems to be going ok for days or a week at a time and then suddenly out of no where, like tonight he just mentally crashes and can’t do anything.

I’m 20 years old, I’ve struggled with depression since my dad passed away when I was 7. After he passed, my mom completely went downhill. She got into drugs really bad, had a gambling problem, and just had problems with money in general. We got SSI until I was 19 and have absolutely nothing to show for it, up until I was 16 we got almost $3000 in SSI. We never stayed anywhere longer than a yr, she could never pay the bills, I mainly remember living with different people all the time because she constantly burned her bridges wherever she was at. This caused me to completely isolate myself, my room is my safe place. I love being alone but it’s taking a toll on my relationships/friendships, my health, and my mental state. Every job I’ve ever gotten (which isn’t many) I ended up quitting because I get drained unbelievably quick. I don’t have a job right now and anytime I get a call for an interview I ignore it because it gives me anxiety. I probably go outside once every other day and it’s just to get in the car. I’ll starve before I go in anywhere. I’ve become lazy and have gotten extremely dependent on everyone around me to do/get things for me.

25,"So we all have those days when our depresion is worse, perhaps we haven’t left our house for while, we haven’t slept properly or too much and food is going out window or too much.. 

Here are some things have helped me

1. Idoser - i listen to idoser every time I’m feeling overwhelmed or simply want to escape reality for while..
2. Listen to music and podcasts, no matter what you are interested in whether you love music, your favourite radio show. 
3. Exercise - exercise is probably the last thing you want to doing you are feeling depressed.. but it can be your best friend and better way of coping.
4. If you find the groups that nhs/council runs for depressed people to meet other depressed people is not your thing. Bunk them off and find something else.. if else fails use the net.
5. Get into nootropics, we all love that we’ve accomplished things but often our depression has clouded that judgement and we cannot focus but we’ve got that mountain of paper work sitting on our desk.. google nootropics and order order  a bottle or two, get some from Holland &amp; Barrett 
6. Do you have a hobby you love, perhaps think about getting one or two that suits you and suits your personality. There’s no point in joining a sports group if you hate socialising or too anxious/depressed or paying out a subscription fee if you don’t use it..
7. Feeling lonely and isolated, go on PenPal sites, chatrooms, forums and meet people that way.. that way you don’t have to worry too much if they disappear you can go and find someone else. Less effort required.. you don’t have to panic every time. Are they gonna turn up?? You can turn your computer on or your mobile any time of the day and get chatting.
8. Make use of that button your mobile called “do not disturb,” we all have those days when don’t feel like talking or we simply want to binge watch that new drama in peace and don’t want to be interrupted, make use of do not disturb and turn your notifications off. I did this last week, I didn’t give a rats about every day problems, daily grind of life, i had done the activities I wanted to do for the day..and I simply had it with life.. so I did it and felt lots better. The group was bunked, told em had flu, switched on that games console, shoved my mobile on do not disturb, let the bugger rundown it’s battery so even if flashes I didn’t see it and a holiday from life..

Now the thing is, I’ve gained 4 kilograms in a span of two weeks. It’s taking a toll on my self and I’ve been getting more frustrated.

28,"every day i wake up, with little to no aspirations of getting up. every day, the voices in my head get louder, grow stronger, grow hungrier with a burning desire to end my life. they flood my thoughts with negative remarks about my appearance, my relationships, my aspirations, my struggles, to the point where suicide is the better option, and the only option for me, as I am not strong enough to end these thoughts. i scream, i bang my head, i destroy my body selfishly to make them end, to destroy myself, but they always seem to be there, urging me to do it already.

but today they have drawn quieter. not so much that they’ve stopped all together, but rather hushed and whispering, and i can hear their negative remarks, but i am powerful enough to keep them at bay. 

i realize how lucky i am today, how something, whether godly or not, gave me this power, this strength out of all the days it could’ve been handed to me.
because yesterday i had strong and severe intentions on ending my life. i scattered around thinking what could be used, how I could do it, as to whether jump off a bridge somewhere, or hang myself. i didn’t have rope, a scarf, a belt, something sturdy enough to hang myself from my door. i was dead set on going to purchase rope, chain, a knife, anything that would insure that I would pass. 
i have tried several times in the past, and now i carry an godly ugly scar on my right wrist, a long vertical reminder, that bleeding out was too long for me, and help arrived far too quickly, and others were concerned about my prolonged period in the restroom. 
i push myself to go on “exiting” trips outside, to locations that I once loved going before it got too murky and hard to just get out of bed. to go to the park, to swing, to smile, to take in the sun, to look at the ducks. 
but i always put them off, saying that tomorrow will be better, that ill have the energy to drag myself outside, that i can be powerful.
newsflash it’s never better.
i cannot stop my own voice inside my head from telling me all these, true or untrue things about myself and my relationships, it’s maddening.
but today, today is the day, i will go to the park. that i will wear a pretty dress, do up my hair, put some color on my eyes, and paint my lips, for no reason at all. today is the day, i will go to the pet store to stare at all the cute little fish, and play with the dogs, and leave with a sense of guilt for not taking one home. today i will bust out my chalk pastels and oil paints and the rest of my things, and draw up a masterpiece, something I haven’t devoted attention to in awhile. i will clean my room, and tidy up my space. i will cook, and use all the fruit and other little things I convince myself I’ll eat but leave rotting because it’s far to exhausting.

today i will live to see another day. i will enjoy life as it’s meant to be lived, and do silly little things that i haven’t had the pleasure to do in awhile. i will be social, and somewhat shy, but ultimately make efforts to talk and hang out. 
and i don’t know how I’ll feel tomorrow. i don’t know if it’ll be good. i don’t know if ill feel this same passion five minutes later after this. but im going to fight tooth and nail with myself, more than I usually do, today. to remain happy, overjoyed, and positive.

to whoever needs it, i believe in you, i believe in your ability to get better. i see so much potential in every single person, and despite not knowing anyone on here, i want each and every one of you to feel joy and happiness, and to know and cling onto the fact that one day it could get better. every person is special, every person is beautiful, and you deserve a chance to see what you can do in the world. i think you are all amazing, and hard-spirited folks, and i hope that one of these days, if you are feeling down, just maybe, you’ll wake up, and feel a little better like me.

have a beautiful day, everyone. ",07Apr2019,1

After 2.5 days in bed, scared to get out from under the quilt, I got up yesterday. I had a package delivered - 80 plug plants I ordered weeks ago. I really didn't want to but I made myself get up and plant those little feckers. I knew that leaving them in a box in my kitchen would have justified my usual brain set - look, they've died, what a stupid idea to get them in the first place, throw them away, everything is spoiled, metaphor for my life.... 

I spent two hours planting them in tubs and pots. Who knows if all of them will survive? Who knows what they will look like if they do? (I've no idea what they are, lucky dip purchase) What I do know is that I'm glad they are done, I'm glad I got out of bed, I'm glad I didn't let them die. If any survive and actually flower I'll post a picture to show that a little bit of effort makes a difference later!

35,"Dear Reader,

I want to share the following with you because I recognise that you are depressed. 

I know...well *at least I think* I know, that the following will apply not only to yourself, but to others too whom are depressed.

I am not so naive enough to assume that the sensations within your mind are the same as those of others who are depressed. I am also not so naive enough to ever believe that that I will ever fully understand the aches, torments, and darkness you often experience. I don’t know what your first thought is when you wake up; nor do I have the slightest clue of the thoughts you have on a day to day basis. I don’t know how long you’ve had these thoughts -  and I don't know how/or/if they come and go. Truth is, I *don’t* know.

That being said, I’m not writing to you as a person of authority. I am not educated within this field. Some of what I write, is from a place of non-wilful ignorance. Despite my ignorance and lack of deeper level of understanding; I carry on to write because I want to understand. I want to understand because I want to help. I do, however, ask for your forgiveness in advance. I ask that you forgive me  for anything  which I write which has, or may miss the point of what depression for yourself, (not others) really is.

That being said, my letter begins.

i) Worthiness

My understanding has led me to conclude that your depression is deeply interlinked with feelings of inadequacy, perceived worthlessness, and the presumption of being a burden. In this part of the letter, I’d like to talk about the perception of yourself being worthless. I’ll move on to talk about perceptions, inadequacy, and presumptions of being a burden at a later stage.

Now - on the perception of being worthless.

The objective of this section is to tell you that you are **not** worthless. This is a difficult task because you **believe** that you are worthless. Your belief is flat out wrong.

It's very difficult, if not nearly impossible, to convince someone/\[you\] that they are flat out wrong. Our minds will go to extreme lengths to always be right because it's counterintuitive to tell ourselves otherwise.  I’m not referring to situations where its socially acceptable to “be wrong” and its encouraged to think alternatively as such in discussions or debates. I’m referring to situations whereby we are alone. We spend most of our time alone. I can’t think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. I legitimately believe that *Kendrick Lamar* is better rapper than *Lil Pump*. I have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *Lil Pump* being the better rapper. I simply wouldn’t do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time I’ll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline. 

We hold a belief about everything. And not in just the traditional sense of religion or politics; but in *every sense* possible. We have beliefs about very mundane words/items such as “chair”, fork” or “fridge”. Our beliefs, and the things which we believe to be true, are created by our surroundings. Life happens at such a fast pace that we often don’t get a chance to scrutinise the sources of those beliefs.  At this basic level, I hold the beliefs that, i) The most optimal way to sit down is on a *chair*, ii) The most optimal/efficient way to eat spaghetti is through use of a *fork*, and iii) The most optimal/efficient way to store food is in a *fridge*. I hold these beliefs because the immediate society im part of has given me tools to test these hypotheses. On large - they have all checked out. For instance; when offered spaghetti and am give western cutlery such as a knife/ fork/spoon; the fork has consistently proved to be the superior means of eating; thereby confirming my belief.

Equally; when I’ve left food outside the fridge, its gone off. Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. You believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. It's not contentious. We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong. We just don't question them because they aren't immediately contentious in the societies we are part of. 

Unfortunately, our brains are overwhelmed with the information provided by the world to the extent that we don't find time to revisit our beliefs. This can particularly damaging for abstract beliefs. Abstract beliefs include “love”, “pain”, “space”, “worthiness”, and things of a more conceptual nature.  Some of the abstract beliefs we have - we hold without scrutiny because the information which we created those beliefs from, was drip-fed to us through social cues. 

“Worthiness”, is one of such beliefs. It’s an abstract belief we do not actively talk about and have (unfortunately) largely relied on parents, peers, siblings, and strangers to define it on our behalf.  When we don’t meet their \[and society’s\] unrealistic and ever changing expectations; - we feel worthless. 

Earlier, I stressed the point that it’s difficult to go against a belief you hold because it's counterintuitive to do so in your own solitude.That being said, I’d like you to challenge the view of you have of being “worthless”. Your belief is wrong. The mere fact these words have been written for you; is an indicator that you, yes you - are of value and indeed not worthless.

**Expectations**

Together, we’ve established that feelings of “worthiness” are deeply intertwined with our inability to meet society's \[and yourself’s own\] expectations. In this part of the letter I’d like to talk about *why you shouldn’t care for expectations.* I can immediately think of two types of expectations which we should revisit. 

a) *Expectations of yourself to yourself*

Having expectations for yourself isn’t inherently a bad thing. Expecting yourself to meet specific targets  gives you drive. However, what you expect of yourself can also be detrimental to your health. I’ll elaborate:

If you grow up with someone, you don’t notice them changing until you look at photos of them in the past. If you live with someone who goes to the gym; you may not notice their incremental gains until a situation arises whereby their physique is put into question (i.e - them trying on a new shirt).The same applies for your mind; you’ve grown up with your mind since birth, and into your adulthood. In the same way you don’t notice the people you see everyday changing; you’ve probably never paid attention to the wisdom you’ve accumulated over the years and just how much you’ve changed. You aren’t the same as you were yesterday and you’ll be different tomorrow, wiser. For instance, last night I was turned away from a club because I was “dressed too casual”. This morning; I’ve woken up with knowledge that the club in question has a dress code which I didn’t meet, I’m now wiser. 

I went to the off licence yesterday and bought some toothpaste. On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - I’m now wiser. You are the wisest you’ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \- You may think “F\*\*k off - what do you know?”. You wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year old’s expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? Its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; it’s not okay to suffocate yourself because of them.

You are too hard on yourself. The only consistent expectation you should hold of yourself is staying alive. We may not know the immediate purpose of our existence but your body definitively knows that you should be alive - hence why your heart is beating. You’ve met and continue to meet your own expectation to be alive. For that, you should be proud yourself.

I see myself letting go, I see myself falling backwards and feeling my stomach twinge in regret. I feel the muscles tense up as the brisk air cools the back of my ears. I feel the point in time where I understand that the fear in this fall is pointless as it's too late to grab anything.

My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to her friends wedding that she was officiating. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, tattoos, big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. We hung out together a lot. It was very obvious that we had interest. One night, we laid on the mountain top staring at the sky, talking, laughing.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship. The next night, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that, nodded his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time. Also to note, Ken has an extremely mild case of Aspbergers.

After all that, the next few months were a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. At that time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love'. The next month I came to visit him and have fun. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and schmoozy with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over we slept in bed and had sex. He had said they had an open thing, so I thought it was ok. I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him &amp; he acted like he didnt want to make commitments. Remember, 'free-love' guy. The next night we (Angela too) went to a gay club and he was allll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with him and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he just kept saying he was intending on ending it. Then he said he would wait till he got back from Cali (a trip to visit family/Ken to meet family). He procrastinated cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings/deal with it. After the trip, he messaged telling me he did it. I was glad and glad she wasn't being strung along.

After a few more visits, we talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point Ken was in a ""can't we just be"" instead of committing zone. I wanted more but tried to open up to his thoughts. I didn't want to push it. Our interest in each other grew. I was willing to see what happens. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with happy inflection that he got the random guy that he hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar to move in (Matt). I hung up lol. He called back like ""did I say something wrong?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra $ and he needed a place to stay. He had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down. Matt and Ken didn't do anything, they clashed and Ken couldnt stand him after a few months. Ken and I became emotionally attached. He told me he was in love with me. He often told me at random, or if I asked...that I am enough for him and he doesnt want anyone else. For the entire relationship, he instilled that. A year later he asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, my health anxiety came about. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 and it fluctuates or disappears. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room. They felt it was my duty to manage my own mind. So I always severely avoided therapists. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 

A month later, I was on Kens laptop. I ended up getting on the internet and went to my FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a min. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. She was discussing wanting to take him to Hawaii. That night, I showed him that I saw his msgs, and I was pissed. He wanted to sit with me and run through the convo to clarify it meant nothing. And that they always talked like that jokingly. That he thought about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything. That he just wanted a free vacation cause he felt he deserved it after hotwiring her 3000$ 3 years before to get her teeth fixed. The whole thing smelled of BS. I then did the worst thing out of BLINDING ANGER. The worst thing I have ever done. I made a faux Sara acct spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a total shit for it. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken what I did, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences; leaving me, him talking to her again, kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. He wasn't upset. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 

Through the arguments over the years, seldomly I would fly off about her if we were talking about her or something relevant. Like the term ""your precious fucking Sara"" came out of my mouth a handful of times. He'd just get into IDC mode or be hurt that I would doubt his feelings/what he says. 
   
A few months later my health anxiety got bad. It coincided with the wedding stress. My hobbies all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would came &amp; went. I would be so out of it, that my surroundings were cloudy. Not paying attention. I would ask irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with, but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it.  His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me cause of my mindset.  If he were to talk about how he feels and I was focused and there, it was often he would say something painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than shock or sadness when he was looking for acceptance, so he thought I wasnt prioritizing his feelings. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fail, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated. I kept meaning to go, but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it anymore. Hes my husband, not a crutch. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car, go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 yrs. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to Boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there too. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. They got the house and we all drove to Idaho. I had severe suppressed/released anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. My sleeping habits also got severely effected, and just my general well being.  Through this all, he always maintained that  he just can't deal with my anxiety, he wants me to get help, lost hope, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go, never forever. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. In the arguments he would accuse me of being a liar, untrustworthy, selfish, childish, etc. 

This last Tuesday was The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I asked him on Monday in bed what was up, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was good.  On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text looked like otd be something bad about me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it was about something else, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, Im sorry, I will go to a therapist, etc...and he just looked at me like ..get a hold of yourself. He has never said that or ever indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. At home i said 
""Please, i am sorry...""
""it's too late""
""do you really want me to leave?""
""YES""
""for good?""
""for now""
 ""I will get help for real I will!""
 ""What, you think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for you again?"" 
""you don't love m---??""
""I am going to bed""
""but.."" 
""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door). not a tear, not a care, not even anger...just a fed up-ness.

 Once I got a hold of myself I wrote him an extensive text stating how I need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, that it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond Wednesday, I contacted every single therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I was really going to do this. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at the quality of my day to help clear my head. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...about his day (which is normal. His #1 priority is the quality of his day/job/hobby. He wont let ANYTHING disturb that...hence why he wants to get rid of me and went to bed mid breaking my heart. That's very normal for him. One of his biggest complaints about me in our relationship is me keeping him up past his bedtime. Like he said I dont care about his well being cause I was in a talking mood at the wrong time. Or I would be on my phone in bed and it would keep him up so I'd put the covers over me so it didn't bother/he wouldnt see. He considered that sneaky lying.) So yeah, jubilant just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him. And went on faith.

Thursday I cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head I was done with the 'pining' 'mindset and just...tried to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So in a small way, I looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister and she understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this any more unless you get help. I'm done"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 1200% and he still wants out then that is really shitty and says very little about the vows he made. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". 

The next day was my appt and fuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was hard. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. She was worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. She could tell I was extremely nervous and tried to calm me down. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk too. He was happy I went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am ding my part, and will continue to. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken to talk and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the literal entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me.
Me:""that was some painful things you said""
Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be tough for you to hear""
Me: ""Do you like her?""
Him: ""no, I messaged her to apologize and to have a friend back"" 
Me: ""you told her you contemplated marrying me then?"" 
Him: ""Yeah, I did..that was such a big lie""
Me: ""it was, and I told you flat out I did it and you let it go"" 
Him: ""well thats cause I already knew and had time to process. I actually found it on your computer."" 
Me: "" What? You didn't tell me that""
Him: *shrugs*
Me: Was it true about why you continued with the wedding?""
Him: ""I did it cause I love you""
Me: ""No, you said to her you stuck with it cause of the down payment on the venue"" Him: ""Stop. Why do you do that? Why do you always jump to conclusions and not take what I say? I love you and thats why I did it. The $ was secondary."" 
Me: ""Do you really want a divorce?""
Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""
Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother you?"" 
Him: ""you arent allowed to ask me about my emotions yet till you earn it"" 
Me: ""okay..I just don't understand why that extreme. We love each other.""
Him: ""You can be divorced and still in love. Lots of divorced people are in love...""
Him: ""I want to be with you. I love you. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate leaving you, but I don't want to live like this (cries) with you refusing help."" 
Me: ""I am going to someone, I am really on this. This is it""
Him: ""I want to see you get help and I want you back""

 Later I said, verbatim ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"" and he said ""you arent going to dictate who I want to talk to or who I want to be friends with. Its none of your business"". He has made it very clear that I have to earn him back and that if I am not cool with something, tough shit. 

 How could he say all those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right. If it is wrong what can I even say about it?

Also, now Ken is trying to do stuff with me. Yesterday we went to a BBQ pit, he was laughing at my jokes, if he saw i had goosebumps he's stroke his finger on my arm and giggle or offer his coat. But at night he still went to sleep in the other room, I asked him if he was sleeping in there again and he did the whole...breathe in and 'what did I say before' look. ""I told you yesterday until you get back to your sleep schedule right I sleep alone"" then hugged me and kissed me on the forehead. He won't kiss me on the lips yet. He woke me up this morning stroking my back and kissing my head like ""you gonna get up and we can do stuff? Do you want to go shopping?"" I of course got up despite crummy sleep, pretending I am totally awake and ready. And now I have these urges to look at his phone to see if he is still talking to Sara and what about now.

His mother and I have tried to provide advice and support but we dont know where to turn next. We were able to convince him to call a suicide prevention hotline 5 days ago or at least he said he called. 

My question is how do we convince him to see a doctor before its too late.
