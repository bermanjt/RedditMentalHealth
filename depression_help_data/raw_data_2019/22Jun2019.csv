0,"My family keeps insisting I go to therapy because I admitted I’m depressed this year. May I also mention they don’t believe I have any right or reason to be depressed because I “have everything I need” and was never abused or had any huge traumatic moments I had to endure in my lifetime (as far as they know, or deem valid enough to count as depression) I’ve repeated many many many times that I’m fine doing what I need to on my own- taking time to myself mindfully to get better: getting rid of my old stuff, journaling, reading books, going out by myself or with close friends, retail therapy on occasion, art. But they don’t see it as enough and keep basically demanding I get help by seeking a therapist or medication. I’ve had experience with a counselor all throughout college and don’t feel I want that just yet because I don’t want to go through the process of finding someone I get along with as well as re explaining my depression, traumas, triggers, relationships. It sounds draining for me rn, I’d much rather meditate on it on my own first and figure out what problems I need more guidance on first. I’m too afraid to start medication yet because someone close to me tried to overdose and I’ve also personally contemplated overdosing so I’d rather stay away until I’m more comfortable. 

I guess what I’m looking for is someone to empathize that we can get better outside of only therapy or medication. Why can’t I just take care of myself and know that’s enough for now? Why does everyone doubt my capabilities, ignore what I’m saying and demand I get better sooner? How can I get people to respect I know what’s best for myself?",22Jun2019,1
1,"I really do. 

I haven’t been able to for years. I’ve taken steps to address the depression. I moved in with family for a short period of time to “reset” and get me out of the situation that had me depressed to begin with. I’ve since moved to somewhere that I actually have friends and a good support system from said friends (about a month ago actually)

The major problem is that I still feel numb. I don’t think I have felt “true” happiness in any time that I can remember. I’ve just been distracting myself with work and small projects to keep my mind busy. 

Here’s the thing. I just wish I could cry. Just once. I feel like it will release something and make me feel better in the end. 

I won’t say the suicidal thoughts are gone, it’s just not as prevalent as they were a couple years ago. 

I’m afraid to talk to a therapist, and quite frankly, my deductible makes it hard to afford when my bills keep me budgeted so tight. 

I need to improve. 

Sorry if this isn’t the right place to vent. I just needed to put my thoughts on glass and probably someone tell me I’m not a completely insane person.",22Jun2019,2

4,"My (M-25) story is that when i was 5 my parents split and spent the rest of my childhood arguing through my little sister and I. Telling us how bad the other one was as a person. So i think i kinda grew up with no sense of what love means, because my mom could tell me how wonderful, smart, and a gift to the world i was but my dad would then tell me about how much of lying manipulative (insert every expletive for a woman imaginable including the c word), and vice versa except my mom would be more passive about her criticism of my dad. So i grew up basically thinking my parents are both shit bags so there fore i must be one too. How the fuck do i get over this and love myself? Cus according to my ex gf (only gf, i didnt date or go out to parties in highschool cus i didnt want to subject anyone to my home life) thats the reason i can never be in a relationship. 

Add to it this little nugget. So my dad owned his own business. A logging business. Which if youre not aware is neck and neck with deep sea fishing as the deadliest occupation in the US. Its also a very cut throat and stressful business. But i helped him even as a kid when i wasnt in school or at sports. So my first work experiance was trying not to get fucking crushed by trees and heavy equipment as a 12 year old, all the while being screamed and cursed at to hurry the fuck up. He wouldnt actually pay me though he would just buy the things id need like fishing tackle and such. But this offered me zero freedom of choice as a kid. 

Say i didnt go to the woods with him and id be home after school doing normal kid shit he would come home tired, annoyed, and probably with another injury because his body is a mess from all the years of hard work, and if i had a good day in school i just felt so fucking guilty and bad i wasnt there in the woods helping him. 


Fast forward a few years and i find myself working in the forestry industry at a government agency, on the timbersale prep side of things (so preliminary sale appraisal before guys like my dad bid on the job), with a college degree, because deep down inside i think i want to help my dad still. Its actually a pretty good job though i have benefits and get to take a lot of paid time off. I dont get paid a lot but im only 3 years out of college. The work i do is also all years in advance of loggers actually cutting the sales i work on so all that danger and stress is gone. But i feel guilty.  Because i genuinely enjoy my job but like i said its a low paying govt job and i think part of me feels really bad that my dad struggled for so many years (he has had 19 surgeries since 1991 to repair bodily damage he has suffered in his job). I feel bad that he struggled for so long and now his son is just a low level govt employee, and im not doing something higher earning with my degree.

So how do i deal with this? Therapy is not an option for reasons i dont have time to explain here. But i know thats what i need. So how do i do self therapy? Or just generally learn to love myself and feel okay doing a job i love or having a hobby or just generally having fun without feeling guilty? Guilty for my parents divorce and guilty for my dads suffering to put a roof over our head and food on our plates.",22Jun2019,1

But that doesn’t help me.  Every time I’ve tried either I’ve been left just as bad or worse.  And when I read stuff that makes depressed people say “Oh, that’s me!  I’m happier now knowing I’m not alone.”, I just get more depressed feeling sad for other suffering people and feeling that there’s no hope for any of us.  Severe emotional pain has been continually bottling up in me every day for six years now.  Therapy and meds and meditation aren’t helping either.

12,"this is definitely going to be a possible TW, and this may or may not be super long, as i haven’t written it yet.

i’ve posted on this community a couple of times. and needless to say, this is the only place i feel safe enough to vent to. i’m not quite sure why, but i genuinely feel like i have some worth after posting in this community. 

hi. i’m bea. i’m a 15 year old female, and i’m part of the lgbtq+. i love music, whether it be composing or listening to music, i love it all. i study neuroscience, as that’s what i want to do when i complete highschool. im pretty motivated to being happy, and typically i can make it happen. but recently, things have changed. i’ve been low in my mind and i’ve been bringing people down with me, as i don’t mean to. i’ve been rude to all the people i love, and pushing away everyone who tries to help me, because they recognize that i need support.

a backstory of my life is that i had the perfect childhood. not the rich parents, i got everything i want, type of childhood, but i had golden parents in my eyes. i got parents who cares and loved for you, and i got parents who tried to help me whenever i fell off my bicycle and understood if i never wanted to rid it again. those were the types of parents i grew up with.

my mother moved away and out of the house about 2 years ago. the substance abuse addiction she has/had, tore our entire family apart. there was always aggression in my family as i started to age, and i started to realize that my childhood wasn’t as perfect as i thought it was. there were so many arguments and sleepless nights due this, so my father and i pushed her out, and let her out on her own. now, she’s doing okay and is living, but still abuses the substances, and it is just as infuriating as it was years ago.

my father and i had the best relationship that i think a daughter and father could ever have. when i was 1, i get told i instantly bonded with him, and just loved him. he’s technically my “step-father” as he’s not biological, but i’ve known him as a father my entire life. he gave me the perfect childhood i mentioned, and i couldn’t have thanked him more for it.

by the age i had gotten my period however, he was sick. not the cancer type of sick, but mentally he was sick. he started to develop cameras in my room, and restroom, and started videoing me without my consent. you get the point. needless to say, i found all of this information on his computer, around a month ago. i had turned him in, moved back in with my mom, and sadly my father is no longer with us, as he had taken his life. rest in peace.

i’ve been under a lot of stress lately, so my period and hormones are completely off. as mentioned, i have been absolutely brutal to everyone i love, and i’m worried that at some point it’s going to get to the point everyone in  my life leaves. whether it be my boyfriend, my friends in the other states, or even my mother. i’m worried that no one is going to realize i’m trying so hard to maintain a good mentality, but i cant do that when all i seem to do, is induce anger in everyone else’s lives. 

my boyfriend and i have been together nearly 9 months. it’s been an amazing relationship, until i just moved away, to present terms. we’re almost 1.000 miles away, and i have severe insecurity problems/trust issues. recently, that has started to come through, and i feel out of control. i’ve been getting on him for stupid shit, and this entire time ive been here, ive done nothing but induce arguments it feels. i don’t like arguing with anyone, especially with my s/o. as mentioned, i have trust issues, so that means i get worried anytime we argue, and assume he’s just going to leave, which isn’t my ideal mentality at all.

i’m insecure. everyone is in their own way. mine so happens to be so intense to the point i can’t even look at myself in my own mirror, because i absolutely hate what i see. i have a flat stomach, smaller bust, smaller butt, an hourglass figure, and bigger thighs and hips. most people tell me they’d “kill for my body”, but i want to be different. i cant seem to get the butt shape and size i want, and it’s so infuriating just looking at myself in the mirror, after doing many, many, tiring months of targeted exercises or your butt, and i still get nothing. i have red hair, skin so fair i have the inability to tan and the blessing to burn, along with brown eyes, freckles, and full lips. everyone says they want to be me, but the reality is— i want to be them.

trust issues have always been a thing for me. i’ve been abused emotionally and physically in my past relationships, so it’s fairly difficult whenever it comes to being affectionate, as well as trusting the other person. i’ve been working on my trust with my current s/o, but i’m not sure he 100% understands that i compare myself to every single girl out in the world. we had a pretty heated argument, about him calling a girls picture perfect, but i won’t go into that, as it’s unnecessary and over with. 

ill see anyone out on the street and instantly get insecure of what is out there. of what i’m not. this mentality absolutely sucks, as i want to be comfortable in my own skin, but it’s so hard. it’s hard knowing that there is always someone better. knowing that maybe he may leave me for the girl who is obviously better, but the excuse is, “it’s not you, it’s me.” i need to get out of this mentality, i really do. it’s damaging our relationship, and it’s damaging me mentally even more than i am damaged. 

i’m pretty much a jealous person over anything. i assume a lot, i get offended over small things, and i panic about what the next second holds. i’m antisocial, and i’m sad all the time. i’m a mess and i cant seem to get it in my head that i deserve something. i’m a needy girlfriend, with a shitty way of expressing my emotions. i don’t know what to do.

congratulations, you made it this far, if you didn’t skip ahead— wtf, don’t you have something to do? and if you skipped, you’re a cheater go back. 

i guess i just needed to get stuff of my chest. this will most likely be hidden. but if you read this, thank you. i’m sorry for my chaotic mess.",22Jun2019,1

I've never had anyone do this before. I'm not how to respond or react. For some reason I'm very embarrassed about it and feel somewhat guilty for making someone worried.


I haven't read the message yet but when he was on Facebook earlier I panicked and closed out of it. I feel super guilty for not responding the day I got the message which was on Thursday. Is there a way I can respond by being truthful about some things without crossing normal social boundaries? My mental health has been terrible lately and I'm getting help for it now, but I've not been doing well. I'm not sure what's ""okay"" to say and what's not or if I shouldn't respond truthfully. I'm also afraid of being committed for depression for some reason. 🤷‍♂️

Despite being in therapy, there is still stuff that she mentions I never brought up until then. (I have a chronic illness which only got mentioned two sessions ago at the start of June.) I feel like it's much easier to type out how I feel because my brain knows what it wants to say, and I don't have to deal with the physical act of opening up and seeing a person's reaction.

21,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I was diagnosed with depression 4 years ago, I went to therapy for about a year, but then we moved to a different country. We thought everything was fine, but then my depression came back a lot worse. 

Now I'm (F/17) back in my native country and yesterday, after 3 years of suffering, I could finally get help again. I went to a psychiatrist, tried to explain my situation. The problem is, whenever I talk to others I involuntarily smile all the time, so normally people see me as a shy but happy person. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with social anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder (which I know for a fact that I don't have). She described me as ""slightly depressed"". But I know what I went through in the last 3 years (constant self hate, inability to feel happiness, wanting to end my life, etc), I even dropped out of high school because I just couldn't get myself to get out of bed for months. 

The psychiatrist said I don't need antidepressants and the best would be if I tried to find some kind of a community to go to (which is impossible for me, as I get a panic attack whenever I have to communicate with more than 1 person in public). She also suggested me to get a job or go back to high school (which I can't do, because, again, I can't get myself to do ANYTHING). 

If I could find another psychiatrist I would, but she is the only one who's available in the city.

How can I get her to understand me? Or should I just give up on her and find another psychiatrist in another city? 

Please help me.

TL;DR: finally went to a psychiatrist to get help for depression and social anxiety, but she misdiagnosed me with adjustment disorder and ignored my depression and social anxiety. She suggested me to get a job and go back to high school, which I can't do because of my severe social anxiety and depression.",22Jun2019,3
22,"My boyfriend and I were together for a year and a half. We jumped right in right from the beginning, falling madly in love. He knew I had depression, but I was managing it. Things were so good. We moved in with each other about 8 months after we started dating. It was going well, we were happy. We went on trips, we spent time together with our families, our sex life was fantastic. I graduated from grad school and got my first job in my field. It was terrible, my boss treated me like crap. I came home many days crying because I felt stuck there. My boyfriend stayed by me and supported me. He was really great! Finally, my boss fired me. I was a mess. My depression came back in a way I hadn't experienced before.

I was devastated.  When I asked why, he said he had been unhappy for a while. However every time we talked about how we were doing he hugged me close and told me everything was good. He then said he lied because he wasn't sure how to broach the topic with me, or how to put how he was feeling into words. He couldn't do this with me, the woman he claimed to love, but he could with some other woman.

33,"I’m a 14 year old girl, and I think I may have depression, for a number of reasons. I tried talking to my mom about it, but she says that I couldn’t possibly have it because I’m not sad. So, I decided the best option was to go on here. 

For awhile now, I’ve been experiencing... 
• Weight gain (I’m 170 lbs, which for a 5 ft girl is a LOT. It happened from mindlessly eating junk food and not paying attention to my health)

• Poor self esteem (caused by the weight gain and rude remarks from my mother, regarding my weight, laziness, bitchiness, calling me rude names, and comparing me to others)

• No motivation to do anything (I want so much more for my life. I have so many goals! But no motivation)

• Procrastination and perfectionism (I’m stuck in a cycle where I procrastinate things because of my laziness and obsession with everything being perfect. It sucks, and I can’t find a way out of it. It’s been going on for years)

• Irritability and agitation (This caused a very bad relationship with me and my mom. To my friends, I’m a sweet, loving girl who would never do any harm. To my mom, I’m the devil) 

• Crying (It doesn’t happen all the time, but occasionally I’ll just start crying because I don’t like my life or I feel lonely. When I woke up this morning, I cried because my friend wasn’t at my house anymore and I felt lonely and hopeless. This doesn’t happen all the time though, so I’m not consistently sad)

• No sense of humor (It seems like my sense of humor disappeared. Although I do laugh from time to time, I don’t usually laugh at anything, even if I do find it funny. Sometimes I won’t even smile. The weird thing is that when I was younger even a fart noise would make me laugh uncontrollably, but I guess things change)

Do you think I have depression? If I do, how can I fix it? Please give me some advice. Thanks :)

P.S, I don’t feel like seeing a doctor is the best idea for me (at least right now). Maybe in the future, but right now I’m just looking for some general advice.",22Jun2019,1
34,"hello guys i'm new here because this morning I woke up with a deep emptiness in me, it's been almost 3 years that I feel a deep depression in me but I filled all this with entertainment (music, anime, food, porn, videogame, etc ... ) but since I am in university and I have changed country and I have been sick for months (and it continues) in short it has become unbearable, I feel extremely alone sad depressed and without hope of change so I agree this subreddit to prevent it from getting worse and especially to check if I am not also sf in my pain.

thank you if you read this and have a good day

Note: I always had this image of being a strong person so I think that practically no one doubts, **I just wanted to empty my bag because I literally have no one and never even had anyone to say that kind of thing,**",22Jun2019,7

37,"I’m sorta new to this to be honest and I’m sorta desperate right now. Basically school is ending and I’m still deeply unhappy with my life. I thought it would get better once school ended since there would be no more pressure or anxiety from school. A new issue has arisen, I don’t know what to do with myself. To put this into words school was the only thing keeping me going, now I have nothing. Any activities I attempt to do just feel so dull and I can’t imagine myself bearing this for a few months till I can go back. Just what do people do all day? Like I thought I’d get a job and volunteer but I don’t see a point. I’m killing time just till I get back to school and the more I think about it I’ll just be killing time for the rest of my life.",22Jun2019,3
