It's been a long time since I've felt so low. I'm scared I'm going to lose my apartment, is getting harder and harder to eat regularly, and my car got broken into right before I was to sell it and its trashed. This year has been beating me down and every time I think I'm making an improvement in my life financially, emotionally, and otherwise I get shoved back down. I try to stay positive and thinking everything with work out in the end has been working out, but now I'm completely broke and have been laid off 3 times this year. I have a job again but it's looking like I might not make enough to cover rent by the time I get paid. Yesterday I sold every record I owned that I've had since I was a child and many given to me by people I'll never see again. It was heartbreaking and still a lifetime of memories ave it only amounted to pennies. I'm not a man who cries easily but right now I'm with my friends and I can't help but hold back tears. I just want a hug and I'm too shy to ask...",18Jun2019,1
2,"Hellooo my friends. Any tips on making art when it's just so so hard?

**Warning** that I kind of devolve into self bashing here, so if that would bother you or get negative thoughts going please skip. Hope this kind of post is ok. 

I'm a long time professional sad with a handful of shitty illnesses on my list. Art is that one thing I feel even the slightest bit of actual enthusiasm for any more, I'm sure many of you relate. I'm not in as deep of a bad depressive episode atm and have gotten used to how bad my other illnesses affect me... but it's still so fucking hard!!

I can sit down and open up my sketchbook and dabble, but *consistently* working on a piece that I want to finish and be proud of is something i haven't managed in years. I've tried to do a little daily, but I get discouraged or too tired and stop.
 I'm also recently off of a multi month slump. I feel like I'm further behind than ever and that i should give up in every way. I wanted to be a professional illustrator or concept artist, but I feel too old for it (im coming up on 25, my online acquaintances are getting professional dream jobs, im still me) and like I'll never make it now. There is nothing special or amazing about my art, so why would I be picked above another?
Satisfaction is so rare for me now. I don't know what i want to make, or why. I'll start something and maybe even like it but stop because I'm not sure it's the right art to be making. It's infuriating. And really saddening. 
Also i want whatever the people who can go to work and do art the same day are on. Or sometimes who can just do stuff in their houses and art same day. 
But regardless, ugh. I just want to do better. I see the drive and energy and ability and passion it seems to take to make it as an artist.. and I'm worried I just don't have it. I rolled a bad hand and feel so stuck. Send tips if you can. Thanks. &lt;3",18Jun2019,1

I should mention I have BPD, with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts (but not actions) coming along with it, so I'm probably overly reliant on people, but when most of the people in my life seem to treat me like I don't exist until they need me, it just makes me feel like shit. I hate feeling like the disposable person in a persons life, but I have no idea how to make myself more concrete in another persons life.

Usually I'm very outgoing and active. I often perform strange hyperactive behavior when I'm around others that's honestly unexplainable. After these periods I'll find myself extremely lethargic and down both physically and mentally. Even my own perspective on life often changes completely. Usually I'll get by day by day without much purpose, just doing it because I have to. On other days I'll suddenly feel really confident, motivated, and excited. These drastic differences make it incredibly difficult to focus or pursue anything in life as they last for occur at and last for random periods of time.

So all throughout my life I struggled with social interaction. I was never really popular by any stretch of the imaginiation, but life was ok, at least I had some friends, but over time many people moved and I'm still stuck with university right now, which I'm done with soon. (Had to change field of study once, while I was basically almost done with, because I saw no future in that field for myself.)
So right now the only ""friends"" I have are people, who are basically not interested in what I do whatsoever, while I try to get to know them better, to no avail, but if I move I'm scared of being perpetually lonely, since i suck at social interactions.

Now that's school's over, my days are quite boring and I don't really get many social situations... In less then two weeks, I'm supposed to be attending NCS however I don't know if I even have the mental capacity to continue with anything... I rarely feel anything anymore...

32,"
To be honest I don't know how crazy people think and feel but they seem disconnected from the real world. I want that kind of disconnection. I don't want to kill myself, nor to stop existing ( although for a while I wished I had never been born ) . I want to live without a certain emotion ( depression ).

I can't stop thinking of death as the end of
everything. I think about it especially before
falling asleep, which makes it very hard to fall
asleep. My depression started around the time
I stopped believing in God. It was the fact that
death is the end that took its toll on me .

I understand I shouldn't fear it cause I wont feel
anything, but it doesn't matter. The fear I feel is
real. I hate myself. I never cut myself but when I
am nervous I end up punching and biting myself.
When I look at the ridiculousness of the world I
feel like laughing, but then I take pity for myself
and start crying. Sometimes I laugh and cry at the same time .

Sometimes I wish to put on a mask and forget my
identity. My instincts want revenge against what
caused me to become depressed. But I cannot
get revenge on an emotion . The only one at fault
here is me.

My life hasn't changed, just my view of the
world. Fuck it . I hate feeling weak, I hate I can't
concentrate on studying because of depression,
I hate that other people suffer and noone helps
them, I hate the nature of this world. I am tired. I
want revenge, but I can only hurt myself.

35,"It's become apparent to me in the last several months that my girlfriend has severe clinical depression. 

Some background about us and what I know about her depression.

* We have been dating for about 10 months now. We are both girls. I am almost 31 and she is 26. She is out and I am in the process of coming out to my family, but most of my friends know.
* The first 5 months of our relationship were great. We were very open about our hopes and fears and communicated a lot. Between the two of us, I am more open about my feelings. She is a little bit more closed off than I am, but during this time she was great about communicating. 
* We both had come from very toxic relationships:
   * The last time I dated someone was about 3 years ago. It was a five year, in the closet relationship with my best friend and it ended very VERY badly (cheating by her/depressed at the time-anxiety from me). 
   * She is recently divorced. It was a very short marriage and was served divorce papers 5 months after they had gotten married in October. She was blind sided by this in March and then found out her ex was cheating on her. She was officially divorced in June, 3 months before we dated (End of August). 
* On New Years Eve we got into a really bad car accident. She was driving and a public city bus hit us head on. I was in the passenger seat. We both had injuries from the impact.  I believe this is what triggered this downward part of her clinical depression. 
* After the accident I noticed a significant change in her. Her motivation and mood changed. Before she was up for everything and very open.  We also had sex a lot. I sensed she was not telling me things and a wall had been put up. As I said before, she has always been a bit more quiet and it takes her longer to process her feelings, but she always talked to me about it. And one of the most significant changes was her lack of affection and desire for sex. At first I thought it was me, but I later figured out it was her depression. This is when I started to piece it together actually. We would start to have sex, but I could tell her head and heart weren't in it. It's like she was going through the motions but wasn't really into it. I pressed her about it when this started happening, and after a few instances where this happened during sex, she finally admitted that she has severe clinical depression. 
* My GF has a really hard past. I don't think it's my place to share all about her past, BUT She has been through the gauntlet of things that I know would affect anyone. But what bothers me is that she kind of would partly tell me things. For instance, she told me she had been depressed before, but it wasn't until I pressed her because of the change in mood and motivation that she told me outright that she had severe clinical depression. She also didn't tell me until later that she is also on Anti-depressants and was not taking them when we first met. I also figured out she had been married before and asked her about it, she did not tell me. These are just a few examples. 
* I keep finding things out slowly, but I love her and want to be supportive. We have been fighting more because her mood and demeanor is entirely different. It's honestly like I am dating a completely different person. She keeps telling me to wait and be patient. She sees a therapist once a week and I went to see mine. My GF refuses to talk to me about about what they talk about, which is totally fine. But what bothers me is when I ask her how I can help her, or be more supportive she just says I need to be patient. Her depression won't go away overnight. I can accept that, but, it's been almost 4 months now....
* My therapist told me to lower expectations because depression is a cycle. To be supportive, but also be conscious if I'm catering her needs more than my own. I can tell you right now, I am putting her needs in this relationship first. We don't have sex. We haven't in 4 months. That is really killing my self-esteem. I plan and do everything. Dates. Initiating when we hang out. Saying I miss her and I love her. I even still try and initiate sex. I am trying to be energetic, supportive, and kind. But, the fact that there has been no change in her in the past 4 months makes me feel lonely in this relationship. Again, She is seeing a therapist and taking her meds, but she keeps telling me to wait and be patient. Things take time. If I am being honest, I am starting to become a bit resentful, especially with the lack of sex. I KNOW it's her meds that are partially affecting her labido, but it sucks.  I hate to admit that I am becoming resentful of this, but I am. 
* I ask her all the time what I can do, but she tells me she doesn't know. I ask her If she just wants to be friends, and she says No because she loves me and wants me as a girlfriend. We have had the breakup conversation a few times, but we keep deciding to try. I know I am coming to my limit, but I really love her and don't want to give up.

**TL;DR: My question is what advice would you give your partner on how to be more supportive or what would you want from a partner if you were in your the lower part of your depression? Am I being ridiculous and unfair in your eyes? What could I do more or be better at?**

&amp;#x200B;

**OR if you were in my position, what would you do? Would you call it quits OR what else would you try?**

I realized that I feel lonely in my hometown and kept dwelling on the interaction that night, ultimately costing me sleep. Suddenly out of nowhere I thought about suicide. Not personally, but as a topic it came into my head, which somehow seems disturbing to me. It's been happening more and more. I know that I'm not personally suicidal, but I'm like scared of it now. In middle school, when I was really depressed, I told my parents I was considering suicide and the conversation was appropriately dark and serious, but that was 6 years ago and they are certainly well over it.

They're out of town so I'm alone at home this week, and I think I'll get over it as soon as we can have a heart to heart about how much better I am now.

41,"Hi All,

First time posting anywhere, but wasn’t sure where else to get some initial feedback.

I suspect my mum suffers from depression but don’t know how to speak to her about it. 

It came up for the first time around a year or so ago, when after talking through an issue she mentioned she had been feeling really down “like there was a cloud” over her, and that no matter what she tried to do it always seemed to be the wrong thing. 

We’re generally close (i’m a 28 y.o female for context, still at home with her, dad and younger sister) but whenever I try to ask about how she’s doing she closes up, almost defensive at times.

In the time between now and then I’ve suggested she talk to someone if she didn’t feel like she could talk to me. Her relationship with my dad is best described as rocky, despite them still being ‘together’, so I don’t think that is an option. We have spoken about it, but he’s had even less luck getting through. Also tried to normalise it to remove any embarrassment, speaking generally about other friends that have felt similarly and the help they got for it, but it’s all been brushed off.

What’s the best way to try and get her to a feel like she can open up? She’s hinted before the whole parent/daughter relationship is what makes her feel uncomfortable (in her mind she should be looking after me not the other way around), and I get that. But I don’t think she’s talking to anyone about it. Also mentioned it’s “just a phase” but I think that was just an easy way out of the conversation.

Any advice from people that have been in a similar position, or even parents themselves would be great. Even if she never talks to me about it properly, I feel like I’ll need to persuade her to speak to someone and get the help she needs.

Thanks in advanced.
