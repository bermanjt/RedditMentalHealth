0,"So I have alot to say and no friends or family to help in my situation.

Ive been married for nearly a decade, I found out my wife was cheating on me with 7 guys at her job. So I kicked her out and filed for divorce as well as full custody of our 2 children. 

During this time my father who has Alzheimers is dieing, ive getting help from a woman that has been in between friend and girlfriend. This was a big mistake in the past week my so to be exwife had the kids and when she brought them back she tried kissing me and giving me a hug. I turned my head and pushed her away telling her to stop doing things like that. But someone saw and told my friend that I was kissing her and she got pissed and started ignoring me. So I dealt with it until she called me over and said we needed to talk.

When I got there she wouldnt let me defend myself and kept accusing me of doing her dirty when I haven't. I got to explain what happened and she apologized for overreacting. But as the night went on she started arguing with her friend about me and kept flipping between he's my man, and he's my friend. I got tired of it and decided to leave. I told her today that we need to discuss why I left, and she said ok but not today. 

Since then she has been depressed and I found out that its because of the guy she was with before I met her. So since our kids were playing together I waited for awhile and we left. I know what it's like to not be someones priority and swore I wouldnt be with someone unless they treated me like I treat them. 

So I'm depressed. My dad is sick and dieing, im going through the divorce and juggling keeping my kids emotionally good, and the woman that has been holding me down has been acting out of place either as a friend or doing me dirty as a girlfriend (no definitions means definite problems) either way its no good. I have to much on my plate and im doing my best on so many fronts but I feel so stupid for this woman, I feel so useless for my dad, I feel so used by my so to be exwife, and I feel like I'm letting my kids down by them having to deal with all of these things and not being able to understand as they're to young.

1,"I’ve been waiting for these demons to dial the volume down
But it’s only been getting louder and louder and louder now

My mind is straight warfare and it’s pushing me to the edge
To the brink of insanity 
i think I’ll just step off the ledge

I seems like everyday day now,
headshots been on my mind
Much like modern warfare
Except it’s real life, 
and It’s my head that I aim at, 
And you wouldn’t even think twice

You’re all caught up in the media, or the newest trending topic
Or your trying to look through insta to see the most recent thot pic

Or your looking at the gossip about that kid in school, and all you do is judge and sit there with your juul
 
You don’t care about anyone and now I’m just saying fuck it
So oblivious to real life, I just got the 9 and I already cocked it

Try to stop me for doing it, from pulling that little trigger,
Show me that your not fake like your tommy hilfigger

All you do is lie
Leading me 
You took my trust and worth
And ripped it all to shreds

I hope that made you happy
I hope I made you proud
I just popped a shot
Now I won’t make a sound

I just wanted your love
My feelings I can not find
My life is feelin short
Just Make it worth my time

Im always contemplating
My mind been filled with satin
My heart been wanting love
But I ain’t got the patience

Please just hold my hand
Please just hold my head
I tryna to call for help
Before I wind up dead

Show me that there’s love
Show me that theres a chance
Show me that there is life
And not among the dead",14Oct2019,2
3,"I'm not even sure how to start this or where to even begin... I feel unwanted or unnoticed. I just left my own families BBQ and I have never felt more like this than ever. My own mom spent more time with my cousins and kept saying how she wanted to spend time with them and made plans, while I sat in the background. I admit that I'm awkward and an introvert but I haven't seen my mom in months. It was like I didnt even exist.

Well, while my cousin and I were leaving, my mom asked my cousin if she could come over tomorrow night. I chirped up and asked if i could come too and my mom just laughed, saying, ""you're like the little kid in the background asking if he can play too."" Hearing that hurt and I'm sitting in my car crying as I write this because I never expected my own mom to say that. I'm hurt and I've been feeling so lonely this week and this just... it's like the final nail on a coffin.

I'm not suicidal, but after tonight, it makes me feel like no one would even care or notice if I just disappeared and left and never came back.

And I only post here because... I dont think my mom even knows how depressed I am or that I'm seeing a therapist. I'm just hurt and I hoped writing this out would make me feel better but... no one even cares. Why would you even care? What's the point? You arent going to read any of this. None of you will...",14Oct2019,1
4,"Hey all

I asked this question a while ago and never got answers but after a while, I’ve found things that work for long hair and depression. Tips below this ramble marked with ***

For context, I am currently a hermit with sibling as my only direct contact, so I don’t brush my hair a lot. I don’t have the energy for it. My hair is at my tailbone, and a little bit thick with thinner hair on top a little. It tangled easily due to having no layers. I haven’t cut it in 5 years. I also have RMD, so I move a lot in my sleep if I’m stressed and get a rats nest on my hair. Solution? 

*** During the night and for a few days, I’ll leave this hairstyle on. I do two braids, one on each side and then gather them together at the back in a ponytail. The braids I do are ones that gather the hair with each new strand, starting at the top of the head. This makes it so you have a braid going down the side of your head and will give you a thinner braid.

This helps prevent bad knots and makes brushing the next day easier. I have left this hairstyle for a few days during major depressive dissociative episodes and I come out not bad, not having terrible utterly painful birds nests to de tangle after all that. It also helps when not showering as it hides yucky hair :(

***during the day, literally ALL I do if I’m not doing the braids, is I use a plastic kids sized butterfly chopstick to hold my hair up. I like it a lot because there’s no elastic, and it’s easier to put up than a bun because of my hair. Somehow it is easier. 

Directions to do this: on any part of the skull, make a ponytail and slightly (or tightly) curl all of it, and put it into a bun. Take the chopstick or pencil or any stick thing and poke it in the MIDDLE and centre part of the side of bun. Make sure to push the stick so the point hits your skull a little. Still touching the skull, push the stick to the side and out the rest of the hair. You can adjust it a little. It works because it’s so quick and you can take it down so so easily. So if I’m depressed suddenly and lie down and my hair is in the way because it was up, I can just take the stick out!

I hope this helps someone.

Oh and always - with long hair, always brush BOTTOM TO TOP! Lay it against yourself and go slow if you have to. Leave conditioner in as long as you can lol",14Oct2019,29
5,"The title speaks for itself.. If you want some context, this weekend, the only close friend i ever had, the only person i trusted with all my heart, the one person to whom i've told about my depression and who helped me throught some of it, well we had a long discussion but in the end he decided that it was for him to leave me, so now im all alone to fight my depression again, as well as my anxiety with my new university and my family which's having trouble too.. Im just, im scared and alone and.. Yeah i could really use some support right now..",14Oct2019,1
6,"(25 f) So after struggling with my mental health since diagnosis six months ago (thought I could handle being on a waiting list and trying to cope myself); I’ve finally gone back to the doctor and was prescribed Sertraline.

Today is my first day taking it and I’m a little apprehensive. 

What if it doesn’t work? What if I just get all the side effects and none of the help?

Has anyone had antidepressants prescribed and how did you feel about taking them? Is it worth it?",14Oct2019,3
7,"So I’m new to this page and reddit so I don’t know a lot but here goes nothing. I’ve suffered from depression for years (27F): had two friends commit suicide in college, struggled to get full time career going after graduating, only been able to get part time retail jobs, living at home with parents and helping take care of another family member with special needs all while struggling to pay off student loans. I haven’t dated anyone since college, I barely see my friends and I’m constantly getting verbally abused by my family about how I’m not successful, how I’m not married yet or how I don’t have kids yet. Every time I try to make a new start for myself aka get info about a masters program, take a test to become a sub teacher, try to get an internship that maybe doesn’t pay but could potentially lead somewhere - my parents shut down my ideas and say that it’s not good enough and after I would feel so awful I would give up and they would call me a quitter. It got to the point where they would pay my bills for me as long as I would do whatever they wanted me to do- be a caretaker for my special needs family memeber, clean this, clean that, do this, do that, etc. I have no motivation to do anything for myself at this point and have started to question what the point of my life is. Randomly my friend reached out to me and offered to move in together around the area she lives which is in a different state. I was extremely hesitant to agree but in the end made my own decision to move because I thought it was time to face reality and give myself the best chance at being ok with who I am. And since I’ve told my parents they’ve yelled at me daily about how I’m only moving to hurt their feelings, how I’m gonna fail, how I’m gonna ruin my life, etc and now instead of seeing this as a positive move I’m starting to panic and feel like maybe Im making yet another mistake. I know I need counseling lol but I don’t have health insurance or enough money to pay for it without. I don’t really know how to feel anymore and I don’t know who to talk to about this. 

TL;DR I’m depressed and my toxic parents control my life- decided to move to a different state to give myself a new chance and my parents yell at me daily that I’m doomed to fail and be alone forever",14Oct2019,3
9,I'm a semi recent graduate from college who landed a kind of good job but no upward momentum can be gained and I just feel like I can't go back to school because my GPA is too low... And the boy I loved for 3 years left me and now ignores me and avoids me.. and I only have one family member left that's my dad and we barely talk. All the friends I have don't want to hang out with me all the guys up try to be interested in me only want me for sex and I just feel pathetic and that nothing really will be gained or accomplished in my lifetime. I don't think anyone except my dad will really miss me... I just wish I was wanted but no one wants me the way I need to be wanted I guess....,14Oct2019,11
10,"People have either moved away (and communicating the pain over the distance is hard), or lost patience, or just don't understand how I can _still_ be like this. I've done the psychiatrist, and the meds and the talking and the activation. And objectively I'm better. I'm not crying all the time. But I don't know whether that's just cause I've accepted this as a normal level of pain. Or it's just this overwhelming apathy and hopelessness. I think about suicide. Not seriously and not to act on it but sometimes wishing it were an option. I think about self harm so some of that pain could transfer out but my logical brain tells me why they doesn't make sense but I still sometimes want to. I just feel so lost. I need help but I don't know where to get it anymore. And even when I'm clear about my needs and not wanting to do something because it doesn't bring me joy, my parents tell me to stick with it.",14Oct2019,3
12,"so ive never really used reddit for this stuff and honestly it was my ex fiance that was the redditer but i am slowly falling from situational depression to actual panic.  the day after my 33rd birthday my fiance of over two years decided to leave me to move in with a guy big on darknet drug forums since we were having trouble moving from the california mountains back to a city.  I have toxic spore and a bad cough that i got from the apt i'm  moving from tomorrow and my liver isnt doing great from the opiates i got off around 6 months ago as i moved into the mountains.  My fiance started having panic attacks and in an attempt to move back faster she convinced me to rehome our dog.  two weeks and hundreds of application dolars later she freaked not being able to get a place cause badish credit and her home made porn income being ""unverifiable""  she left me on the mt taking all her things in a truck.   So ive been packing up to move back into my parents house for the first time in a decade as a 30 year old man who now has to find someone to take my cat too since my parents are alergic and i cant afford a place by myself in the city till i get a new job and recover from this cough.  i cant deal with going from a bed with another warm body and a large dog to just alone... i had to cancel a flight we had planned for yesterday across the country and if i need to give up my cat too i may just end up back on fucking opiates cause i cant start completely from scratch after 6 years of systematically fixing up my life.  i dont know if anyone will even bother with this long post. ive definitely found it hard to find friends to talk with this about since i sort of lost contact when me and my ex fiance moved up here to finally quit methadone and six months later im leaving in a worse state than when i came up.  i miss my dog so much she was such a good girl and for my ex to talk me into giving her up for her mental health to just leave less than two weeks later was the biggest F U of my adult life.",14Oct2019,1
13,"So I’m a 20 y.o. F who’s currently on her sophomore year in college. 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. 
Since then I’ve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. 
Since starting school I’ve realized I’ve become incredibly isolated. The only time I’ll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I won’t have a conversation with anyone.  Even my parents don’t talk to me everyday. 
I’ve joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? 
My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that I’m training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies don’t care if you have depression - they need to be trained. 
I’ve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly don’t see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. 
I just don’t know how I’m supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on- just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? 
I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals- how did you survive?",14Oct2019,49
14,"I'm a 29 year old man, doing well for myself working in IT, and I don't know what there is for me to live for any more. Not any risk of self harm, just that there's nothing I look forward to any more and I have no idea how to get that spark back.

&amp;#x200B;

I throw myself at my work because it occupies me and makes me feel active, like I'm doing something. This inevitably leads to stress and burn out, and I can feel it coming up again.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't deal with ""tough love"" and ""take ownership"" type motivators, they do nothing for me. I've visited multiple psychologists, and while they are nice to talk to it rarely feels like it impacts me going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm post-nihilistic – there doesn't have to be any inherent meaning or purpose for me to still experience joy, but nothing draws me to it. Any kind of socialising can be nice but it feels like a simple distraction that gets replaced with darker thought patterns almost immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm smart and I'm strong willed, I know I can take steps to get out but I just have no idea what they are and everything I try and research online is new-age woo or some ex-marine telling me I just need to do push ups until I don't feel sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done exercise, sleep, diet – they help but they don't stop the black dog. I'm just so tired, sometimes I can cry but for weeks now it's just felt like I'm numb, like there's nothing.",14Oct2019,1
15,"I have my own history of depression and severe anxiety, and i've found my ways to cope and take each day one step at a time when i'm having really low periods, but in general I'm in a really good place lately. Perhaps because i've become more religious, and i'm starting to see more big and positive changes occur in my life and personality, is why it's a little easier for me. I'm an INFJ personality type, and a Highly Sensitive Person. I have always empathized easily with people.

&amp;#x200B;

but recently i've found that i'm becoming the emotional sponge for several of my friends, who are all having  their own crisis. From stress about school, family problems, integrating with society and social pressures, and one important thing - we're all foreigners in a country that heavily stigmatizes and ignores mental health issues. Getting professional help is possible but it's ridiculously expensive, and the quality is poor. Previously I myself had attempted to get therapy and was literally slut-shamed and victim-blamed by my therapist when i opened up to him about being raped several years ago. It was an even more traumatizing experience realizing that the people who are supposed to be there to help you are not, and no one gives a damn. We live in a country that doesn't support mental health awareness or education, and even people who are just end up getting oppressed and overlooked. On top of that we are foreigners, outsiders, and struggle to integrate into society enough as it is. We deal with racial prejudice and social prejudice and language and cultural barriers on top of everything else that the locals have to deal with too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've somewhat made my peace with it, but now i'm trying to help my friends. I'm no professional, i use what i have learned for myself as advice and just maintain an ear for listening and keeping my heart open to them. Helping one friend who is done with life and having a lot of stress and sadness is a huge undertaking, but now it's like 4 of them. And two of them are having situations that are related to the other! It's a mess and I don't know what to do, but I don't like the idea of ignoring them or not giving them the attention and help they really need when i know others aren't able to do it, just for protecting myself.",14Oct2019,1
16,"I'm happy for everything that I've done in life.
I've had everything that I wanted in life.
Always  been surrounded by beautiful people who actually gave a fuck about me and I'm grateful for everyone of you.
But once I fell into the hell of depression all I could see was people laughing and making fun of it.
Suffered from loneliness  the worst fuckin thing to happen anyone... 
I couldn't  believe they were the same people that I've been with all these years. I  felt completely isolated . I wanted to end it there but my will to live on, kept me going.
 I recovered and kept going on in life.
 But by the time I could get back...life was a fuckin mess again 
 Depression had made friends with anxiety and over thinking....

 I would have flash backs or some kinda trauma about everything and would over think about everything....
 Anxiety panic attacks became a thing I could feel my chest getting all hot. I'm unable to breath or talk. My face turns red. I wanted to die 
 I would go to sleep everyday in tears and sadness that I've to go through all this another day...
 When I reached out for help there was no one. 
May be it was my mistake, just may be I reached out to the wrong people . 
I was lost depressed and full of suicidal thoughts that were very severe but I kept on moving in life but failed to keep going on forever.....
This is to say I'm not pointing at anyone in particular  this is what I felt from within and it was not good at all. 

From the most positive person in life , I completely changed....
I had become a maniac my sleep patterns were all fucked , slept for less than 2 hours a day. Had become  socially isolated  barely spoke to anyone.
Over thinking had fucked me up so much that Couldn't differentiate from reality.  It was severe and I was scared.  started to feel I was losing all of it
I did not like who I was becoming and I couldn't ask for help either it all played down to one thing and that is to end it all and I'll do it and hopefully I'm successful in this atleast..
Thank you everyone  for everything ❤ I'll always be grateful for all your help...
For all those who always asked why I never spoke much these last few months. These were the things I was going through....and i couldn't talk...
To say the truth no one knows the ultimate truth and I'd like to take it to the grave... 

I know suicide is not the answer for this but I don't see another way out either....
Typing this in tears thank you all so much and always smile 
Take care of your mental health it is important  
Thank you.",14Oct2019,1

18,"Hello there readers i'd like to firstly thank you for reading my first post (ever! Please go easy on me) 

I am a 24 y/o male from the UK. My depression has been with me ever since I could remember and I feel that this is the right time to tell my story. 

I grew up in an Asian household with both my parents and my sibling. For as long as I could remember I always had the feeling that I wasnt good enough for my family and for this world, i was somewhat abused physically and somewhat verbally and emotionally by my mother at a very young age  (i would like to add that while i dont condone her behaviour i found my closure with this that I will explain a little later so bare with me aha) as a result i started to think of myself less and less and would constantly put myself down as well as paint myself as this grotesque creature that was not fit enough to be part of this world. I would have panic attacks daily and constantly cry everyday praying for god to just take me away. 

My feelings started to grow worst as i joined secondary school (i was around 11/12 years old at this stage). I was constantly bullied in school due to my ethnicity and faith, the teachers would do nothing about it and as a result my grades started to decline. As my grades declined the more my parents expected me to work harder and harder, i would spend countless hours trying to study and revise nearly everything but my anxiety kept holding me back. By the age of 16 i had sat my GCSE'S (these are exams that allow you to continue onto higher education) i failed pretty hard, returning home after results day was one of the worst things i'd ever experience and while it hurts to write this out its best that i do this. I remember walking into my house and being told immediately to go to my room, my mother came up and started to berate me calling me stupid, not a man, that i'll never amount to anything in my life etc etc. I took a hard beating that day from her and she just left me to my devices. My father walks in and i was kind of hoping he would console me in some way, i was desperate and was willing to take anything that i could hang onto to keep my sanity... it never came instead i was taking round 2 of a verbal beat down the only words that i was left to hold on to was ""you're a dissapointment and you've brought shame to youself and this family"". 

The next few months was tough i spent a long time trying to build myself up from an emotional and mental level. I got enough courage to phone the college I wanted to go and explained my situation and for the first time in months i was given some form of light, they agreed that i could attend the college on the condition that I would resit my GCSE'S and if i passed i would be able to continue onto my A-levels. I was ecstatic couldnt get over it i was going to go the college I wanted to and be able to prove everyone wrong about me (i want to add that i was fortunate enough to go to college with my best friends who consoled me and helped me build myself) 
About half way through my course i met this girl and we clicked instantly (she was my first love) and not long after we began dating. At this point i'd let the past go and just kept to myself. Now i want to warn anyone here reading this that this next part is what set my depression into over drive mode as this involved sexual violence.

About 2 years into the relationship she had gone off to university to study and while i was nervous i was confident i could handle it and to an extent i did until that day came. It was a Saturday morning at around 10am late Sept. I was working at this carehome and I wasn't feeling all that great as I had a huge argument with my then girlfriend. I get a text saying she needed to tell me something, me being me i thought its probably nothing serious and that worst case scenario we break up. I text her back asking her if she was alright and she tells me that something happened last night....she was attacked. I quickly run upstairs into the staff room and call her to see if she's okay. Turns out she was raped on her way back to her uni flat. I died right there. Hearing those words i didnt know what to do i was only 18 at the time, i phoned my mother and tell her whats happened and i go home immediately. Everyone (my parents divorced at this point) is at home and without my knowledge my mother tells them my situation. Thankfully my Uncle was there to console me through this but it wasnt enough to get my mind out of it. I bought a trainticket as soon as i could so i could see her. She cried a lot that night, i held her tight and kept silent i didnt know what to say all i knew is that she needed me and I needed to do what I could to make her smile again, to try and help her and make sure she was okay. I completely neglected myself, i recieved counselling from my college but couldnt go to it anymore because it was too painful to keep talking about it. I pushed it all down outta sight outta mind. We tried to keep the relationship going but ultimately we couldnt make it work it was too difficult for her to keep it up and i guess she needed to let me go to heal properly.  I fell into a deep depression. 

All of this was coming right as i started university so the timing was off. It was weird because it felt like everything i pushed far into the back of my mind had finally exploded and it all came out. I'd reverted to my former self, constantly crying and being on edge. I ended up dating another girl while attending law school and things were good at first but then it started to go off the rails. I was financially abused out of all my savings because it was my responsibility to make sure she was okau, i was expected to do all these crazy things until finally i broke down crying infront of my new girlfriend telling her that im not okay im constantly in pain and i cant get out. It was at this point i'd lost all hope for myself after she uttered these words.....""just man up its not that bad"". It felt like everything now was just shit to tell you the truth. I was living with a bunch of guys who claimed to be my friend but would constantly have people coming over to the house doing various drugs and my girlfriend just didnt care if i was okay or not, her needs needed to be met. 

Now heres the light at the end of the tunnel. It was around Christmas time 2016 and i'd bumped into my old best friend from college and school we started talking and he said we should get the group back together, it was perfect i hadnt seen them in over 5 years i was excited. We all met up at a friends house and started to talk and joke around like nothing changed. Then they asked me how i was doing and i guess this was the moment i needed to just get things off my chest and i felt safe around them. I told them everything from my parents splitting up, to the rape to the housemates to the toxic girlfriend. 
Immediately i was surrounded by love and hugs and they got so mad at my then toxic girlfriend that they gave me confidence to leave her so i did. Everything felt like it was going up in the world. Until i relapsed.

In 2017 i had gone out with my best friend from uni with her boyfriend for an open mic (i love music and playing its one of the only things that helps me through) i had a few to drink that night and when it was finally time to go home all my feelings came back. I felt like a failure i felt like i didn't belong to this world, i had let my girlfriend (girl from college) down when i was meant to protect her. I finally had enough left the house without my keys and climbed ontop of a railway bridge looking down into what i could describe as a bottomless pit. I was close to giving in to my insecurities until i said i couldnt let everyone who loved me down. With blood still trickling down my wrist i asked my house mate to phone an ambulance cause i needed to go and see someone right now. I wont bore you with the details of what happened next but essentially i was in A&amp;E for the majority of the night and no one saw me. But in that time i started to think deeply and more introspectivly. Is this how i wanted to be? Constantly on the edge of my seat and constantly putting myself down? No. 

Its been 2 years since that all happened. I still think back to it as a motivater. My ex girlfriend who is still my friend helped me through this experience so much by advising me to turn to my faith for guidance and it works. Im not overly religious but it helps knowing that theres something there when i feel alone. Im still at university studying law and im still making improvements. I still have my days where i cry and I have my days being happy and excited. I try and keep my head held up and stay out of the house if i can and do something productive even if its just walking in the woods in the middle of December. Im not out of the woods but im getting there, as an example right now as i write this long post i am going through the dark side of my depression where i feel worthless but i refuse to give in cause there is so much love out here and i dont wanna miss it.

Thank you for reading and if you have any questions please feel free to ask! One of the things i found in my road to healing is that its okay to talk about experiences even if they hurt and if you dont wanna talk about it thats fine too! 

Again i'd like to thank everyone for reading this was a tough one for me personally and i appreciate the time and effort in you the reader in reading this. Until next time friends

20,"I'm 20 years old and I've been depressed for the most part of my teen life. Since I was 15 probably. I have been having very bad thoughts about hurting myself and blowing my brains off for some time now. I cry myself to sleep every so often and I also get panic attacks. I've been like this for so long and I'm trying to seek help. I've tried talking to my friends, family, and even a therapist but I can't feel better. Friends don't really have time to listen, my family don't understand and the therapist couldn't really help me. I've been feeling miserable for so long and I don't want to feel that anymore. 

I used to get bullied in school, my dad used to come home drunk and he and my mom would fight every night for as long as I can remember. I don't want to seem like I'm begging for attention. People have it far worse than I do but I really want to feel better. 

My dad passed away 2 years ago and I haven't gotten over that. I quit jobs after a month or so. I can't sleep at night. I smoke a lot of weed to feel better but that doesn't help me in the long run.


I just hope that someone would reach out to me because I've tried everything else.",14Oct2019,4
21,"I have been battling with my depression for at least eight years now. I have been on meds and trying new types/doses and I will feel a bit better for a month or so. After about a month, I will go back to feeling awful and suicidal. I do weekly therapy sessions to counteract this. I eat a healthy diet and do what I need to be doing to try to feel better but I don’t think I am going to be able to. 

I have been suicidal for years now, going through phases of severity. I’ve only attempted in middle school. Right now, it’s more of a desire than an urge. I have dreams about different ways to do it and I have briefly researched into it. I don’t think I will actually do it, though. 

I’m contemplating signing myself in to a mental health center but I do not want it to interfere with my studies. I am supposed to start nursing school next semester. 

What do I do?",14Oct2019,1
23,"i have been feeling suicidal lately, everything i do makes people angry. and i can’t control my temper lately. i feel like everything is my fault and that i’m constantly screwing up. my apologies feel worthless and i feel i’m losing the people important to me. it hurts every day and i don’t know what to do. please help",14Oct2019,1
24,"So, basically my story is that when I was born my mom abandoned me in hospital, she was a drug user and despite her many attempts to abort me she failed and was 'forced' to have me. She didn't even wait, or anything, she had me left hospital and never came back. I was told later on in life that she actually died of a cocaine overdose. 

My dad was not much different. He was also a drug user, alcoholic and extremely violent person. He denied my existence from the moment I was born, but was 'nice enough' to document me as his son. The nurses in the hospital might've noticed that a baby was there by itself and once they indentified me they called my dad's mom and told her to come pick me up because they couldn't leave a baby in hospital by themselves. 

Reluctantly my grandmother took me and was forced to adopt me as her son, because without adoption papers she basically couldn't take me to hospitals, schools, etc... 

Sounds like a happy ending, but no. Unfortuantely she was bipolar and throughout my whole life she reminded me of how much I was not welcome into the family. To start with my mom is half-black and that was a big no-no for her, she called me names, said that I had n\*\*\*er in my blood and often diminished my accomplishments because apparently 'I belonged in jail'. To pile up with her bullying, 2 of my dad's half sisters (half-aunts (?)) lived there too and they were even worse! Believe me, they have said and done things to me that I can not accept to this day. 

I basically had to raise myself through the bulying at home and school. I ran away from home when I was 14, my dad died and the bullying at home became worse than ever, I lived at friend's houses, cheap hotels in sketchy parts of town, etc. When I finally turned 16 I started working at a bank and made quite a bit of money. I moved away to another country at the age of 19 and started a new life. New name, new nationality, new everything!! 

My life is much better than it used to be, of course. But lately I have missed an important aspect of being human. Affection. 

Sounds cheesy I know, but sometimes when I'm struggling I wish I could have someone I trust to call and talk. A dad, who could go out for a meal in a Sunday afternoon. A brother, to take care and give advice when needed, etc... I want a background of which I can be proud of, rely on and fall back when needed. 

I sometimes think that maybe I wasn't supposed to be born in the first place and that all that happened to me is my fault and I should just end it all, without even look back. Someone like me, without a family, without a proper structure, is not supposed to even be here.

Lately I have thought a lot about suicide, unfortunately I have no one I can talk to about that. Hence I'm here. Struggling to put a sentence together because I don't really know what I want to achieve by posting this.",14Oct2019,2
25,"As the title says, my problem is that I sometimes develop a feeling of emptiness, a sort of void that can last for months. I can't enjoy food, games, art or anything else. I don't have medical insurance so I can't just get help, and my family is not very supportive. My mother is especially unsupportive (she has a mental disorder on the opposite side of the spectrum, so she can't relate to my problem). I used to take quetiapine and sertraline, I don't know if it helped or not. Even after the episode is over, my anxiety keeps me from enjoying things for some time after. Just a few days ago I was ok, today I wake up and I know it's back. Any advice?",14Oct2019,6

28,"I cant stop thinking about either blowing my head off or crashing my car into traffic. I don’t think I’ll actually do it since i have have think of my family dealing with it but i can’t get these thoughts out of my head, they won’t go away it’s literally 24hrs a day , the anxiety is crippling, i feel alone and unwanted &amp; i try to hard to be normal but sometimes i break and people reject me. I have to always pretend to be strong for my family since they rely on me so much but it hurts to feel this way all the time",14Oct2019,90
29,"God, I hate myself. I don’t know how to get over this. And the worst part is at one point she even asked me if it was ok that we were just talking about her, and I said it was. WHY DO I DO THIS. Now the conversation is over and I still haven’t talked to anyone, even though I went through all the stress of amping myself up to reaching out. Whyyyyyyy. Just wanted to vent. Anyone else here struggle with asking for help? That’s been one of my main issues I need to work through. How do people do it???",14Oct2019,1
30,"So I made this account on impulse because I don’t know what to do anymore. I apologize for the length of the post you are about to read. I am a 20 year old woman who has suffered from major depressive disorder and anxiety since the ripe old age of 11. I started attending therapy for these problems several months ago but haven’t felt much along the lines of improvement. I began to suffer academically around the time I started middle school, and have since not been able to keep my grades up, be it at my high school, or at the college I’m currently attending. At 13, I lost my childhood home to natural disaster and have subsequently faced a multitude of losses since the incident. At 15 my brother in law committed suicide, and the year just after that my best friend died of leukemia. I understand that life goes on, I do, but I still seem to be facing the emotional repercussions of everything. My mother got sick the first semester of my sophomore year of college, which ultimately ended up with me failing a majority of my classes and, long story short, racking up about $11k in debt because my student advisor didn’t really know what the fuck she was doing. Currently, I’m taking the semester off to work off this debt. I’m working at a fast food place which doesn’t seem to be helping my mental health so much, and I’ve only been working there a little over a month. I just feel as though I am deteriorating at a rate which I can’t control, that I’ll never be successful in life, and that I’ll be stuck in this proletariat lifestyle, living paycheck to paycheck and never amounting to anything. I have to pay about $1k a month to pay off last semesters bill if I want to go back before January, and I also have a $300 pair of glasses that I can’t afford either. I am terrified that when I go to school, I will be a failure again. Im tired of hearing “you’re an adult, this is just life.” I need help. I have such bad social anxiety that most of the interactions I have with my coworkers are awkward and I end up beating myself up over every single one of them. My boyfriend lives an hour and 40 minutes away from me and I haven’t seen him in over a month since I started working. 
As you can see, I just have a lot of bullshit I need to work out. And I’m sorry, again, for writing such a long post, but I’m at my wits end and I just don’t know who to go to anymore. I just want to feel better about myself and about the life I’m living. If you take the time out of your day to read this entire post, then you are a truly blessed person.",14Oct2019,1
31,I feel like I'm in a dark hole. I can see light at the top and my family. I try to talk but they don't listen. All I need is one person to throw me a rope to help me climb out. However not one. The hole seems to be getting smaller and yet the top is fading away...I think about death now more than ever before. ..,14Oct2019,2
32," I have no desire to be depressed, but I can't stop myself. It hurts when you're incapable of making friends and being a likable person. I should really stop acting before thinking because it can hurt people and then it puts me in a difficult situation. It makes me feel guilty and I can't do anything to fix it. Because of that, my reason for living and socializing disappears, but I have to bear with it because I don't want to make it worse. If I make it worse, I'll be even more depressed and people will start to dislike me before they even meet me. It hurts when I can't be normal emotionally because I always get misunderstood and people can't relate to me, which then causes them to dislike me or get bored of me. When that happens, they'll most likely leave me. Even when people online don't know me, they never stick with me in the end. I try to make good impressions when meeting people, but it never works out for me. It's always frustrating when I watch people socialize so easily and not making embarrassing mistakes. I envy people that have always stuck with their childhood friends. I had no conscience back when I was younger. I'm not a likable person, whether I'm nice or not. I can't function how I want to around others. I always feel more comfortable alone where no one can judge me and I can let my guard down. I can't ever trust anyone, not a single human being, completely. I can't open up to anyone and I always lie to be likable, even when I know for a fact that I can't back myself up. I always think of what would make people like me instead of showing them who I truly am, which is sort of like putting up a mask. Even when I'm talking to a best friend, I always have that fear that I will be judged. I can't say anything positive about myself and I can't stand up for myself.(edited)always regret every single thing I do, no matter what it is, in the future. I hate remembering past events because I can never understand why I do things, so that always makes me question why I'm even alive.I always regret things either because I always overthink, even when something has already happened, or I acted before thinking.In a way, I still haven't really developed a conscience, so being alive is always frustrating for me.I can't give up my pride and it's never beneficial.(edited)I hate acting before thinking, but I can't control it.I always act positive around people so they would also be positive.But it's all just for show.And in a way, I'm lying to myself by doing that, too.I say that you should focus on the things you can do instead of the things you can't do, but here I am, contradicting my words like I never said them.To me, it feels like no matter what I do, people will never be impacted by it, but I still try anyways.The impact is always short lived, but I still give advice contradicting my whole personality, hoping I would be able to help when I can't even help myself.As I'm typing this, it's driving me into even deeper depression because I'm basically listing everything I'm doing wrong.I can only watch people improve their own lives with my advice as I use their happiness as a source of my own instead of following that advice. I envy people who actually try. They're desperate to be saved, but I have no passion to save myself.I find happiness in helping others. I can't find a reason to trust myself and enjoy what life gives me.I can only picture what my ideal self is and use that as a template to think of useless advice. The advice only caters to others that aren't me which is why it is useless.I hate people, but I can't help it when seeing them happy makes me happy.",14Oct2019,1
