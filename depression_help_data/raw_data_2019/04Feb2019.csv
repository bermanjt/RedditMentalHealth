2,"Just too much to say that I don’t know if I can.  Let’s start here.

A little over a year ago, I held a knife to my chest.  I didn’t go through with it, but it felt... surreal.  I revealed it to some really amazing friends later in the year (all of which were seniors at the time and I was a freshman but am now a sophomore), and I told my mom that same day.  She started looking for therapy, but I went throughout the entire summer without any sign of a therapy session.  I held the same knife to my chest again, and this time I got closer.  I didn’t do it, and I ended up getting therapy.  Absolutely love my therapist, but in the four or five sessions that I went through, I never fully opened up even though I thought I did.  It’s been months since my last session, and I have too much to say.

My mind works in phases, and these phases shift in a split second with no warning.  All it takes is a thought, maybe even one that doesn’t make sense, and I go from pretty happy to hopeless.  My depression episodes are never fully about people hating me, because I know people do love me.  It’s usually about life and how I feel trapped.  Sometimes I can barely breath because I feel all of the physical matter surrounding me is closing in.  I feel suffocated.  When I’m alone, I sometimes think about killing myself.  Life doesn’t matter, so who cares how it affects my parents? I make plans to jump off of a building or lay out into the freezing cold or even concuss myself because the happiest I was recently was when I had a mild concussion and my brain didn’t over-analyze everything.

It varies.  Sometimes I’m really fucking happy.  I’m trying to live in the moment and I’m not taking life seriously.  But then I just think a single thought that is usually so indescribable that I can’t even begin to talk about it, and I’m hopeless.

I held a knife to my chest again this past week.  I was bawling and finishing the dishes and didn’t understand what anything was.  I was blinded, and I know I’ll be blinded again.

I don’t know what to do.  I want to talk to people about it, but my best friends are off in college and my present friends, though really awesome, just aren’t the same.  I know that I shouldn’t kill myself.  I don’t want to die.  But it’s an attractive option sometimes.  I need help.",04Feb2019,1

5,"Long time lurker (YEARS!) first time poster. 28yoF

I'm an actor in NYC. My parents are paying my rent because I can't figure my life out, and they're by no means rich. I don't go to auditions anymore -- I don't go anywhere. I stay in my apartment, except when I walk the dog (he's a foster and I'm about to not have him around anymore because he found a family, which is exciting for him and terrifying for me). Having a dog has really helped my depression. I can't afford a dog on my own right now, which is why fostering with my two roommates was so appealing.

I have a psychologist, I'm on medication, and I'm waiting to see my psychiatrist so I can change my meds -- earliest appointment is in three weeks. My depression hasn't been this bad in seven years. The worst thing about depression is that it makes me not want to do ANYTHING. I shower once a week. I sleep all day until my head hurts, and then I sleep some more. I've gained 30 pounds since graduating from college six years ago -- fifteen in the last four months. I keep wanting to post on my social media accounts, ""Hey! I'm severely depressed!"" but don't,  because I hate when other people do so -- it seems only for attention. I'm not suicidal, never have been (thank god). I just.. exist. I keep hoping for a magical change, like a haircut (didn't work), or not eating out and cooking for myself (broke that in a week), or buying clothes so I feel better about myself (I don't). I'm just.. existing. Life is passing me by and that makes me sad. 

I don't tell my friends how bad it really is because I don't want to scare them. I'M scared. I just want to feel like myself again.",04Feb2019,1
6,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I've followed this subreddit for about as long as I've been on Reddit. Depression has been a huge problem in my life since I was 11 years old. As a teenager, I was very suicidal, and cut myself on a daily basis as a means of punishing myself. I grew up inside of an abusive household, with a truly insane, monster of a mother who cracked something inside of me that has yet to become full again, despite having moved out of her house eleven years ago. Over the past two years, my depression has become so bad that I feel like its swallowing me up--like I am no longer controlling my life, but it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago as of May, I broke my foot. I had been having health problems with my sinuses before then, and I had just figured out how NOT to get back-to-back sinus infections with the help of a team of doctors. I thought my life was finally going to be orderly again. The intense sinus headaches were a constant hurdle in my life. For me, exercise has become the way I deal with depression as an adult. The headaches had made it harder to find relief in my work out. After breaking my foot, I discovered I had an extra bone in my foot and developed a very bad case of tendinitis. My doctor turned his back on me after I had done everything he wanted me to do, yet I was still experiencing life-changing pains in my leg. Well, a month after I was allowed to get back into a work out regiment, I broke my other foot. Instantly, the same issues occurred: tendinitis and so much pain. In 2018, I couldn't afford to throw money at the problem (I live in the US and my insurance wasn't great). I lived with it. I lived with this crippling pain, and inability to work out and achieve any mental relief. The depression got worse, as did my anxiety. Suicidal thoughts became a daily occurrence. There's nothing like feeling totally useless and broken. I developed stomach problems due to the immense stress I was in.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to 2019--I  have better insurance and the money to ""fix"" me. At this point, my mental health is trash. I'm horribly depressed in a way I haven't been since I was a teenager with the constant abuse of my family. I'm trying to fix all my problems--stomach, feet, and my mental health. Between physical therapy and other doctors appointments, I am going somewhere nearly every other work day this month. It's intensely daunting, especially because surgery is a high possibility with the problems regarding my extra bone. At this point, I'm scared. I'm scared I can't power myself through recovering from a surgery like that. I'm afraid my ability to walk will be further effected in a bad way. I have a family--a husband who loves me, children, and even some furry folk. I'm doing everything I can for them, and I know I'd never kill myself, yet it doesn't stop the thoughts from occurring especially at this point. I guess I wrote this post because I needed to get it out. I'm in a lot of pain. I finally scheduled a psychologist appointment for next week. I've seen three psychologists throughout my life, and each was an epic failure. It became a situation where I was helping them with their problems. Right now, I'm drowning and I need help.

9,"Well...my friend referred me to Reddit because she said it was a place i can speak my mind freely. 

Right now, i'm trying to survive. There is a constant cloud flying above my head. I wish that I could explain it in a non-cliche type of way but, I can't. I suffer from PTSD, Bi-Polar 1, paranoia, and SEVERE depression. I recently quit speaking to my alcoholic, drug addicted, and GOD AWFUL mother. I'm trying to cope and it's not working. I wish I was dead. I can't stop blacking out and it is almost always violent. I have two jobs. I'm working so much to try to stop thinking about all the bad things, but I feel like it's just making everything worse. I have talked to my therapist and my psychiatrist but they haven't helped. I have told my friends something but not everything. I sit in my room at night and re-live ALL traumatic incidences and just cry. This all sounds pitiful but i promise i'm the farthest from it. I'm not supposed to be working but I CANNOT just sit there and not have a job. I have a car payment and other bills to worry about. I don't know what i'm doing anymore and, honestly, I feel like my days are numbered. I don't have the balls to kill myself in my right mind but I got really close to badly hurting myself the other night while i was blacked out. I can't tell my friends because it will worry them too much. If ANYONE can provide insight or advise that'd be great. Thanks-Elizabeth",04Feb2019,1
10,"I moved away to college last semester, and it helped so much. Before that, I was crazy anxious and depressed, but moving was perfect. Until this semester.
My roommate is really my only friend that I interact with at all (I have two more, but talking to them takes up so much energy and gives me so much anxiety), which is the way that I want it to be. I really don't want friends, or to bond with anyone, but it means that I've been spending most of my time in my dorm. This is also my ideal lifestyle, but it doesn't seem healthy.
Anyway, the weeks have been torture. There is nothing to look forward to because my weeks are stressful, hard, and have me constantly on the verge of a breakdown, and the weekends are time for me to be super depressed without interference. I've been pushing myself to do things (go out, join clubs, go to activities), but I hate every second of these things.
I don't know what I'm asking for necessarily, but I don't know what to do. Nothing is right and all I want is to be happy again.",04Feb2019,1
12,"   I’ve been dealing with depression for a very long time now. About five years which seems like a lot, especially considering that I am only fifteen and a half. I’ve always had a fiery passion of hate towards my family. It started with them being annoying all the time. Eventually they started being mean, constantly saying mean things to my face and behind my back. I’ve tried to confront them about my depression and they never seemed to care.

One day I was feeling really bad. I’d been contemplating suicide for a couple weeks prior. I didn’t know what I could do to kill myself besides use this big sharp knife that was my dad’s. I previously took it so I could cut myself, leaving reminders to myself about how bad I felt about life. I had a best friend that I told everything. She was the only person who had ever made me feel better. The only person that made it easier to wake up in the morning. The only person I looked forward to talking to throughout my day. In one sentence, she was the best person in my life at that time. We gained feelings for each other. We were going to get intimate, but my parents took my phone and read all of my text messages. They saw my messages to her when I said I bought the condoms. Because of this they got angry at me, punished me by taking my phone and they called her themselves and my step-mom said a bunch of rude things to her. She told me about how she didn’t care about me and all that. But I knew it wasn’t true. My parents drove us apart, once again leaving me by myself as I had always been for years prior. I was once again alone. This only increased my hate for my parents. Some time later I tried to confront them about my depression again. They responded with telling me that all of my problems were my fault. Once again, increasing my hatred for them. When I tried to kill myself I attempted to cut into my left arm deep enough so I would lose a lot of blood and die. I tried so many times but I couldn’t push myself to do it. Whenever I cut too deep, my arm would start getting a spasm-like feeling and I would lose my grip. It was like a temporary paralysing. My parents found out about me trying to kill myself and they kept yelling at me, claiming all my problems were high school bullshit. My father hit me several times and ever since I’ve been scared he would hit me again. Sometimes he gets really aggressive and it scares me. They also took my phone and the next day I had to apologise for attempting to kill myself. 

You’re probably wondering why I am so depressed. Well, in short... I’m really lonely, have no friends that I can talk to, I have had bullying problems forever, I lost my best friend, my family is extremely mean to me and I don’t feel like I am a part of this family, sexual abuse and a lot more. In terms of family, we are dysfunctional. Much of my family is out of the picture and I have been dealing with women coming in and out of my life because of my father’s inconsistency with dating. I’ve moved around a lot, we’re poor.

I just don’t understand why I am being punished for trying to kill myself...",04Feb2019,1
13,"So I spoke with a psychologist today who recommended groups to share my story with for support and advice but I feel too embarrassed to talk about it in front of people so figured reddit was the next best thing.

To start with I was about 10 years old give or take a year or two not quite sure. My dad dropped me off at one of his freinds houses and didn't really say goodbye or anything like that I remember. But this was quite some time ago. Im 26 now. My dads friend was always strange when I was there other times and for some reason my brother and sister weren't allowed to come. He would sit me in front of his computer and make me read wikipedia pages about Buddha but only a couple senetnces and then tell me to stop and remember that and say buddha didn't talk and that I'm buddha. He would also practice hypnotism on me and blind fold me and spin me around trying to disorient me. Basically messing with my head in a whole bunch of different ways. Back to when my dad dropped me off there this last time. He gave me a glass of coke and said it's a special relax potion. It had been drugged and all i just remember being all floaty as kind of like valium. He then raped me and I blacked out. I woke up hanging from my neck in pitch darkness in the roof of the house and started trying to move as much as I could but couldn't much. i remember my head feeling like it was going to burst and not being able to breath much but grabbed a rafter or something and somehow got free. I ended up falling through the roof and getting up and ran as fast as I could to my friends house and told his dad that I had been hurt but wouldn't tell him how. I eventually got taken home later that night once I had calmed down where my mum was in tears because my dad was moving out with another woman so she barely noticed I had a bruise around my neck. I never spoke to him again for at least 10 years. When I spoke to him again I asked him if he remembered the day he dropped me off at his friends house to which he told me he didn't have friends back then. Which I thought was weird because he had taken me to this guys house several times. I asked my friends dad if he remembered the day I came running and crying to his house and he said yes it looked like you had been close lined by something on your neck but refused to talk. So that's the main part of where a lot of my issues come from. I've dealt with PTSD a while after all off this as a kid. I've dealt with depression most of my life after this where one time I spent basically an entire year not leaving my bed. I've tried to kill myself once but failed and made my own mother have to find me passed out on the floor covered in my blood.
Today I spoke with a psychologist who says I've been hiding from all of this and trying to pretend it never happened and need to accept that it happened and work on moving on. I've never talked about this in detail with anyone except for the psych today and right now am feeling like my head is going to explode or I'm just going to pass out. If anyone has advice on how I can possibly deal with this outside of my psychologist who I'm only going to be seeing once a week for 1-2 hours it would help so much right now. And thank you all in advance",04Feb2019,1
14,"So my girlfriend had some of her nudes leaked 2 years ago and over time it’s just completely ruined her life. (both 16 right now) but it has slowly eaten away at her for years now of people calling her a whore, a slut, and so many other horrible things. People have been claiming to have fucked her and showing everyone her nudes to “prove it” and it has completely destroyed her self esteem and her confidence. Over time more and more people stopped talking to her and stopped wanting to be associated with her because of all the nudes and all of the hate towards her, even though pretty much every girl has sent nudes, the only difference is hers got leaked. At this point i’m the only person she talks to because she just stopped talking to her best friend of 3 years because her friend tried to break us up by trying to convince her to fuck one of my best friends. Now i’m the only person she talks to at all and she’s going through all of these awful things that a 16 year old shouldn’t be going through. She does have a form of bipolar or depression that runs in her family, i’m not sure what because she never will tell me exactly what but i know she has medicine for it. I was talking to her a couple weeks ago and she started talking about suicide and i immediately texted her parents about it. I helped her get through that really dark patch but now i was talking to her again tonight and she said that i’m “the only reason she’s still here” and i don’t know what to do. I know if i break up with her she’ll have nobody and most likely end it, but if i stay with her i can maybe and hopefully help make her happy again. She just keeps talking about how her life is such shit and there’s no point. Yes she does have a therapist she talks to but it never helps her and i’m really stuck at this point. ",04Feb2019,1
18,"Ok, so I don't know how to put it, but here goes a short history of my rise and fall.

I used to be bullied during middle school, and pressured at home. This happened for two years, and it was a dark place. Then I entered into high school, and met her. She was a lovely girl that showed me kindness after I was shattered to dust. She made me feel like I was worth something, that someone cared for me. It was because of this kindness, and the dignity she gave to me what made me feel loved. This feeling of being loved inspired me to build something great out of my life despite of my past. So naturally I fell in love with her. I think any person under my circumstance would have fallen in love with her after spending so much time around her. However, she moved away. Not under her control though.

So she went away and wondered if I was ever going to meet someone like her. I believed not because I believe that every person is unique. So I swore to pursue her. I was going to make myself so great that when I went back to her, she would want to stay with me after seeing the person I had become.

So I went to college with her as the motivation of my studies. Go to school, have a good job, and then go back to her so we could be together. I started working on a novel for her. I gave it all for her. I worked hard in my undertakings so I could be worthy of her. I gave it all, all my heart was spent in loving her, at least from a distance. And during this period I was doing good. I was going to a great school, I had a great job, I was about to start crowdfunding for my novel. It was great.

But my brother was the messenger of the bad news. He still stayed in touch with her sister and told me that she (the girl that I cared about) was with someone else. This was what crushed me, and after this everything went downhill. I became so depressed that I stopped caring about school. I stopped caring about the work, and was sad all the time. I felt like if part of me was ripped apart. I became depressed, and thought about joining the priesthood, now that I couldn't have her. This made me more desperate, and even more depressed that I started having dark thoughts.

One day I decided to go through it, but I regretted and called the cops. They took me to a hospital. I had to tell my parents, and finally I had to drop school and transfer to a school closer to home. I lost my job, I had to put my novel on hold. I lost it all.

Sometimes I blame her, and sometimes I blame myself for how far I have fallen. Sure, there are other fish in the sea, but I'm not sure if I want fish anymore. She made me lost everything I had built, and I'm never going back. Until yesterday, I was considering joining the army, and I can't even do that because of my history. So yeah, in some way I feel like meeting her was worse.

Any thoughts?",04Feb2019,1
19,"He's always been there for me, even when I was in a bipolar episode and goes to therapy with me when I need it so I wouldn't doubt that he loves me.

I've fully taken the time to learn his love language but I beg him to learn mine on a monthly basis now. I need gifts of affection and quality time but I only get his love language back.

22,"2015: In college I used to be depressed. I used to sleep all day and had bad anxiety. I used to want to die. I thought I wanted to kill myself, but I was too scared. I cried and felt hopeless.

My mom said that when I got back from school (2016), I was angry and hard to be around. I don’t remember that.

But then I didn’t feel depressed anymore. I got a job and that helped. I felt useful, but still generally lost in life. So I went back to school and got a certificate.

Now I’m working in a job I don’t love, but I’m okay with for now. I read an [article on NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/04/689747637/if-youre-often-angry-or-irritable-you-may-be-depressed) that caught my eye because it described me.

I am angry and irritable with my parents. Things that shouldn’t make me angry greatly shorten my fuse. Loud noises, yelling, arguments, just make me snap. I don’t want to be angry toward my parents. I love them, but being around them makes me crazy. I also experience a dull version of this with two of my co-workers on occasion when I can hear them chewing.

I am tired a lot. I don’t have energy to do anything after work except drink. I drink only on the weekends as a New Years resolution. So far so good on that. I worked out at the gym a lot in 2018, but I haven’t been back this year. Mostly because of location convenience.

26,"I'm on two antidepressants and I don't necessarily consider myself to have a high alcohol tolerance. A year ago I was definitely a lightweight but around the time I started to drink more regularly (maybe once or twice a month) was when I started taking the first antidepressant, lexapro. The other one is wellbutrin. I can't tell if I have a higher tolerance now or if the antidepressants make it harder for me to get and STAY drunk but I'm just curious what other people have experienced. The other night I took two shots of tequila and a shot of fireball and didn't feel anything for maybe 20-30 minutes and then once I was feeling pretty drunk I felt myself surfacing back up again in about 15-20 minutes. I wanted to do more shots and try to stay in that sweet spot but I knew not enough time had passed. It's just frustrating that I can't seem to /stay/ drunk without taking a lot of shots or drinking a bunch. I seriously don't think I have a high tolerance I'm a 130 lb girl so I think it must be the antidepressants. Anyways, thoughts and experiences are greatly appreciated &lt;3",04Feb2019,1

31,"Nearly a year ago, I lost my father in a sudden, fatal heart attack. Since that day, I have struggled from intense weed and nicotine addiction. I use a juul throughout the better parts of each day, and am high as often as I can be. I have tried on multiple occasions to quit both substances, but have evidently failed as the severe urges always get the best of me. From using and abusing both of these drugs, I not only am chemically addiction to nicotine, but am behaviorally addicted to nicotine and weed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have struggled with depressive feelings dating before my father's death, but obviously my feelings of sadness have significantly increased since his passing (alongside my substance use). I see a therapist bi-weekly, but therapy can only do so much when I am constantly overcome by substance abuse. I have watched as my motivation to do once enjoyable activities, such as simply watching netflix or playing a video game, has all but dissipated. I struggle to move from my bed to school every morning, more than ever throughout my current, senior year of high school. Most nights feature a repeating cycle of smoking, followed by netflix, followed by eating, and juuling throughout. It takes me ages to begin homework assignments now, assuming I will even do them, differing dramatically than previous years. I completely realize how my behavioral addiction to weed has caused most of these negatives in my life, but it is so, so, so hard for me to stop. I have an extremely addictive personality (and a family history of depression and anxiety). Weed is the temporary happiness and removal of sadness that I so desperately need when I struggle to even focus on a netflix show because of constant depressive thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most consider me a naturally born leader, and I should easily thrive in social situations. I am not the most popular person in my high school but have a large amount of close friends outside of my school. I like to think I am the life of most parties I attend, I work the room very well as my confidence always increases dramatically in party environments. Throughout high school, I was always the person talking to parents after a night of drinking or smoking; I am the most functional, most intelligent drunk out of the bunch. However, I have a hidden social anxiety that really prevents me from seeking more of these social situations where I like to believe I strive. It is nearly impossible for me to attend an outing or party without going through an intense, anxiety-driven thought process. I go through every possible situation that a night may entail, every scenario, to try and convince myself that I am socially acceptable, that I am not the unwanted kid at the party. This has recently kept me on the sidelines from even engaging in social events, it has locked me in my bed on most Saturday nights. In attempt to avoid these situations that trigger my social anxiety, I have even created my schedule to allow me to leave school before noon on a daily basis. In terms of relationships, I have had a small amount of sexual encounters (I am a virgin, however) but never a true girlfriend. I continuously believe that I am unattractive and unwanted by everyone, which essentially forces me to curb myself from any conversations with girls before I get a few shots in to spike my confidence.

Now, you, whoever may be reading a basic outline of my recent life, please comment a response. Please comment if you can relate to anything about me, comment if you have overcome intense teenage substance abuse. Give me advice to heal my wounds opened by the sudden death of my father. Please, provide support, give me a comment that will help me. I feel emotionally frozen; I feel as if my dependency on substances has frozen me inside of a grief-induced depressed that has no treatment. Please, help me.",04Feb2019,1
32,"My kids dad and I have been together and separate on and off since 2013, when our daughter was born  I got pregnant soon after we met, I knew I loved him and I asked him to get me pregnant. 


I have a daughter who is 9, who I was raising alone when he and I met.

I have tried living with him in our own space, having a relationship while I'm at my mom's and he is mobile, in an RV with him, at his parents house and I have had my own apartments intermittently but I usually lose my space when I move to be with him.

Neither of us own a home.

So far I'm feeling pretty pathetic in this post.

Ok. So yes we had a son in May2018 and since then I have had to leave him again since then we were at his parents and his brother verbally attacked me, and he was slapping me around.

Domestic violence has not been a theme, but when his brother and I were yelling at each other I think it hit a nerve and he resorted to smacking me, a bunch.

I freaked out and left.

So now here is the pathetic part, he wants to basically un-agnowledge his kids and now says I'm a terrible person, for leaving him; even though there was so much discord.

I think counseling or therapy could help us both and benefit the children but, it's all or nothing with him and so I have tried to piece my life back where I'm living now. (Got my job back but very part time, yoga, swimming, trying not to cry all day.. activities and school with kids,swim lessons and parks and...my single mom routine).

I keep trying to get him to talk to me, texting him occasionally and or calling every week or so and even emailing him.

I keep trying to figure out why this happened and keep a thread going with communicating with him.

Since we met, except when he went to California 3000 miles away, we have always kept in touch more than intermittently. 

I think I'm having withdrawal or something thinking I'm never going to see him and I feel like my life is over and my family is ruined.

I think he's given up finally and I'm still trying to hold on.

I go thrift shopping because he and I would go and that together and am innoculating mushroom logs (he for ages and sells to restaurants). I think I've gone insane trying to imitate him. One time when he left I crocheted hats all winter. He taught me.  Its like I have to recreate some part of the relationship to feel sane without him.

If he reads this he'll  think I'm nuts.

I have not dated anyone else since we met, except one guy I went on a few dates with and talked about him the entire time and that was after I had been alone for 2 years in the midst of all this.

Partly, I think the relationship has made me insane. 

Partly the fact that he leaves, and shows up unannounced years later and with romantic interests I feel like I'm not insane, I'm a doormat.

Partly I just can't think about the pain involved with the relationship because he won't agree to any shared child custody or even sign birth certificates and any financial aid (to help raise the kids) has come from his dad who is more financially stable than him--although that is in the process of changing as he has been investing energy in an online business and it has potential to continue to grow.

I work and raise 3 kids and don't make enough money to support myself entirely.

I get 50.00 from the state for my oldest child 

His family gave me a car. And then took it back.


I think I'm rambling.

Um, yeah I feel pathetic like I'll be miserable till I die.

How to stop obsessing when tied to uncommitted, weird non relationship type bond.

Without being a total jerk.

And, be happy (even though I miss him and deep down want to be a family with him despite ritualistic hell)

33,"On Saturday morning as I was lying in bed with my husband, trying to get the will to get up, I finally got up the courage.

I quietly said, “I have no joy in my life”.

He was immediately offended.
“Jeeshe, thanks a lot.”
“At least you’re not a paraplegic. You should be happy about that.”

I don’t think he realized how hard that was for me. How it was a scream for help. How it wasn’t a reflection on him, but on me.

I’m not stupid. I know people have it worse. I know people are stronger than me. It doesn’t make feel any more worthy to know how selfish my feelings are.

Recently, I have had money problems that have gotten out of control.
I have been preforming badly at work (partly due to my instability).
Despite loosing 50lbs I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and put on a strict diet (food used to equate happiness). 
Despite loosing several inches, I have no money for new clothes or activities and my health problems have not improved.
I’ve recently come to terms with the fact that I will probably never have children because of my fertility issues.
Worse, I have not been able to be intimate with my husband for months because of complications. 

I recently started working a second job. It takes up some free time and makes me feel productive. He’s worried what will happen if I’m over worked.

I’m worried what will happen if I stop.

34,"My insurance is through the school and I’ve been trying to find a therapist for 3 weeks now. They’re either not accepting new clients or can’t accommodate my busy schedule. I’m in my third year of law school, working, and doing pro bono so my schedule is jam packed. 

I’m finding myself going through the same motions involving men. I’ll meet someone, my depression goes away and I’m incredibly happy while it’s going on, then they’ll ghost me or dump me and it’s like I’ve hit a wall. I’m horribly depressed, can’t focus, and I’m not taking care of myself mentally or physically. This one hit the worst because he told me that I’m too much emotional work for him (he said he could tell I’m depressed even though I can’t seem to figure out how or why he thought that). 

It makes me feel like no matter who I meet, this will always negatively affect my relationships. I feel like shit. I look like shit. I hate myself right now and I just want to feel normal. And ffs, I just need someone to talk to about all this. ",04Feb2019,1
35,"Its been a shitty two months for me, and I wasn’t particularly happy before. I’ve been keeping myself busy as a coping mechanism but there’s only so much I can do. That, and a lot of my busy stuff is alone - so then later I think about how lonely I am, you know? I haven’t had a serious suicidal thoughts for a while but I can feel them creeping. ",04Feb2019,1
