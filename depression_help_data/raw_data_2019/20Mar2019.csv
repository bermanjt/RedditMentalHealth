1,"Hey guys, so this post is me mainly looking for some words of encouragement. I’ve rescheduled this appointment like 3 times because I’ve been so nervous about it, but tomorrow is the day I just suck it up and go in to talk to a doctor about the option of starting depression meds. 

I’m excited to take this step for myself, but I guess I’m just nervous about talking to someone outside of my therapist about my depression. I’m worried I’ll be judged or they won’t believe me. I’d like to believe the inherent good in everyone but this just makes me feel really vulnerable. I’d really appreciate any support or encouragement! ",20Mar2019,6
2,"I’m a sophomore in college and I just got dumped on Valentine’s Day. Not kidding. She said she needs to focus on school which I understand but I feel lost without her. We dated for almost a year and I literally never had a negative experience with her. Ever. It was literally perfect and now I feel like everything is crashing down on me again. I guess I didn’t realize how fragile my happiness was until the source of most of it was taken away. I know time heals breakups but this isn’t even about that. I can feel the darkness in my head creeping back in and I’m starting to revert back to old habits and moods. 

I guess I’m just asking how to stay ahead of the wave and use myself for happiness instead of relying on the love of others. ",20Mar2019,17
3,Please help me Vaun? Please...? I want to ask you but I can’t. I never can. I come so close like typing messages like these and I can never send them. I can never tell anyone. It’s like no one feels the pressure of being squeezed by two walls (depression and anxiety) like I do. And they can’t hear me. They see me screaming but they don’t care or maybe my smile is so good that they really can’t see me screaming. I’m scared Vaun. Please.... see me screaming. Please see me drowning. Please... see me..... I’m not okay. I’m not me. I’m not the happy girl you met. I’m the way I should’ve been while I was being beaten. Why now depression? Why strike me AFTER the trauma is over? I don’t know!!! But it makes me not like myself.... I hate myself. I want to be happy. I want to be loved and actually feel it. But I can’t feel anything Vaun. I just wanna kill myself. Please help me Vaun. Hold me all night every night.... please help me...,20Mar2019,1

I tried to provide a safe environment to talk about them many times but after she does tell them, she feels a little happy, but the anxiety is a lot worse. This was caused because of her ex in the past, and we’ve been working together to help for over 6 months. She’s definitely been getting better, but I can’t help with this because she just lies, and when I try to tell her, she shuts me down worrying it will hurt me. And I just don’t know what to do. She refuses therapy because of past situations, and I don’t know how to approach this. Any help and experiences are greatly appreciated. I just don’t want this to start affecting my levels of anxiety when she hides things from me...",20Mar2019,1
7,"I am not diagnosed with depression, despite seeing a psychiatrist. So there's that.  


But every day, I wake up, struggle to go to work, and when I come home, I go to bed as early as possible. On days off or on vacations, sometimes I just don't leave the house at all. Sometimes I don't leave my bed.   


Today is my 6th day of staying home, alone, mainly in bed. I don't feel sad. Not at all. I don't feel happy either. I don't feel anything except occasionally rage.   


When I do make myself go out, when I am in this headspace (as it comes and goes), it feels like a chore, and I can't wait to come home again. At home, I do repetitive tasks because my focus is horrible; I read online. I answer work email. I make excel spreadsheets about random things. I do deep research into things of nominal interest to me.   


When I wake up when I'm not working, all I can think about is ""When can I fall asleep again? What do I do to fill this day?""  


I feel slowed down AND unconcerned/apathetic. I don't care what I eat so I just eat anything around, and not much of it. I can't always sleep, so I lie in bed with my eyes shut. Talking to anyone annoys the Hell out of me. Driving the car, being out, doing errands, taking a shower, cleaning the house, they feel stupid and irritating and pointless. Seeing friends feels utterly horrible as I have nothing at all to say and am usually an entertaining person.   


There are next to no psychiatrists where I live. I am lucky to have one who runs the hospital here, seems like an alright person. I asked him if I could try an antidepressant. He said only if I went to therapy as well, which would cost $1,200 a month, so no thanks. I have panic disorder but it's under control right now, for a long time, decades.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suicidal, but I wish I would just die. At the same time, I am afraid of dying and ruminate about it all the time.   


I don't care about anything. I was speaking to my mother (who lives 3,500 miles away) on the phone, and she said, ""Happiness is a choice."" I hung up on her and turned the ringer off so I didn't have to listen to her blather on about some happy horseshit that I don't identify with.  


I am female, in my mid-40's, gainfully employed as a Professor, a world's expert in my field, in fact, and yet right now, I can't focus on Soul Caliber IV or a stupid comedy or the dishes or taking a shower or reading a book, and it just comes and goes like this. I have zero social support network and in the past, when things have gotten bad, I've lost so much weight from not eating that I've had to be hospitalized (I'm not anorexic; I was malnourished). It's happening again. And really hard and long this time. I feel confused and lost and without any help at all. There is no one to turn to for support. Even my therapist/psychiatrist annoys me to talk with. I just want a pill, any pill, or some treatment, to fix this, which has been diagnosed as ""anhedonia."" It feels like that, but worse.",20Mar2019,64
8,"I woke to a thud, the thud of my house shaking beneath me like something had smashed into it something hard, heavy. Adrenaline already in my veins, my body shook uncontrollably mostly my hips side to side, like a charmer’s snake dancing to his flute. I peaked through the curtains to see what it was, it wasn’t long before I saw the red break lights of a car. Its inside my house, I mean the front of it not fully. I peak at more an angle to get a better view, it’s our car? Why is our car in our house? I lie there staring with a patient I’ve never seen in my self like I was content but fearful all at the same time. I opened the window and fly screen and stuck my head out in the shadows.

God, I hope it was mum in that car if it was dad, I know what mood he would be in. The car starts to reverse, screeching louder then the regular gunshots around here, schools going to know about this. The car loosens from the grip of the metal and flies out backwards skidding a little in the autumn leaves, I could see his face the same drunken face that I see every night. he doesn’t notice that I’m watching him, he looked down in confusion fuddling around, maybe looking for something. The sliding door swings open shaking house making me jump again. It was my mum in tears, confused I’m not sure whether she was crying because of the house or because she knows what’s going to happen. He looks up locking his head towards her like he found what he was looking for my Mum.

Usually I only hear yelling and sometimes screaming but I avoid seeing it start, my Mums’ tone from firm to begging when she realizes that it was only going to make things worse. I feel powerless and I can’t call the 000, Mum told me not to I don’t want to disappoint her. Voices are raising I can see it coming. I stalk the conversation hoping it resolves itself but most of the time she isn’t so lucky.

He paces his way to her, reaching past her arms to her hair, pulling her with it like a leash toward the car almost dragging her, her squeals echo through the paddock waking everyone in the house I can hear my younger sisters whispering, and moping dads name even they get the picture at there age.

I watch in hatred thinking of all the ways I can hurt him, all the ways he can suffer, it isn’t my first time. My rampaged thoughts were quickly interrupted, he punched her closed fist flat in the nose. It looked hard real hard, I’ve seen some of their fight but never that hard. She fell onto her face blowing dust and spit on the dirt, I can’t look I can’t bear it, I thought of grabbing the rifle but I was frozen, I wanted to kill him so bad. I clenched my teeth ignoring the sound of scraping in my head.  I’m useless",20Mar2019,2
9,"Idk if i should put a trigger warning on this, and tbh I'm not really sure how too. So uh....

!TRIGGER WARNING! 

If you struggles with eating disorders and suicidal ideation, uhm, this might be hard to read. Uhm. Idk if that's good or not. If not I'm sorry. Truth be told if i don't get this off my chest now im afraid of what I'll do
 
I cried so hard i threw up tonight. TBH it felt good. In a scary way. Due to depression and mental and emotional abuse, a few years ago I was severely malnourished. My hair was falling out. I had growths on the back of my tongue. My nails flaked a part. I stopped eating almost completely. 

I'm now clinically obese. Not excessively so, but jumping from 130 to 230 in 3 months was a fucking wild ride. I dont want to go back to that place. Im gonna talk to my therapist about it in a few days, but I couldn't hold it in anymore. 

I'm scared. Im scared of what I'll do to feel better, to hate myself less. 

I'm also afraid of what I'll do if i don't stop hating myself. 

I'm caught up in this cycle of oh itll get better, then it doesnt. And i spiral again. 

Please don't come back with comments like, ""get a gym member ship"" etc. I tried. It didnt work because I don't have the energy all the time, and then I beat myself up even more for not going. Im ending that cycle of self abuse before it can continue. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. ",20Mar2019,7
10,"I've been struggling with depression for a couple years now and in general have been doing well. I have a therapist and am taking medicine. However, this last month (and especially this week) has just been really rough for me. 

Granted, there is a lot going on. I just moved to a new country with my boyfriend for my new job. My boyfriend, through a slightly unfortunate series of events, realizes he is polyamorous. That's not a deal breaker for me, but it will take some time and effort for us to figure out what will work for both of us. I haven't been focusing on making friends so far, so I've been getting lonely and I don't have a support structure here. I'm feeling lost and unsure of what I want for my future.

I'm noticing this week that my confidence is shot. I'm doubting everything I do or say. Everyone has a better way to do the things I've done. I keep wanting to just stay in bed or disappear for a little bit and not have to worry about anything so I can come back refreshed. 

Luckily I'm still going to work, getting things done, making sure I eat even with no appetite, and spending time with people (co-workers or events). 

At this point I just feel drained even after taking some weekend days just to focus on myself. I know this isn't the worst I've been and maybe things aren't so bad but I just feel awful and I don't know what would help right now.",20Mar2019,1

17,"So I had my first Dr's appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. I'd like some feedback on a few things (just need to know whether some of the stuff I'm about to post is common, or not)

&amp;#x200B;

1.) A lot of the stuff was ""up to me"" and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a ""I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but it's bad, and I need to address it"" mentality. I have no idea why I'm depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this.

*-  ""Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety?""* 

*The answer? I honestly have no idea, I'm coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didn't know it had to be either one of these.*

*- I was asked what ""kind"" of medication I think I should be on (given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together)* 

*- I had no idea how to answer this either, I don't know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue.* 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) After this short 45-minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I haven't taken either yet, because I'm not sure that's right for me. I just feel like 45-minutes wasn't even close to enough time for me to ""explain me"" and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I **know** that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I don't feel confident that I'd even be taking a **good** crapshoot from a single 45-minute appointment with a brand new doctor.

*- Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Can't doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world I'd previous known (getting diagnosed and treated for migranes) where everything was ""testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!!"" before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health it's just ""idk, we'll throw this against the wall and see if it sticks."" Makes me incredibly uncomfortable.* 

&amp;#x200B;

3.) When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago (and making this appointment with a psychiatrist), I had **absolutely no idea** what kind of doctor I'm supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even ""diagnoses you"" with depression or anxiety. I don't want to self-diagnose, it just doesn't feel right. (After this appointment I still didn't feel like I was ""formally diagnosed"", just given medication).

*So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the ""Psychiatrist"" is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy.*

*- Does ""formal diagnosis"" happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have.*

*- What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just don't know all the terminology.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The path I've currently chosen: I've not taken my medication (not started), cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a ""safer"" path for me.  As much as I want to address my issues NOW (I'm impatient), going straight to medication just didnt feel right...

&amp;#x200B;

26,"I feel like my depression will never get any better. I can't get out of bed, yet I feel guilty for not working. I've barely eaten - the idea of food makes me feel ill - but I feel bad for not eating. I'm failing my exams and have no long-term goals, because even as an ""adult"" at 19 I don't know what I want to do with my life. I've spent most of the last couple of days staring at the ceiling feeling terrible in every way.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. And my parents don't think that my disorder/disability ([Tourette's syndrome](https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/#1461071540054-f0944fbc-3f2b)) exists, so I get told off regularly for something I physically cannot control.

Thoughts of wanting to self-harm have come back after a few months of not harming, and I just feel like I want to die.

30,"I don't really know where to start. I was a pretty normal child. The only thing I remember is I cried too much than normal. I got scared at times because I my mom had to deal with an angry drunk, but it happened only once in awhile. I even didn't understand why my mother didn't want to get a divorce. But for 5 years my dad does not drink too much to where he gets angry. 
Fast forward to high school. I slowly began losing interest. Many students said I was weird and would bully me by saying that I am weird because I rarely talked. I realized that I did not fit in high school and it was hard for me to make friends, and this is when my isolation began. I even did swim team for three years, but never made a friend that I could regularly hang out with. I just continued to keep to myself, and I never told anyone about how students called me weird or other things they said. I told my mom when it was too late. Fast forward to college I am still finding it hard to adjust because of my four years of keeping to myself. My second year of college in the spring I begin not feeling like myself. I feel I am not in my body I don't know how to explain it. It could have been due to the isolation, depression, and stress. I felt disorganized, lost/confused, my OCD became very extreme, I would walk faster than normal in public places. I would cry because I didn't understand what was wrong with me. I felt far from normal, and that is when my first intrusive thought appeared. But after some time I felt back to normal again. During this state of feeling not like myself I like to stay at home because I look scary in my opinion. 
​
Fast forward to a year, and after some stress and isolation, I began not feeling like myself again. I have weird behaviors my OCD worsens, disorganized talking, anxiety increased, depressed. I wanted to commit suicide because it got worse. I was in a psychology course and we learned about the dark triad and about psychopathy. Later I started worrying that I was a psychopath. All of my movements were quick and my eyes were very dilated. I didn't want to go anywhere but I had to finish my college semester. Even students were scared of me, and I felt scared of myself because I hated that I was this way. I heard voices in my head talking about killing. I told the voices to leave me alone. However, my mental state did not stop until I started talking Seroquel with another medication to relax. I felt like myself again but I felt much better because my anxiety had decreased, too. 
​
Fast forward to this spring, and I began to not feel like myself again. I had a mental breakdown because I had been feeling sad, lonely, and stressed. During my breakdown I had suicidal thoughts, (this wasn't my first time having suicidal thoughts). This is my third time that I don't feel like myself, and I may be mentally ill. Currently, I am on Abilify medication but I feel no change atleast not yet. I do not want to go to my classes because students will begin getting scared of me. I do understand what is wrong with me but I feel that I am very different from everyone else. In my opinion, if I keep on getting these phases then I have no other option than to commit suicide or go to a mental institution. but if I go to a mental institution it will ruin my parent's life. I feel like I was partially born like this, but I have no way of finding out. If I commit suicide I will break my parent's heart. My parent's and I lost my brother, he died from cancer last year. I cannot do that to my parents but I have no choice. I know that I have ADHD, anxiety, depression, and OCD. But I don't know if I am a psychopath or these are just intrusive thoughts. I don't believe I have schizophrenia and I know I don't have bipolar disorder. I don't want to live if I am a psychopath because those aren't just intrusive thoughts if my mental state is off.",20Mar2019,1

I work in a kiosk by myself for 8 hours. And it’s hell because nothing entertains me. What I like doing I don’t find enjoyment in. The mornings when I wake up are the worst. Wish I could just lay there forever.  I have huge anxiety..talking to people feels like work. I struggle to hold a conversation. Even around my own family. If something pops in my head I don’t have the energy to say it or don’t out of fear of sounding stupid. I have a girlfriend who I have been living with for a year. But I don’t feel comfortable around her. I struggle a lot with her and have relationship anxiety. And even though I love her. I don’t really know where I stand with her. But she has said she is content with me. We hardly interact and going on any type of date other then the movies is a bad idea. Because I struggle with conversation. Im always thinking about her which I know is unhealthy. I can’t help but watch her mannerisms and also watching mine. I’m never mentally at peace. For reasons I can’t understand she hasn’t left me yet. And looking at her as more of a roommate makes it a little easier. Because I feel the pressure is off. But I’m always initiating contact and I’m in the room while she is in the living room. We don’t go on dates. So we pretty much are roommates. And I feel like she keeps me around and will never leave me not because she loves me but for other reasons I can’t think of...if you understand what I mean. And that was going fine. Until it wasn’t. It’s like I’m happy for like a week. Or a day then I’m sad for months.  I’m always in my head. And feel a cloud over me. I have tons of thoughts flying through my brain. And the only  time I feel a little ok is if I’m drunk. I can’t confide in my gf  all she says is for me to “chill out” and I feel my weakness and sensitivity turns her off. And that I have to watch my mannerisms and that I want to get off today and just go to my moms house and just lay down across the couch in her presents. And talk to her but I feel like I’m putting more stress on her then is needed by being down. And her only words are “hope you feel better, find a hobby” every other man I see I think is wayy better than me. And that they could fuck my girl. And just way better then me in all aspects of life. I can’t figure out how to pull myself out. I’m on meds.  I don’t want to go over a friends house because I feel that because I’m down I would be nothing but a burden to them. And I feel like my girl would be happier with a more stable man. I don’t know what to do...and I don’t know what I’m looking to get out of posting this. I guess it’s a final cry for help. Maybe I should start telling myself that my girl and family/friends will never abandon me no matter what and start working on myself more. But it’s hard when you don’t have the energy or drive

34,"So...where to begin, exactly...um...I guess I'll start with the core of all of my issues. My father died unexpectedly when I was 17. Diabetes complications. After taking a strenuous course of different meds every day for years while dealing with a reoccuring infection laden underfoot wound that landed him in the hospital more times than I could count growing up, he didn't take his meds one day and within a week was in total organ shutdown and a coma. Life support. The end. My world was shattered. My mom and I got through it somehow, and we are doing just fine.

My issue immediately afterwards manifested itself in sex. I found grindr, and random spontaneous adventures with total strangers was my life off and on for years. Luckily, I've encountered no major consequences physically, despite not being safe during any of it.

I had several longterm FWB relationships within the last few years. One was with my first real boyfriend after we broke up  from I guess 2014-last year, and the other was with a pilot my age who lived about an hour away from me from I guess 2016-last year 

&amp;#x200B;

my ex boyfriend recently got involved in a serious relationship since November, and the dynamic has obviously changed between us...he does not involve me in his life, I don't know what's going on, or what he's doing...etc. He only responds if I text him. The conversations are short and not at all satisfying. I feel like I've just been left behind for something better, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN EVENTUALLY. We used to talk a lot and he'd come stay at my house, was very close with my mom and I although I've never met any of his family, etc. I learned about the relationship he's in more than a month after it was official, and we talked about it and I am TRULY happy he's found someone he's happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

The pilot who lived an hour away recently finished all his flight hours and got accepted at a job for a major airline. He moved a few states away. The very last time we spoke, he was drunk and anxious, talking about how he wanted to move on from where he lived and stop doing stupid stuff and our friendship, which was entirely based upon the sex, was not good for either of us and he didn't regret me he regretted what we did. He said the friendship was bound to fail, and after a long drawn out argument he gave me an ultimatum: If you don't stop bothering me I will block you everywhere, goodbye. This was such a sudden (although again, EVENTUAL) change in our relationship that I wasn't prepared for.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself obsessing over one or the other every single day. Thinking about how I miss him, remembering the best times and the reality that I will never feel their presence again, remembering the smallest details and wondering if they're forgetting about all of it and wishing I could go back in time to relive the memories. I find myself in agony wanting to reach out and text either one of them but KNOWING it's futile. One made it clear I wasn't in his future, and the other is happy in a relationship so of course we aren't talking much if at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mind goes back and forth and it's in a constant loop and I want it to stop. Last year, I was wishing I could focus on my own future and stop feeling regretful and like I was wasting myself and my time fucking around with both of them. I wanted to never have a FWB again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've gotten everything I wanted, and a chance to focus on myself and my future, which I am beyond grateful for. I know my daddy issues have everything to do with why I am attached to these dead relationships. Can you guys please help me by suggesting how to control these intense emotions so that I don't waste anymore time obsessing over these two? I am struggling for nothing.
