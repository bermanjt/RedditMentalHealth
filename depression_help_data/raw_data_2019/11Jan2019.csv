0,"I suffer from treatment resistant major depressive disorder. I am currently receiving both therapy and psychiatry services. I work full-time and I have a master's degree. I am married to a man that loves me more than anything else in the whole world. I'm pretty lucky in life.

Almost a year ago, I took a huge risk applying for a doctoral program. Getting that degree had been my dream since I was in fourth grade (I'm 34 now). Every professor told me I was a shoe-in. I interviewed well, and participated in group discussions. I have a decade of experience in the field. I felt confident that I would get the letter of acceptance in the mail. But... all that came was a poorly-written rejection letter.

Since that day, I haven't been the same. I have cried more at this point in my life than at any other. I know that I would feel better if I could focus on working toward something else, but nothing is appealing. I have been able to accomplish a lot at work, but it felt effortless to do so. My career is in the same field as the doctoral degree.

I keep trying to find something to work toward, some goal or something to strive for, but I just feel adrift. Nothing is appealing. I have no desire to have children, find a new job, or even read a book. I can't engage myself in video games and sometimes I can't even pay attention to the TV. I scheduled a big vacation last year, but by the time it came around I didn't have much of a desire to go.

I can't grasp anything. I feel like my life is pretty much over and there won't be anything else to look forward to. At this point, I don't know how to do anything other than simply exist. I'm hoping someone has some advice for me.",11Jan2019,1
1,"I live abroad, family is far and I'm in a demanding job. I feel very sad and anxious and the only person I see is my bf. He is not into me sexually anymore because of my mental health status and now even that part of my life sucks.

Background: Used to have sex every week with at least two people but I was lonely, now dating but still feel lonely and even no sex (being in a relationship for 9 months)

2,"I have practically no friends. the ones I do are fake. my long distance relationship is too much to bare. my boyfriend (of about 15 months) puts our talking on the back burner while he is at college early for the semester for indoor track; he hangs out with people he claims he cant stand instead of talking to me at a decent time of day. and ignores me all day. he claims he cares but as with all relationships, romantic and platonic, I'm the one who cares the most and it sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

my family critiques my every move, my dad called me a liar when I was talking about a band I love, saying I was being a fake fan meanwhile I've listened to them for fourteen fucking years, just because I don't talk about them to him. so now I don't know anything about them apparently? k.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not good at anything, and even when I am okay or do something decently I get shoved down by people who are jealous. I'm constantly lied to and used so whats the fucking point anymore if I don't even matter to anyone.",11Jan2019,1
3,"I am new around here so don’t kill me if my format is all wrong or some shit.

So 6 months ago my mother forced me to go see a doctor about my mental state (Was 16 at the time) I was diagnosed with clinical depression. 

I was on Prozac for around 2 weeks but then I stopped taking it because it just made me feel like I was useless needing a drug to improve myself. So I tried to get out of depression without it (hasn’t worked)
I am now putting on an act for my doctor pretending that I’m getting better and all my shit is good, but really it’s far from it. I don’t know why i am doing this because it seems counter productive in a way but I just hate people trying to control me and help me. I’d just rather deal with it myself.

I really don’t know what to do and I don’t even know why I’m on reddit right now. But I feel nothing my mind is completely dead. 
Help.

4,"Im in an abuse situation. Ive reached out to homes and cps and my school, nothings happened. Its gotten worse since. I feel so alone, My dad holds others over my head and tells me if i try to leave, he'll not only harass me but others im with. I feel trapped. New York rarely hands out emancipation to minors. I cant do this anymore, im breaking",11Jan2019,1
5,"I created a reddit account to talk to someone.. anyone because honestly I dont want to live this life anymore. im usually optimistic and hopeful but today... today im questioning everything.

I am a 23 year old black female. I consider myself a devout christian, and im active in my church as a singer. i love singing and playing drums and guitar, im not good and either but im a pretty good singer. as a carrer im a certified welder, but im in the beginning of my career i guess.. its been 3 years and i still havent had someone give me a chance and work for them. i live with my mother and grandmother and 10 other people in a 2 bed room apartment. all my life hording and clutter and being broke has been my reality.. my mother never ever cleaned and it would get so bad that there would be bugs and mold in places. clothes everywhere. for 23 years. ive been trying my hardest to get myself out of this situation ever since i was old enough to work but.. im stuck. i am truly a clean freak and minimalist at heart and even when i was a child, the whole house would be a dirty wreck and my room cleaned and sanitized to my best ability.

currently with the whole 13 people in a 2 bedroom apartment deal, i have one corner where my things are, (one lidded bucket of clothes, one medium bucket that holds approx. 10 pairs of shoes, and a small bucket for my personal items) i have a puppy named jaxsen and i was trying to get shoes to walk him and like i couldnt.  i couldnt because my family has thrown junk into a space that i worked  hard to keep clean and i thought.. that sums up my whole life. I work hard so someone else can fuck it up and im tired of it.

With  my health.. I was diagnosed with polysystic ovarian symdrom, and told its the reason for my weight and that it would be very hard for me to have children. it causes my ""flow"" to be crippling and weight loss to be impossible although im very active. I gain muscle beautifully, but to lose fat is a losing battle. i excercise and im a very picky eater (only eat protein and veggies, very rarely sugar) but as soon as I eat a piece  of bread im instantly a candidate on the show ""my half ton life"".. I starve for weeks  to feel better about myself because thats the only way i can sucessfully loose weight and doctors dont really help. but now that I dont have a job I dont have insurance.

Im just thinking.... why am I here? because if its to suffer then i dont want to be here at all. I was raise in the church.. to be christian. but im like.. why would God make me miserable make me suffer? I honestly dont have anyone practical to talk to.. my family will just say ""go pray""

... but why pray to a god thats letting me feel this way.. live like this... be this sad?",11Jan2019,1
6,"Depression is more than a dark cloud following you around. It’s pain, it’s sadness, it’s weight on your shoulders, it’s guilt, it’s frustration, it’s a lack of feeling like you’re enough, it’s an assumption that you’ve made about yourself that you’re not worth a *damn thing*. You look in the mirror and you might as well have the word mistake written on your forehead in permanent marker. You go through moments where you feel everything at once and then other moments where you feel nothing at all. You have reasons screaming at you to leave it all behind but your voice of reason is shouting *“no!”* in the far distance. Dreams remind you of the pain that your mind can’t forget, which naturally means you never get to escape. When you’re awake you cry and as the tears hit your cheek, they instantly shatter your sanity. In your dreams you may *scream* yourself awake. The feeling of sadness seems to creep into your fingers and toes, making it impossible to pick up the phone and ask for help, or walk into a place where you may find hope. The voice you have is no longer yours, it almost seems as if you are listening to another person speak, yet its your lips moving. *There would be less hurt if I wasn’t here. There would be less worrying on others if I weren’t here. There would be less…* Your mind even is too tired to finish the sentence. *You will be ok.* They tell me but it’s easier said then done because they don’t feel this.. *I have lost everything. I have no idea who I am anymore. Why am I here? I take 1 step forward and I fall at least 10 steps back. I need a sign that this isn’t for nothing.. that I’m not nothing.* ",11Jan2019,1
7,I wouldn't consider my life horrible. I actually feel like it's pretty great. But I always get this desire to just die because I feel like I hate living. I have a few good friends and many other people I would consider friends. I volunteer with kids and they look up to me and love me and I love it. I feel like I'm going more in the direction I want to go with my life. I still can't help but feel like I'm better off dead. Like I'm not important to anybody and I'm replaceable. Sometimes I think I just want someone to finally tell me to kill myself so I can do it. What am I supposed to do?,11Jan2019,1

9,"in august i moved to my dads. after realizing it would be smart to take a gap year before college i moved back to my moms. im 18. since then ive moved 5 times to different peoples houses, two times of which i got kicked out for reasons out of my control. im jobless, just got a car but cant afford the gas for it, i dont have a phone and im not going to school, and like i said before, im living with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive ""tried"" to kms before, but i think it was more of a needing to get my emotions out but not truly attempting to die, because ive never felt this way before. i feel like a low life because im 18, cant seem to get a job and im living with my mom. I really wanted to work at this one pool teaching swim lessons. i applied with my boyfiend and, even though i was 10x more qualified, he got the job and i didnt. so while already feeling like a loser, i watch my boufeiend to go work, doing the job im more qualified to do, while i comntinue to get rejected by job after job. not to mention the idea of me going to a job i cant stand while he works there makes me want to die in itself. He tries to help but its like he thinks im constantly crying wolf. he always says we'll get through it, you cant let your depression get the best of you. like its not eating away at me day after day more and more. and today, after finally reaching my limit, i tried to break up with him and give our pet lizards back to him because in that moment, i was going to do it. I looked up how old i had to be to buy a gun. and right when it came to driving to a gun shop, i got scasred and couldnt do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

all of this stemmed from me finding out the 25 dollar check i deposited (from my dream college refunding me partially after rejecting me) got sucked up by my account maintence fees and paper statement fees, which i thought i had opted out of. Thats how beat down i am at this point. its been over 6 months since my life started going to crap and i mean it REALLY went to crap. and a 25 dollar check made me come this close to actually going throuogh with committing suicide. whats worse is i tried to talk to my boyfeidnd, turns out that even after exclaiming how in pain i was and scared i was because i couldnt do this anymore, i find out that after messaging me twice he just went home and laid in bed doing whateve it was he was doing. hes sick so i dont blame him for that but he didnt even bother to say hey im going home, or ask if i was ok., he hadsaid wyd and that was that. which makes me feel like he doesnt undrstand. and im not the type to heavily rely on my boyfriend for my depression. i understand hes got his own life and my porblems shoudltn suffocate his. but i genuinely was about to kill myself. ive never felt this in my life. i hadnt messaged him for hours, trying to do something and finally when id come to terms with being too scared, not a single new message from him. i feel so incredibly alone., i need help ive never felt this deep of a painfully sinking hole in my chest. i dread waking up i dread seeing anybody i dread every second i breathe i have never wanted anything more than to be gone from this world as of right now. everything i do is thrown into the dirt, nobody sees how much i go through pushing myself to keep going, yet i still just look like a deadbeat hanging out at her moms rent free. 

&amp;#x200B;

on top of all this, i keep hearing my boyfeiend say just get a job, omnce you get a phone itll be better, keep working on your art you cant give up. like its easy. like its easy to wake up every day already hoping somnebody just drives through your house killling you. or like i dont feel bad enough that i keep getting rejected by jobs. ""just keep at it, i kept at it and i got a job. youll get one just keep applying"". with every job i apply to it just cuts that hole deeper and deeper. god especially knowing he got the job i wanted. it just burns this anger that i cant release. i cant stand myself and i cant stand being alive. and im scared because i feel like today was the day that i finally decided im not going to die of old age. i think im going to kill myself. and i need help because i truly and genuinely dont think ill get through this and i cant talk about it to my boyfeiend, who im closest to. i have n e v e r felt this level of hopelessness and loneliness. and i surely have never been this desperate to not feel anything. i tried to talk to the prevention hotline but since im using a computer and it wouldnt work after i had waited in line for an hour.

11,"So I’m staying the night at his house and I can tell he’s been feeling off today and he out right said by the end of the night that he’s just feeling extra depressed today. Nothing new I’ve known for awhile, he’s in therapy and we’re doing all we really can for him. Not worried for his life or anything, or at least anymore than normal ,but what’s something you guys suggest that I can do for him while he’s sleeping so he has a surprise to wake up to in the morning and I can hopefully brighten his a day a little. Or at least help remind how much I love and care about him at least. ",11Jan2019,1

13,I have a false sense of purpose. There is no purpose in life. I don't feel emotions in relationships.  What makes you get out of bed in the morning?

14,"Earlier I just opened up to my mom on how lonely I felt when I’m away from home (my work is like a few miles away so I’m staying with my colleagues).  I always felt out of place whenever I’m with them, I just want to fit in. But I guess it just won’t work no matter how I tried everything to adjust myself. There are more but I just don’t want to dig deeper. 

I had finally the courage to tell my mom about my it and I broke down crying. She was surprised and disappointed. She told me on how shallow my problem is. She explained that I should just forget my so-called friends, they were not worth shit. But, she really stressed out that there are much more worth problems to stressed about compared to mine. 


To be honest, I was expecting some sort of comfort because she was always there for me and we’re close. But this time I have never felt so hurt coming from her. It made me cry even more. I tried to stop it. I wanted to tell her that she shouldn’t down other people’s problem no matter what she thinks if it’s shallow or not. 

I love my mom but she really disappointed me this time. ",11Jan2019,1

17,"I have chronic depression and severe anxiety  and paranoia and recently I feel so....low. My self-esteem is as low as it could possibly be and I find myself reeling at the thought of trying to get up and be productive. I’m trying to make it through the day without sobbing randomly so as not to concern my fellow classmates but it’s getting harder and harder. I feel like I am a waste of resources and a financial burden on my family. I can’t get the thought that everyone I try to talk to is tired of me and doesn’t feel like dealing with all of my issues because they have their own and they don’t have the mental capacity to listen to me. 

I currently realize that I’ve isolated myself from my friends and family. I barely talk to them now. I come off as aloof to them but I actually have nothing to say to them. I can’t say anything. Any thought I have, i shut it down and throw it away cause I convince myself that it isn’t worth hearing. 

I want to be better. I’m trying to be positive but I can’t do the things I used to be passionate about. I want to sing and play guitar but I can’t even look at it without getting angry. I have no creative energy to paint or draw or write. I want to be an artist but I barely have the energy to get out of bed. How am I gonna find the motivation for becoming a successful artist?

19,"I feel empty, slow, and so tired. I’m not really suicidal anymore but I’m probably depressed again. I see no hope, no point of trying. I’ve given up on college for now because I’ve changed my mind so many times. I’m probably getting a new job which is great but it won’t let me be in school due to the extensive training and I don’t have any online classes left to take before I  would start my bachelors. So I’m broke and not in school, cleaning toilets to get by. 

I sometimes tell my boyfriend how I feel but it upsets him so much to see me sad that it’s not worth sharing how I feel anymore. I’ve been on almost every anti depressant ever made in the past so that’s not worth trying again. ",11Jan2019,1
