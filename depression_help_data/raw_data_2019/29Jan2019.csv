0,"I am starting to hate my job. I feel like everyone is out to get me, that they want me to quit. I cant talk to anyone there because they all talk to each other and word gets around. The office politics get to me, and I work no where near that department. I work in a hospital helping patients. I feel like I give all that I have but it is not enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. 

Have to go in tomorrow. I'm trying to have a good attitude but I dont know if I can.. 

I try to keep to myself and just do my job but sometimes it doesn't seem to help.

1,"I don’t know where to start so I guess I give my life story.  My father left me as a baby, and my mother lost custody at some point. Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing.  At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didn’t impact me at; first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender.  At first, I didn’t realize this, and I’ve never told anyone what happened either.  I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didn’t care until I hit puberty. Around this time, I’m still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didn’t have many friends, maybe 2-3 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didn’t know how to approach any girl for it. My self-confidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks I’m gay and I’m still bullied.   

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay; saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, I’m struggling, staying in one spot in subjects I’m not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot.  To this day, I can’t ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.

&amp;#x200B;

By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games.  I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate.  I move in with my mother at some point,  I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time I’m with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I can’t focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them. To this day,  I’m quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking I’m making it up, you last this long why now you need them.  So yeah,  I don’t ever get it and it always…just something I hate myself for. I just feel like I’m lazy and crap because I can’t focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you don’t have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. I’m only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on. Both take the longest to learn and hardest for me to stay still for. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me. Then I move back in with my grandmother who pretty much hates me or feels like it. Most of my life she told me I never do anything or amount to anything and honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began pro wrestling and been in for about 4-5 years now, but I don’t even have that anymore because of my limit of travel. I’m unable to drive, and I have anxiety trying to drive on an actual street.  I have no reliable ride for it and because of my limitations; I will never get far for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only relationships I’ve had is online ones, and each one never led to meeting in real life. Don’t get me wrong, I wanted too and tried to get there, but it never does. There always an excuse for each person I’ve been with and even recently it has happened. I got no confidence to try a person face to face. But at least with an online relationship, I don’t feel as lonely and keeps some depression away. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, that my life story and how I became who I am now. I do not have anything to look forward to in the morning, and I curse at myself for now randomly dying in my sleep. I feel like shit and the thoughts of suicidal grows stronger with each day.  Make matters worse,  it has become easier for me to gain weight and harder to lose weight as I age. So every time I eat, I just feel awful.  I’m going bald, my vision and my hearing is getting worse.  Often told I look like a 40-year-old man or something.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, I can’t even work longer than 20 hours, and even then it feels like it pushing it. Every time I work longer than those hours I get so stressed out and my depression grows worse. I could get more hours, but when I do, I feel worse about myself. But because I don’t my family looks further down on me. I look down on myself, I feel like this waste of space lazy piece of shit.  I just don’t know what to do anymore, I just feel like anything I try or will ever try will be meaningless. I feel like I’m constantly in an endless void, like stuck in the middle of the sea while unable to swim. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I try to find love, it can only be online and they will always have zero interest in meeting the real me.  So it will always be the same result just a different person. If I try to further my education, I can’t ever stay focus enough to make any progress and that always repeat. If I work more I feel more stress  out about everything and grow more depress. If stay where I am, I’m constantly being looked down on and be called lazy. I’m growing older and fatter, I don’t have anything or able to gain nothing. I do not know what do anymore and taking my own life is constantly feel like the best solution to end the madness.

3,"I’m always being negative. I complain about everything and I don’t like anything or anyone. I have nothing nice to say about anything that happens in my life or daily life. People complain about me complaining because I never try to just have fun and be positive, which makes me more mad and sad. I never make jokes, I never give compliments anymore, I’m always just complaining about everything and people hate it. It’s very hard to be positive when I cannot see anything positive happening. I don’t know how to be positive or ignore the negative and focus on the positive. I don’t know how to see the good in people, because I believe everyone is selfish or an asshole. Why am I like this? From what I can tell, by hearing other people’s perspectives, it’s not normal. I’m very depressed, and I don’t know how to be positive or get out of this hole. I am doomed to never have good relationships with anyone and it sucks. Everything is just shitty and everyone hates me because I’m this way. I have no idea what to do and I’m getting very fed up with everything.

My family is horrible; the family member I live with in particular is the worst. She is holding me financially hostage, making me pay for everything which is preventing me from saving up to move out; then she guilts me into paying more by saying that without me giving her my paychecks, she and her dog would die on the streets. My mom is a nasty narcissistic jerk who only talks to me to ask for money to pay her bills, and yells at me for basically everything else I do wrong, since she never wanted me in the first place.

Everyone I know lies to me, won't talk to me, ignores me, and/or talks about me negatively behind my back.

I have no one to talk to, no one to listen, no one to hold my hand or hug me and tell me that they're there for me when I need them.

I cry at work, I cry alone in my room, and I cry myself to sleep every night; fighting back against the thoughts that everyone would be happier without me, and that everyone would be better off if I just killed myself.

8,"I’m just... done. 

My medicine isn’t working. My doctor put in a referral for a behavioral doctor which made me feel like a freak but that was almost 4 weeks ago. Nothing has happened and I feel like no one really cares enough. 

I’m realizing that I care way more about my friends than they do about me. A few of my friends suffer from depression and I’m constantly offering support and help and anything they need and I just never receive an “are you okay?” Or “how are you” in return. I kind of think I don’t have any true friends who actually genuinely care about me at all. 

My mom is my best friend but when I have down days she gets tired of my constant “I love you’s” or asking if she’s okay. (I get anxiety that she’s upset with me). 

My school semester is my toughest yet and I’m four weeks in and already crumbling. I got accepted into my dream program which adds 2 more years and I just feel like I can’t take it anymore. 

I just really want it all to go away and I don’t know what to do. I feel like such a failure going in and crying to my therapist about all of this because I know that people have such bigger issues plaguing their lives than my small issues. I just feel really alone and I don’t have anyone I can reach out to. I don’t know what to do. ",29Jan2019,1
9,"I have been feeling depressed for about 2 years now after a certain event. Now that I look back at it, it wasn't even that traumatic, all that happened was that someone told me that nobody liked me because I try too hard to be nice (I always tried my best to be kind and optimistic) and I took the insult to heart. That one event just somehow ruined my life and I don't know why. Ever since then, I've stopped being nice since I was afraid that what he said was true even though I hate being mean. This made me lose a lot of friends and I regret every bit of it, but for some reason I still refuse to be nice. Eventually, I started hiding all my emotions and masking them with a straight face so I couldn't hurt anyone. It has gotten to the point that I haven't cried in more than a year and can't even cry when I really want to. About two months ago, I've been wondering wether or not I was depressed, but I always have these happy moments that make me question myself. Since I'm only 14 years old, I always feel like I'm too young to be depressed and that I'm faking it for attention. I just don't know myself at all anymore. The combination of my confusion and me hiding my emotions has made me resort to cutting myself to relieve all the stress. I hate the pain, but it's the only thing that keeps me going anymore. I would ask for professional help, but I'm scared that I would make my parents worry. They would (literally) get worried sick and I don't think I'd be able to cope with making my parents worry so much.

I feel kind of useless asking for help on the internet instead of asking for help from professionals, but at this point I have no other choice.",29Jan2019,1
10,"      I recently have been feeling lost with everything crashing down around me. For reference when I was in high school I was diagnosed with social anxiety and clinical depression. I took pills and they never seemed to work. I stayed the overweight quite kid throughout my entire high school experience. I talked to next to no one. I felt like dying every moment I was awake. I think this stinted my social growth.

        Shortly after high school my life started to change I grasped onto cooking as my passion and began the process of getting into shape. In a year's time I went from 315 lbs to 200. I was improving in everything around me except my social skills seemed to still be lacking. At heart I was still the same quite kid. 

       I'm now 21 and I still feel like I'm slowly improving but, I still see that I almost can't conquer feelings of self loathing about my overall social capability. I still struggle to build and maintain relationships ( friendships and otherwise). I've never been able to be in a loving relationship with someone, I've had flings but nothing more. I actively want to do something with my life, such as going to culinary school, but I feel like I would move and be friendless the entirety of the time I'm down there. 

        I'm wondering if anyone has had similar feelings of fear and loathing about their situation. I no longer feel like I want to die, I want to improve but have no clue how to approach it. Im willing to try anything to conquer my social standing. I'm a lonely person by nature and I want to fix it and expand my social circle. Help...

15,"hi,

frankly I'm here to hear some motivational words. I've been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. I've been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and I'm going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. I've been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as I've had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, I'm really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 1/2 months just broke up with me because he said that I've been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I can't believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. He's shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop 'feeling grumpy'. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dad's place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I can't catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. 

I'm so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean it's good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that won't be there for them during difficult times. I'm just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. I'm probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this  situation better, as I fear that I might self-harm.",29Jan2019,1

17,"So I’m 15 and for most of my life I’ve been treated not badly but like I’m really different as if there were something wrong with me  (pretty much only in school since kindergarten). Other than that I’ve always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan (my mums side, ill get to why that’s important later) was diagnosed with dementia (other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody). In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years (when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeks/months old) suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didn’t have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months (tear down my face as I’m writing this). The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died (I still don’t have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened), and although I don’t feel sad about not having him as I’m used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives (although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times). There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder (I will say I don’t think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up). There’s heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when I’m not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion (I know he’s a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans). I’m failing at school since year 8 and I’m always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me I’m an intelligent kid but I’m just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all C’s and turned it into C’s and one D. I can’t focus on anything important in class, I can’t remember stuff and it feels like everything I’ve explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind would’ve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my “boring” parents. I don’t know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also don’t want to know if there’s something wrong, I don’t want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. I’m sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if there’s anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know what’s wrong with me because I want to seek help but I don’t want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me I’m just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I don’t know what I’m talking about but I just don’t want to keep feeling like this. If this isn’t depression then I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.",29Jan2019,1
