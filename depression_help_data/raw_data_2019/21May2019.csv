but here's the thing he seems to like me and he tells me I'm amazing and beautiful, but he's conflicted with himself he tells me he doesn't know If he truly likes me or if he truly knows what he wants. he says he feels numb and lacks interest in things he likes doing. he has low self-esteem and says he's never been in a relationship before. when we are together he does things that make me think he likes me like kissing me and just talking about something kinda personal. 

ive been very patient with him because I care about him and he's unlike any guy ive been with so far 

I also struggle with being depressed (I'm diagnosed bipolar) 

im being selfish for wanting a relationship with him because I know and understand how he feels but I just want him to be mine and it'd honestly kill me if we were just friends 

I feel safe with him and comfortable with him--I need that but I also want to know what I should or shouldn't be doing so I don't scare him away or make an ass of myself 

&amp;#x200B;

please help me!!!

&amp;#x200B;

ps--if this guy sees this post and knows its about him  just know im only writing this because I care and I want something more than a friendship with you because I see so so sooo much potential and value in you and you make me smile for no reason--all I want is for you to feel something similar :)",21May2019,2

3,"Hey guys, 

I apologise ahead of time for the poor grammar and punctuation of this message... I'm typing on the phone and it's not as easy to write out in the amount of time I still have this feeling/inspiration in my mental... I'm jus trying no to loose it (feeling/inspiration)

I first would like to say thank you for your help... More importantly thanking you for listening and taking the time to answer a total strangers rant... That means alot...

Yesterday I posted here what was feeling. I felt as though I was unhappy with my life up until this point... I really just really felt that I've been living in a viscous cycle of clusterfuck for a very long time... I didn't want to live another year bringing in the same shit... So I bared it all the day before my birthday... Today, I am committing to rebuilding myself... 

I  initially felt like there was a whole lot of things to obtain at once and it felt like I was looking at a huge mountain and not having anything to help me climb it... 

I feel as though now I have a place to start...

I have been told this a million times in 26 years: 

You don't show me you want It enough
You have no follow through
You start things but you don't Finnish
You go all in and then you stop showing progression
You make promises you don't keep

My self analysis is this:

I go into things fired up... I know that I want it... I know my expectations... I believe that I can meet them... Things are great, The idea is good, I'm enjoying the process, I'm enjoying learning, I'm enjoying growing... Then I loose steam almost immediately... My initial feelings dissapear, and go back to what it is normally... Nonchalant, or Apathetic... I still want it, I still desire it, I still believe I can do the thing... But now I'm constantly having to push past that just to do a simple action... And the more I push past it it's like the further away it gets... I'm fighting myself to do simple things, not to mention hard ones...

Example: Someone asked me to do something simple... log my day to day activities... The first 10 days was easy it was good but the closer I get to day 10 the more numb I get to the action the more dull it felt... It became hard to push myself to do it, even though it was a simple fucking task...

What's worse is I understand that it's bad and I fucked up but I feel noting towards it... I'll tell myself you need to do this... But my base feelings don't push me... 

I literally feel nothing most days actually...

This has seeped into every aspect of my life..

Work- I will be late at times
School- All A's and B's up untill midterms... By midterms and after... I've already checked out... I can't ever Finnish a semester with out it happening by midterms...
Being on a team- People see this as judging my passion, and my believe in myself... And no matter how much I try to explain this none seem to get it...
My own goals plans and Schedules and aspirations- I start by thinking this time will be different only to end up the same fucking way each time...

If anyone can help I would appreciate the feedback and thank you for taking the time to read and respond...",21May2019,1
5,I hate myself and and extremely depressed and feel like my life is falling apart I just honestly want to die,21May2019,3
6,"First of all this is really stupid and I feel ridiculous posting it. Second, **GoT SPOILERS** ahead.

During like S2 or 3 of GoT, right when I started watching, I had a really bad episode and tried to kill myself. Desperate people cling to things to stay afloat, and I clung to Daenerys Targaryen. She’d been through worse versions of some of what I’d been through and she was better because of it. She was like my antidote to the injustices of reality, because she was an unapologetic and amazing hero. She freed slaves and stopped rapes and always tried to do the right thing, and the existence of a character like that meant something to me. Her strength genuinely helped save me. 

When everyone figured out what was gonna happen to her (like a year ago, you know?) I got pissed off and stopped watching, because that felt like a betrayal. I don’t like that her strength and courage is just a precursor to madness. I don’t like what it says about women or female characters or whatever. But not liking how a show/book goes is nbd, you know? It sucks but so what. 

But now that it actually went down exactly how I knew it would (I mean all I personally figured out was that the people who actually figured out it was gonna go down like that were right), I’m genuinely like not okay, in a way that doesn’t feel like tv is supposed to make you feel. 

I’ve been super upset about character deaths and I’ve been super disappointed by arcs or plots or seasons. I’ve been moved by tv shows enough to be upset for days or to cry or to have to fix it in my head. That’s part of watching tv, and it doesn’t bother me any more than it bothers anyone else. But this is some other thing that I don’t really understand, and I am just drowning. 

Like, somehow this is about society to me instead of about the show or the character. It’s like I feel like society let me down or doesn’t have my back or something. Like I’m alone and in danger. I don’t know how to describe it, and anything I say about it is going to sound really stupid. And I know that people have real attachments to characters and stuff, but that’s not what this is. I don’t feel like I wanna know Daenerys I’m real life or something at all. I definitely don’t like want her sexually or romantically (I’m a straight woman.) This isn’t a waifu thing or even whatever the Platonic version of a waifu would be. 

I don’t know what this is, and it sucks. 

K thanks for listening, I know this is ridiculous and that I’m not conveying my feelings well",21May2019,2
7,"Not sure if i will post this, or if anyone is ever going to read this, but i feel like writting this down might help me somehow.

I am feeling weird, in fact, i feel sad. I am not sure why. I shouldn't be. Im studying for free in one of the best universities in my country, im working part time and getting paid above average , i have amazing parents, brothers, family. For some reason it doesnt seem enough to me.

I am afraid of not being enough, and i hate it. Im currently 21 and i see a lot of people doing better than me. I know theres a lot of people in worse situations but for some reason i dont care about being ""ahead"" of these people , but i care about being ""behind"" of those others.

I have never been in a relationship and have just a few friends. It makes me feel bad knowing that im getting older, and i am still alone.

Sometimes im feeling extremely ugly and after some days i feel pretty good. I go to the gym pretty often and i know my body looks good but sometimes i look at the mirror and feel like someone would never talk to me.


Im doing bad at college now, my grades are not good and i'm gonna have to re-do some of that. This will delay my graduation up to a year. So i'll be a year late, because im not good enough to get a decent grade.


I hate complaining. My problems are so small compared to whats going on in the rest of the world. But i feel like i needed to vent. The odds of me even existing is this world is so small that i should never even think on complaining about something, looks dont matter as much as i think, confidence is super important. Part of me knows this stuff but for some reason knowing this doesnt help me at all.",21May2019,3
9,I feel as though all the important people in my life have been rejecting me - specifically this last month. My dad called me incompetent for failing my first class last semester and told me I needed to snap out of my mental health crap. One of my best friends started dating my cousin(who is essentially an older brother to me) and then stabbed me and my gf in the back by moving out of the house we were renting together 2 weeks before the lease renews and telling our landlord it was our fault she moved out. My cousin and aunt are 100% on her side. Idk I'm just really overwhelmed with money stuff and i just havent felt this lonely since I was 15 with no friends.,21May2019,2
10,"I'm making this post because I feel like I've found something so powerful that I owe it to the world to try to help at least one person by sharing my story. I'm confident that utilizing these tools will help you change your life and combat depression in a way that I once thought impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick Background:** I've been depressed since childhood but wasn't diagnosed until a couple years ago. Depression used to beat the \*\*\*\* out of me, I attempted suicide a couple times in my childhood and was hospitalized because of suicidal thoughts about a year ago.

Outside of being depressed almost 24/7, I live a pretty normal life, go to college, live on my own, and have dope friends. However, the past couple years outside these recent months, I was severely depressed . For long stretches, I couldn't take care of myself, couldn't eat, sleep, shower, go to class, work, I was paralyzed. All I'd do is smoke and drink and play video games to try to numb the pain.

**Breaking The F\*\*\*ing Wheel:**

They say the definition of insanity is trying something over and over and expecting different results. So I finally decided to make some major changes in my day to day life to try to become a better and happier person.

**\[GAME CHANGING APPS\]**

I decided to surf the app store in hopes of finding something to help me get organized and ended up stumbling on an ABSOLUTE GEM. The app is called ""Productive"",

[Productive](https://i.redd.it/zzgi0jskkhz21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

This app lets you set habits, tasks, and goals that you want done and allows you to break it up by morning, afternoon, evening, or all day. You swipe right to mark tasks as done and swipe left when you skipped a task. Holding yourself accountable using this app can help you more than you could imagine. Take it slow start with a few habits and as you master those add more.

On the productive app I have tasks titled, ""Check to do list"" and ""Write to do list"". I also found a great app for keeping track of your to do list called ""Wunderlist"".

[Wunderlist](https://i.redd.it/kv1sc57nkhz21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been one to carry a planner, journal, utilize a calendar or notes. This put me at such a disadvantage, My mind would often be racing with thoughts, so I'd forget things even though in my heart I intended on doing it. Each night I'll write things in my ""Daily"" category, those are task that need to be completed the next day. ""Homework"" and ""Appointments"" are self explanatory and ""Future Tasks"" are things that need to be done and kept in the back of my mind but not asap.

\****DISCLAIMER***\*: EVERYONE HAS TIME TO MEDITATE

90% of the time I have 0 desire to meditate. However, every time I force myself to do it I feel great afterwards. I really can't describe how meditation has helped me concretely outside of I feel at peace. I'm now able to truly live in the moment and calm myself down when needed. I have Meditation as a daily task in the ""Productive"" App. The app I use for meditation is called ""Calm"".

\*Screenshot of the Calm's calendar feature that displays your meditation history\*

[Calm](https://i.redd.it/rvbxvt5pkhz21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody is perfect! Even on days when you really don't feel like it they have mini meditation(1-5 min) and even after the shortest one, you come out feeling amazing.

**Drugs, Alcohol, and Journaling:**

I used to have to be high 24/7 and if I wasn't high I was trying to drink. Typical pain numbing shit. But man you can say what you want but imo weed negatively affects my ability to converse. Which meant no talking to girls cuz I'm too high can't think of anything to say minds blank. So now I try to keep drinking to once a week and thats the goal for weed. However, I smoked 24/7 so stopping straight up obviously isn't easy. As of right now I'm proud that I keep the weed to night time no problem (nothing like a goodnight blunt). I'm really only smoking a few days out of the week I'm a work in progress and still trying. Anyways I found an awesome app to keep track of your addictions called ""I Am Sober"".

[I Am Sober](https://i.redd.it/v5ujy5fqkhz21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by saying ""Social Media"" is code for ""Porn"". I do this because I can casually explain tracking how often I drink and smoke but ""Porn"" might be a little sus to explain. (Also I'm not addicted to porn just trying to greatly reduce it and as I type that I'm realizing that's probably what a porn addict would say :/ )

My favorite part of this app is that at the end of each day you report back if you were sober or not. When you do this they also give you a bunch of emotions and activities to choose from to describe how you felt and what you did that day. You then are given a spot to type out anything you want to remember about the day. I've been using this feature as a journal. Really short and sweet post but it's been awesome to see my journey and ups and downs from day to day. There's a lot more to this app like each addiction has it's own little twitter like community, where you can post after each milestone: 1 day, 2 day, etc...but im going to leave it at that.

**\[GAME CHANGING BOOKS\]**

\*Audible is godly utilize it\* \*First book is free just sign up and cancel the membership\*

This post is getting long so I'm going to keep the books short and sweet but their importance in shaping and changing my life is massive.

1. ""Models"" by Mark Manson: this book helps you become a better overall person and teaches you how to get girls. Literally two birds one stone. Amazing book people will vouch.
2. ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" by Robert A. Glover: if you think you might be a ""nice guy"" or have ""nice guy"" tendencies read this book. Helps with setting boundaries and standing up for yourself, but that's just scratching the surface. Amazing book people will vouch.
3. ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle: this book will help you in so many ways I can't even put it into words. Mind blowing book that's helped my depression immensely. Literally will change the way you live life. People better vouch.

**ADVICE**

Strive to get better everyday. Each day's a new opportunity for growth and improvement. Self awareness and patience are major keys to unlocking your true potential. Actively trying to do better will make you feel better. Knowledge is power. Try to limit the social media use. Go to the gym even though you don't feel like it. (Most people don't feel like it but always feel better after pushing through and going). Small victories count, take the time to say good job to yourself when you do something good. Lastly take it ONE DAY AT A TIME.

**TLDR**

I suffer from depression. Used apps and books to fix the way I think and function. I've created a more real and lasting joy. A life where I'm happy for no reason, not because XYZ happened for me or because of drugs and alcohol. I wanted to share this because I'm so confident it can help someone else who's given up or feels hopeless. (I still have bad days but they have become thousands of times more manageable thanks to these tools)

The two of us had a nice time at least, and afterwards I went to the movies because that usually de-stresses me and puts me in a better mood. Not 12 minutes of the movie went by before the power went out. Just my luck right? Wait! It gets better!

16,"Ive been depressed because i feel very unimportant and i wanna kill myself because i feel like a burden to my parents. I love them very much and they dont need a daugther like me to feed me everyday and give me somethings because i feel unworthy.
 
Since grade 1 till now im shy, unsocial, an very quiet so i dont have that much friends. Im also dumb for being the only girl on the row of low grades. Im ugly, and all! Everythings no good on me. When someone insults me, i take it too much inside (but i dont show what i felt). Ive decided to train myself to change all that then i finally become a bit social and got improved grades. I joined school activity and everything just to make my parents proud, ill do anything to make them proud. Still this time even though a changed a bit, my behavior hasnt still change. 

I always hide negative emotions till now and it have bottled up eversince i was young when my mom always gets mad whenever i cry they tell me to stop crying and they keep cursing, threating, and forcing me to tell the reasons why i did cry even if i dont want to. I dont want to tell them the reason why i feel so down because whenever i tell the reason, mom make me feel bad even more of what she told me about it like all im crying about is nothing and then compare me to other teens and it makes me feel dumb. Thats why i always hide when i feel bad, it made me feel like my feelings arent important to them.

It also applies on my friends, my bestie, i dont know if i should call her bestie anymore. She hurts me so much without her knowing it. I know she had problems but shes avoiding me. When i tell her something, shes always against it and it hits me so bad (she always says dont be assuming when i told her about my crush) i know shes depressed, but its really unfair. When i got depressed (before she did), i dont hurt her at all, i didnt become a cold hearted person like she did. i dont avoid her and all shit you could think of she did to me. I confronted her on chat i burst it all out i said curse words to her because its too much...

Now back about my parents, my parents are overcontrolling. I guess thats why i became shy back then. Im almost 18 and had a lot of friends now. I changed, but my parents never did. Whenever i wanna hang out with my friends and go with them, they always forbid me like they always did and they also forbid me for using cellphones ever since im young. Hmm why are they confusing me? Why cant they cant let me be? I did everything for them to change myself, like i got rid of my shyness and i got friends, i got high grades, i keep every shitty emotions for myself and i always help them on chores. Why do other parents allow their child and not me? I thought they want me to be more open and social.. and they still act the same way i get it that they want me safe but its too much, im almost 18, they seriously need to stop im getting frustrated. Its the first time i got mad at them because they just keep confusing me my whole life

When i got depressed, i almost killed myself. My parents found out and they got mad and cried but the reason is nothing for them when i told them. They just told me theres no reason for me to feel this way. I dont get it why they are always against what im saying, they dont understand me at all.

I love them, i know they also love me but i also hate them for them not knowing how much theyve been killing me inside. Now i feel like they dont deserve me and im hoping to die for them to realize theyve been treating me like a robot. i cant anymore... im did everything im struggling with for them they are too strict. Please help me guys.",21May2019,2
17,"The first time i was depressed I was as a teenager after a severe injury. As soon as i was healed up i got better. The next time i was depressed was after i gave birth to my daughter and at that point it got very serious. I remember feeling like i just wanted to stay in that feeling. It was hard to let it go, even though it wasnt very familiar, it felt good to be so sad. I got help and took my medication for a while and i got better. That was two years ago and ive been amazing since, until about 2 weeks ago. 1 month ago i finally got back into sports and got a sports injury the first week. I recognized it immediately when the depression hit me and i got a little concerned. I've been depressed almost every day, for hours at a time each time since then. I can feel how off my head is and its driving me crazy, yet when it hits i just want to stay in that feeling, I just want to feel it SO bad, even though its incredibly painful for me.

*This is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years. I have been posting a video daily on Youtube and Facebook on my journey to get out of Depression 'Gratitude Bridge'*",21May2019,2
21,"I was talking to a depressed friend of mine of Facebook Messenger and I explained to her what it means to be allowing. Imagine doing your favorite thing to relax of unwind… a hot bath, a glass of wine, reading a book, all of the above… when we do these activities we have absolutely no “resistance” to it, we are completely “allowing” of it with a willingness to slide into the experience fully.

On the other hand, when we are depressed, anxious or experiencing any negative emotion, our tendency is to tense up, resist, not allow it, deny, suppress,  distract ourselves from it, analyze it to try to change it, we criticize ourselves for it and often get depressed and anxious because we are depressed and anxious. To be “allowing” of negative emotions is counter intuitive… to slide into the negative feelings in a relaxed calm way without resistance is very difficult and even painful… it even seems like everything is screaming at you to “stop, why the hell are you doing this!?”

What is the mechanism of being “allowing”? Why is it a good thing to do? Often, we can't use logic to heal intense negative emotions that spring from past trauma. What we need to remember, is that our subconscious (where our depression and anxiety come from) doesn't know that our current situation is not the same as a past trauma. When we experience intense disproportionate negative feelings, it's our subconscious trying to put us on high alert to protect us. This is the primary reason we need to be “allowing” of negative emotions… stay calm and relaxed and slide into every sensation of the experience without resistance. This way our subconscious mind is free to come out and explore and see that we are “allowing,” calm, relaxed… only then can our subconscious realize the danger is not real… or at least not as dangerous as our past trauma.",21May2019,0

23,"Hi  everyone, 

I am a 26 year old woman. I've struggled with depression foe about all my teenage years and early adulthood. One year ago I was suicidal. I left a good bye message on an online support group, but before I had the chance to act on my plan, the people in that group somehow reached out to my uncle, and long story short they rescued me. Since then I've been on antidepressants and in therapy. Some of my issues have improved but I really struggle in romantic relationships. 

My main question is: how can I really know for sure that my partner loves me and is not going anywhere? My therapist explains it as if it  was a simple situation, but for me it's kind of a nightmare. He has  never given me any cause for concern, and I'd say he's generally  trustworthy. But I've learnt the hard way that the world is a terrible place, that people are flaky and inconsistent, and fundamentally cruel. The therapist says, ""love is a choice day after day"", but people are shitty and hurtful and mean, how can I be sure my SO isn't going to hurt me? Love is just a feeling, and feelings are so inconsistent! Yes today he may have strong attraction towards me, but tomorrow? We have been together for two years, but I don't think time is so relevant after all. There are people who cheat on their partners - or even become violent to their partners! - even after 20 years of marriage. 

Sometimes I feel like it's better to bully than to be bullied: that maybe I should have an affair before my SO has even a chance to cheat on me. Sometimes I try to suppress all my feelings towards my boyfriend, and to withhold affection, so if he leaves I won't suffer because I've already shut all my feelings down. I know that this may seem a lot of bullshit but I'm actually in pain. When I was suicidal, I considered myself the most horrible and useless person in the world. Now I've somehow overcome those beliefs, but still I consider myself just an average, mediocre person. So I can't explain how on Earth my SO has bothered wasting two years of his life with me and I'm constantly worried. Did someone of you have the same issues? What helped you?

25,Hi everyone so I am having trouble forgiving myself for a decision I made in the summer before my senior year. I had a girl that liked me and I honestly kind of wanted to date her but I decided not to because she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't want to get my heart broken. Instead that month she decided to date my best friend and break his heart a month later. She then dated another guy in August and broke his heart but in September she found the person she was going to date the whole school year. Honestly I have been extremely down on myself for not making a move at some point. After realizing 2 months ago high school is ending huge regret has set in for not dating her. Every time I see them in the halls or at any school event I just think that could have been us. I just think I ruined my senior year which I had high expectation for. There were some good moments but I run a business and started working out and that ate up almost all of my time. I never sat down and thought about what I did. I will now always remember Prom as a bad night watching her dance with the guy she is dating instead of me. I just feel like a complete failure. I have never had a girlfriend before and I am just afraid I will never find another girl like her or even worse never get the chance to ever date her. I just feel like that social atmosphere that I get from high school will be gone forever and no matter what I do I can never make up for what I lost. I started building my passive income business in sophomore year that makes me about 50k a year without doing any work. Which is great and all however the reason I built my business was not to buy necessarily anything because I am not materialistic at all. I built it for two reasons. First I want to have the freedom to do whatever I want for the rest of my life. I am thankful that that is coming true but what sucks is that most of my friends are moving away and I will have to enjoy this freedom alone. The second reason I built this business is that one day when I meet the girl of my dreams I could make her life great. Sadly I feel like I missed my shot and I just dream of the day I can date her and tell her how much I care about her. We are really good friends today and every time we hang out she always talks to me about becoming a pilot and traveling the world. This may sound crazy but one day I wish I could buy her this small plane she wants and travel around the world with her. I don't have a question really but I am just wondering if someone could give me some advice and tell me if there is a way I can make my social life just as good as it was in high school or is that not possible. Thanks for actually taking the time to read about my life. I sincerely appreciate it.,21May2019,1

27,"I’m 20 and I’ve had a hard couple of years with different family issues which have made me a bit fragile and I find university difficult as I am very much known as a person who “has got it together” and I guess my friends don’t realise how sad I feel sometimes because I find it crucial to “fake it till you make it” to be able to cope. I feel I’m my own worst enemy sometimes because the idea of confiding into friends that I have been feeling sad for a while scares me (I’m naturally a private person when it comes to my own feelings, but love helping others) because I feel that there is a stigma attached to confiding I’m feeling vulnerable and rightly or wrongly, in my first year of university I am afraid of this stigma.

For a long time now I've been dealing with lots of family and social issues, but one thing that has kept me up has been my life in school. Despite me feeling better being around others, I always feel like I'm always chasing after someone, or I'm always the ""next-best"".  Maybe this isn't true, and it's just in my head, but I always end up measuring myself against others, and this can sometimes become saddening. I end up feeling that I'm not enough for my one remaining parent, siblings or friends. Does anyone have any advice?",21May2019,4
31,"I'm a single mom working and going to school full time. I don't have any family in town, closest family is 2.5 hours away. I've lost so many friendships and relationships this year, it's all so overwhelming. I get very little support from baby daddy and I'm running out of money. I'm trying so hard to keep a roof over our heads and a vehicle to get to and from work and school. 

I've suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've tried a therapist but talking about my troubles have never helped me. I've done extensive research on methods to alleviate depression and anxiety so I basically know how to do it, it's just so hard when the world seems to be against you. 

I'm trying to find ways to make more money because finances is my biggest source of stress. 

I'm ready big into video games so I'm going to be streaming on twitch, but I know the income takes time and dedication. I'm afraid I'm going to be too tired to consistently stream. I'm also scared my depression is going to cause me to lose interest because it's done that before. Video games are my life and I've not had the desire to do anything that used to make me happy.

I've started a blog. I know bloggers who have stories to tell and interesting thoughts to speak can make decent money. But like streaming, it takes time and dedication to reap the benefits. I have so much to write about my life and experiences and thoughts, so I shouldn't be out of ideas any time soon. I'm just worried it's not going to be as successful as I hope. I've already invested some money into blogging so I can't give up on it. If anyone wants to read my first blog post and share it with anyone, please feel free!

My first post is about the sexual abuse I endured as a child. It's pretty heavy and brings light to why I'm depressed and anxiety ridden. 

I've started writing stories. Mostly sci fi and horror. I get ideas and start to write them and they begin to form something awesome and then I get discouraged when I can't think of the next scene to write.

I've completely given up on dating and trying to find a man who will come into my life and make it easier. Anyone I've met and tried anything serious with has ended up more struggle than happiness. I'm so heartbroken. I know I'm a good person and I don't deserve to be treated poorly.

I just want to be happy again. Life is doing everything it can to keep me down. I'm a strong person but the strongest people are still only human and can only endure so much. I'm so tired. I'm tired of being tired. Tired of being alone. Tired of trying so hard to keep people in my life when they put sub par effort. Idk how long I can keep this up. I just want to sleep. 

I want to help others with their struggles while also helping myself heal from everything I've been through and still go through. I want to be positive and hopeful. I'm really trying.",21May2019,3
32,"So im prescribed escitalopram(10mg) and Vilazodone Hydrochloride (40mg) which are both SRRIs. I have to take em before sleeping at night. I found that whenever i have a nap in the afternoon or forget taking the medication i get really weird dreams. The first few times they were these fantastical nonsensical horrible nightmares and woke me up. Then gradually the 'scary' part started to dial down a bit, but they are still wayyy fantastical and not at all realistic. They are still very intense experience but not mind shatteringly scary to me,like how you feel on a roller coaster. This doesn't happen much as i usually take my meds on time. But is it normal or anything else even?

I've skipped school maybe 5-6 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I don't even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. I've never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brothers/sister wouldn't be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe (in a weird way, I know) that I could kill myself if I needed to. I haven't skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, there's a ""time limit"" of sorts on when I'm actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I ""have"" to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, I'm not sure why. Today I woke up at 6:30, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that he'd better walk to school ahead of me if he didn't want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 3-4 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, I'd do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, I'm honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I can't deal with it and I don't even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasn't there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I don't end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

I really, really, appreciate any help at all. Feeling really lost right now. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far.",21May2019,108
36,"I have always struggled with depression. I have constant feelings of not being good enough. Lack of self confidence. Life has been a rough road but it's made me who I am. Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasn't going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I don't know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she.

37,"I’m sorry if I do, say or post this wrongly! I’m just desperate and lost. 

Female, 24, diagnosed with severe depressions for a second time...
Long story short... 
I was sexually abused by a classmate for 2 years from the age of 8-10. This has lead to anxiety and a messed up childhood due to my mom never really recovering from what happened to me. Which lead to her being overly strict with me in all aspects of life.
I’ve been bullied throughout pretty much all my years of school up until high school (I did theatre and we were so isolated no one bothered to come bully us). 
I was heavily messed up because of an earlier boyfriend who must have had all kinds of diagnoses and he took out all his shit on me, mostly verbally. This was what lead to me being diagnosed for the first time. I was about 14 then.
Now my family is this huge pile of cluster fuck. Which is what I think might have triggered this round of depressions.
I think I’ve had several rounds of undiagnosed lighter depressions throughout the rest of my life.

I feel so lost.
I feel like I’m not doing good enough in life.
I feel so lonely.
I hate who I am. 
I hate the cards I’ve been dealt. 

I have one thing in life that keeps me going, and that’s my poor boyfriend, who never knew what he got himself into when he met me. I love him more than anything. But he isn’t always much help as his social skills aren’t always the best and his not the greatest at communicating. And that’s alright, really, I jus wish I wasn’t putting him through all this, and I just wish I could be better for him, he deserves so much better than me! But I also don’t want him to leave me! I don’t know how I’d continue living without the one good thing I have in my life...

The two of us had a nice time at least, and afterwards I went to the movies because that usually de-stresses me and puts me in a better mood. Not 12 minutes of the movie went by before the power went out. Just my luck right? Wait! It gets better! As we're all in line to get free passes for a future show, someone in the line reminds me of my college girlfriend, who at one time I thought I was going to marry.

So recently I’ve been talking to this girl who I’m very sure I love, I’ve known her for 10 or so years and we dated when we were a lot young. We were VERY close, like talked each other out of suicide on separate occasions over the years. She helped me get through one of the worst times of my life when I was falsely accused of a sexual harrasment/assault thing by my cousin who lived with us (she was like a sister to me) and every one assumed I did it even when it was eventually cleared up with proof the she had done it just to get away from my parents so she could move in with other family memebers who’d let her smoke and drink at home. This destroyed me for a long time, I’d get death threats, phone calls at night and people looked at me different. The girl who in talking to now was the only person who believed me and kept me going if it wasn’t for her I’d be dead. I went on to screw her over because of my issues from that and drove her away when all she wanted was to be with me. She ended up getting married but before she did she tried to reconnect with me to see if I still felt that way and I was just to busy drinking to care. She moved after that and is back now, been back for a month or so and she’s getting divorced. We’ve been taking non stop and it’s made me happier than I’ve been in a long time, but the other night she said something that kind of fucked me up, she asked me why I liked talking to her so much and I told her about how she made me happy and how funny I find her. Then she replied with how she felt and said “Honestly, I think it’s because you actually enjoy talking to me and I can tell haha. I like when people enjoy my company, etc.” which to me sounds like a not very good thing to say to somone. Should I just try to stop talking to her? I would be ok just being her friend cause she great but I mean that doesn’t sound like something you’d want a friend to say to you.
