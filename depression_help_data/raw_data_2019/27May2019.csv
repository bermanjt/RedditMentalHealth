1,"My wife is away on a work assignment for almost half a year. She's losing weight, getting active, and getting out and socializing. I'm happy for her. She deserves to enjoy life. She's an amazing woman.

I don't think she feels like she can be like that with me. I get it. Not much brings me joy in my life other than being able to see my family happy. I have no interest in things like hiking or camping. I don't like going out much because I have to be in bed by 10 or I have a very rough day emotionally the next day. I know I'm boring.

She's been looking at motorcycles. I have no interest in them. She talks about staying in an apartment instead of buying a house and just traveling a lot.  She loves life.

I'm pretty sure when she gets back, she's going to realize that I don't have anything to offer her other than stability of income and that I'll never leave her. 

I'm just not a fun loving guy. Fun means something is getting neglected that's going to come back and bite me on the ass. Fun means I've neglected something. Fun means that something bad is going to happen because that's what always happens. Fun now always means suffering later.

So I'm pretty sure that she's going to be done with me. And I can't blame her. 

I feel like I have a question and need help, but I can't even figure out what the question is. 

When you actually fear fun and joy what's the point? Nobody needs someone like that in their life.

Do I just say, ""Okay, buy a bike, go travel, have fun with friends, I'll be here when you get back. I'd be alright with that but why would she be? I can't see why anyone would.",27May2019,14
2,"I've been feeling like a piece of trash lately. I'm not doing anything for myself. Any free time that i have, i spend it in bed, doing nothing. I only go out to work, and only because I have to, but it's getting harder to get through the day as being at work is not easy to tolerate for me. 

I don't work out anymore, have been skipping meals and either sleep too much or too little. I'm paying less attention to myself and my responsibilities and I'm worried this is gonna ruin my life sometime soon. 

What should I do?",27May2019,2

I seem to focus squarely on the mistakes, and try desperately to fix them.
I met this girl and I never got her number, but told her I would add her on social media.
I never got added..I am still trying to find a way in,but all I can do is mourn.

I believe in you!! I’m proud of you for fighting this long!! Know that you have someone that loves you, cares for you, and is on your side when you think the whole universe is against you. My inbox is open to whomever needs it (I might just need some time to get a reply out). Don’t let anyone dull your sparkle!!

6,"I'm not happy. I can't remember the last time I've been happy. I'm on medication, and it helps a lot, but it's not enough to get me over the hump.

I work full time. 8 to 5 every day. My job leaves me absolutely exhausted and it's a struggle to wake up in the morning. I make ends meet, but I can't afford my own place or a car. I can't eat out, but I don't have to worry about being able to buy groceries.

Let's face it: I'll never find a gal who wants to spend her life with me. I have horrible people skills and I have a hard time relating to others. I'm incredibly unattractive. It's a struggle to make it through a conversation.

I have no friends in the area. One friend is in California and the other is clear over on the other side of the state. On top of that, I haven't been super great at staying in touch with them.

I can't help but wonder . . . What's the point? I'm never going to find that ""special someone."" Maybe there will be a time when I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, and maybe someday I'll have a higher status in society, but I don't see myself ever being any happier than I am now, no matter what happens in my life.

I've always wanted to be a father. The hardest part about it all is that I'm losing hope for that. That image of the future is what got me through the day, but to be honest it's not working anymore. I have a hard time believing that it's possible.

There's a particular sports car that I've had my eyes on since I was a kid. I had a little model of it that my parents got for me, and I played with it constantly. I still have that toy, in fact; it's scuffed and scratched, but you can see that it was well-loved. Some time ago I started an investment account to someday purchase that car. I've only got about one grand in it, and I can only afford to budget $5 per month for it (plus loose change), and on top of that I've had a negative overall APY, but the point is that I'm trying.

Every morning I tell myself that one day I'll be happy, and I look at this bank account as evidence, but deep down I know that *stuff* doesn't buy happiness, and the power of that bank account over my mood fades a little more.

How can I find a reason to live?",27May2019,12

(Sorry about spelling errors and typos, i dont have my glasses on lol)

So, i will be going into my senior year of high school, and it just hit me, i dont have friends. When i started 9th grade, i was best friends with this girl who we’lk call lylah. Here’s some background about lylah and i, we met in 8th grade, durring that year, i was planning to kill myself. I had everything planned out, my means,   My note, and i even made a list of people to invite to my funeral. On the last day before i was going to go through with it, i met lylah at the lunch table where some of my elementry school friends sat. She was so nice to me, she was the most kind person in my life at that time since my dad is phyiscally and emotionally abusive. I developed somewhat of an obsession with being her friend, which looking back, was really creepy. I had an episode where i cut my wrists. They werent deep, but there were a lot of cuts and a lot of blood. I showered and disinfected the cuts with peroxide. The next day, i wore a jacket (i live in florida, so that was dumb) and lylah noticed me in pain whenever i had to move in a way which irritated the cuts. She and i would both leave a little early to get to the busses so she stopped me and pulled up my sleeve, after that, we became close. A day or so later, i was bakeracted (72 hr hold, which ended up being a week because the nurses messed up and didnt call my parents). When i got home, my father got drunk, started picking at my insecurities, and then he told me “you should have gone through with killing yourself”lylah helped calm me down and keep me from doing anything. Come freshmen year, lylah, and a few of my other middle school “friends” were trying to get used to the whole high school thing. Lylah started acting different, she would start inviting me to the local rec center, but only as a front so she could be alone with her boyfriend. I kept telli ng her that i didnt feel comfortable with doing that, but she didnt care. After doing that for a few months, she broke up with said boyfriend, and naturally, i said i wanted to fight him, i was only half joking, but then, right after i texted that to her, the boyfriend (we can call him theo) messaged me talking crap. All throughout that school year, people from our new group dropped lylah. They urged me to do the same, they saw how she mistreated me. When i finally did, i felt amazing. As sophomore year came
About, all of my friends were gone. No one messaged me over the summer to hang out, i was alone again. I started sitting with these people at lunch who became my new group. After a while They began treating me like i didnt exist. When i stopped showing up for lunch, they didnt even notice. I didnt eat lunch after that. Next, junior year. My mom and i escaped my dad, i sat with 2 people from my previous table, but they were a couple. The girls name will be lizzy, the guys name will be gabe. Lizzy and gabe would actually listen to me. I now know that gabe didnt like me, and lizzy didnt tell me to spare my feelings. By september, i discovered that my grandma was diagnosed with cancer. I transferred to online school to take care of. 
no. one. Noticed. That. I. Left. By november, she passed, and they finally reached out and asked where i was. Im going back for my last year, and i just dread it, there are so many people that i know who claim to be my friend, but none of them noticed when i would stop speaking louder to be heard, when i stopped showing up, when i stopped being present. I dont wanna hold it against them, theyre busy with their own lives, but is it selfish to say that they are wrong for not noticing anything? I dont want to be pittied, i want someone to care about me like i do them. Even though all of these people did me wrong, if they needed a shoulder to cry on, id be there. I hate to think that they viewed me as a charity case, if id known that, i wouldnt have even made an effort with them.",27May2019,3
8,"So i've been on various medications and combinations thereof for depression (with psychotic features), for the past seven years, with pretty disappointing results. 

Last week, my pdoc started me on a super low dose of lithium, 150mg a day, and to be honest, i was pretty suspicious of it and still am, given the side effects. So far, I've cried three times this week, over fairly mundane things (sad songs, accidentally hurt my friend's dog while trying to stop him from eating chocolate cake), which is extremely weird for me, because I usually can't cry even over extreme situations. I've also had conversations where I get actually involved in what's being said, rather than being bored and just wanting to escape, which is how i usually feel when i'm talking to people. 

Is it possible that this is related to the medication? I've read people with bipolar disorder say that it made them feel slower or duller, but this seems to be the opposite effect. Also does lithium even start having an effect this soon after you start it? I took my first dose one week ago exactly.",27May2019,2

11,"Hi... Not sure what to say but I guess I can start with me sharing what I suffe with... I have BP2, panic disorder and PTSD( oh and Fibromyalgia). I see a Pyschiatrist and therapist to help with this.

Ok, let me explain today... It has been the worst day in my life. I have a boyfriend who suffers from alcoholism and he relaspe today. He was so drunk he told m I ruined his life and how I don't care about our relationship because I don't bring in any cash. 
How i ruined his life because I don't help financially.

I dont work for many reasons from mentally to physically but I have been doing more then I thought I ever could. I started going out more and trying to do work with apps but since I only walk I don't maken any money but it is a step ive been trying.

While we were arguing over the same things he's been saying over and over the past 3 days. He feels that I don't seem to know how bad things are since we're also losing our apartment due to missmanaging our money. he is a bike courier and spent a ton on his bike essentials. He also buys me cannabis for my pain and mental health, and not to mention his mental health but yet its my fault.


Maybe it is but I'm trying to get out of my depression to help more but its so hard and he argued that I don't seem to care.  That theres a disconnect because I can't see his pain but I do. I'm just in pain too but I'm doing my best by going to therapy.

I ended finding his card because my friend sent me 15 on hisl bank card for food since I haven't eaten.   I shouldn't of offered him food but I wanted him to eat something. As I was walking out the door to get food, he grabs me and checks my pocket for his card but I hid it in my bra. He yells at me keeps asking for the card but I lied and said I didn't have it because i knew he would want MY money for beer. He kept pushing me around and said I was stealing his card and tells me he is calling the cops. 

When I heard him call, he said that hism gf that is bipolar and whatever else he added assaulted him. So I get really hurt that he is doing this to me. I ripped the phone from his hands land stated he is drunk. Then after that I ran out the door.

I wait outside and my bf comes out and starts searching me again. This time it's VERY pyshical and I push him off me and run, he then chases me and I see lady walking her dog and I dunno why but I ran to her for help. Then my bf gets behined me and chokes me by wrapping his arm on my neck. Not sure if he knew he was choking me because he is drunk. Then the lady said something and he stopped.


Then he leaves me alone after searching my pockets and me lying that it's at home that I threw it. I just stayed outside. I just wanted to tell the cops that I never assaulted him. I was deathly afraid of the whole situation.


So the cops come a little after everything. 

As soon after the cop stepped out I just ran to him and hugged him. I was just so scared and seeing a cop just made me feel like I was safe.


I explain that I didn't assault him. That he relaspe and started blaming me for ruining his life. That I have audio on how he said I should kill myself. I mention I did have the card but it's my money inside it. I told them I haven't eaten much because of his drinking. That the money was given to me for food.


They asked to talked to him but i just said it may make things worse. Then they said he wasn't picking up his phone anyways but if I let them in they can talk to him. So I let them in. They knocked on the door and he answered only to be very rude to them. One cop said ""he's being a dick"" that just that few seconds they believed me. I just cried when I felt I was in the wrong because I blame myself for everything but hearing that, it made me feel like I wasn't at fault for once.

Then they ended up asking if I knew anyone here that can help me stay the night at their place.  I told them no... I'm from Cali and I came here to get better. I only know him.  They ended up talking me into staying at the station till he calms down and they. Can get me shelter if I needed. I agreed.


So I'm here... Wondering if my relationship is ended. Crying because I love him and I want to help him despite me hearing him say how I should die and that I ruined his life because he was helping me.



I just know people will say I should leave anyways but for me, this is a mental break down and I can't just leave him. He's just in need of help and as his partner. This is where I prove myself that I will be there for him.


Thank you for reading this messed up and crappy written story.",27May2019,3
12,"So.. how do I start.. I'm 21 and I have recently been watching myself go down this hole. It's been three weeks of this sadness I have in my life and I do not know how much longer this will go on for. I don't want to believe that maybe I am having some kind of depression crisis but it's starting to seem so. Going back to when I was 18, I decided that I wanted to be a pop singer while going to school at the same time (just hoping my singing career would take off). Singing has been the only interesting thing about me and who I am for my whole life, it's the only thing I feel like I am good at (I was always bullied and hated but when I sang all of that hate disappeared in that moment)... Anyway, at 18 I was happy, going to school, working, planning on continuing this ""star"" journey with my closest friend but not really working towards the goal properly and thinking that it would ""magically"" happen if you know what I mean. very delusional... I always dreamt about it but a dream is of course just a dream without hard work and in this case destiny/luck is needed too. I know I can sing well but I never really tested the other aspects like performing and captivating a crowd, showing others a star worthy personality, basically having what it truly takes. I then found myself either quitting or getting fired from every job I had because I did not have proper skills or I communicated improperly, made too many mistakes over and over, did not know what I was doing and needed help, got sick of the job.. just a sheltered girl with no experience really. 

The first major I chose I found that I hated and decided to just dive in the dream. Within pursuing this goal, I was able to get a pinky toe through a couple doors but overall, they meant nothing. I just had shitty experiences with a few well-known artists over and over. Maybe I was not exciting enough for them but I did not want to give up. I just kept pushing forward looking for that right person. A year or so later I still did not have a song out(what a fuck up), only had a few singing videos and just kept wishing to meet that person. I also still did not test out the other aspects of having what it takes and kept thinking that if a label would ever come across me, they'd just train me (you gotta have star quality in the first place). For school, I just started taking online courses and pushing my amount of general Eds with possible majors that I did not like trying to keep my parents happy. I made money here and there with pet sitting/baby sitting and went back in forth from my home town to my closet friends home town in hopes that something will come... and eventually it did. I finally met this guy through a trusted friend who had legit had connections and after 3 months of on and off communication and only one song which flopped later, he finally told me the hard truth. Basically, some of what he was saying was actually true and as much as it hurt and as much as I did not want to accept it, I’ve had such a hard time trying to ""fix"" what is wrong. I guess those who become stars have it in their DNA... it is apart of them. They naturally have what it takes.I always thought this is what my life is meant to be, but I was also not thinking completely logically, did not work smartly or hard enough. I’m still not going to stop, this is my passion and am working on a lot more to put out and approaching it differently. I just worry about where I will go with this and how far I will get, if this is truly meant to be my destiny( I felt like the universe was guiding me this way).. And It is one guy who means nothing, but the truth in what he has said really does eat me at times. I do not have the best performing skills, my personality sucks, I'm shy, I feel like I am not bright, I can't communicate with people properly. I need to learn so much but time is ticking and I don't even know what to do for plan B (school wise), I just really do not want to be a uneducated loser if this does not work out. I don't want to be 25 with no direction in life, no degree, and no means of supporting myself or having to get jobs that would not cut it. I have felt like such a failure and felt so rejected and still do not feel like I have truly learned. 

What also does not help is my close friend is so intelligent and so is her family( I am so grateful they even tolerate me)... when I am with them, I realize just how in experienced I am with basic life skills and communication let alone the skills and knowledge I need now to be a successful adult and I just feel so incredibly incapable. I don't know how to approach certain situations, I am very clumsy, fuck up more than average, and need things repeated to me. I know one should not compare themselves, and I am not comparing myself to them specifically but I realize just how underdeveloped I am to the rest of the world. I have found so many things I am insecure about within myself since coming back and I am so lost. so incredibly lost. I do not want to be a failure in life and I want to be self-sufficient but I have no idea how to efficiently go from here or what I want to major in that will help me support myself incase anything. Since realizing how ""skilled"" and ""knowledgeable"" I am at this point in my life.. I have lost my confidence, I have had a really hard time having basic communication with people I know, I resent my appearance, I am always nervous, insecure up the ass, and I isolate myself.  I feel so unworthy, I feel like nothing.. not good enough. Even though I know no one should say that about themselves I just cant help but feel it. I have lost touch with my happy self. I still live at home; barley got a grand in the account and am currently looking for a real job. The voice in my head goes on and off ""what will you pick? "" ""what are you going to do?"" "" what the hell are you doing with yourself? What is wrong with you?!"". Not to mention the disappointment and disgust from my parents.. the cherry on top. I wish I knew what else I was passionate for, I have looked and looked. I know I need to somehow find my way, leave this environment and learn... gain experience, I feel like not finding other real jobs and budgeting the right way has just screwed me so much now. I know a huge part of this sadness is due to my mindset and I know you just need to grab life by the horns but the cloud over me has been so draining. I feel like a negative force latched itself onto me or something I have never felt this hopeless before. Any way sorry for the long story that I hope is worded properly and makes sense.. it feels good to let it out",27May2019,5
13,"Hey I've only just recently lost my virginity and Ive been on anti depressanta for a few months. I heard they could make it harder to cum and that has been the case even with masturbation. It took longer to finish after I started the treatment. Well when I lost my virginity this week I just dint finish, as Ive had two sessions of 40+min and cant finish. It dosent go soft or anything, I care about my partner and she is trying to fulfill my needs in bed so its not that. Also the sensation is dulled, Ive heard sex is supposed to feel amaizing but I felt little to nothing in the way of pleasure at first. The second time I had been off anti depressants for a day and did feel some more pleasure but It was dulled.

When I mean pleasure I think its more accurate to say stimulation. Im 20, M if that helps my partner is Female its that helps too.

I would prefer to talk without pink filters. Trying to think that *""everything will be ok""*, *""don't worry, you have people that loves you""*. No, it won't be ok, it will suck ass and i will have to confront it one way or another and trying to color it doesn't help me prepare for it. I prefer to grab that sadness and anger and use it in a productive way instead of trying to cover my eyes and go to my happy place ignoring and avoiding everything that I cannot change thinking that tomorrow will be a happier day, watching the beauty of the world around me. That only works so much and doesn't solve anything. 

I would prefer avoiding not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because I can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what I actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.

They started out as things to talk to but have turned into voices just putting me down and attacking me, even now as I’m typing this I feel like shit for just being another sad story on reddit and an attention whore as I always call myself I’ve tried taking medication and seeking counseling but nothing is working. So please help sos whatever I just want to be able to feel again",27May2019,1
26,"What do I do with this feeling of guilt that I have about where I am? I feel it's a natural response to what I've done - I'm 22, and for the last two or so years, I've slowly broken down more and more. I bailed on countless jobs, I lost a lot of friends by isolating or ghosting on social media (deactivated everything but reddit and youtube, only talk to like two friends from when I was younger). I'm a recovering addict of benzos and weed, but still drink just about everyday. I'm actually kind of buzzed right now, hence the confidence to reach out and see what strangers think of my pathetic existence.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm unemployed, dropped out of school, anxiously bailed on just about every meaningful thing I've tried to accomplish. I used to feel being alone would be best, but now it's left me more hallow than ever. I feel ashamed and guilty, I can barely talk to my parents anymore, and I can't keep telling my friends that I'm unemployed and depressed, because every time I get a job offer, I just leave it or don't show up due to one rationale or another. So now it's like I can't trust myself, and can't open up to others because I know this was all my doing that got me here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm drinking less and want to stop all together. I've been listening to motivational stuff on youtube, and want to embrace the unknown with a summer job and by picking up skateboarding. But it just doesn't feel like enough, and quite truthfully the biggest accomplishment of the month is finally showering and shaving after almost two weeks without doing either. It's not that I want to kill myself, I can't have my parents lose another child (my older sister died in a car accident, and one of my older brothers is a bad heroin addict that basically tore the family apart). But I certainly feel like I've given up, which makes me feel like a huge piece of shit and makes me want to recluse myself further. What can I do when I willingly don't do what I need to do?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to improve my diet, I walk at least 5 miles a day while listening to podcasts and lectures, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm a failure. I feel embarrassed, my family is sick of me doing the same thing over and over, and I really don't have much faith in myself after the amount of bridges I let burn to the ground. Even writing this has made me realize the knots I've tied in my own brain. I just don't know how to break out of this prison cell of a lifestyle.",27May2019,15
27,"My ex from three years ago made it clear that she doesn't ever want to talk, and I don't want to push the boundaries further than I already have. I can't stop obsessing (therapist suggested I might have OCPD) about her and all of the horrible things she did to me during our relationship and break up. I have been trying as hard as I can to get over her but I can't; therapy and psychiatry doesn't help, new girls don't help, working on myself doesn't help. I don't want to become an incel-type of guy but these thoughts are ruining my life. I just want to talk to her but I know I can't, and I don't want to start feeling entitled to her attention. My depression and anxiety just keep getting worse and worse because of this and I haven't felt genuine joy in years. I don't want to feel like this anymore, please help.",27May2019,34
28,"I was on a singles group. I reached out to a few women. I mean i messaged and introduced myself  in what i think is a polite fashion. Im trying to get myself fit because i do like women with some muscle. Im fat, but losing weight. So in my heart and mind, i do understand that im not exactly adonis. I know and understand im not owed a response. 

But i cant help but feel...disappointed. I dont even get a “thanks but no”. Just straight ignored. I have no problem someone not wanting to talk but...i dont know. I can only say that i wouldnt ignore anyone because id consider that rude. Is that my problem? Am i just expecting too much just for someone to take the time to at least tell me no thanks? Seconds of politness. It feels no one in the world even cares enough to have manners these days. I know im not owed manners, i guess i just find the state of the world depressing that people would rather ignore than be polite but honest. Idk.

I was feeling positive about my mental and weight loss achievements but when i put this across people in the group told me i was wrong and the asshole etc. It may be my fault because i was exasperated and  put it in not the best way that i would rather ppl tell me than ignore. Idk. Just feel shit.",27May2019,1
29,I can't help with anything. Anytime I try to help I ruin everything. People call me useless all the time and their right. I can't take it anymore and I'm starting to lose the battle.,27May2019,2
30,"So I put that 14 y/o in the comment because i dont want people to assume im a 25 year old man that can just go work (Ive applied for a lot of jobs but no response). This credit is one of the main roots of my depression, theres so much more but it feels like im in a box and I cant get out of it. 2017 I made the mistake of opening a credit line to start a ebay selling business. As you can tell it went horribly, I was just trying to make some money for my family, and a little for me so I could get into pc gaming. After selling items i didn't realize theres eBay fees and racked up a large sum of money. After that I had failed attempts of resell. I sold a big ticket item which was a pc building service, built the guy the pc (took a long time 2ish months because I had to rma half the parts DOA) and paypal refunded the money to him who hes not giving it back, he keeps saying hes getting approved and my phone just broke so I lost his phone number and hes not answering email or ebay. I dont know what to do anymore.",27May2019,2
