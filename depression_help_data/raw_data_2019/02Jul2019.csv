1,"There is a person online that I have known for a year, is 16 years old (from Mexico) and is depressed by her bad mother, bad friends, many childhood traumas, and losing relatives. She has developed emotional dependence, and who knows what else. The thing is that she does not receive love or affection for her mother or friends in his own country, so she spends her time on facebook looking for friends online  (ALL DAY FOR YEARS since she was 12 )who love her a little, but she still feels empty with a lot of stress, daily headaches, isolated, suicidal thoughts, she has wanted to leave his house multiple times, etc ...

What can I do living in another country, to help her, besides supporting her emotionally via? (which is not enough)",02Jul2019,1
2,"I don’t think I’m depressed but I’m extremley lonley. I try to keep my self super busy (sports, job etc) but now that is school holidays I have no idea what to do with myself. I’m considering picking up more shifts at work so I don’t have to face this. I have friends but nobody invites me to hang out or if I ask they’ll cancel :(. I’ve tried joining clubs to make friends but nothing sticks. What’s wrong with me? 
P.s if it helps I’m 16",02Jul2019,1
3,I have to go to work tonight. That means I have to shower and brush my teeth. I have to make myself somewhat presentable. I know even after the little effort I can bare to put in I still will not be presentable. I will look like a fucking zombie. I have to go over there and see all these people. I have to put myself in front of co workers who barely know me but will make a joke of me whether I’m around or not. Talk about how weird I am. I have to go be the village idiot for 12 hours with a fake smile. Knowing that when I’m not around they make fun of me. I have to use that smile on strangers who know nothing about me but want so much from me for 12 hours. Then I will finally be able to come back home and get back into bed until I have to go do it again. I only do it because if I didn’t force myself to go to work I would not do anything. I would never shower or brush my teeth. My hair would be a fucking dread. I would not leave my fucking bedroom.,02Jul2019,1

5,"Since I was a teenager I’ve been struggling to meet people that I can have genuine connections with. Now I’m a 22 year old man who has nobody. I don’t have a problem talking to people and I can make people laugh pretty easily, so I’m not sure what my issue is, I just don’t click. My inability to make connections has began to make me feel like a freak, and if I can’t make connections with people I don’t see a point in living anymore. I think this is something people grow out of as they get older, but if you’ve been through something similar and are a little older like me, feel free to message me. Thanks.",02Jul2019,1
6,"Sorry for my english, I'm brazilian, but here we go: I have depression and anxiety disorder, borderline personality and insomnia. I went to the ward 4 years ago, I stopped cutting myself 2 years ago but the thoughts came back and it's hard to control it(I haven't done it so far). Anxiety got so bad I can't even take a subway, I can't watch movies with my girlfriend because before the trailers end, I need to get out asap and go home to take my meds and breathe for 40m to calm down, I don't see my friends in months because I can't seem to get to crowded places. I feel like my gf is going to leave me one day because everytime I feel bad, I ask her to go home because I feel like I just need to shut down my brain and look at the walls without anybody by my side. What should I do ? I feel like I'm wasting my time away, all I do is lay down on bed watching horror stories or play games on my compute while everyone is out doing all sorts of things, partying, having fun, enjoying life.. and I'm here, I'm always here. I feel like I'm going to break down at any moment, I just don't know when. Should I go back to the clinic after 4 years ?",02Jul2019,1
7,"I finish high school in 4 months, my life is a mess. I was suicidal last year but I talked with my parents and started going to the psych. School is as hard as ever, despite having a 4.0 GPA I'm far from the top of my class and I've fallen behind on lots of work, my grades are ok and I'm passing off of classwork and tests which I do ok on. 

I fucking hate my life and stay in bed almost every day, my grampa got cancer and I live like 12 hours away by plane, I'm extremely lonely. I hate myself and my school doesn't give a shit about my health. I've got no idea where I'm going in life and so many things are going wrong. I've become suicidal again, but at least I don't drink alcohol anymore. 

I've got depression, anxiety and attention issues. I've been dealing with so much pain for so long and I don't wanna go on existing this way, it's not living.

8,"I’m a 16 year old male and every day I just feel empty. I don’t really feel like doing anything. I’m horribly anxious and scared about school and the world around me. I’ve tried therapy and none of the emotions I share with the therapist seem real. It just feels like anything I share is what the therapist wants me to say and how they want me to react so they feel like they did their job and so I’m “always improving!” while I still feel as empty as I did before any therapy. I’m at the point where I want to try medication, but my mother does not want me to as she doesn’t want to be on any medication so obviously I wouldn’t want to be on anxiety medication or antidepressants. I’m pushed to do better than all of my siblings to the point where I am taking science classes designed for high school seniors when I am currently a sophomore. I feel that my classes are further exasperating my problems and I just want anything that will help with my feelings of emptiness and anxiety and the breathing techniques and therapy that I have been given aren’t helping.",02Jul2019,1
9," When i was really young my father was killed, i wont go into those details but it really messed with me for a long time, about a year later my mother married an abusive man that beat us and threatened our lives, we ended up moving out of the state because he was chasing us and trying to kill us, now as you can imagine i was a really fucked up kid that didnt understand anything that happened to me so i didnt have a lot of friends growing up, i was a bit of an outcast. The few people that gave me a chance i ended up pushing away without meaning to. Ive never been diagnosed with any personality disorders because ive never been to a therapist but im sure i have a few. I got good at pretending i was ok from a young age and even went as far as to ""create"" a personality for myself. Everyone around me thought i was weird, but happy so no one attempted to get me help, not that i would have taken it anyways. I eventually met a person that i could relate to and things got romantic. I started feeling better and opened up to them, we were together for 3 years until i found out that they were cheating on me with the mutual friends we had, of course tore me down and i tried to kill myself, my family decided i wasnt worth it, for the first time in my life i was actually alone. Ive been attempting to put my life back together now for about a year but things dont get better. Im finding it harder to keep the thoughts away and tbh i feel more happy/excited when im running scenarios through my head than anything else",02Jul2019,1

11,"      I've been depressed for 5-6 years, with three (secret) suicide attempts. Thankfully, I never succeeded, but I never quite got over the whole ""wanting to die"" bit. Instead, I live in this weird kind of limbo where I'm not fully committed to living, but neither do I actively pursue death. Has anyone ever encountered this problem before, or is there something one would recommend? Might there be something I am missing? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.",02Jul2019,2
12,"I have ADHD and its hard for me to follow what other people tell me and also i cant stay still, my parents are aware of this yet they expect much from me like im a normal person (Ex: i was at church the other day and i cant control my self from moving alot, and my parents got really mad).I admit im not really doing much with my life, but i want to do something. im not doing that great at school and its now summer holiday and i have not been doing much, been taking courses here and there though. yet my parents keep calling me useless and a loser for 16 years now and i believed it.

I always feel like a second compared to my older sister. she gets my parents support and love, and i only get a fraction. Now my sister i dealing with depression at college because she thinks she is trans but it has been proven by her therapist that she is not and my parents became stressful when they heard that she wanted to be a guy. i tried talking to them about what i feel and they took it for granted and said it was all in my head and I made myself this way, they also thinks its selfish of me to think more about my self and not think about my sister, the truth is ive been feeling this way for a while now and my sisters problem just adds the pain. I dont want to tell them about my possible depression and suicide thoughts cause maybe it will hurt them more and cant focus on my sisters medication. I want to go when my sister is cured from her depression, but idk how and im scared of hell. i feel i like im weighing down my families goal and my parents blamed me for the destruction of my family. What should i do? and if it ends whit suicide, how should i do it?",02Jul2019,1
13, I'm sure everyone gets these all the time. But. Maybe someone somewhere cares. I'm sorry. Just feel like I need to get everything out. The past few days I've been having a bad depressive episode. I'm alone. Almost all day. No one really talks to me but I guess I don't make the effort. I just feel like I can't relate to anyone or I open up too quick and doing something wrong. So I don't make friends. But here I am. Up at 1 in the morning crying my eyes out. I don't feel like I belong here anymore. I disappoint everyone. I can't do a single thing right. I tried to make friends and get back into the things that make me happy but I did it wrong. And they all just left. I was just put onto the earth at the wrong time and at the wrong place. I don't deserves to be here anymore. I'm tired. I'm alone. And I'm scared of my own mind. I want to die. I want to not hear my vocies anymore.,02Jul2019,6
14,"*long rant and not organized at all... just like my life*

My parents are homophobic, racist, hypocrites, and extremely closed minded. They don't understand that depression is a disease that anyone can have, even if they have everything anyone could ever want. They laugh at other people who have depression because they think depression is a joke. They think everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community is insane, mentally ill, and evil. They sneer at the homeless. Even when I try to show them how insensitive they are being, they don't listen to me. 

I, unfortunately, am everything they seem to hate. I'm depressed. I'm pansexual. And if I ever come out of the closet, I will be kicked out of the house and left to die on the streets. 

However, I've been staying quiet. They occasionally comment on how I'm still a failure, even though I try my hardest to impress them. Even though I try to smile more, even though I try not to look at another cute person, regardless of whatever gender they are, I can't help it. Sooner or later, they're going to find out. I'm going to be kicked out to the streets and become another statistic. 

Even though I hate my parents... I still love them. They still care for me, even though they have only cared for the person I pretend to be. They feed me, they give me food and water. Even though they would hate the real me, I still can't hate them. They've sacrificed things for me... shouldn't I sacrifice my happiness for theirs?

I would never wish them to be ill. I want them to live a long and happy life. In the end, they want me to live a perfect life that they never could have. 

I can't be the perfect daughter they wanted, and I feel awful because of that. I feel like a constant disappointment, and they remind me that I'm not good enough. I can no longer list a single positive trait about myself. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm stupid. I have no talent. I'm not special. I'm just a mistake. 

In the end, I'll have to tell them. They're going to be disappointed in me and themselves for raising a piece of trash. In the end, I'm most likely going to see the last of my days on the streets, just how the statistics forecast. 

But as for today, I will stay quiet. Tomorrow, I will wish I was different. The day after that, I will hate myself for thinking that I'm suffering more than anyone else. The cycle will continue until the tire runs flat. But by then, no one will care or remember me. By then... it will all be over. By then... will I ever be accepted and truly be happy?",02Jul2019,4
15,So I’ve had depression for a many years. I’m questioning what should I do since my family themselves didn’t believe that I’m depressed and they don’t believe in me and many things I say. I remember for my third year of being depressed my mother was driving me and my sibling home. She says depressed people should die because they are lazy and don’t want to work. It hit me extremely hard. Most people probably have it worst and I’m probably just some ungrateful person. My group of friends are usually uncomfortable about the topic so I cover everything up as quickly as possible about me that looks wrong. I’m the person who holds the group together and keeps things in peace along with most of my friends looking up to me. I feel that if I show weakness or something wrong they will show sympathy and feel bad for me. Which isn’t something I want because my friends deserve the best. I’m pretty stuck and unsure on how to speak of my feelings to people around me. If you are reading this focus on yourself also I’m really not important. I’m not really important in general since I should care about others instead of myself. I’m just wondering what I should do. This isn’t to make you feel worse also think about yourself don’t think of me. I’m just a person on the internet saying this. Is this selfish for me to reach out for help though. Although I am quite stuck and can’t do anything. Anyways take care of yourself and wish the best of luck to you!,02Jul2019,2
16,"Sup I'm 20 and I genuinely feel hopeless and hate myself. I don't really feel like there's anything in my life to be super proud of, like I've been unemployed for a few months, I don't have a drivers license, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm not in super great shape and I hate myself for not taking steps to change anything. It's like I'd rather just wallow in my own sadness then actually go do something about it even though all I want to do is be happy. I don't want to sound like the stereotypical 4chan incel but the never having a girlfriend part especially bothers me, like to the point where if I see a pretty girl in public or I see someone my age on social media being in a nice relationship or something I get like jealous and sad, and I don't want to be like that I should be happy for those people but I'm just not. I feel like such a huge loser who is going to be stuck just loathing myself forever. Any of my friends or family members I've spoken to have told me it will get better and I'm a great dude but it just doesn't make me feel any less worthless to myself.

17,"Thinking about doing a piece on how depressed people affect the immediate environment around them. I have certainly built many of what I call ""depression palaces"" (apartments of filth and apathy, entire rooms I cannot traverse due to random clutter, vehicles crammed with unfulfilled hobbies, the bottle mountains). These spaces are not willed into existence or engineered, but rather a natural biproduct of the lack of will and conscious thought, which fascinates me to no end. I think they are a physical imprint of the depressed mind, almost like a vinyl record of our feelings and suffering.

I am interested in your spaces of depression and what they're like, and I do not judge. Candy wrappers and dirty underwear - I don't care. I wanna hear it all.",02Jul2019,2

She says I'm weak for expecting expressions of joy when I should apparantly already know they're happy for me. She said some pretty shitty stuff and honestly I've lost all hope.

20,"Granted, I had barely any idea before then... the speed bump of two amazing relationships gave me some sort of brief goal, I guess, and every time i have another meltdown I lose interest in everything I've built up in the past few weeks again.

My meltdown two? days ago resulted on most of my Twitter being deleted and me sleeping for some 11 hours (when I average 6-7) and only getting out of bed to feed my dog. She and my niece have been the only thing keeping me going, and given that she's 15 and my niece is moving out in November, I don't know where to go or where I'm headed. I'm unemployed, have severe (yet somehow fluctuating) anxiety, depression and borderline PD, PTSD surrounding driving, and trace amounts of other fun that basically leaves me unemployable.

I have one friend left after everything, as the rest left for greener pastures, the willing and able (I'm aro-ace), or being sick of my deteriorating mental state, not helping in the process. I haven't drawn in... days, and I haven't drawn anything seriously in probably months.

I'm really just scratching the surface, but I'm looking for advice, not telling my life story. 'Getting out there', psychs, and meds aren't options -- two have been exhausted as possibilities and the other makes me want to die.

22,"Hi there. Male (32) here.

My life has been going well for the past few years but suddenly things have become very tough. 

Some incidents have happened and its made me think a lot and I have gone down all sorts of spirals. I feel like I am sinking into a massive depression.

To give you some background I am from New Zealand and now living in Europe (Where my parents originally came from).  All my family and some of my friends are back there. Things are not easy here but there are positives and I enjoy living here.  

&amp;#x200B;

\- So I met a girl and she is amazing. I really like her and would like to stay with her, she doesn't seem open moving to or visiting New Zealand on a regular basis so I would need to make giant sacrifices by staying here. She is very much in her comfort zone. She has a place and a job. She isn't the adventurous type of person or a risk taker. I am worried our relationship is going to end due to my instability. She is 35 and probably wants to settle down into something comfortable and have kids. I also want this but I am worried for my future.

\- I was working remotely and lost my job. Basically my boss who I was working with gave my job to her new husband. This has made me feel very insecure. Now I only have limited savings, I have been searching for remote work but not hearing anything back at all. I feel like my opportunities here are so limited. I either need to start a successful business or work online due to salaries here being so low. I have some savings to rely on but little motivation at the moment. 

\- My mother has come to visit me. She is super controlling, I never realised how controlling until I spent time away and now I am with her again. She wants to spend 24/7 with me, do things together, she is also abusive and manipulating. She is trying to dictate how I live my life. I try to tell her this and she just gets more upset. Now it's like she has put a wedge between me and my girlfriend. I am very sad and upset. When I spend time away from her she guilt trips me and manipulates me to spending time with her. My girlfriend is also upset saying she is very sad about the situation.

\- All of this has caused me to have a giant identity crisis. I do not feel at home in New Zealand and do not feel at home 100% here either. It is a terrible feeling, I just want to belong somewhere and fit in. My parents were migrants. I feel like I am lacking an identity. The girl I met is probably the most compatible I will ever find, now I am scared to lose her. I feel like if I go back to New Zealand I will not find someone I am compatible or happy with. It is depressing because I do feel homesick a lot lately but I know if I go back I will feel homesick from where I am at the moment. It is a no win situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to talk with people but I am so far from my support network. I wish I could just make this work. Now that I feel down I find it hard to get up, exercise and work. Searching for and keeping a job and having stability seems like mission impossible right now.",02Jul2019,1
23,"As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, I get what it feels like to be alone. But I am unsure how to help him. He told me this morning. I have never tried to help someone through depression. I have had another close friend help me. I don't know what to say or how to act in order to help him if he were to have an outburst, or worse, become suicidal. I know what it feels like to have someone talk you down from suicide. I just don't know how to do it myself. Does anyone have any pointers I can use?",02Jul2019,2
24,"Nearing 50 year old mom here.  I've been through the wringer more than once.  My whole family (except my son and one asshat brother and distant relatives who live far away and have never given a crap) is dead and I have no friends where I live except my boyfriend.  He's wonderful except he's even more depressed and socially anxious than I am, so I end up carrying the lion's share of the burden and end up with no where to go to get support for myself.  I've had a reputation for being the world's strongest woman, as things that should have killed me didn't, but I'm not; until now I've just been stubborn.  But I'm about over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost my career almost 10 years ago trying to do the right thing, and my ex-husband managed to ensure I'd never work in that field again but utterly betraying me personally and professionally.  Ended up living in a friend's dining room with a toddler because we had no where else to go.  It's been five years since then and I've managed to get a job (no where near what I used to make, and still in debt because of all the unemployment), but for every step forward it seems like we're getting pushed at least three steps back.

&amp;#x200B;

I drive to work and all I can see it this every day; going to a place I don't hate but which makes me want to chew my own foot off, making barely enough to keep us going (not ever sure I'm making enough for that given the new crises), never see my kid or my boyfriend anymore.  Never go out, have zero friends and zero social life.  I work. I go home, I cook dinner, I go to sleep. I start over.  And for all of that not only do I never see my son, I can't even give him everything he needs on a material level, much less an emotional one.  So I wear myself out making sure he knows he's loved and gets attention from me in the few moments I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it doesn't sound like that big a deal given the other posts on here, but this is the culmination of a life that has always been a struggle at best, downright terrifying at worst.  The one time I was truly happy it turned out to be a lie (when I was with my ex-husband) and destroyed everything I'd worked for and built for myself out of nothing, and left me scraping by physically and emotionally to provide for our son (needless to say, his father doesn't care and is utterly absent).  I'm never going to get it back, I don't know what to do, I'm almost 50 ffs and I'm just so done.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't do anything because my mother committed suicide and I don't want to do that to my son, but there are days I'm truly afraid I won't be able to resist anymore.  I pray I'll get hit in a car accident or get cancer or something that will kill me and it not be my fault just so I can die and he won't hate me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so exhausted pretending everything is okay and having to be the rock for everyone else, because no one else is strong enough to handle what needs to be done.  I know people will tell me to get professional help, but I don't have health insurance and we're teetering on the edge of poverty as it is.  I work/commute 60+ hours a week, and time off isn't an option for me.  I don't work, I don't get paid, we don't eat.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety and depression (I believe as a side effect of all of being terrified all the time, I don't think I would have depression were it not for all the anxiety issues).   Naturally not medicated because, again, no health insurance.

31,"Recently, I've struggled with how to start habits. Especially those habits that help me improve my life. But, I don't have a lot of energy because of my depression but here's some stuff I learned:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Decide What Your Routine Will Be:** You need to have everything together. You can't frantically start googling 'Glute exercises' while you're already at the gym. Do it beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Use Physical Reminders In Order To Help You Remember To Do Your Routine:** One of the hardest things about starting a routine is actually remembering to do it. Put physical reminders in places in order to ensure you won't forget to do your routine. You should make sure to put these objects somewhere where they seem a bit out of place. For example: a pillow on a coffee table. If this doesn't work, you can write yourself a note as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Reward Yourself For Sticking To A Routine:** This will give you a little boost of motivation! And it will reinforce you positively.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Make It Fun!:** Sticking to a routine doesn't have to be boring! Find a workout buddy or listen to your favorite playlist.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Start Only 1 Routine At A Time:** As tempting as it may be, you need to only start one routine at a time. If you don't your life will be hectic and you won't remember anything you need to do. Don't force everything upon yourself at once. Dip your toes into the water slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

**6) Baby Steps:**  Let’s face it – you’re not going to be able to immediately begin on your hour-long morning workout. Some days you may forget – others, you may just lack motivation. While it’s important to be able to build self-discipline and not focus on motivation alone, you still need to start out with baby steps.

&amp;#x200B;

**7) Consistency Is Key:**  I’m sure this tip doesn’t surprise you at all. It’s important to be consistent for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, try to do your routine at the same time every day. Completing routines in the morning tends to keep you more motivated since you’ve already accomplished something that day.

&amp;#x200B;

**8)  Track Your Progress:**  Create a tangible calendar – one where you can physically cross the days when you complete the task. This will make you more likely to do your routine because you won’t want to break your steak. And, remember to not beat yourself up if you can’t stick with a routine. It’s not the end of the world. Always try, but always be nice to yourself.

If not, that's perfectly fine. I really hope that this post helped in some way. I started writing because it was something I enjoyed and I also want to help people who struggle from depression and anxiety (both of which I have).",02Jul2019,7
32,"51y/o WM. Divorced last year. I was living overseas trying to make a bad marriage work and failed miserably. Moved back home to take care of my 84y/o mom.  She’s Fox, I’m MSNBC 
I’m depressed ( obviously) found out I have a kind of PTSD from all the stress of the last six years or so. 
I’m running out of time, money, patience.  I can’t get my mind in gear. Taking bupropion 150mg/day.  I used to be a teacher, but I don’t think I can teach right now. I’ve always been a workaholic, now I can barely be bothered to look for a part time or online side gig.  I feel lost, stuck, angry, full of shame.  I try to read books or blogs to get info and I can’t keep the focus for more than a couple of minutes and then I just get... hyper fidgety. I’ve tried meditation for 15-30 minutes every morning for two months and almost nothing. 

I have a history of suicide on my mothers side, but I’m not going to do that.  But it worries me. 

Any suggestions. Any advice. I feel absolutely trapped and hopeless. I was never like this before",02Jul2019,8

34,"Hi! I'm Robert, and I'm sad! Why? Well first of all, I was writing a really long post about providing support just a second ago, but I accidentaly closed it and lost all progress. That post must've been over 700 words long, and it all disapeared just like that, but you know what? I don't really care : )

You see, life likes to throw some challenges here and there, and that's ok! Life does it, so that you learn from them. And life has trained me harshly, and I mean ***HARSHLY***. I have been given so many extremely hard challenges that I was supposed to solve in order to survive. And I did. I learned every trick to complete these horrible painful challenges. 

And I think that I should help others get past these challenges too. So if you need any help or just need someone to talk to: I'm here! Just text me in direct messages.

I'm a really kind, patient and understanding person, so you can talk to me about absolutely anything, I won't shame you.",02Jul2019,7

36,"High school has ended and I want to fucking kill myself. Throughout my life I was always bullied and never had any friends until high school. I decided I wasn’t going to get pushed around anymore and decided to stand up for myself. I built a business that makes me 60k a year in passive income and went from a skinny lanky tall kid to a tall muscular man. I feel good about my accomplishments however last summer I had this girl who was interested in me and was wanting to date me from what I heard. I was to focused on my business and thought she want pretty enough for me. I feel like only someone crazy would think that because she actually is very pretty and out of my league. Anyways I always thought that by senior year that I would attract females due to my money and muscle however by the time I had all of this it was the end of the school year and high school was over. I realized towards the end I should have dated the girl who liked me and that would have made my senior year great. I could have taken her to prom, homecoming and all the games and had a great relationship. Sadly I had to watch her spend it with someone else and it is all my fault. I feel sick to my stomach and just want to turn back time and get those moments I never had. But I can’t. It’s over. People have told me just look into the future but I can’t. I feel like I failed and I can’t mentally accept this. I either want to find a way to have a romantic relationship like the one I had dreamed of or kill myself. I see literally no other purpose and I don’t want to enjoy my life or move on until I somehow make up for the time I have lost. I am not excited about life and want death to take me. Most of you in the comments will probably call me crazy and I definitely feel mentally insane. I just need to somehow fix this or end it. Help",02Jul2019,0

39,"He’s always had a history of depression, but he’s really been going through it lately. He’s sleeping a lot, and other times he just lays there in bed for hours. I was gone for 2 weeks and have only been back a few days to see how bad it’s gotten. We’ve got an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist in the works, but seeking advice on how to help in the meantime. I can be a bit of a pusher and my inclination is to coax him out of bed since it seems like just laying there would make it worse. Would it be better to just leave him alone though? He’s not really talking about it much. He slept in this morning and then took a mid morning to mid afternoon nap. I was able to get him up to do some work in the garage with me, but an hour or so after it was done he was back to laying in bed where he is now. I made dinner and thought he was coming to eat but he never got up. I know he’s suffering, so any advice on what to do would be wonderful.",02Jul2019,5

41,"Hi, I'll start off by saying that English isn't my first language so some sentences might be a little off. I made this account because I needed a second one so none of my friends would see this post and possible future posts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I've had depression for almost my entire life (got diagnosed at age 9 and I'm 21 now) so I know how to deal with it for the most part because I've been to over 6 psychologists and got admitted to a clinic for therapy a few years ago which I did intensively for four months. 

&amp;#x200B;

It really didn't help much. I'm not in a state of crying every day anymore. I'm in this grey area where I can't really take care of myself for a small period of time. Like not brushing my teeth and not showering for over a week (until I have to go outside basically) and not cleaning my room eventhough it drives me up the wall when it's messy. I have ADD and it can get really overwhelming when I can't even find some calmness in my room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel empty and can't find the enegry to do these simple tasks. I can eat and such, just not 'basic' hygenic things... I'm at my wits ends as to how I can pick these up and keep doing them. I can start doing them for a few days but I can't keep it going... It's been like this for years and I'm starting to think about what the point of living really is.

Its just like , i never get invited or somebody wanna go out with me , for shopping or shit like that.

I always have to ask em and most of the times they R “busy “ or they have “other things to do” 

And i just never gets asked .. that makes me feel like im such an unimportant person that dont deserve shit , so i dont get it ..

I always care about ppl , be nice and lovely to em but i just get shit back.



And since 3 or 4 months i feel like i want to kill myself and i cry about every 2nd night.

Ofc i wont do it , but i still feel like that...



I mean how ridiculous to write a post like this on reddit cuz i dunno what to do , think or say , but writing this rly gets off my soul.

Cuz theres noone who wants to lissen to me or talk to me bout this Topic .. 

Thank yah for “lissening” and G8

43,"Hi, I'm just feeling really hopeless in my current situation.  I want to live, but I feel like I've already screwed up this life save file, and I feel my Game Over screen coming on fast, if I don't find some solution.  I'm sorry if that's a stupid metaphor.  It just makes the most sense to me.  


So, on Easter I noticed a rash.  It continued to get worse and worse.  I went to urgent care and they told me it definitely wasn't bites, and prescribed something that didn't work.  I went to a dermatologist, they cut out a skin sample, stitched it up, mailed it off, and prescribed me three things that didn't work since they didn't know what it was.  When I went to get them I learned I had been kicked off medicaid.  My husband got a job at an animal, so now we don't qualify, and I will have lots of medical debt.  Due to expenses related to his job, it feels like we don't actually have any more money.    


In fact rent was due yesterday and we don't have enough for it.  My car registration expired in May.  We are behind on electric, internet, and the phone bill is due in two days.  My car insurance is due on the 5th.  My parents are wealthy, but I hate asking them for help.  They aren't accepting of me being trans really, and believe in ""personal responsibility.""  My mom said before she thought I seemed autistic as a kid, but never did anything, so I'm also undiagnosed on the spectrum.  Husband is diagnosed.  


Well last Thursday, I figured out the cause of my horrible rash.  I found bed bugs in our apartment.  This despite the medical debt I accrued for people to tell me it's not bites and cut off my skin instead.  We have ferrets and also mice we are fostering from the shelter.  We are scared for them if they treat the apartment.  Also, our apartment is disgusting and requires lots and lots of work, but our mental health keeps seeming to get worse, because of all the problems.  I feel like I'm drowning in this horrible apartment with no way out, and blood sucking monsters hiding everywhere.  We did some treatment, killed the vast majority with cleaning vinegar, but I know they aren't going to go away that way, and I keep finding furniture in the dumpster and hearing vacuuming at 1 or 2 AM.  I'm pretty sure the whole building is full of them and the landlord won't do anything.    


My rash looks significantly better, so I know the problem has improved a lot, but I usually need lots of sleep, and I haven't been getting it.  Lying awake waiting for them to come out, waking up and freaking out checking myself, unable to go back to sleep, and the couch is the only place I feel safe sleeping, but with my husband using it to there isn't enough time.  We don't own a bed.  I used to sleep on the floor before I knew about the bugs.  I feel like I can't deal with any of the many many problems, because I'm so so tired all of them time now.    


I feel completely and utterly hopeless.  I genuinely don't want to die.  I just don't feel like there are any other options.  Don't know how anyone would be able to help, but I figured I'd try.  Thanks.",02Jul2019,2
44,"So I'm in the most stressful period of my life at this point. And you would expect that my boyfriend or friends and family would help me get through. Well some of my friends live in other countries and other friends that are close to where I live just forgot about me just because this year was really a shit show for me. I was a busy mess. Working, trying to graduate (giving 13 classes at a semester) and trying to have a personal life just so I don't have time to be depressed like I did the previous years. Now we're having the finals and I'm fucking going crazy with studying. But there comes my boyfriend and fights because he acts like an asshole and blames it all on me. I cried a fucking a lot and I crying rn as I'm writing this. I'm so broken and so hurt from what he said about me and his lies and his fake apologies. And I'm so tired of fighting endlessly without him understanding even a lit tiny bit of what he did. And I'm so tired of my parents never being happy with the things I do and accomplish. I'm so tired with me and who I am and how I look. I reached the bottom. 
Right now it supposed to be our 4 year anniversary and I took pills with the hope that I don't wake up tomorrow.",02Jul2019,2
