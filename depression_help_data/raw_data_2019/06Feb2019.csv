0,"im 19. im a trans girl, i used tumblr a lot as a teen, ive been suspected to be autistic, i have strange and undefined interests, and i wasnt allowed to have a phone or internet for a lot of middle thru high school. i had a hard time making friends. i had a lot of friends online but i had less going into senior year. there was one friend i had consistently, and they had talked ab nicotine and dxm, so i got a vape and started drinking cough syrup cuz i had nothing better to do. i was mean to everyone around me. i wasnt very happy, but i had a lot of eyes on me. 

i met them around that time. we met on tumblr. we were the same age and they only lived two states away. they were adorable. precious. and sane. they werent crazy like a lot of people on that site. they were more normal. like me. we fell in love. so deeply in love. they gave me a reason to enjoy being alive. they were my everything. my happiness. my whole world. we talked all day every day and most nights we would video call and watch movies. i stopped using dxm because of them. i was so happy. i was so in love with them and they loved me too. we would have done anything for each other. we were so proud of each other. they were shy and i helped them to be more confident, and i was a know it all and liked explaining things to them and they liked to listen. they made me feel so loved and they made me feel like every bad thing that had ever happened to me was okay because it had been worth it because it led to the exact crazy circumstances that led to us meeting. we told each other that we thought we were soulmates, that we were born to meet each other. that we would kill ourselves if the other broke up with us, but it was a mutual feeling. we couldnt imagine living without each other.  

we were together for two years. they visited me more than a couple times. when i went to college i started smoking weed and they did too. we mostly maintained our routine. they visited while i was at college too. we got motel rooms when they visited. it was so sweet. it was perfect. it was just us in a bed in our own little world. and they were great at sex. they were so small and so precious but they had incredible curves and just a perfect body and they came a lot. everything was perfect. we got engaged. 

i couldnt go back to college for my second year. i had to move in with my grandparents and go to community college online. i started to get depressed again, and i felt disconnected from my partner. i was still happy with them, but sometimes i just felt like i didnt get them or that what i was saying wasnt good for them to hear. i dont think i encouraged them enough in their art. but i didnt know what to say. and sometimes i felt like we were talking in scripts. we still loved each other. i was going to visit them for our two year anniversary in november of last year. 

and then i met this random chick who slept with me after a week and broke up with them. 

two years gone. for a relationship with a terrible person who didnt even accept that i was trans that only lasted a month. 

its just bad. i did an unforgivably bad thing. they have abandonment issues and i played into those. it wasnt even for my own happiness. im not happy without them. i miss the fuck out of them. and afterwards when they tried to distance themself from me i lashed out at them. and now i just want them back. i think sometimes that i just need to meet new people. but where can i? i live in a nowhere town and i go to an online college and i work in food service. the people i do meet usually arent that great anyway, given my location and gender. im not that good at video games and i dont really like social media. so where do i meet people? even if i met anyone i dont think i can meet anyone as good as them ever again. i think they were the one. i still believe all the things we said about having been together in a past life. and now im alone with no close friends and no way to make any. im alone and im afraid im going to die alone. if not alone then unhappy. 

i broke up with them at the end of last october. i just dont know how im supposed to live with the horrible thing i did and i dont know how to meet people. ",06Feb2019,1
1,"Two years ago I was stuck in a pretty vicious depression cycle (it was only because therapy didn’t really help as well as me not having built up a good support system that I have now), bad enough where I tried to drown twice but couldn’t follow through with it. I had been using rubber bands to deal with my self harm tendencies, and had only cut on two occasions as of 2017-18. I’m scared that I’m falling into the same tendencies again, because I’m starting to feel depressed, tired, and anxious a lot more. I am in my second semester of college (out-of-state), but the stress of that doesn’t seem to be the problem. I have a better support system (friends, partner, music/movies, etc) now than I did two years ago, but I still don’t want to bother them when I become depressed. I’ve been clean of rubber bands for six months now. Im getting to the point where I’m starting to realize what I’m worth, and I’m not as prone to the suicidal thoughts and self harm tendencies anymore, nor the self deprivation that depression puts me through. I’ve been starting to get better, but I’m scared I might relapse and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice? ",06Feb2019,1
2,"I have been in and out of depression since childhood, always feeling numb refusing to feel anything.
For the first time I started to feel something for this girl, with this feeling and her unknowingly helping me, I got out of depressed for the first time in a long time.
Then one day, I could feel that she was unwell and feeling down, so I reached to her and sure thing she was deeply depressed. She had helped me through my depression,and of course I went to her to help and be there.
We talked and I confessed my feeling to her and she told me it was mutual but that she did not feel right at the moment, I was ok with it, it was the first time I was truly happy I believe,.being able to be there for her and seeing some hope at the end of my tunnel.
Then I felt really in love , like the same bullshit they sell you in cheap rom-com, couldn't sleep couldn't eat, Always thinking about her and wanting to see her. I asked her multiple time if I could come to be with her and she told me she needed time alone, I tried but I failed to leave her space and she told me I was hurting her.
I just lost it, I felt like total shit and deeply sad, went to see a doctor for depression and booked a Psychiatrist to help me.
Thing got better between the two of us, we exchanged text, joke pictures of cat. 
However my psychiatrist asked me to write her a chronological chart of my different depression and anxiety. To write it, I felt like reliving all those abuse and trauma never did I felt so down, so I tried the only thing that made me happy; Her.
Well let me tell you that not only she didn't answer which made me feel way worse she asked me to stop talking to her because I stressed her, the sheer thought that I had hurt her have the fatal blow.
For the first time I thought about suicide ending it all to stop suffering.
I realised my mistake, apologized and cheered up a little. I tried to keep texting her and she blocked me.
Woohoo second time wanting to die.
Since then I have stopped trying to contact her, but I never stopped thinking about her, I miss her like crazy and still feel like shit.

Today I realised, that it was it, I stopped feeling again, no more sadness no more happiness only emptyness. I'm lost I don't want to go back to this state I rather still love and being always sad than being numb.

I want to contact her to discuss to see if I can still feel, but I don't want to hurt more that I already have. What could I do?


Holy shit that was long, I guess I didn't realize I had that much to get out sry if it's too long or confusing.

3,"Not gonna go too much into detail, But lately I've easily been overwhelmed and ended up in a depressive state where I'm constantly beating myself up in my head, but it has gone too far and I've started being very self-deprecating and really negative when talking to my only friend who I feel comfortable talking to. But now she's getting tired of my negativity and self-deprecating behaviour and I just feels worse because of how I'm talking to her without thinking about it. I wish I could go back in time and be more responsible with how I interract with her. I don't know how to approach this.

5,"Hey guys. 
I feel worthless. Pathetic even. I feel like a failure. There must be something wrong with me. Everyone in my life has abandoned me. As a male everyone says toughen up it’ll be alright. Well, it’s just not that easy. I have no friends. No family. The girl that came into my life at the most unexpected time and made me feel like everything was going to be okay left me too. No fighting, no problems between us nothing. Claims it’s because she doesn’t think she’s ready. Says she has too much going on in her family to focus on us. Which that’s understandable by why toss away everything you have with someone for that? People that care about you are supposed to be there through the hard times you deal with. I was 100% prepared to be her rock while she dealt with these things in her life. Like I wish I had someone to be for me right now as I fall apart and lose my self control. I do nothing but cry these days. I don’t know how to cope. I have no one in my life that will just talk to me. Just listen to me rant. Just have a conversation with me. I work a dead end job and it seems like I’m not good enough to work anywhere else. Not from lack of trying. I’ve put on my best face and talked to many people. Apps and everything. Nothing. I’m so alone. I don’t know what to anymore. I can’t afford to be going to someone such as a professional. A therapist as it where. I’ve noticed that not many posts in here get replies, but if you read this.. will you take a little time and make my day a little better? I just need a friend. I don’t want to keep feeling so alone. I hate the way I feel about myself. I hate myself. I’m a tender hearted, clueless fool. I’m lazy. When I’m feeling okay, other people see me as a hyper self confident douche. But that’s not who I am. I suffer with this pain constantly. I don’t try to hide it either. It’s so tiring. And then everyone just thinks I’m a self centered asshole because I don’t talk to them. Well that’s not the case either. I’m so scared to make new connections with people. Because history repeats itself. Every connection I’ve made has left me. Why am I not good enough for anyone? What’s wrong with me? I know who I am. I know who I want to be. But most of all. The thing that makes me happy is making someone else happy. Some people’s purpose is to be famous or rich or the boss. I really feel like my purpose is to make someone happy. Build a life with someone. That’s the only thing I want from this painful world. Shitty work doesn’t matter to me. Material things don’t matter to me. I could have the worst job in the world but I would do everyday. For the rest of my life with a smile on my face. To make my person happy, as long as they where willing to do the same. I just want to be a provider. I want to feel appreciated. My father left when I was 2. My mother abandoned me when I was 13. My grandpa was the only person that would talk to me or take me in on that time. But the day I turned 18 he put me on the streets. I’m not even a bad person. I have always cleaned up after myself. Always had good grades. Always put 100% into every task I took on and stayed focus on every goal. Whenever anyone needed help I was there. Where is everyone at when I need help?  ",06Feb2019,1

So keep living so you can find your soulmate. Also here's 3 things you should do before you die, credit to my 10th grade spanish textbook. 1. Plant a tree
2. Write a book
3. Have a child with the one you love.
 If you still feel depressed after that then keep planting trees, keep writing books, be with your loved one(s). Just don't give up. There will be someone dying to meet you. Also for the ones with no friends because of events, there's a whole community on Reddit. There's thousands, maybe millions, of chances to make friends or at least starr a conversation, but not all of them are good people. But some are good people. Also for the people that have trust issues or just hate humans. You probably have heard this hundreds of times but I don't care. Not everyone is like them. People are rarely the same. We're each our own special snowflake. And if your family don't care then don't care about them. It's their loss because you are a wonderful and amazing person. Keep being you and do your best in life. 
Also upvote or spread this across reddit so more people can see this. I sorta do care if you steal this so please don't. But I don't care about upvotes or whatever it's called. Just spread this post.

Worldwide, more than [300 million people](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression) live with depression. Without effective treatment, the condition can make it difficult to work and maintain relationships with family and friends.

Depression can cause sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest in activities that are usually pleasurable. At its most extreme, it can lead to suicide.

Depression has long been treated with medication and talking therapies – and they’re not going anywhere just yet. But we’re beginning to understand that increasing [how much exercise we get](https://theconversation.com/how-physical-activity-in-australian-schools-can-help-prevent-depression-in-young-people-107889) and [switching to a healthy diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242200) can also play an important role in treating – and even preventing – depression.

20,"Hi guys. My name is Anonymous and I have Asperger's syndrome. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the right place to write this, but I need an outlet.

I'm not sure if many of you know what Asperger's Syndrome is, but to those who do know, maybe you'll be able to help me out. So I have issues learning how to normally behave. I don't understand how to read people very well, I don't take social cues very well and overall, as I've been becoming an adult, my ability to make friends, conversate, and even small talk has become increasing difficult for me. It's been draining me mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since sophomore year of high-school, my social skills haven't been developing mentally like I should be.. Sure, I had some friends in high-school, but the people I did talked to only talked to me when I was their last option. I'm super awkward. I don't know what it is people find interesting, why they want connections with people and how they do it so easily. I don't understand why I need human connection myself, but I know it's a basic human need. Something I never get, unless forced.. I've never had a real friend and after slowly realizing this it has been killing me slowly inside. Now that I'm in college, working and going to school all the time just makes me feel even more lonely.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always tried. I always tried to go out of my way to make friends and did so to the point I felt like my mind would explode. But no one has ever done the same to me.. I'm slowly getting to the point where I hate people.. I hate my fucking stupid slow brain... I have resentment for people, but yet I have this strong urge to be around them.

&amp;#x200B;

Well yea. As i said i want a reason to pull the trigger, to jump, down the bottle or whatever. At a closer thought, i think i NEED a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

A backround might help, i honestly dont know.

im a teacher assistant and a ""after school time"" employee (dont know the correct term, not first language) for kids in age 5-12. I like my jobb, and i love to work with kids, im good at it. But i have always hade the thought that it is not worth it, life that is. Im not miserable, im not hated, i have very good friends and a nice family.

this is so much more then many have and that might be what keeps me from doing ""it"". i dont feel i have a reason, but at the same time i dont feel it is worth the hard work and the stress and the pain that life is. The enternal sleep sounds better everytime i think of it.

I live in sweden so the living situation is not bad or anything. i live on my own in my fairly big 2 room apartment. i make enough money to live and do thing i want. im not a big spender, i get what i need and save the rest for the next stupid thing i like at that point in time.

I have always hade a hard time comiting to something. school, girlfriends or hobbys they have all been donehalf-heartedly with less and less care over time.

anyway, i have my gun on the table next to my computer screen. Always loaded, always within reach. i have lost count of how many times i put in my mouth tasting the metal. i have never been scared holding against the roof of my moth or the side of my head. but i always stop at the last couple of seconds. at this point i am HOPING and honstly dreaming of a tumor or a robbery turned bloody or a high speed car. just something to take the step for me.

i am fully aware that my death will probably leave a lot of people sad, and if it is by suicide they will probably be wondering why. that might be the reason why it have never happend maybe not. im venting alot now i feel so i will move on. if anyone is interested i can always keep going in comments or something

&amp;#x200B;

i would consider myself a very pedagogical person, i have always found it fascinating with the mind and the reason of choices, actions and beliefs. but no matter how much i try, i can not understand why i should, or more likely why i shouldn't, follow thru with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have long ago accepted my own death and everything that comes with it, now i feel done and i feel ready...

i have forgoten the reason i even wrote this, but i feel i need to tell someone. someone might even change my mind or feel the same.

25,"HS was the start of several problems to my mental health, stress, anxiety, social problems (and bad grades with it too as a consequence)... Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I can't force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. It's really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I haven't talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they can't understand what it's like to be like this. I expect an answer like ""you're too young"". And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. I'm having a mental breakdown, seriously.

26,"I was fighting depression for 6 years with it getting exponentially worse. First it was just once every couple of months for a day or so all the way to I was lucky if I got half a week where I didn’t feel like shit in a month. I met someone who I opened up to, she convinced me to get help and I’ve been so much happier since. Has it been easy? No of course not. The depression will always try to find ways to sneak in things to make your life worse like pushing people away from you, making you believe you are a burden on others, all that horrible shit. But it does get better, you just have to keep on going until it does. Even the brightest sources of lights in our world like Robin Williams can be extinguished by this. 

Today I am somewhat organized in college when I thought I would have died before I graduated from high school. I’m happy and life feels amazing again. Sure sometimes there will be a part of me that misses the depression, but when I look back at how I was and how I am now, I know it’s all worth it. I know it’s worth it when my sister runs up and hugs me fighting tears saying “I’m so glad you are still here”

28,"I started working my current job in July of 2018. When hired I was told I would be full time. I was given 27 hours instead. It made money tight but i was able to pay my bills, until my student loans came due. I found a second job, but was laid off a month later due to budget cuts. 

My current job uses me when they need me and throws me aside when they no longer need me. I work in two departments. One only has two employees in it. The other lady took vacation one week and rather than inform me or change my schedule ahead of time they told me the day I needed to start covering her shifts. They didn’t change my schedule to reflect the extra 40 hours and instead made me work 67 hours that week with no days off. They knew in advance they would need me, but for some reason didn’t think to change my schedule. My state has almost no worker rights so its perfectly legal for them to do this. All i can do is quit. 

My manager in the other department cut my hours because she said I was a terrible employee. She compared me to the lady who had been working there for 25 years. I couldn’t do as much as she could so therefor I was a bad employee. The issue was, she would come in early and work off the clock to get things done and would clock off and stay late to finish up. I refuse to work off the clock so it always looked like I was doing less. 

In my other department the second lady quit, leaving me as the only employee in that department. I assumed they had worked to replace her as soon as she put in notice. They didn’t start looking until a week after she left. They notified me on Christmas Eve I was getting her hours as well. I worked another 67 hours that week with no days off. I didn’t get to see my family for Christmas at all as I was at work until late on Christmas. 

They told me I was working her schedule until further notice. I asked to be taken out of my other department until they found a replacement. It was killing me physically and mentally. I have a bad knee so working nonstop for so long made it to where I could barely walk. Not to mention shear exhaustion. 

They refused to take me out of the other department the next week due to the holiday. I had to work another 67 hours with no days off while the managers all took three days off that week. I told them if they didn’t give me a normal schedule i was going to quit on the spot. Since I’m the only one in the building trained in this department they caved.

I asked if I could have the full time spot and they told me they would think about it. Instead they hired some girl who legally cannot work where I work (she told me). They had me train her (she was also getting paid more hourly than I was). They sent her for a background check on her final day of training. Surprise surprise she didn’t pass and they let her go. So I just continued filling in. The department got a new manager and he asked if I had put in an application for the spot. I didn’t know I needed to, I was told I didn’t need to by the previous manager. 

I went to give the general manager my application for the spot and she didn’t take it as “we don’t need you to apply as you already work here.” A week later she asked if I wanted the spot. I said yes. She said you need to apply then. I got pretty upset at that point. I got it in the next day. 

She interviewed me for the spot a few days later and used it to inform me of why they most likely weren’t going to give me the spot. They had me trying to do my old job in that department, plus all the new duties. It was impossible to get it all done. They didn’t care though. They said I wasn’t good enough because I couldn’t handle 55 hours of work in 40 hours.

It’s to the point that I can barely crawl out of bed in the morning. I barely eat. I get off work and go right to bed. My marriage is falling apart. I spend every waking moment on the verge of tears. I’ve had problems with depression in the past but can usually overcome it with time. This feels like I’m being crushed into the ground and stomped on. I’m trying to fight but I just can’t. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been trying to find a steady job for 10 years. I work hard, I cross train, I do everything I can think of to make myself an asset to the company and I get nothing in return. I thought I had a chance at the full time spot. My manager said he wanted me in the spot, but his manager overrode him on it. This fact alone makes it ten times worse for me. It’s to the point that even at work I can only move at a crawl pace. I feel like I cant breathe. I feel like I’m not destined to be happy. Nothing ever works out for me.

I want to quit so bad. I might have a part time position at another company but it won’t pay my bills. Staying here will kill me though. Should I just quit anyway and take the gamble that something will work out?",06Feb2019,1
29," 

I don't really know where to start and I am honestly very insecure about writing this in the first place. English is not my native language so please be careful with negatively commenting about that since I know I will be effected by it if someone does. (or about anything else on here for that matter)

I don't know where to start or how to really explain so I am just going to throw it all out.

I would consider myself to be an unnattractive person nor do I see myself as capable of going to college and succeeding since I don't feel like I am intelligent enough, I haven't been outside for the past 3 years (maybe 3 times) after dropping out of high school. (I am graduating this year and I don't know what to do with my life which is another struggle) and I don't do anything else during the day then read, masturbate and daydream, I have the emotional awareness of a pineapple and I literally can't seem to understand or learn anything from my past mistakes in life. I don't have many friends because I'm honestly just odd in every way, I don't know how to have conversations with people and I don't understand why, (I personally think it's because I'm very unintelligent) I am incredibly insecure about anything I say or do in public and I feel almost paralyzed to an extent that I feel like I have to be careful with being myself every second or minute of the day. I sit in my room most of the day and don't do much other then masturbate, fantasize about kissing and hugging my imaginary boyfriend (jeez this sounds all really pathetic and sad) that I met online (which I have been talking to for the past three months and because I find him so attractive I didn't want him to lose interest in me so I lied to him that I would be visiting him next month in another country (not sure how to handle that situation either) I also always compare myself with everyone in literally EVERYTHING, I compare myself to my dad with how much better he cooks then me, I compare myself to my friend who seems to be naturally good at academics, I compare myself to people on instagram who seem to be naturally good at taking pictures, I compare myself to literally everyone about anything and it drives me insane because I am never satisfied with myself because of how unnattractive and uninteresting I feel as a person. I genuinely am very desperate at this point and don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for, maybe I just wanted to throw this all out because I'm a mess. OH yeah and also, I spend sometimes hours a day dancing or listening to music and imagining as if I am very pretty, liked by everyone and very intelligent and succeeding in every aspect of life. I am pretty sure I am a maladaptive daydreamer which also consumes not only a lot of my time but makes my imagine things that I am planning in my imagination to do to become 'the perfect girl' that I daydream about being. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I also suspect myself to be a HSP, ADHD and depression. I am not sure what to say now anymore and I am just going to post this without reading and see what people on here might respond with as advice.

OH and by the way I am going to a therapist for the first time in a very long time next Tuesday and hoping to get treatment for all my issues and just see what happens really, I am aware that I might sound like a troll because of the way I talk and stupidity in general but I honestly just want some help, I have no one to talk to and I feel overwhelmed by my mind and having to do it all alone.",06Feb2019,1
30,"Hey. I'm fairly new here but my name's Amanda. I had a really deep (kinda?) convo with my gf and not to go into details, but a plan we had got demolished (the plan was for valentine's day) and I dont think I handled the conversation correctly. 

This whole day my mental health has been garbage and I've felt really disconnected and,,, kinda like not wanting to do anything at all. Just lie around and veg out. Along with that, I don't feel like I'm a good person when I have these moments. Because I can be really one-worded as far as my text messages go, and I can get really snappy and mean.. I've snapped a couple of times with my friends, my parents, my gf, etc. And I always feel like such a bad person,,, 

My personality is (I would like to think) fairly sweet and not at all a ""complete bitch"" which is how I am when I'm depressed/anxious/dissociated/etc. 

I just feel like I had to get that out. If anyone has advice, feel free to offer it. I'm all ears.

31,"I think I am close, to suicide. 

I can't experience joy in life. Sometimes I can experience happiness, but it is fleeting. 

I see very little meaning in living. There is no one for me, and there is very little to go on for. 

I know I am close. Because I have been entertaining thoughts of suicide every now and then. 

I've been doing my best to get along with people. But it seems there are just those one or two asshats who will make attempts to make a person feel horrible unprovoked. 

Life sucks so hard. And gods it's really miserable.  

Sorry for the rant. It's been long.",06Feb2019,1
32,"Ok so for a little bit of background, I’m 17 and turning 18 in a few months. I dropped out of high school at 15 due to bullying, mental health, and lack of motivation. The majority of my happiness derives from the internet (youtube, reddit, twitch, insta, etc) and even when I was little I’ve wanted to be an “entertainer” in some form. My dream is to start a YouTube channel, twitch channel and travel the states. (Unlikely but I’m trying really hard to get the money)

I’ve worked at Chick-fil-A, Target, and am currently working at chipotle. The reason I’m doubting myself and the way I think is because my anxiety and depression only gets super bad when I’m working. I’ve talked to my mom about it and she says that everyone gets upset that they have to work or might get anxious before work and I need to tough it out. I always end up calling out “sick” or straight up quitting under pressure. 

During the periods when I was in between jobs I felt close to fine and yes I had days where my shoulders were heavier and my mind was foggy but it was rare. Idk how to compete with my own head and it’s getting harder to keep pushing myself every single day. To go to bed wishing I never had to wake up again in the literal sense. How do I make money without sacrificing my will to live? How do I get the motivation for things like a college education when I feel like a defunct for not making it thru high school like a normal kid?

I’m going super cheap to get a van and covert it but even then I need around 10k

Ps I’ve had therapy and I’ve enjoyed it but it wasn’t a life changer. I smoke weed if I feel like I’m about to have an episode at home and it helps significantly but I never smoke before or during work Bc I’m not trying to get arrested.",06Feb2019,1
34,"So much effort, so much anxiety, so much doubt but I’m finally seeing someone. It’s so hard to open up about these things I’ve been running away from. My therapist literally just asked how my week was and I burst out into tears, I’m so fragile when it comes to talking about myself. I feel so much hate for myself and it’s so hard to tell another person to what extent I’m hurting. I hope this leads to a better path for me. I have this ball and chain of depressions connected to me and I just want to be free. ",06Feb2019,1
35,"I don’t know if this is the correct place for this as I’m new to the whole Reddit gig but I just really need to get something off my chest and get it out there so I can start to move on. A few months ago. On Saturday the 15th December, I tried to kill myself. It had been building and building for awhile and I snapped. I took way to many tablets. (I’m on 50mg of Sertraline daily for depression). I then didn’t sleep the whole night as it was physically impossible. I couldn’t stop shaking, I was having difficulty breathing, I was hallucinating, I was feeling nauseous, I couldn’t stand up, which I later found out where all side effects of taking too many. I didn’t know what it would do to be but I was hoping for the worst. I didn’t want to be on this planet anymore. Obviously I’m typing this post so it didn’t do what I had planned. I haven’t told anybody this. I needed to get it out there and say it all.

I’m genuinely scared of myself now. I have always felt down but I didn’t know I had it in myself to try that. I’m scared that one day I’ll try it again and no matter what I do it’s inevitable. I also hate that I tried it because I would be leaving my mum and dad in a bad place. The last thing I want to do is break them and I know it would break them. I really don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m trying my best to plod along and take each day as it comes but I can feel the pressure building once more and like a safety relief valve, I’m gonna go and explode to let it all out.

Truthfully, I don’t wanna die. I’m scared of death, it’s so final, it’s the game over screen at an arcade and you’re out of coins. But I think I prefer that to the reality of continuing to live.

I don’t even know why I’m like this. I don’t have a bad life, I have a good job, I have a loving family and I have a small group of friends. But yet, I feel this way. I know there are a lot of people on this planet who have genuine problems at home or in other places who have a reason for feeling like this and I feel guilty that i feel like this without a reason. 

I have seen counsellors in the past and I’m considering going back as I’m determined to get better. Since I tried, I’ve noticed changes in myself, I still have tremors although they are no where near as severe as that night and I’m struggling to sleep a lot more. 

Once again, I apologise if this wasn’t the place to post this but I just needed someone to vent and get it all off my chest where I’m sort of anonymous. I wish everyone the best new year and I hope that this year brings you all your dreams. Peace and love. ",06Feb2019,1
36,"Ok here is the deal, i always felt depressed my entire life but i dont know exactly if it is ranked as enough to be put under the depression banner. Like i barely have any friends or go out and i am always crying alone feeling lonely, this is my 6 month in uni and i never had more than a 10 min interaction with anybody i didnt know, i always tell myself i wanna kill myself but i know for sure im not going ever to do it. But a moment ago i had the scariest moment of my entire life, i was in bed feeling sad like the usual but idk some feeling struck me that i am going to kill myself now, i never ever had this feeling before , i started hyperventilating severely, tears uncontrollably and smoothly running down my cheek and i was literally shivering from this feeling, it was the really most frightening and scariest moment ever in my life ill surely remember it for the rest of my days...",06Feb2019,1

Sorry for wasteing your time.,06Feb2019,1
38,"I had my first session yesterday and have been thinking about it a lot. I was very excited and looking forward to it when I made the appointment almost over 4 weeks ago. The original appointment (would've been two weeks ago) got cancelled cause severe weather led to the office closing, so I had to wait another 2 weeks, which I was very bummed out about. 

Anyways I show up, fill out the paperwork in the lobby, only one there, my time comes up and I meet my therapist. Typical small talk at first, how are you doing, weather sucks today, etc. Asks me to make myself comfortable and sit down and ask what brings me here. Said nobody wants to admit they have an issue but I think I have some sort of anxiety/depression on top of a very bad habit managing weed use over the past few years. Essentially the 1 hour session led into me more or less bringing my therapist up to speed on what I think my issues are over the past 4ish years. Seemed like I probably talked for 45 minutes of the 1 hour session with him chiming in here and there. Things I told him (for reference im 22 and graduated from college May 2018).

- largely throughout college I smoked weed quite literally every single day when I wasn't home from breaks. Maybe not freshman year when I was in the dorms, but the following 3 years it was daily use when I was in my own apartment.

- despite having a good group of people to hangout with, I was a part of an honors fraternity, I would spend most of my weekends alone in my apartment. From the moment I got back from class Friday I would begin to smoke, have a few sessions with multiple bowls each session usually, until I went to bed. Wake up Saturday, wake n bake, repeat. Wake up Sunday, wake n bake, repeat. I literally wouldnt even step out of my apartment door until Monday morning for class

-smoking on weekdays right when I got back from class

-horrible procrastinator, homework very last minute, crammed for tests the day or two before even then itd only be for a few hours. It's a wonder how I managed to keep decent enough grades slightly over a 3.0 GPA

-typical college kid who would skip class occasionally, except junior year and more so senior year I gradually skipped more. My final semester senior year, some weeks, I would skip Monday and occasionally Tuesday classes. That perpetual haze of smoking alone for 3 days over the weekend turned into 5 days. Not to mention it could've been me skipping Friday and the following Monday. (In hindsight I'm not entirely sure how much I mentioned the skipping class part to my therapist)

-first 3 weeks after graduation 2018, I didnt open my laptop once to begin my job search back home. Spent the summer/early fall heavily procrastinating and barely applying. I had a science degree and part of me doesnt even care for a career in the field. Ended up getting a job offer to start working Oct 1st 2018 in a totally unrelated field. Working for the Boy Scouts of America as a Distict Executive. I quit without notice Novemeber 30th 2018 and have been unemployed since, I've applied to literally one job since then.

-note, since graduating I've only picked up weed 3 times, an 8th each time. Two of those pick ups were during me working at BSA. Smoked every day immediately after work. Sometimes prepacking a hitter to smoke in the car after a late night meeting. I quit without notice when I was ""working from home"" and typed out my resignation letter while high. 

-last time I got high was a few weekends ago when I bought 3 brownies and ate one a day over the course of the weekend. 

- my brother rarely picks up, but over the summer I would scrape out resin from his pieces and smoke it. If he did pickup I would take a little pinch for myself without him knowing. 

-my dad is very great and smokes occassionally/frequently throughout the month. But he is a very hardworking man and is responsible with it and keeps it to himself. If I know he picked up (under the guise of going to his friend to have a few beers) I will then try to find his weed in the house to sneak a little pinch.

-ive tried scavenging for weed crumbs and nugs, that may have fell to the garage floor/carpet next to the workbenche where my dad may smoke his one hitter. I've got on my hands and knees and checked the carpet by his dresser where he may pack his piece. This tactic has only worked a few times, where I actually found a hitter or two worth of weed that fell to the ground. 

-besides week stuff I talked to my therapist of lack of desire or interest in applying to jobs. With no idea what I want to do as a career. Music has always been a huge hobby of mine, while smoking at college I self taught myself classical/fingerstyle guitar and got very very proficient at it. My quite literal pipe dream would be to support myself as a musician or in music industry related job. 

Long story short, I have my issues with weed. Near the end of my session my therapist asked if I wanted to schedule another appointment in two weeks, and the real only goal/advice he has me to work on is to really think about what I want to do for a job. Write out all my interests and passions on paper, list and research as many similar jobs that could possibly connect to my interests, etc. We talked about audio production/sound engineer/av sort of jobs because they dont have to be limited to just music and it could tie in with me wanting to be involved in something similar to music. But I guess I've been thinking about if I should be expecting more from my therapist because besides prompting some questions when talking about my weed use, he didnt really offer or we didnt really talk about goals/ways to fix that. And we didnt talk to much about possible depression. Mainly focused on the job issue. Idk if I didnt give him enough time, because out of the hour session i feel like i was talking nearly nonstop to kind of bring him up to speed. Am I expecting too much from a first session? 

Idk even know what to think of depression because I dont neccesarily feel sad/dread. I've had some days where I get into crying episodes, but largely I'm almost very calm/content in a baseline existence of nothing, while the logical part of me is telling me this is so fucked, I can't find the motivation itself to do anything. I'm very productive in my interests and hobbies. I read, play guitar, and love to run and walk around the nature preserves near me. But when it comes to anything ""serious"" I just cant get started.

39,"Hey I don't usually post on reddit but I need some  advice (this won't be wrote well as I'm on mobile and it's quite late.)  But basically I've been feeling like everything is pointless, I can't enjoy the things I usually do for fun and just feel like I can't be bothered to eat or take care of myself. Nothing improves my mood and if I need to do something I'm just constantly doing stuff without thinking like I'm on autopilot. 

I'm wondering if this is depression if so what can I do to help? 

I'm not usually a person to talk about how I feel and in my friendship group and im the happy one who people can usually get to cheer up so its really hard to talk about this.
