2,"Last week I starved myself. I survived mainly on coffee and 5 hr energy. I wanted to look cute for a party my friend was having. The gag is when I went not only was I extremely bloated but the whole night was a shit show and I feel like an idiot. I hated myself for doing what I did and I hate the girl I call my friend and the other girls for not stopping me, tell me what’s going on and instead making fun of me (mainly the bitchier girl) but that’s a different story. I’m just. So. Desperate. I know there are more effective and safer ways to do this but I’m unhappy RIGHT NOW. When I look at myself and see the damage I’ve done to my body this year I just want to hide in a corner and never come out. And I wanna be better but I feel like I’m too far gone and there’s no point. I starved myself last week and this week I binged. It feels good to eat and not think but then I look in the mirror and all I feel is disgust. I walk up a flight of stairs and I’m exhausted. I barely fit in any of my clothes so I look and feel gross all the time. As superficial and shallow as it sounds I wanna feel pretty again. I wanna feel good again. It feels good to not eat and starve. I feel like I have the tiniest bit of control but I’m still exhausted and nothing ever really changes. I just wish I could be normal like everyone else and I don’t know what to do",23Nov2019,1

He said when he first got it it was okay but then after people tried to talk to him about it, it got worse, and when they stopped it got better.

People at my school saw it and now everyone knows I’m the reason my mom wants to die. That’s not why I’m mad however, I’m mad because I have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though I don’t talk to my mom everyday I’m still hurt that she was just going to leave me. I feel so guilty that I’m mad at her because I also struggle with mental health and I’ve been there before, and I’ve felt what she feels but I’m still SO angry at her. She’s never been the best mom, she’s hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though she’s hurt me so many times I know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so I’m trapped. Please people of reddit, what should I do? And am I a terrible person for being mad at her?",23Nov2019,1
7,"Never complain about anyone, nor anything,
because basically you have done
what you wanted in your life.

Accept the difficulty of improving yourself
and the courage to start changing yourself.
The triumph of the true man emerges from
the ashes of his mistake.

Never complain about your loneliness or your
luck, face it with courage and accept it.
In one way or another it is the outcome of
your acts and the thought that you always
have to win.

Don’t be embittered by your own failure or
blame it on another, accept yourself now or
you’ll keep making excuses for yourself like a child.
Remember that any time is
a good time to begin and that nobody
is so horrible that they should give up.

Don’t forget that the cause of your present
is your past, as well as the cause of your
future will be your present.

Learn from the bold, the strong,
those who don’t accept situations, who
will live in spite of everything. Think less in
your problems and more in your work and
your problems, without eliminating them, will die.

Learn how to grow from the pain and to be
greater than the greatest of those
obstacles. Look at yourself in the mirror
and you will be free and strong and you will stop
being a puppet of circumstances because you
yourself are your own destiny.

Arise and look at the sun in the mornings
and breathe the light of the dawn.
You are part of the force of your life;
now wake up, fight, get going, be decisive
and you will triumph in life. Never think about
luck because luck is
the pretext of losers.

9,"For the past two years I haven't felt anything. Most of the time I over react and fake all my emotions... and though I'm not constantly depressed anymore I still Fucking hate it.

Obviously I went on a rant so people don't get the impression I'm mental but I hate the fact that most of the time I'm literally just a fake.

I quit drinking a while back because it was becoming a problem, but recently started again - I figured, screw it, I'm already in so much pain, I might as well drink. Well four weeks later I have spent all my money, been robbed while passed out in a bar, and generally made a fool of myself. I am now scared to leave my house in case someone sees me.

11,So I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for awhile. I believe over Christmas break I will for the first time be admitting this to a medical professional and hopefully getting help maybe in the form of medicine. I am terrified of what this means but also excited to feel better. What should I expect in terms of how long it will take or what I should feel? I'm mostly scared of feeling bland as I have heard that can happen and I would say I already feel this way. I'm also worried about feeling suicidal as it is something I already feel in forms of ideation but not in any way that I would act on it. I'm excited to get better but worried it could make it worse. Any advice or kind words welcome! Thanks,23Nov2019,1
12,"i’m so exhausted, i worked so hard to get through this past semester and my depression just really weighed me down. i didn’t do as well as i should’ve, i had a few failed exams, but i can barely get out of bed in the morning and all i think about is ending it because i’m so unmotivated to do anything at all. thinking about having to get through tomorrow is so exhausting, how can i make it through tonight even? it feels as if all my reasons and inspirations that kept me alive before are loosing their flair. i’m so stressed out, by everything and everyone, despite the fact i’ve finished for the semester and now i’m thinking about not even attending my own graduation ball because i really just can’t be bothered getting everything planned. every conversation i have during the day feels so strained, i stress over what to text back and how long i can avoid replying or answering a call because i’m just not in the mood, i don’t have the energy. there’s one person who i value so much and am always joyed to speak to, even at my lowest, but last night i just left them on read, i was so exhausted i didn’t even want to have to type any longer, it was like my hands had lost their use, i just lay there and stared at my wall. i’m really loosing myself. i hear my parents invite their friends over and force me to socialise, then i can hear them speak rudely about me to them and it makes me feel even more like i’m worthless. they think i’m shutting them out and being withdrawn, keeping secrets or what not, but really i’m just trying to keep myself together. i really don’t know how much longer i can be here. a great man on the show catfish once said ‘sometimes you want to end your life, but you start planning how and when, then you realise you don’t even have the energy to do that, you’re really just that depressed’ i’ve never felt that more.",23Nov2019,1
13,"She doesn't care enough about her depression to get help. She says it's like a sprained ankle. She doesn't care enough to go to a doctor for it, and she can take care of it on her own like she's done before. She feels bad like 90% of the time and she won't do anything about it. She's convinced herself that therapy won't help because it didn't help her brother or her mom so she won't try ANYTHING. Also her mom is hesitant to get her any help even though she was diagnosed with depression and I've told her that if she continues to not get her help she should honestly go to CPS because that's neglect but she won't listen to me.

And I haven't told my parents about it. My parents have high hopes from me. They are proud of what kind of a boy I've grown to become but are unaware of what I've been doing to my academic career. I don't have any negative influences. All I am is a guy who is lazy, has zero self confidence, and full of self doubt. Love life is screwed up as hell, seeing my significant other being passionate and successful makes me happy but increases my inferiority complex and insecurities. At the dead end of my relationship with her. She definitely deserves better, so it's okay. I feel like I should've died a long time ago or I shouldn't have even been born.

19,"I feel like I can’t love anyone
For as controversial as this may seem, I am not a loner. I have friends on my side, I’ve had girlfriends but somehow I can’t feel a strong connection with a girl or someone in general. Almost like if they did disappear tomorrow I would not miss them. I think I feel this way because I have always changed school very often and almost every year I made new friends, however I don’t know.
I never loved the girls I were dating I never truly loved my friends, and I still don’t. Sometimes I feel like I can’t control myself, and I do things I later wish I would have not done (hurting my friends for fun). This school year I met a girl we like each other and all, (we are not officially dating tho) deep down I do not love her. 
I feel like I am a bad person and I’m trying so hard to improve myself. Yesterday, a friend of mine lost her wallet and a friend and I were helping her seeking it around school and in the streets. I took her home later, and on my way home I gave a homeless man in the subway 10$ that I had in my pocket. But it still isn’t enough.",23Nov2019,1
20,"I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and suicidal thoughts for the past ~4 years (they started around the time I was about to enter uni). One thing that I have always believed is that, before I even consider any sort of romatic relationship, I need to work on bettering my mental health drastically and thus gain enough emotional maturity. However, I’ve failed to define how much emotionally maturity is just enough for me to start considering myself worthy of a relationship. 

Thanks to a supportive family, medication and plenty of therapy, I’ve bettered myself far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I haven’t had serious suicidal thoughts in a couple of months and I’ve been able to confront situations which before would’ve emotionally crippled me for weeks. I still have a lot to work on, specially in terms of social skills, but atleast I can find some joy in my day to day life.

So my question is: how will I ever know when I’ll be mentally stable enough for me to even consider seeking a relationship? Or am I just overthinking all of this?

23,"I'm 22 years old and I think my mind is about to blow up!
I never had been with a girl and I spend most of my life alone.
I spend the last three years wandering around, trying different course after failing at college, and now I'm still the same insecure, lazy, overthinker I was at 19.
I feel like I'm attacked at so many fucking front: pressure to be cool and social, to be successful, to be passionate about something, to be less morose; because my friends either build their business, launch their freelancing career, have sex, party, kiss, motorcycle and all. I don't want to lose these few friends I have, but I think I'm too a burden for them: I'm too morose and I don't have some skills to help nor knowledge.

24,"Using a throwaway as the username suggests. Some of my friends know my main and I don't need them getting involved.

I'm not looking for help, I don't want it, I don't need it. I just need to vent about everything. This is also bound to get long winded and rambly. Hope ya'll don't mind. Also on mobile, so please excuse the formatting. 

So I think the crap started to build up when I was around 5 or 6. My parents were in the middle of a very messy divorce, china being violently thrown to the floor messy. After my dad moved out he tried to kill himself unsuccsessfully several times, with my mom always having to find him and taking him to the ER. It was around that time that I begun to suffer from anxiety attacks whenever I was left without adult supervision. This was never diagnosed by a professional but I don't know how else to describe them. Nobody around me knew how to deal with it and it often lead to me getting yelled at for being an inconvenience since I couldn't be left alone anywhere. Luckily I grew out of it by the age of 15.

I must note here that despite everything I've written so far I wasn't unhappy as a kid. I had a tightly-knit group of friends who I hung out with regularly. (being alone with my friends was okay too, but alone with just my little sister for example wasn't enough to keep me from having an attack) My sister and I visited our dad every other weekend and I was fine with that. Though our visits slowly became sparser and sparser after he moved further away to his new wife, to the point where we visited him only three times a year. 

Shit really hit the fan on my senior year of upper secondary school. I'd largely lost interest in studying all together, playing videogames and hanging out with my friends instead. Still, through some form of divine (or more likely in my case, demonic) intervention I managed to pass all my matriculation exams and graduated. Only, my sister had disappeared a week before the ceremony. She had taken most of her clothes, her tv, and all her other valuable things and moved in with our dad without so much as a word of goodbye. Somehow he had managed to bribe and coerce her to leave her studies, her friends, and us behind to go be with him and his new family. To say my mom was distraught would be an understatement. It was only at this point when she actually told me what kind of a man my father really was. Of the suicide attempts, gaslighting, verbal abuse and other shit he had put her through. Through it all I was silent. ""Take it in, shove it down, seal it up,"" I kept thinking to myself. Not a very healthy approach I know, but so much easier than dealing with it. My mom was a nervous wreck until she was prescribed sedatives by her doctor. Somehow she managed to pull off a nice party for my graduation regardless. My dad showed up briefly too, though he didn't come inside the house thankfully. My sister wasn't with him. I wouldn't see her for a long time yet.

I moved away to my own apartment when I was 19, to study game development at an institute. That year was hands down the best one of my life so far, even though it ended up being a huge waste of money since I don't remember jack about what they taught us. Meanwhile my mom was talking to a lawyer about taking my dad to court. In the end that proved to be unnecessary, since my sister seemed to realize what our dad was like on her own. They (my dad and his wife) had bought her a puppy, among other things, as a bribe to keep her there. Well apparently he had almost killed the dog after coming home drunk one night. That had, according to her, been the first thing to make my sister doubt the legitimacy of everything our dad had promised her. She eventually came to her senses and moved back home to our mom and we begun to work on rebuilding our relationship. I haven't spoken to my dad for 2 and a half years now, and I have no intention of changing that.

Everything I've written down so far, I've treated with the same type of ""out of sight out of mind"" mentality. Everything bad I've ever had to deal with shoved down and sealed away. 

Then came the military. My country has a law about all males (and female volunteers) being bound for military service. Every able-bodied man has to serve for a period of 6 to 12 months and I was no exception, despite being overweight. I was doing okay at first, but that damn organization has a way of sapping both a man's physical and emotional strength right out of him. After two months, it all came crashing down. I suddenly didn't have the strength to keep it all buried down, and everything, every shortcoming, every failure, every unresolved conflict in my life suddenly came bursting out like an over preassured sewage pipe. I came very close to turning my RK 62 to my own head at the shooting range one day. It would've been so easy too. I'd've been gone far before the sergeant would've had time to react. I couldn't do it though. I later told the field nurse what had happened. She quickly decided to evacuate me from the camp and sent me back to the brigade, where I spent the rest of the week in hospital since our unit was locked down due to everyone else being at the camp. What followed was a series of interviews by different medical personnel until I was finally declared unfit for duty and unceremoniously kicked out one day before the vow. (yeah I didn't even make it past basic training) I'm still expected to go back in 2021 or 2022. This was in last August. 

My mom wouldn't allow me to go home to my own apartment, instead forcing me to stay at her house. So here I am now, I've been doing nothing but lie in bed and play games or browse reddit for almost three months now. Except it's gotten to the point where I no longer find any interest or energy to play games, nor for much anything else either. I'd prefer to just sleep through the day than actually do anything, and I have no appetite to speak of. So much so that I haven't eaten anything in 2 days. Hell I even turned down a free pizza for crying out loud. Yet just imagining eating something makes me feel like retching. 

Honestly, if I had the guts to kill myself I'd likely do it. But I've always been a coward, from that little kid scared of being alone to the grown man afraid of dealing with his issues. My self-esteem has never been very high but this is an all time low. I pretty much loathe myself and everything that I am, and feel like everyone would be better off if I'd never been born. Yet here I am, a leech in my mom's side, a bloody parasite incapable of anything productive.

I hope I can at least be something of a cautionary tale. Deal with your shit, people, before your shit deals with you.",23Nov2019,1
25,"Hello, recently I've been feeling really depressed and stressed because i realized i can´t count on anyone, my parents are divorced and the one I'm currently living with used to call me crazy behind my back, that led to my younger brother not having any respect for me and everyone tell me what to do like I'm some kind of child in response i don't trust her anymore, i have 3 other brothers who studied overseas and when it was my turn they chose to prioritize house constructions and bet that i will gain a scholarship which in my country is rigged to a certain extent, meanwhile i see my friends going to college and living their lives and here i am having to depend on a fucking corrupt system to succeed, i feel trapped, i have to count on people that don't know what to do nor do care because they already have jobs and i have no one to turn to, recently(one month ago) i was feeling so overwhelmed that i started watching porn , i have been struggling to stop ever since, i guess its one more problem to add to my life, i cant talk to anyone about this since family sucks and my friends are on different countries and seem so occupied with their lives, and now i have to go back to high school to take some classes that weren't given in the year i graduated, sometimes i don't understand what the teacher is teaching and i remember that at this level im not going to get that scholarship. im in a state where i wake up most days stressed and angry and when i come home i have to deal with these people that think i have it easy.

26,"I personally feel guilty because idk if I'm depressed at least not 100% of the time. But most of the time I have an extreme lack of motivation. And I dont feel like doing anything. I also get plagued with thoughts about how everybody dies so why do we do things. As in... Not understanding life? Do I make sense? Does anybody get me? Ugh. I feel so bad because I was not like this. I used to be super positive. And bubbly even. Just... Different. 

But how does one cope? I don't want meds and I dont think the psychologist has helped me at all. Like she listens and all but I dont think she's actually changed anything. I just feel better some days, I guess when I go to therapy I'm not as bad.

I just wish I could understand and accept life as it is. I get very overwhelmed by the thought of just to survive all the things we must do, every single day. Am I just lazy? Because sometimes I wish we didn't have to do so much. It is a huge work we have to do to care for ourselves and I don't know if I'm that strong 

I don't understand myself, or what's happening to me, or what's the reason I feel this way.

Idk if this is a rant or I'm asking for help but I'd like to know your thoughts if you are or have been in a similar place

Thank you

28,"Have to point out I’m not feeling suicidal atm. Ofc there are times recently I’ve felt suicidal but I didn’t kill myself. It’s just a self hate thought. Anyway, let me get on to what we’ve talked. 

My therapist asked me if I had a memory that I could still remember clearly back from my childhood. 

I told him that I attempted to suicide when I was 14-15. My mom was a sick person who locked me in my room every single day (even during weekends and summer) so I could work on my homeworks and be better than their neighbours and so she can show off. And her motivation for me to work was comparing me against neighbours kids. Ofc I grew tired being locked in a room all day. Ah btw, it wasn’t a literal lock. It was a mental lock. If it was a literal lock I would probably read and did other stuff and would hide it the moment doorknob is tried to bulge. So i had to pretend at my desk that I was working. 

One day, when sun was shining and outside looked pretty fun and heaven like, I really wanted to stop being a prisoner. Climbed window and stood inside the window panel for five minutes. The only thing holding me from falling down that I was holding the window edges. For some reason I decided not to and climbed down and sat behind my table. 

So I’ve told that thinking back then I have no idea where I have got the courage, how fucked up could I be to think about killing my self. Told him that I can relate how idiot I can be to do such thing as I was a child. I mean child’s are idiots after all. And as the moment I was questioning that my therapist made his boldest and straight statement by cutting my sentence. 

**You didn’t kill yourself because you are not a murderer. **

It was a weird moment because the guy was being vague for the last year. Never seen him this straight. My response was, “isn’t it a bit schizophrenic to call suicide a murder?” And he was again boldly said “yes”  and he continued;

The act of killing yourself *is* murder as you both urself is the executioner and the victim. It’s the same as pushing someone else from cliff or pushing yourself from the cliff. Suicide is literally murder case where you punish yourself for not going in the executioner’s way. 

Sounds like he’s trying to plant the idea on my unconscious mind but this was coming from his research. Tbf he tried to do such thing twice and I had to warn him to stop with “motivational” crap as I wasn’t buying it. But this was different. 

The fact that suicide is literally murder case. And it makes sense. **I think suicide is just a “pretty” way to call murder act. **

My country is a just a developing country with many domestic conflicts and economy is not developing too so there's no chance for  teenagers to stand on their own.I'm getting depressed day by day,because of their words.I don't know what to do. GRRRRRRR! I can't keep writng,I don't know how to mention my pains.
P.S. In your mind, you probably think Nahh This problem is not that big It's just an ordinary problem for a teenager. Reality is I have anyone to discuss about this as my entire environment pushing me to follow my parents' commands.I don't have anyone no more :'))",23Nov2019,1
31,"ive never had strong interests in anything. ive never seemed to be able to find passion like my family and peers. i so desperately wish i wanted to pursue some kind of interesting career. but not once in my life have i felt that pull that most people do. Nothing makes me happy, everything stresses me out. Im so sick of just existing. All i do is work and sleep and try to ease my discomfort with life through escapism. I feel like im not able to express how im feeling to anyone in my life. my boyfriend is depressed worse than i am so i never bring up how i feel in order to keep from tanking his mood. its getting increasingly hard to be in a relationship with another mentality ill person. I love him to death though. All we do is sit and watch tv when im not at work. We both have a hard time leaving the house and it starts arguments between us. We both want something more than feeling stuck in a room at our parents house. But we’re both so fking depressed we have little motivation to get ourselves out. He doesnt work and feels very trapped in this room he spends all his time in. hes supposed to get his ssi straightened out so we can move out but is so afraid of contacting lawyers for it. Im trying everything in my power to get us out and living more independent but i feel like im carrying every responsibility. Im so exhausted. I got in a head in crash about a month ago. I cried and thanked whoever runs the universe that i didnt die. but since then i really wish that would have been it. Nothing in my life seems to be going well. Everything is so complicated. I just want to sleep and never wake up. the thought of hurting my mother with my death is too much to bare though. I wish i could just phase out of existence and no one would notice me gone or remember me. I feel like i make everything so much worse for everyone im involved with. how can i just live with this pain? i dont think i can anymore. its been a good three years since i last self harmed but the thoughts of relapsing is a daily matter now. its so constant. i want to bleed out my pain instead of letting it bottle up in my head. but where does that get me, where does anything get me? i guess i just had to vent somewhere thanks if you read this",23Nov2019,1
32,"I'm best friends with my ex: we dated on and off for about 5 years (it was a turbulent affair) and finally around 4 years ago we figured it wasn't working and we were better off as friends. This was the only romantic relationship I've ever been in (I've been on other dates but nothing really panned out) and even though it was messy, I realize with hindsight that all of my primary relationships are unhealthy in some way (my parents try their best, but they're super problematic). 

I've always had precarious mental health but it really took a turn for the worst around a year ago, when I was starting to feel especially disconnected (I had recently relocated for career purposes and was struggling to build a new support network, then I was rejected by a girl who I had really high hopes for - that ended up being a disaster and really triggering). I've been pulling through just a day at a time, seeing a counselor, trying new things to keep me engaged, but I'm a real mess and my friend is losing her patience with me. She feels burdened by my low mood and my constant loneliness and general negative attitude. And she basically told me she couldn't be my friend anymore if I didn't get better. She thinks I'm being selfish and inconsiderate and should be trying more things, like CBT or even meds. She might be right, I don't really know. I don't have any official diagnoses, but my motivation and self esteem have been pretty low.

Honestly, I'm just too tired and defeated to even fight this.",23Nov2019,1
33,"I saw a therapist and  he diagnosed me with cyclothymic disorder. He said I should start taking Lithium. I need to go to my Dr. first before I get a prescription. Does anyone have any experience taking  Lithium for depression? 
I read their Is no cure for this disorder and it is probably going to be a struggle for me the rest of my life. I guess I’m looking for pros and cons of starting lithium, I’m scared as hell to take medication, especially for the rest of my life. But I’m at a point I need to try and start to figure my mental health problems out.",23Nov2019,1
35,"So I'm in university and I'm 18, recently for the past month and a half I have had no energy to do anything or go anywhere. I've stopped going to class but still have maintained my high marks, rarely eat, and basically never leave my room. I started counselling, and she recommended that I get diagnosed and try medication. So on Wednesday I finally gave in and went to the schools clinic and was diagnosed with severe Depression and mild anxiety. My parents have called me and have asked me if I'm doing okay and I lied and told them yes, but now I have to tell them because I have to use there insurance to get the antidepressants that were prescribed to me. But I'm scared to tell them because i'm afraid that they wont believe me or think that I am faking it as they don't tend to believe in mental illnesses. Also even though I know that I'm not faking it I keep making my self believe that I am even though a doctor told me I'm not. Any advice would be greatly apprenticed.",23Nov2019,1
37,"Hi everyone, 

I’ve been away a while as I’ve been feeling okay for once but back as once again I can barely make it through the day without crying or having nightmare thoughts... 

What’s everyone’s best coping mechanisms? I don’t think mine are working anymore so I’m open to any suggestions or advice... I want to avoid medication if possible... 

Thanks 🙏🏻",23Nov2019,1
38,So I was peer-pressured into drinking and I wasn't strong enough to say no. Me and another guy kissed that night. I told my boyfriend and we went on a week break before we broke up. Two friends I thought I could trust ditched me. Everyone I made friends with is close to him and doesn't talk to me anymore. I feel so alone and lost. I still have a deep love for him and do not know how to cope. Our relationship was slowly fading and I don't know if it would have ended regardless. I don't know if there is a possibility that we can still have a future. I have no motivation to live anymore and feel like I am slowly withering away. Advice?,23Nov2019,1
