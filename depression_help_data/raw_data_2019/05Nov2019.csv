0,"I have been dating my partner for over 3 years now and living together for 1 and a half. In the last 6 months or so i have started to feel like we aren't right for each other. He is an amazing guy and i love him dearly, however, I am just no longer IN love with him. He also suffers from severe depression and anxiety. He is medicated and sees a therapist but still obviously leans on me for a lot of support. He has mentioned in the past how much he benefits from our relationship and that he would be devastated if I left and isn't sure how he could handle it. What is the best way to go about ending our relationship while causing him the least amount of pain?",05Nov2019,2
1,"I can’t do this anymore. I spent 13 years of my life loving someone and thinking we had something great. Two weeks ago she threw it all away by sleeping with another man. Now she tells me she never loved me. 
I was born with a few major disabilities which made it difficult for me to connect with anyone. This was the only person I ever had any feelings for. Now it’s all gone.
The thought of trying to start over is overwhelming. I just want to shut off. I only sleep an hour or two a night, if I even sleep. I’m so alone in my head and I hate it. I’m not normal, physically or mentally and struggle with my existing a lot. 
I don’t know why I’m posting this. I keep going to my job. Keep putting on this mask that I am okay. I just don’t think I can keep doing any of this.",05Nov2019,1

Hi guys, not sure if this is the place to put this but I need some advice. My partner of ~1 year has some pretty debilitating depression and has tendencies to isolate himself when it's really bad. I'm not sure that he's ever been on medication or seen a therapist for it and I'm not sure if it's my place to ask, either. Is there a way that I can tell him or show him, and make him actually believe, that I don't want him to isolate himself but I don't want him to just pretend to be okay for my sake? That he's not a burden to me even on his worst day (although I may not have experienced it since he hides it)? We're both early twenties if that makes a difference.",05Nov2019,1

4,"Hi all,

I suffer/have suffered from clinical depression for almost 8 years. My boyfriend also suffers from depression and has a history of self harming and he recently relapsed and has spiralled a little. 

I am trying to promote my own self care (going to the gym, completing a college course to further my development at work, seeing my friends [my support system]) and trying to provide support for him too. I write positive notes for him, tell him how I feel about him, reassure him that I’m there if/when he needs me and to not be guilty or embarrassed by how he is feeling or think that he is letting me down, bring him treats, and offer to go to appointments with him. I have done some research to try and get a better understanding as I know that depression is different for everyone.

We are also trying to figure out his triggers and I’m hoping that he goes to more doctor’s appointments. I want a long term future with him (am hoping for us to live together next year) and remind him so. I worry sometimes whether he thinks I smother him or that I make him worse/don’t help by adding extra pressure on him but he says that he is happy with me/us and says that he wants to be with me and I believe him (sometimes my own depression demon feeds on my insecurities and I try to curb them). 

At the moment he is struggling with work, he says he wants to go but then struggles to get there. I mentioned/advised about having an action plan to use as a recovery aid and to help secure his job by showing evidence of working with the company to try and improve (which is what he says that he wants) and it also keeps his employer in the loop with where he is at, what he needs helps with and where he wants to go etc. but he says that he doesn’t want to have one, nor a journal to help at the doctor’s appointments. 

Not sure how else I can help as I don’t want to force him to do something which he doesn’t want to do. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks :)",05Nov2019,1

7,"I’m a 20M junior, and I’m considering withdrawing from school, because each semester I procrastinate my work for my classes until the last minute, stressing myself out just to finish the bare minimum. 

This makes me very anxious and I often hate myself for doing it, but it seems like I don’t learn. Each time another project is assigned, I just do the same thing and put it off. I feel like I am just barely hanging on, like my college career has been me alone on the sea, holding on to a life raft.

I have another assignment that is due in 12 hours that I haven’t even started, but at this point I’m considering just crying and falling asleep.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Did you “tough it out” and finish school, or did you drop out, or just take a break?

Thanks for listening.",05Nov2019,8
8,"Hey everyone. So lately I've been feeling really bad because some issues that I had with my family, but it seemed easy to overcome, until the girl I was seeing started taking distance and ghosting me. 

This has happened to me before, I kinda feel more confident when I have someone who is interested in me and stuff, and I know thats like a dependency for other peoples attention, but I feel like I need someone else to weigh in and tell me why is this or how can I combat it. Cause everytime I runout of people (more precisely girls) that are interested in me or invested in me, my depression kicks in, I oversleep, I feel alone, I loose motivation to anything, I stare into the void. 

Thank your for reading me, and for your advice/opinion in advance. 

I wanted to add that I've been trying meditation and exercise, but is hard to keep up when I don't have mucho motivation.",05Nov2019,1
9,"Ive been having coming and going depressive mood and when my so brings up something that stresses me out a little such as fixing my habits on things im already working on, i start crying.  its happened 3 times this week. he explains himself and i know i dont reply straight away when im in a low mood. Then my so doesnt want to talk to me anymore since im in a low mood. my so is stressed out from me crying each time and says if he doesnt say anything on how i can get better he'll feel guilty for not helping and its stressing him out  and pulling him down; he says hes at his limit. Im used to avoiding more negative feelings but when he brings it up, it pulls me back down.

10,I'm really really depressed like I've been undergoing therapy and I have a psychiatrist and I'm also taking meds but nothing is getting better it's been like 4 years since I've gotten meds and help from a psychiatrist and still nothing. I've had depression since I was a child but I really knew when I was grade 4. That's when I found out that's what it's called and shit and like I have a thing and being sad all the time isn't normal. I just wanna end my life already everything is going wrong I just keep messing everything up. I don't see a future where I'm happy or content at all. I fuck up everything at school like very badly and my close friends don't hangout or talk to me anymore. I'm not good at anything. I don't find happiness doing anything. All my passions and shit I found interesting are gone. I just want to die or idk even I can't think of any other way. I just really wanna be happy but I'm only happy when I'm with my friends but I can't be with them always and I'm not and shit and ugh ugh ugh fuck I hate everything and am really sad idk what to do.,05Nov2019,2

13,"About 2 and a half weeks ago, I found out my ex fiancé had actually been cheating on me the whole time(we'd been apart for now 28 days or something like that), and it didn't take long for me to get over it. It's difficult with a break up for me. But if my partner cheats, I lose all feelings for them and move on. Recently I had started dating again, and she felt things were moving too fast (Even though we literally just went on a few dates). So I slowed down more and just kinds talked to her for a while. And a few days go by and she says she thinks she's ready for a relationship, so I asked her out, she said yes, that went on for about 2 days, then she thought we were moving too fast again, so me being super confused but supportive, said lets take it slow. And now I believe she ghosted me. So like, I feel great. Absolutely great.

It sucks, and I'm not desperate for a relationship, that doesn't bring happiness, I was just testing the waters and I truly found an interest and a liking to her, it just sucks now, though. I just feel kind of bad.",05Nov2019,6

15,"I’m 20 and about to take my second discrete math exam but I’m not ready. I’ve been failing my classes this semester so it’s been a bit stressful. My mind is on my living situation since my family lives paycheck to paycheck. I grew up in poverty so it was rough and now I’m working as I study. It isn’t so bad now but I love with my aunt and her cruel husband. He has anger issues, I tried talking to him about him banging on the wall (the shower heat gets weird when two people use it at the same time). I asked him to tell me instead of hitting the wall but it ended up him saying how it was funny I’m going to community college, talk about how if I were his son he would’ve smacked me, and how the way I go up the stairs makes him want to throw me down them. I recorded this but my aunt doesn’t do too much because he just starts yelling at  her is she helps. I’m not able to share my feelings because of some childhood trouble, I end up shaking and crying if I try to talk about my problems so I just keep it to myself. We’ve had issues with paying bills since my aunt and her husband want to pay less. We originally agreed on paying 1/3 since they owned 2/3 of the house and this has been going on for years but now that my aunts husband got fired due to anger problems, they want to only pay half. They gave us no time so I’ve been working more. When my mother gets stressed she takes it out on me but tries not to, I understand how difficult it is but all this really builds up. I walk around in the morning coughing and feeling sick for an hour because of how scared I am. I then get mad at myself for wasting time which becomes a problem. My fafsa was also taken away because of my stupid decision In taking calc2 over the summer and dropping it halfway. I thought I could handle it but it was much more difficult that I had to withdraw instead of fail. Since I have to pass at least %76 units or higher for fafsa, that means I failed %100 of units over summer and was disqualified. I thought I could push through these obstacles but I probably can’t. My grades are great but now I’m not sure if this semester will destroy my chances in getting into transferring to a good four year with help.",05Nov2019,1
16,"My life has been on a roller coaster for so long and I’ve been having intervals of feeling very overwhelmed which leads to high blood pressure and high heart rate and exhaustion that stops me from focusing on anything which usually happens during weekends when I’m on my own and I feel lonelier than normal. 
I’ve been to so many therapy sessions and it hasn’t helped. I went to a GP yesterday, thinking that he may refer me to a psychoanalyst or something but after getting a life history and asking some questions he decided I score 9 out of 13 for reactionary depression and prescribed Escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro). He said it’s the low dose (10mg) and for one week only and I follow up next week and then another follow up a week after (somehow I cannot remember the details about this bit). Today when I went to get the tablets, the pharmacist said that once I start adjusting to it after a week or so, the doctor may increase the dosage and I’d be on this for another while and it’ll take several weeks to see the results. I found this controversial to what the doctor had said. I haven’t taken it yet and I’m a bit hesitant as I don’t want to depend on medication for endorphin fix. Has anyone been on this medication? How did it go?
Should I take a GP’s diagnosis on this or should I ask to see a psychiatrist specializing as I feel sometimes the doctor’s would just give away medicine?

Further details on my rollercoaster:
I’ve (33F) been raised by strict, financially providing (and controlling) and emotionally incapable parents who wanted me to be the best at everything and only reward me if I did so. My longest relationship was with my psychopathic aspie husband (38M) who was also extremely abusive and emotionally non-supportive, and I had to leave everything in my home country behind to start the married life with him in another continent in his country. After going through too much roughness, loneliness and eventually physical illnesses caused by the poor immune system, I managed to get myself out and after a few other episodes of ending up in other toxic situations with flatmates, friends, etc. I’ve managed to stand up on my own feet, living alone and somehow minimizing my social interactions as well. I don’t really have anyone I can trust or rely on, so that stresses me a lot every now and then that I have to do too many things and I cannot handle it and it wears me down. I think I’ve coped well but I’m not emotionally very stable but I’m still unsure about the medication, particularly with the mismatching opinions I was given by the doctor and the pharmacist. I’ve tried reaching out to the doctor but I don’t know if/when I’ll hear from him. Feeling quite lost...",05Nov2019,2

18,"I have a friend (online friend) who has been mentioning trying to end her life. I do check in on her every now and then and I try my best to respond to her when I see her post something that could be a form of reaching out for help. She does go for counselling although not sure if she is on medication.

The problem is, I'm no better myself. I have anxiety and very introverted. I get drained from just texting someone.

I want to help and be there for her, but how do I do that when my glass is almost empty myself? I struggle EVERY SINGLE TIME to find the right words to comfort others. It's pretty hard to tell someone everything will be okay when I don't believe that myself. What should I do? What can I do?",05Nov2019,3
19,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I've been with him for almost 2 months now, known him for almost half a year. We've not met yet due to his self confidence issues but we live in the same country. 

He's been in a slump since September which was when we had exams and are having exams rn at the moment as well. He has expressed to me that he wants to end his life and disappear. He has also said that he feels I'm better off without him. I try to be there for him, offering to talk, to go to him to meet him, to try to be a form of support in anyway I can. He was diagnosed with ADD if I'm not wrong. He has issues with self confidence and often feels worthless and like a failure and he also thinks that he's not important. 

I try to persuade him and affirm him daily. I do want to meet him irl and we did plan on it but he backed out saying that his self confidence and other insecurities were the cause of it. I do read to him a story every night (mostly) in hopes he does know that he has me if anything happens. Last night, I heard him cry and I ended up crying as well and we did talk a bit and I tried to affirm and support him. I don't know if me crying worsened things but I couldn't help it. We didn't call tonight cause it's pretty late.

He has been expressing that he wants to end his life more frequently than he did in the past and I'm really worried that it might actually happen. He often justifies his need to end his life with some philosophy reasoning that I find hard to refute cause I don't understand it much and convince him otherwise.

He thinks that I'm better off without him and often mentions his thoughts of wanting to end the relationship for my benefit. He also said that he wasn't sure if he loved me and his reason for that was that he didn't know himself but he'll choose to believe that he loves me. He also thinks that his insecurities will ruin our relationship. 

I'm not sure what to do because I'm worried things might happen to him. I don't know his family or his close friends that he may have. I'm really worried. I know what place he lives in but I don't know the exact unit and level. I'm really worried if something does happen to him. I really love him (I'm very sure that at this point it's not just attraction or infatuation) and try to offer as much support as I can cause I genuinely care for him. He has told me that he is mentally fragile.

I don't know what else I can do at this point and I'm just really concerned about him. I myself know how tough it is as I've been through similar with my prior experiences with my own mental health issues. I do try to take care of myself so as to help him more.

I really don't know what else I can do at this point and I'm afraid if things escalate for the worst. I wish I could do more to help him and be there physically for him but for the second one, he's not letting me do that. I know I can't fix him and that ultimately, he has to be the one solving his problems and all I can do is offer support. 

I just need advice on how to proceed I am at my wit's end",05Nov2019,3

21,"Hey everyone, 

I don't really know where to start, I don't even really know what I'm doing here \^\^'

To make it short, I'm a guy, in my early 30s. I survived lymphoma but after it relapsed a first time, which makes my 5 years survival rate noooot so good.

It's been about a year since I'm in remission and I've recently started meeting new people to try and maybe meet someone.
But as I meet new people and time passes, I'm realizing I'm sabotaging myself every time, even before anything happens. I'm stuck with the idea that I might get sick again, and if I'm ok with the idea of not making it, I don't want to take someone with me. Even if I know I should let them make their own decisions, I just can't let them take the risk and get hurt later if something happens.

I know it's stupid and that it's not my choice to make, but I have no idea how to get through that. I don't even know if I'm posting in the right place, I'm just so lost. Should I really pursue a love life ? I can't prevent the idea that it would be a really egoistic thing to do.

After I broke up with my ex that I dated for 9 months and found out that my best friend dates her now (and probably dated her behind my back while I was still in relationship) I don't feel almost anything . Just never-ending emptiness . 

About 2 years earlier when I was depressed every day I created my other personality that is very sadistic , loves to hurt me , but somehow keeps me sane (as much as possible) . 

Now when I feel only emptiness the other person is slowly taking over me and I am worried what will happen to me and others . I could control it for the 2 years , but now when I am hollow and dont have personality I am not sure if i can keep him in secret and fully control him .

Do you have any tips how can I feel as myself again ?

People have noticed I’ve seemed different lately and try to help me but I push them away because I don’t want their help, and don’t want them sucked in to problems they don’t need to deal with.

33,"That's something that others don't usually think about. I'm from a family where my mother and father were low educated and abusive in their own way. My father was a narcissitic pervert, my mother is... I don't really know to be honest. She the kind of woman that ignores how you feel/what you say, request love and proofs of how a good mother she is (""I did that for you so give me a kiss""), mumble to herself and talk mainly about cleaning things. Luckily enough i went without any contact since 2-3 years with my father but I still live with my mother, it's really stressing.

&amp;#x200B;

She complains everyday about everything. She says i'm not depressed (despite me going in a hospital two years ago because I've tried to kill myself and almost succeeded), that i made my own problems and talk to me mainly to give me some of her stress. Living with her is really hard. She does not understand me and understimate how I feel, even though I know that she had and has a hard life.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you add the pressure of school, it's really tough. I live one hour away from my school, so i lose 2 hours everyday in transport. Although I'm lucky enough to always begin at the very least at 9h, so I can actually get up at 7h, i'm actually jealous of my classmates that live like 15 minutes away from school. Yet I can't have my own place because my mother does not trust me and I plan to save up. The other day she said to my boyfriend that she did not even trust me about going one year in a student exchange because of my depression but I still plan to do it if I can (I'm 21 btw).

&amp;#x200B;

I have the best grades in my class, so it's possible. Yet... Studying with the pressure of failing and having no issues, no future if you do so is awful. But even more living in a hostile place (even if my mother does not mean it) is awful. I can't talk to her, otherwise she will say everything is my fault and possibly yell at me.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is the food, usually this is very industrial and unhealthy. Moreover she is used to mumble to herself everyday, which is super stressful and she tries to talk to me as much as possible, which basically means unleash as stress as possible on me. That's why I also got a chocolate addiction, because it helps to feels good and get ride of the stress really quickly. I'm overweight but can't really do things about it at the moment. Except letting my boyfriend tries to help me about it, he is a great cooker but he got so sad aobut me being used to bad food that he made good food that is also mmh... not very good to lose weight (although very good when it comes to flavours)!

Though, she is cooking for me most of the time and provide me with a shelter and clean house, which I'm very grateful. I honestly would like to help with the cleaning but everytime I did something she just got awfully upset and I gave up because it as emotionally overwhelming. I just wish that she would understand that I'm dealing with heavy thoughts and encourage me about my schooling (she never asks anything and does not care in general, although she tries to at least show that she cares when i tell her about a grade).",05Nov2019,1
34,"Lately I've been feeling like my whole life no one really knows me. I find I can never choose the right words to get out what I'm trying to say and people just look at me like I'm talking another language, my conversations are very short and I get this feeling from people they don't want to hear about it, but no one can ever say ""look I don't understand/want to talk about this ""

This has been going on my whole life and I've been to a lot of DRs for mental health reasons but it's hard cause I just feel so disconnected from it all. Most Drs seem real basic and I feel like I'm getting told the same stuff for last 15 years but still just as alone. Like wtf is wrong with me it's getting really frustrating",05Nov2019,1

36,"I usually don't browse this subreddit much as it sometimes makes me feel more down, but I feel like I'm in a really bad place. I'm not sure if its allowed to talk about self harm here. I posted over in r/selfharm for support, but didn't get any responses and I'm just really struggling. 

This past month has been very rough and today I am really struggling with thoughts of cutting again. It's been well over a year or two, not sure exactly how long, but today it's all I can think about. I have been very proud of myself cause I've gone months without even thinking about it and being happy, but lately things just have been getting to me. I'm not as healthy as I'd like to be. 

I know that it's not worth it and I know it's just temporary relief when I do it, but I can't shake the feeling of it. I haven't felt this down in a long time and I'm struggling to cope with it. I have plans to go to the gym with my friend(someone who has also struggled with selfharm/depression) in a couple hours, but my brain is giving me every excuse on why I could skip going and stay home. 

I could really use some support and positivity or a distraction from you guys or if you can tell me what you guys do when you're struggling and how you deal with it. I've been allowing myself to lay in bed all day when I don't have work. I can see myself slipping down this slope, but I want to stop it before I get too far down. 

I feel like I just need to talk to people who understand the urges of this addiction and the struggle of feeling this way.",05Nov2019,2
