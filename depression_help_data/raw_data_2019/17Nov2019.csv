3,"Hi everyone,

I (34/female) haven't been on reddit for a very long time, so I'm sorry if I break any rules about the community here. I'll correct them if they're pointed out.

I just need to get this out because there are very few people I can speak about this to in real life and I've always had good experiences on reddit.

I want to get it out that I just told my dad -- my best friend -- that I need to talk to him tomorrow, and I'll be telling him about how I've been feeling that I want to end my life. I am not in immediate danger. I will not be taking any action on this between now and tomorrow, and I don't think I ever will. But I've been having the urge.

I've had generalized anxiety since childhood, diagnosed and medicated since age 23. This is the first time I've felt out of control since my early 20s.

The depression developed after several life-changing events all occurred around the same time in 2017. I am medicated for it. It's been up and down, but on a general downward trajectory since then. I haven't seen a psychologist since my new insurance denied my old one last year, but I've made an appointment for January (soonest I could be seen) with a new one. 

I feel relief that I'm going to tell him, but I'm also very nervous that he's going to freak out.

Love,

@pootertime",17Nov2019,1
4,"I (21M) have had depression for 11 years, recently diagnosed with MDD and GAD. Everytime I fall into a depressive episode it lasts much longer than it used (days to weeks) before I bounce back to a neutral ground again; it also seems to come out of nowhere with no warning or trigger, which really sucks. More than anything I am just so tired of saying this to myself because I have no one to talk to at all (I've always been a very solitary person). Just once man I'd like to have someone to open up to and just someone to give me a hug, man...

I don’t know what to do in the meantime. I have no friends. It was lonely even attending class, but it served as a distraction from my lackluster and boring life.

10,"I wanted to live, I want to have a happy family but I'm not so sure anymore. I don't see a future of me being happy or with anyone. 

I wanna tell the story of my life. 

I'm a male of age 22. I was born in Texas, US but am currently in India (we'll get to why in a while.) I don't have any relatives at all nor do I have any siblings. All I had for a family were my parents. 

My parents were very religious. Religious to the point of being toxic. They forced me to go to church everyday which I couldn't resist to because I was under the age of ten. One day when I was 10,I was so sick that I didn't wanna go to church. My mom still forced me to the church and as expected, I felt worse in church. 

After that incident, I was beaten by my dad on every small mistake I did. If I drop a pea on the table, I get beaten. If I say a word incorrectly, I get beaten. And not just slaps or shit, I got beaten by a wooden stick that my dad used to keep and his belt. They kinda neglected me except for providing me a home, food, clothes and school and Nothing else. 

I came out as an atheist at age 14. Since then, my parents completely ignored me. Only a home was provided for me. I had to do everything else myself. I had to cook for myself, had to wash my own clothes and I couldn't attend school for a year because my parents refused to let me attend school with them paying the fees. 

I ran away at age 15 sleeping at random places on the street. One day, I met a lady who ran a diner. I met her because I was sleeping on the sidewalk next to her home. She allowed me to stay at her diner if I worked a little. I agreed to become a janitor. She was a very kind lady who helped me get into a school by paying the fees of a complete stranger. I learned cooking at her diner. Thanks to that, I'm good at cooking food and that is my current job. 

A year later, after I had left for school, she dies in a gas explosion. The diner was destroyed and I had lost her. This had a great impact on my emotional state. She was more of a mother to me than my biological mother. I was back on the streets. 

I rented a home with the money I earned from working at her diner and my new part time job as a cook. I pursued my interest of media editing. I did edit a few pornos and three short films (2 of which were Indian.) 

A few years of uneventful normal life, I made my worst decision ever. At age 21, I decided to move in with my parents as they were moving to india. I don't remember why I decided it was a good idea. I thought that they had changed over time and would love me again. I was wrong.

On 19th of March, 2019, I jumped out my window on the right floor. Unfortunately, I survived. I woke up from a month long coma. My parents didn't even show up in the 6 months I was in hospital. They didn't even call the ambulance, the security guard called the ambulance. 

I had no help in paying my medical bills. I had to sell my gaming PC and the car I had bought just a month ago to pay for my bills. I was alone for 6 months only being visited by the hospital staff. 

I did not want to be on suicide watch so I lied that It was an accident. I got out with just $100 in my hand. Before I was discharged from the hospital, my parents sold the house I was living in with them because it was under my dad's name. So I had no place to stay and only had $100. I rented a cheap house that I still stay in for $50 rent. 

I should add that I've never had female contact. I've been single all my life. 

I've got nothing to live for anymore. I just want to end this suffering. I am tired of this life. I've experienced more than I ever could.",17Nov2019,1
11,"Am I the only one who seems to have or feel like that  can't properly express themselves to others with their  personality without being more hands on and make physical contact with others (not in any sexual or violent way of course). I mean for the love of God most to any one can agree that simply sitting next to and making just a little skin contact with some one you like is already amazing and a genuine hug can make their whole week. I'm all for keeping people safe and not feel cornered but with how touchy people are and society in general is the common person is so against any contact plus alot of people (like myself) are basically too scared to hug any one because of possible reactions from them. Some how the only group of people that are fine with making physical contact and literally leaning on one another is the kids at my school that play D&amp;D because we all have suck odd personalities that we seems to just be fine with it and practically encourage it. I just wish it was ok to ever hug some one without literally having to ask them is they consent or something like that and can hug people without feeling like they make or may not get yelled at for rape. God, I'm really kinda starting to see what boomers are getting at when they say younger generations are such snowflakes, cause now most society is just snowflakes and you can't even just do a nice gesture for some one if it involves maybe making physical co tact with them. Sorry if this isn't really making sense, I'm just ranting here. Still tho why is any one younger than 25 or so now adays  so touchy about being touchy. Fyi I'm 15 so I'm just barely a millenial, not a boomer ranting about millennials.",17Nov2019,1

14,"i'm nearly 18-- i've either thought abt or tried to kill myself since i was like 12. i thought at first it was just situational--middle school was rough, so that figures. then i moved during 8th grade so ofc that was hard. i didnt have a lot friends throughout freshman and sophomore year, when i got popular my 'friends' all hated me, and i was brutally raped junior year. i've moved countries since then (repeating junior year due to time table clashes, not because i'm an idiot) and i should be happier because people actually like me now and i'm thriving in all my classes and my social lives and people say i come across as confident and like i've got my shit together.

but i really haven't.

i've seen a couple therapists. my latest one said she couldnt help me unless i was medicated because my symptoms were so severe. and they're severe again. there's something wrong with me. my parents don't take me seriously. i'm going to the school counselor (apparently shes quite good) tomorrow and i dunno if it's even worth it because i wanna die so bad. i mean i know it is. i know that i want to live usually but right now (since forever) i don't. that's quite scary that i've slipped so far again without noticing. i don't want to die but i can't live like this when everything is fine but i am so so miserable. i'm like this every year. its a vicious cycle. maybe i do needa be medicated. i'm a toxic person. i hurt and hurt and hurt and hurt and i cry about it like it makes everything OK. i don't wanna be that guy anymore.

But recently I have started noticing my bad habit with my eating routine. I have found myself eating less (before medication) and having no appetite which prevent me from feeling hungry. To be clear I have always had a great appetite which worries my sisters a lot (I believe). I started noticing this myself after one of my sisters commented that I have lost weight. It kind of startled me because I have only seen that I have lost my muscles. 

Now I told my therapist about my sisters comment (that I have lost weight) and after some discussion I realized I only eat 2 times per day (sometimes 3 depending on the day). But that’s kind of it. My therapist gave “homework” that I should start to eat at least one time before lunch and before dinner, but to be honest. It’s going awful, and really idk what to do....

24,"I'm a college student. I was eating at the dining room with my friends Bob and Sally(fake names for privacy's sake). While I was getting ready to leave, I grabbed a cup of jelly I wanted to bring with me. The jelly had whipped cream in it, and I spilled the whipped cream on the counter. I grabbed some napkins from a table nearby, and attempted to clean it up. I realized that I was only smearing it, which Sally pointed out. She grabbed me more napkins and I finally began to clean it up correctly. I was almost done, but there was still a little cream on the counter. Sally got more napkins and attempted to clean the rest of it up. I asked her to let me clean up the mess. She insisted that she would finish. I got very annoyed, and told her I wanted to clean up the mess myself. Sally rolled her eyes, muttered ""fine"" and let me finish. I muttered ""why do we have to get into these stupid arguments?""

Sally reprimanded me, of course. She said I was letting my pride get in the way. She said she was my friend and wasn't just gonna stand there and watch me clean up the mess. As my friend, she was going to help. I told her it wasn't her responsibility to clean up after me. She said she WANTED TO help. Bob said ""If you hadn't spilled the jello and if you had cleaned it up correctly the first time, we wouldn't be going through this."" I said the day was the ruined. Sally said the day was only ruined because I thought it was ruined. Then as we were walking back to our dorms, we played in the snow for about five minutes, parting ways in good spirits.

The thing is, I have interactions like this with Sally on a daily basis. One time, I told a few other friends of mine that she was asexual. I told them that because Sally doesn't like sex jokes, and I wanted my friends to know that so they wouldn't upset her. Sally was offended because she said I ""came out for her."" My mind is blanking on more examples, but there are dozens of uncomfortable encounters between her and I.

We still hang out. We still make each other laugh. I care about her as a person. I just don't understand why there are times when I can't stand her presence. If we are indeed friends, shouldn't I enjoy her company most of the time? I've only known her for a few months, but I would say I enjoy her company 50% of the time and resent her presence the other 50%.

Here's the thing: I don't WANT to have negative feelings towards her. I was raised by two people who hated each other. My mom and step-dad never failed to find something to blame the other for. ""You're the reason I'm an angry and bitter person."" ""You're the reason I'm in so much debt."" ""You're the reason this marriage has failed."" They also used me as a rhetorical punching bag. ""You're a bastard."" ""You're lazy."" ""You're ungrateful."" This probably sounds stupid, but I don't want to repeat their mistakes. I don't want to blame other's for my problems. I don't want to be an angry and bitter person. I don't want put out negativity into the world.

Should I try to work it out with Sally or should I avoid her in the hopes that she will be happier without me in her life? I know I'm not a saint. I have many flaws. I have the habit of using my friends as therapists. I don't know when to keep my mouth shut. I am socially awkward to the extreme. My sense of humor can be very immature.

I feel ashamed to feel any negative feelings towards her. I guess I'll go ahead and elaborate. I feel like she gets offended too easily. I feel like she is stubborn, a little bossy, outwardly cold (especially to me), crappy even. I always feel like I have to walk on egg shells when I'm with her. I can't discuss religion. I can't discuss politics. I can't have philosophical conversations ( I once wanted to have a philosophical conversation about suicide; she got angry and quickly shut it down).

So, again, I don't know what to do. I want what's best for her, but I don't think I'm the only reason our friendship is a bit strained at times. We both have mental illness. I can't help but think that has something to do with it. I just want her to be happy and I want to be happy myself. Does anyone have any advice for me?",17Nov2019,1

It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isn't... he told his mom about his issues, and she said: ""well you better get on studying and stop with this (bad word) poopoo"" . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I can't help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!?
