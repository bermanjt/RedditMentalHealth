1,"I go back to college in a couple of days, and I don’t have any interest in going. I’m a freshman, and leaving home was really hard for me this past semester. I only have three close friends at school, one of which is my best friend. And she knows that I’ve been struggling severely with depression, an eating disorder, self-harm, and anxiety. She actually has a life though, and a great boyfriend. She always tries to spend time with me when she can, and include me on her plans with her boyfriend. I know though I’m only a burden, and that I take time away from when she’s her happiest...which is when she’s with her boyfriend. I don’t deserve to have her in my life, and I think she would be better off without me. I’ve been talking less and less to my friends from home, they now feel like distant strangers. They ask me how school is and how I am and I just say it’s good and I’m good. My parents and my family are totally unaware of what’s been going on. All they know is I’m happy and I love school. I don’t think I can ever tell them the truth. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. Suicide scares me, but death doesn’t. ",07Jan2019,1
2,"27 F. I've always struggled with anger issues and depression, these both run in my family along with bipolar. I started hit rock bottom April 2018. My job became unbearable where I couldn't even get out of bed or have any energy. So I quit my job. Fast word to August 2018. I finally went to the Dr. but just a general practitioner (no insurance) She prescribed  me 20 mg celexa to take daily for my depression and klonapin for my anxiety as needed supposed to start school back for my last semester for internship part 2. I took a semester off to try and feel better but that didn't happen. At first I felt like the medicine maybe helped me cry less but I still feel suicidal, very depressed,and angry.My anxiety hasn't really decreased either. I start school in two days and im so anxious and I don't know if I can do it with me sleeping all day and self loathing with depression like I'm used too. I just need some advice on how to make it through this semester. ",07Jan2019,1

5,"Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dealing with depression for a few years, but it wasn't too unmanagable until around two and a half years ago. It feels like it's been getting exponentially worse. To the point that my girlfriend of 8 years can barely help with. I don't feel any different towards her. But I have been wanting to see friends that I haven't seen for a little over a year. For some reason, every time I think to go contact them, something stops me. I can't explain what it is. I just don't want to for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for treating the depression, I've tried medication, which either has little effect or makes things worse. I've tried exercising more, and changing my diet. I've been social before, but that's gradually decreased. I think one part of that is that no one ever asks me to go out anywhere. Only one friend does, which is fine and all, but I hang out with him so often. It doesn't have the same kick it had before. It's other people I know who I want to see, who I want to ask to hang out again, who last asked me to hang out over a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the gist of this post is two fold. Are there any other suggestions for dealing with depression? Minus diet changes, exercise, and drugs. Also, do you think I should kick myself in the ass and ask to see them again, or some other thing?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time and attention,

6,"In 2018 my boyfriend of 3 years (I’ve known him 8+ years) left me for another woman, whom he was seeing while we were still together. He kicked me out of our apartment, the only place that ever felt like home to me, so that she could be with him. And most importantly, I lost our baby.

My body is still displaying symptoms from it and I still tear up when seeing children. I currently live in a basement belonging to his parents, because they wanted to help and offered me a place to stay. (They’ve been showing signs of not wanting me around any longer).

I am trying. 

I am trying to keep living by going to classes for college, I got a gym membership with a trainer because I was too depressed to go on my own anymore, I joined a women’s hiking group so I wouldn’t have to go alone (we used to hike together), I am looking for internships, Still trying to find a new apartment, I’m recognizing my depression and seeking help for it. 

But no one sees anything I’m doing as trying. They see it as pathetic. Which makes me feel worthless and a waste of space. 

How do I stop the dread of waking up? Or going to sleep? Or trying at all?? How do I let go of the man I asked to marry me with his child inside me?...how do I move on from that?

7,"I (21f) have been struggling with severe depression for like 7 years. I’m ready to just end it. I’m so tired, and I have no motivation to do anything with my life. I’m very lonely since I moved back home and quit school. The only reason I’m not checking myself into a mental hospital is because one of my friends went there a couple months ago and when I visited them it looked awful. And she hated it. I’m at a loss at what to do. Basically just looking for someone to talk me out of suicide.

9,"2 years ago I was having problems with depression but managed to step out of it and every time I look back at that time I realise it was a shitty reason to end up with depression but now I think I have a legitimate reason and specially to enter this subreddit to ask for help. So this all started when I entered High school and as well as my social life was getting (I didn't have many friends until I changed schools) everything else was falling apart, since I started high school my grades went down in an alarming rate, I failed most of my classes and then tried to save them but wasn't enough and it kept on going until now that I was finally expelled which is the reason I'm falling back to depression, since I failed my first semester I gave everything I had to pass my classes but wasn't enough and I still failed most of them, and now that I was expelled I feel like shit since I gave everything to pass my classes but wasn't enough and that was starting a domimo effect on my life since I'm again having a lot of troubles with my parents and most of my family, I lost all the friend I finally had, I gave up my passion in life (playing guitar/bass) and many more things which now make me feel like a failure since I'm the first one in my whole family to ever fail school and now I lost my parents support and everything which is now making me feel like shit, honestly I need help, I'm not looking for attention or anything nor wanting so sound edgy but any help I could get I would appreciate it, thanks and sorry for any broken English but I'm mexican and I haven't practiced my English in almost 2 years ",07Jan2019,1
13,"We've been really struggling. We've been together for a year but for a couple of months something's been off. I feel like she doesn't want me around as much, she doesn't want my touch as much as she used to, hasn't been interested in sex for a couple of months. I should say, she has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I've been trying so hard to be supportive and listen to her whenever she felt like talking.
Last night, she told me she wants to be by herself for a couple of days. She says she's not excited about us, as much as she was when we first started dating.
We're best friends and still are. And at first, I thought things suck because she's going through hell. But now she just doesn't know if she wants to stay together. She admits she doesn't know if she feels this way due to her depression. I don't know either.
It's been really hard not to spiral into bad moods and horrible thoughts, cause it's really frustrating. I feel like if we don't make it, I'm going to find myself in a bout of depression as well.
Any thoughts? Advice?",07Jan2019,1
14,"Up until recently, for about the last 2 or so years, I've been somewhat depressed. I remember I cried a lot, and was *very* emotionally sensitive. I guess I had a lot on my mind, all bottled up for a while. It made me sad seeing all of my ""friends"" eventually finding people who had a mutual love for each other while I was stuck alone, and naturally, I began to drift away from them. I don't know why I tend to isolate myself from the people I care about the most, but it just happens. Recently, as previously stated, I've been feeling less... depressed. I still feel sad, but a lot less emotionally sensitive. Prior to recent events, I could recall thoughts or songs that could put me to tears in seconds, but now they just make me think, and instead of sadness, I don't really feel anything anymore. I still laugh a lot - I always have, but nothing feels genuine anymore, nor is anything truly interesting to me anymore, like life has lost its touch. For context, the reason for the sudden change in emotions is because of a friend I recently made, that always has open arms. It makes me anxious knowing that one day I'll stop talking to him too, and who knows what turns my life could make after that.",07Jan2019,1
15,"I've been fighting depression for a year and I have this strange sensation I want to share with you. When I emerge from depressive episodes, I feel good and more focused on material things (i.e. job, education, relationships)... but when I relapse, it seems like I've finally found the truth. Like a veil has been ripped off and I can see the reality. And the reality is that life has no purpose, that after childhood there is no chance of happiness for humans, that relationships are just fake attempt to connect to others. I watch other people living their lives and I can't help thinking they're all living an illusion. I just can't understand if the truth is what I experience when I feel good or what my depression tells me. Both my therapist and psychiatrist told me that there is no ultimate answer to this question but I won't stop searching. ",07Jan2019,1
16,"I feel like I'm going crazy. I made so much progress recently. I was so depressed because of what happened to me in the past and I spent the past year making brand new relationships and patterns. This summer felt amazing, like my depression was practically gone. I started dating someone new. I took a break from therapy. I felt like an entirely new person. 

But now... it's been about a week since I got a good night's sleep. My brain is constantly wired and I have no thoughts to pin them to. The smallest things makes me feel so overwhelmed. I feel distant from my friends, my boyfriend, and I really have no reason too. When I try to think positive thoughts my chest gets heavy and all I can do is dwell on shit that happened so long ago and doesn't even matter. Logically, I can convince myself I'm okay. But emotionally, I just don't know anymore. Would love some encouragement as I know this time will pass but times like this makes me feel like my depression will always get the best of me. I feel so weak fighting this battle against myself. I'm very open about it. I have been crying and venting to people and working out and drinking sleepy teas and sleeping meds and... oh goodness. It comes out of no where sometimes and I'm getting very scared, like my chest is also heavy and my heart is callous. ",07Jan2019,1
17,"I can’t sleep. I can’t do anything I was able to do a while ago. I can’t even tell people how I feel, and I hate the word depression. I hate it because so many people use that word nowadays and everyone wants to be depressed to be “random” or “quirky” but half of the people live normal lives. I’m no gonna go into details, but I never really had the best childhood. That’s all I’m gonna say, but I have cut off all of my relations with people, and for some reason I feel better alone. Solitary is the only thing that makes me feel okay. Wat do?",07Jan2019,1
19,"So recently I had been talking to a girl, we were both interested in each other and had hung out a few times, everything was going really well. 

She was supposed to come to my New Years Eve party last week, but she ended up blowing it off with no explanation. Haven’t heard from her since.

The old me would have gone into catastrophic thinking, wondering what did I do wrong? Am I a joke? Does she hate me? Was she only hanging out with me because she was bored? And it would have brought me into the darkest depression, I would’ve focused on it for weeks.

But this time I deleted her number and I told myself something. I said in my head “there’s nothing wrong with you, you were a gentleman, you were extremely nice and fun to hang out with. The problem is clearly on her end so do not dwell on something you can’t control. Focus on becoming better as a person and meet someone who will treat you better. You deserve better.”  

We all deserve an amazing life with great friends and family. Do not ever sell yourselves short guys. Because we are all beautiful people. And we are destined for a great future. Never give up. Have a great day everyone, remember, it’s a new day full of opportunity so I’ll be as corny as I can be right now and say EXCELSIOR! Seize the day! Haha:)",07Jan2019,1

26,"Ok, here's another nugget of crazy:

Every single morning for the past 2 years or so, I've woken up to voices talking of my suicide.

That moment right after I shut off my alarm, when I'm still mostly asleep, I hear people saying things like ""He's dead"", ""He killed himself"", and other more-detailed comments of my suicide.  Like they're just finding out about it or gossiping the details.

This isn't something I hear every now and then.  It's every single morning.

I don't recognize the voices as anyone that I know and they are both male and female.  And they never talk directly to me, just about me.
