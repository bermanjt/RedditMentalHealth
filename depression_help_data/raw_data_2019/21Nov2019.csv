0,"Am I that unworthy of life? Even on r/suicide_watch I posted a plea for help because I was going to cut my wrists again. But nobody gave a pice of shit about me. So I just ended up smacking myhead in the walls of my bathroom crying and laughing hysterically. Please, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ANYTHING NOTICE THIS! I AM DESPERATE! PLEASE!",21Nov2019,1
1,"I hate complaining, but I can’t help it. 

I dont know if this is the right sub to talk about this sort of thing, but I guess I’m just kinda ranting.

For the most part, I’m successful in my life. I have a girlfriend whom I love, I feel fulfilled in work, and I’m performing at least decently in school. 

That said, I always have something to complain about. I always have, and I hate that about myself. I feel like a narcissist, a self-absorbed piece of shit.  I’m sure my friends would say differently, but I feel like I am always talking about myself. 

There’s a long list of complaints I have about my life, and that makes me very, very upset. I want to be content, I want to be supportive of others. I want to be consistent with how I view myself, and how I handle things. I want to be happy.

I have something of an anger problem. It used to be a big issue in my relationship (don’t worry I’ve never hit her or anything.) While I have learned a great deal of self control, I still feel it flare up from time to time. Especially when she has a recurring problem that I can’t help with, despite my attempts. This makes me so mad at myself, and so sad. I just want to be good. Instead, I feel alone. I feel like I have isolated myself, and other’s don’t feel like they can trust me. 

People used to come to me for advice, it was kind of comforting. It was nice to know that despite how shitty I was, someone still wanted to know my opinion. That doesn’t really happen anymore. I lack much external validation, and it pisses me off that I need it.

My girlfriend tells me she loves me. My friends like to talk to me. Why do I still want more? Why can’t I be satisfied with what I have? Why do I have to complain so much?

Hell, this post in and of itself is just a string of complaints.",21Nov2019,1
2,"I'm well aware, this post will likely be buried, and rightfully so, my problems are nowhere near the intensity and the magnitude of others, and I honestly encourage anyone reading this to go help someone else first, I'm a waste of time. Id also like to just inform I don't even know if I'm depressed or if I'm just some suicidal mental basket case, as well as, if I do, moving forward, decide to end my miserable existence, I might as well try to get some sort of help. Ether way this will definitely sound like me complaining most of the time.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I can barely put to words the exasperation and thought processes I feel daily. And for no reason of course. I have absolutely no intriguing or legitimate reason for the unacceptably unreasonable way I feel. I'll make a presumption that any person reading(if anyone is actually out there...) Would want some background information. I'm a high school junior. I'm reasonably athletic, and I'm told, by numerous people that I'm quite popular, though I very much doubt this. All my life I've been in some state of mental disrepair. I continually ignored my depressive behavior and inexplicable sadness for years, all the way to the age of nine. I attempted to, well, explain my feelings, to my heavily conservative parents, who are very much of the, kids these days are entitled mindset. As you can imagine that went absolutely terribly. They nearly threatened to ship me off to a military school for being such an, ""Entitled, lazy, son of a bitch!"" Thereafter calling me a mistake. All of which I personally believe is justified, I've contributed nothing to this world. I'm simply a mistake. After hearing that, I stopped complaining.

  It continued to get worse. Instead of just sadness, it grew to encompass sports, one of the few reasons I refuse to do school sports. Anytime I do anything sporty, play any games at all, I critique myself. Harshly. If I miss a shot, it becomes ""Of course you missed that shot you useless stain on humanity."" When I make a shot it becomes, ""You finally made one, you complete and utter disappointment."" After a while, I asked one of my coaches if he knew of a way to fix this. He proceeded to cuss at me and tell me about how ungrateful I am, and I stopped complaining. 

  But then, it proceeded to get worse. As high school rolled around, through to the middle of my first year(seventh grade, our school started high school early), I worked hard. All the added stress didn't help, and at this time I didn't have many friends. Then one of the very few teachers I revered and trusted had a few choice words for me. Called me some terrible, true, but terrible things. One of the only people I trusted made It very clear he disliked me. From that point, I began contemplating suicide. Twice I almost attempted, caught neither time. Though I decided, on the second attempt, that I would not die a nobody. I would be remembered. Even for bad things. But I'd be remembered. 

  Over the next 2 years into ninth grade, I went wild. I became the class badass. I did many crazy stunts, like hanging by my feet off the roof. I wasn't afraid of dying, I wanted it more than the world. I became friends with a bunch of assholes, and thus became a reasonably popular bully. I'd say horrible things to teachers and continued punching down like an absolute trashheap, and of course my parents hated me after time. I of course did not care. For some time, I could ignore the terrible feelings. Until I got home and felt even worse. I became a slight racist, egged on by my newfound following. I was finally top of the ladder. It was all not meant to be, socially at least.

  The end of eighth grade. Last two weeks. My friend James, (who was one of the only people I wasn't an ass to, and who I considered a real friend) had added me to a call with a girl, named Karen. I had dated girls before. None of which I liked. Then I met her. She was beautiful. She was smart and funny and absolutely amazing. She was two years ahead of me. We talked for a long time. That week I walked her to the school doors. After she left one of my ""friends"" asked me, if I liked, ""that dirty little slut."" I punched him I the face. The whole of my ""crew"" then began to flip. I called them all a bunch of miserable insufferable assholes, then walked away. I renounced my old ways. The last week i broke down. I realized what a shitty person I'd been. Thus ended eighth grade. 

  Through into ninth and tenth grade my depression came back. The self hate, the loathing, the sheer hatred of myself. Though, it was very modest at first, slowly developing into what I'd call full blown depression. I however, improved my conditions enormously. I soon became real, respectable friends with everyone in her grade level, and all over the school. I learned to act. Put on a happy face while sad or pissed. Found out humor is the way to anyone's heart. After only 1 more attempted suicide, I learned a lot, and gained so many true friends. However, the self hatred got in the way of one huge thing. Karen. She asked me out. Twice. I turned her down. I was head over heels for her. But I couldn't bear the weight of the thought of her dating me. This shitty terrible horrendous person who can't even make his own dad happy. I couldn't let her date me. I wasn't, and I never will be, good enough for her. Ever. Ironically enough, the one thing that I changed my whole life for, I'd refuse, not only once but twice. And the worst part, I'd turn her down again. For as horrible as a person I was, I'd never subject her to that. She's still as amazing as she was when I met her. I wish so much that I could date her, love her, but she deserves so much better. 

  By the end of tenth, the symptoms had slowly gotten better. I had made the grade level 2 years ahead my friends. Everyone knew my name, and a lot of people liked me, not a majority no, but most people did. Slowly I felt better. I busied myself and ignored like I've learned to all these years. It's all I've been able to do. I'd become happy occasionally. One in a million I'd congratulate myself. Anyone I saw in the halls I'd laugh with. Teachers occasionally likes me, and I make a few of them laugh with witty jokes. One time... I actually said, maybe dad's wrong. Maybe I'm not a dissapointment. And it all went downhill from there. 

  Eleventh grade started. I hadn't realised all the seniors I'd made friends with last year were so important to my mental health. So going in on the first day, I expected the usual, staying hi to everyone I know, taking about everything under the sun with he people I'd known for so long. Surely with them not there, there were still plenty of others to talk to?

  I was wrong. On the first day it hit me like bricks. All my eggs were in one basket. Of course I had many surface level friendships with people, but I lost so many people I had real, meaningful connections to. Maybe 5 people, who I'd truly do anything for, still remained, compared to the 20 or so that left that year. At first I assumed a fluke, but soon I realised this was the naked entire truth. And with so many people going to collages in other states and in different countries even, it was hard to reconnect. I felt alone. As it was since I met Karen I attempted to distract myself with girls, but that never went beaond superficial relationships I couldn't make a connection to to save my life. And so we reach now.

  Slowly I've been getting worse and worse. I go to a trade school for half a day, so I don't get to see those 5 friends only twice a day. Because of where I was born and where I live, the entire trade class automatically hates me. The teacher, who I thought actually liked me turned out to despise me just as well. Karen joined the army, and I can't talk to her only on very special occasions. By 3 weeks I had seriously considered suicide. By week 6 ive gained new symptoms, things I'd never thought I'd feel. No longer is it sadness alone. I simply have no drive to do anything. I hate myself more than already normal, I feel crunched and floored by the weight of my parents dissapointment, my own unsatisfactory feeling toward myself. My only escape from this wrenching emotional pain comes in sleep, and even that is being taken from me, insomnia being the culprit. I no longer think of suicide. I dream of it. It sounds so nice and peaceful, slowly luring me in. The little I still care about keeps me grounded unfortunately however, forcing me to slave away in this world where I wake up with the incomprehensible hatred of my life and the weight of my past actions and horrible misadventures on my shoulders. The Little I do sleep I dream of those I've wronged, knowing they'll never know anything else of me, exept that I've been an asshole to them. So many people will know me as only that. It's a lot to carry. I don't know what to think. If you've read this, all I ask is for a simple word of advice. I figure if I plan to end my life, and succeed, I may as well ask someone, anyone, for help beforehand. However, even I don't consider myself worth saving, and if you such as agree with this sentiment, simply tell me to stop complaining.",21Nov2019,1
3,"I have had depression for a very long time and I let it rule my life up until a few months ago. It’s all I had ever known. I have been so amazed by how much I’ve been able to recover and love myself even over a few months. I’ve developed healthy mental habits in place of extremely self destructive ones. A lot has changed because of that and I believe in all of you that you can do this too. I had looked up so many books and videos and articles and so much therapy but what really made a change was looking inside myself and actually listening. Just my suggestion for anyone struggling!

What hurts is watching myself fall back down. Back into these terrible cycles. I’m proud that I’ve finally gotten a taste of happiness but it’s terrifying thinking of getting that bad again. I can deal with the inner extremely critical and hateful voice in my head one way or another. It’s just the emptiness, numb, disassociation that I don’t know how to cope with. I’m not able to enjoy anything I love anymore and I avoid texting or talking to my friends. Which makes me feel even more alone but I just don’t enjoy talking to them. I can’t get into the conversation and I just space out. 

Anyone know how to cope with feeling numb/not real? Any tips to bring yourself out of space? I appreciate any advice :)",21Nov2019,1

She recently went back to school and works nights now, so I don't see her hardly at all. The loneliness and sadness has crept back in, which is noi problem.

14,"First time poster here. On mobile.

I've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.

This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.
Things weren't always perfect.

I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.
This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.

I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.
On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.
Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.
He said he didn't love me anymore.
He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.
He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. 
In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.
We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.
Fine.

I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.
We didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.
We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.

Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.
Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.
We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.
After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.

The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.
We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.

During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.
I didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.

As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.
I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.

He wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.
He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.
Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.
He said he hadn't loved me for a while.
That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.
Through all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.
We argued the rest of the way home.
At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.
I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.

Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.

And so now I'm just here. Feeling worthless.
I cared for him
I loved him.
But I didn't even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better.
He didn't even have a regard for me anymore. He didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so I've been writing this since 5:23 AM and now it's 6:29 AM. I don't know how to feel. But I feel worthless.",21Nov2019,1

18,"It's occurred to me that I've been thinking about my problems lately and stacking one after the other: losing my high school sweetheart to the gay community, being comfortable with my bisexuality (of which I'm starting to think is coming from loneliness), the pressure of becoming the first Comp Sci. Bachelor graduate of my 7 siblings let alone college graduate because I'm a first gen, depression from having financial instability, poor parents who ask me for money, and a close-knit friend group dissipating from new jobs and relationships. I've tried to stop thinking about it for the past few months but it comes back during stressful situations.Trying has gotten me inescapable coding interviews that I'm not motivated to prepare for anymore and a failed Tinder relationship of 5 months. Honestly, I was just testing the waters with that Tinder date. We broke up a few weeks back and I already forgot we dated. It was nowhere compared to my high school relationship which I depressed over for about a year. I cried often and dissociated myself from everyone after he confessed months later that he's gay. I used to take relationships seriously. Oh yeah, and lots of depressing music. 

Anyway, I'm losing motivation for just about everything, especially for drawing, friends and family, and school. I was a suma cum laude 4.0 high schooler with nearly 11 years of self-taught experience in traditional drawings. A novelist wanted me to make her a book cover. Who am I now? I don't even know. I chose CS because I loved the idea of programming and building mobile apps. It felt like a perfect blend of creativity and technology. Also, I dont think I've broken from my middle school shell just yet. I was once that quiet, humble, optimistic student from high school who loved to cheer other students on, while I fell behind. It was an improvement from middle school me, who never worked and was always stressed out about my parents arguing. I was still quiet then and never talked about my issues. I was okay with helping others because I felt like there was nothing for me to keep living on about. I work only to make others happy. But what happens when they aren't? I can't read minds but it feels that way often. Now, I always feel like a waste of space. In fact, it's growing back and I'm not motivated to fix it. I just want life to end already. I've made an appointment with a counselor which is next Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving.

I also am always never out in the ""real"" world so to speak so my social cues are of course skewed. But I thought I had a really strong bond with my friends despite my illness meaning I only find motivation to talk to them every so often. I recently went and visited one of my closest friends at university and the whole time I was there I felt weird. Like I was a hinderence to him, and he'd much rather be off with his other friends who he'd grown closer to by living with and around them. That's fine, and I am so happy for him but I just wanted him to be real with me about our collapsing relationship instead of forcing himself to be around me, like I was some old dreg of a version of him he wants to forget. This made me consider my other relationships with other friends and how I always seem to be the last person picked for the football game, so to speak. I realised that other people were my friends but they found it much easier being friends with other people due to just how taxing it must be to deal with me always being in a bad mood, or always being anxious, so it's not like I can even blame them (not that I would anyway because it's blatantly obvious I am the problem) Anyone else think that they overestimated their relationships with their friends or am I overthinking it?",21Nov2019,1

I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy)

I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure 
I'm not feminine in any way. I don't care of my appearance and I smell (but I just don't feel like taking care of myself, I know it's a crappy excuse). I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I don't know why I can't bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. 
As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this. 
I don't know if it's because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe I'm acting like that because I believe it too. 
I don't think I'm insane but, maybe I'm wrong?
It's driving people away and it's driving me insane. 
I'm not aware of my surroundings and it really pisses people off, including myself. 
I really need some advice and I want to know why I'm acting like this and what I need to do to be a better person.",21Nov2019,1
28,"Is it bad that I love to be hated? Is it bad that I love the pain of knowing no one likes me? I feel like a burden on everyone that tries to help me. I feel like living with all of this bottled up anger is going to be the death of me. Or push the few people I love away when they realize I’m a lost cause, that’s only going to get worse or hurt them too.",21Nov2019,1

31,"I suffered from debilitating major depression for a year  when I was 19 (shaved my head. had to be carried into the  shower because my personal hygiëne was atrocious etc etc). Never had it again afterwards thank God.  

What I got instead , years later,  was seasonal affective disorder and what makes my depression such a weird experience  is how ridiculously atypical this depression it is.  

I still feel good about myself and about my future, I  feel capable, my self esteem is the same but I seem to have no energy what so ever. I sleep all night, wake up and feel like i haven’t slept, I lack all motivation and I cannot stand other people. On one hand I have been unintentionally celibate forever and I feel bad about that. (Because too young to be this lonely and sexually inactive I tend to think to myself)  but on the other hand i’m pushing everyone away. I have deleted all social media and would rather not speak to or see anyone.

I’ve been inside for weeks and feel complete resistance to going outside. I only go when I  100% need to. Getting out of bed  takes forever, showering and brushing my teeth takes forever. I haven’t cleaned my house in forever. When I know I have to be somewhere it seriously takes me 4 hours to do stuff I used to do in 1 hour. When I’m finally dressed and made up I feel cute and can go about my day without issues. Then when I come home, no matter what time it is, I just want to put on a onesie, lie around and shut the world out again.


It is so frustrating. I feel like I’m not “depressed enough” to get help but also not NOT depressed enough to deal with this myself because I feel like I am losing months of my life to living in this state.",21Nov2019,1
32,"Last month I thought I was getting better I was excited for the future but now my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are worse than ever I feel,

I keep getting in arguments with my family my brother thinks I'm a terrible person I make everyone annoyed when I talk I've been trying to be nice to everyone and i always get yelled at about anything an everything 

I have been in bed all day because I can't get up idk why I just can't my mom was yelling at me for being in bed because she said there is no reason and I asked her if she needs me to clean/do anything but she said no, 

I feel like there is no point in me being here I don't want a future like getting a job, getting married,  having kids, basically anything I'm just done and want to be gone I have been on different medication for two years and I ask to see my therapist again but they never scheduled an appointment 

I just don't know what to do anymore",21Nov2019,1
33,"I’m so sad. I just want to cry. For a fleeting moment in time I was happy, I had finally been a step closer to my dream. But now the dream is withering before my eyes, crumbling in my hands. I won’t make it. This last wall I need to get over is too large. It’s to tall. I had leaped over the others, it was hard but I did it. They where Self confidence. Strength. Love. All things I myself needed to change. But now the one thing blocking my way is in other people’s hands. It’s been a month, after we sent the email my happiness escalated, waiting for a reply.  “you can do it” is what I thought I would feel like when I received a good reply. But no. There was no reply. Follow up. Follow up. Still nothing. Nothing. I got past my self confidence. I believed I was good enough to sell my creations. I got past strength. I was strong enough inside to handle it. I got past Love. Love for my creations, knowing that other people would love them to. 



But no. I’m not good enough. I’m not strong. I’m not loved. I was to stupid to have my hopes up. This is the reply. The reply is nothing. I know I’m being selfish. But all I wanted was something that let me know I was good enough. All I wanted was a sign from the universe telling me I was worth it. But no. I’m sorry if I’m being vague. I just don’t want to explain the details. 



Thank you for reading this far. I just don’t know what to do. I shouldn’t give up. But I want to so bad.",21Nov2019,1
