1,"I am a 21yo male and A year ago I moved cities to live with my family again. In the past year I have made no friends in this city despite gaining a very good job, there was no one I really connected with due to the age difference. I left that role not long ago as I felt I had grasped all knowledge and wanted something more challenging. Not connecting with anyone also swayed my decision to leave. I don’t get along well with my family so I don’t like hanging out with them as generally every conversation turns into an argument. I am still between jobs and have become very lonely to the point I don’t know what to do with myself. I used to be surrounded by friends 24/7. I used to not have as much social anxiety. I met lots of people through mutual connections as I dont play sports or have any “hobbies” like taking art classes or whatever. Now, I barely leave the house unless I have an interview. I feel like I’m missing out on everything, I see all my friends from the city I previously lived in having a great time. There are so many events here I would love to attend but I have no one to go with. I have taught myself to like my own company to an extent but I really need a friend right now. I try keep my mind occupied but I don’t really know how much longer I can keep lying to myself. I am alone. ",30Mar2019,2

6,"I'm just going to start by saying that, while I haven't been diagnosed with depression, I believe that I am depressed.

I don't mean to upset people who have depression, by saying that I am depressed, but ot seems easier to use the word ""depressed"" to explain how I am feeling.

---------

I've been incredibly depressed for months, but it's been much worse these past two/three weeks.

I do have a job, a good job, but my head is so fuzzy that I can't think properly (most of the time). I end up taking longer on jobs than I used to, and I'm so anxious that I can't get myself to ask for help. I'm terrified of being fired, because I don't know what I'd do for work, but I also really want to be fired so I can end my life.

I am limited with the jobs that I can do, as I am an idiot, and I have severe hearing loss.

--------

I have suicidal thoughts constantly, because I'm so much of a weirdo and dumbass that I can't properly function. I also deal with such ridiculous levels of guilt and shame that I can't get out of my depressed state or stop feeling suicidal.

I don't have the motivation to kill myself, but I don't want to go through life being unable to enjoy anything at all, and I don't want to have to live with all of these thoughts on my mind.

I also keep myself from killing myself because I'm stubborn, and I don't want the people that I went to school with to be right about how useless I am; or the two primary school teachers who dragged me into another class to show me the smarter kids in my year, who were going to the same school, telling me that I'd never get to the same level as them, making me cry.

--------

I also think that I might be a transgender woman (you'll see tons of trans posts on this account), and I can't deal with it. 

I have a family that refer to trans folk as ""freaks"" and constantly fearmonger, and because they've been that way since I was 12/13, I was transphobic in the past (they gaslighted me, and I started arguing back when I was 16, but it took a massive toll on my mental health).

Because of my past, I don't think I deserve to be happy, or accept myself as a transgender woman.

Plus, I wasn't as heavily depressed as this other trans girl at my school. She didn't look after herself at all, talk to anyone (except for this one kid that I was good friends with), and was constantly sleeping in lessons. She came out after I left school, and I don't know how she is, but I hope she's happy. I wasn't that depressed, so I convince myself that I'm not transgender.

I wouldn't have the support of my family, and I don't have the confidence to go out as ""Molly"", start HRT or wear women's clothes.

I've seen myself in the mirror, and I just see some incredibly skinny disgusting guy.

-------

I'm also bisexual, and I've dealt with a lot of homophobia in my past. I don't believe I've instigated any, thankfully, but a lot that is making me feel awful about it.

I wasn't aware until I was 16, but I had a lot of people insinuate that I was gay (because I was very feminine), and my parents would tell me ""I think you're gay"" and ""I wouldn't want a gay son"". I don't think a bisexual transgender daughter is the sort of person they can deal with.

I'm so uncomfortable with my gender and sexuality that I can't picture myself being in a sexual relationship with anyone, with my personality being so dogshit that I won't be able to get into a relationship anyway.

-------

I ruined my personality when I was younger. I was happy and feminine, then I had to hide that side of myself, because men aren't supposed to be feminine. 

Hiding my feminine side made me slightly depressed, and I felt like shit constantly, also leading to me disconnecting from my emotions and trying to disconnect from the people around me. 

The transphobia also made me a complete piece of shit, and I argued back against my family's homophobia and transphobia when I finally decided that I had a duty to (later realising that I was bisexual and possibly trans), but I feel like people might think I changed *because* I realised these things.

---------

I have had friends, but I lost most of them when I went to college at 16, because I deleted my FaceBook account. All of their attempts to reach out were ignored, because I felt like they were just doing it out of pity, not because they actually liked me. I then decided to disconnect from people at College (16), and have continued being disconnected from others to this day (18 turning 19).

I'm also a complete dumbass. I went to a grammar school, sure, but I was definitely one of the dumber people there. I wasn't good at tests, and I was mocked about it constantly, bullied by the vast majority of my year (for homophobic reasons mostly, but also because I am a dumbass).

--------

I can't get my mood swings in order, and my moods just jump into another. Example:

• I feel anxious about asking for help with work; I think everyone hates me; I think about how people have hated me in the past; then I think about how I deserve to have everyone hate me; and then I just want someone to kill me.

But my mood will swing every few hours, and I do sometimes feel happy, so I have convinced myself not to seek help over it (dumb, I know).

The happier I feel, the more sad/shameful I will feel later, and I'll feel worse for longer.

If I'm only slightly happy, then I'm less ashamed/sad, and less suicidal.

Trying to balance my mood is incredibly difficult when my brain won't even bother to work. 

I know how to do certain jobs at work, but these past few weeks in particular, have been awful. I can't think, and can't work, and then harass myself, and then follow the cycle that I mentioned above.

------

I'm also incredibly skinny, because I can't find it in myself to eat. I have a slice of toast in the morning, and small chocolate bar in the afternoon, and my dinner (which is usually a full plate, since my parents cook dinner for me, and I don't want to be rude to them).

------

I am seeing a therapist, finally, on Monday, but I feel like I need antidepressants to help sort myself out.

I can't keep going like this, but I can't see myself changing anytime soon, and I can't find it in myself to kill myself (I'd need someone else to do it for me).

I could just be being dramatic, and I feel aeful that people in my life have to deal with my shit.

If any of you have managed to read through **all of this**, thanks.

I know it's a lot, but I just needed to let it all out.",30Mar2019,1
7,"Lately I've been feeling increasingly sad for no reason. I cry uncontrolably nearly every day and I find it impossible to focus on my work. I've been feeling terrible about myself and every aspect of my life, even though nothing bad has happened. My previous experience with therapy hasn't been great. I think it's because every time I've gone in before, I've had trouble being honest about why I'm really there. I've felt worthless and unhappy for a really long time and have been experiencing pretty frequent suicidal ideation since I was a teenager, but whenever I'm in therapy I end up really minimizing all of it, I think partly out of the fear of being put in a psychiatric hospital. I mostly talk about the anxious thoughts and feelings which I also experience, so the conversations always tend to that and ways of coping with it, which feels to me like treating the symptom and not the cause. I've also never been prescribed meds either for anxiety nor depression.
I guess I'm writing this for two reasons. One, is how to find the courage to be honest with my new therapist, and the other one is to read some of you who've had possitive experiences with therapy and medication, since I'm feeling really hopeless right now and not really feeling like what I'm doing will change anything.
Thanks for reading, I hope you have a good day.",30Mar2019,2

16,"I posted this on another sub but I couldn’t crosspost. Im just looking for help.

Im 19 almost 20 and i feel like I’ve accomplishment nothing in life at all.

My story is the following. I was born in Mexico to a single mother and brought to the US when i was one year old. My mom got married to this man and every since I have memory this man has treated me terribly. I’ve been told that he treated me well I was a baby but I don’t remember any of it. I used to be beaten almost everyday by this man and its left scars in my mental state. He would beat me for the most absurd things. He beat me because i didn’t all my multiplications, he beat me because I couldn’t hold a chicken while he killed the poor thing, he beat me because I wasn’t strong enough to help him do some mechanic things. He would tell me that I was useless and worthless. This has left a pretty big scar. And the worst thing of all is that mom wouldn’t do anything and i didn’t know why. I thought everyone just hated me. 

I just want someone to tell me that they are proud of me. Im going to college, I have a job, I have a girlfriend that I love, Im paying my rent and bills but even though I do have all of this I still feel worthless and useless. I feel alone and unwanted, hated by everyone. This leaves me to sob alone in the night because I don’t know if even deserve living. This has lead to many attempt suicides.

I just want to know if Im truly worthless and useless. Am i truly hated? 

I just want to hear someone say they are proud of me...",30Mar2019,4
17,"Hi.

I've had depression from about the age of 9, I'm now 22 and it's gotten progressively worse as the years go by.

I'll cut a lot of the backstory out but I recently went through something very emotionally painful and struggled for a while to pull myself out of the worst of the pain. I came very close today but then my mother walked in and told me she was so miserable because of how 'unwanted' we were. During the difficulty I had not to long ago, she made it out as if it what happened was my fault and that I was lied to by someone who pretended to care for me. I absolutely do not believe either of those things are true but it stings so much. She regularly tells me that she would've killed herself if she had my life. Yes, my life is difficult, but she just reinforces beliefs I'm trying so hard to fight against and sends me back to square one.

It's financially impossible for me to move out, I have a toddler and I can't put my child into poverty when she's the only reason I'm not on the street.
I'm extremely isolated, I can't reach out to anyone because the only people I know have either made it clear that my problems are not theirs or they are too unstable to respond appropriately to what I tell them. She did this to me, she refused to send me to school in case I got hurt and I grew up with no friends, no sense of identity, no education, no way out.

Is there anything I can do? I know I'm stuck with her right now and I need to do the best thing. We're awaiting referral to family therapy but my mother has to organise it through her own care providers so god knows when that will happen. Does anyone recognise if she's displaying any symptoms of any particular personality disorder or is this just depression gone wild? She has depression, AAPD and CPTSD but I don't think these behaviours are associated with them. I just want to know what's wrong with all of this.

Thanks for reading!",30Mar2019,2

Theres one woman I loved from afar for a long time. But shes made it clear shes not interested, and i try to stay away, shes far away from me  anyway (not cuz of restraining order shes always been far away). But i cant help but message her. I go thru insane lengths and make alternate emails etc. ( i KNOW this is creepy. Please. I dont need to be told, I need help and advice not to do it).   Some days I feel suicidal about it. 

Ive tried to meet other girls online but it ends similarly. Even though none of them mean much to me, i get ignored or looked over and feel so angry. It feels so unfair. I like girls into fitness but im fat so i get it. But it hurts.

The only thing inwant is to stop this. I have no friends. U can see why.  I dont wanna hurt harass lr upset anyone. But some days ...the truth is i, 35 year old virgin. Never been kissed and am on the spectrum so meeting ppl is hard enough . Im so so lonely with romance terms. I never had what normal pppl had. I want to be normal but with autistic spectrum and mental illness i can never have that and it kills me.

I dont think id say im an incel because i dont hate women. But sometimes it does feel like women only really want buff or athletic guys,

And it seems like my old co-workers can't see why it might be hard for me to work around them or in that place.

I just want so much to pack up and leave this city because too many things just remind me of mistakes I've made and regrets I have about the past few years.
