“im still salty at you, you caused me to break up with my boyfriend”
“wait what?” 
“doesn’t the word reputation ring a bell?” she continued to tell me that it echnically did ruin the only relationship that she cared about and i might just be ove rreacting but i honestly feel like the worst person in the world, no sane person would be the cause of a broke-up relationship, right?

4,"I've searched for advice on this several times and it always seems to come down to ""stop thinking about it"" or ""distract yourself"". If I could do that, this wouldn't be a problem. 

Today, for example, I was working with someone at my job who was very helpful and I appreciated it. I was busy, but felt calm and not flustered or even anxious. This person caught me off guard when they pointedly asked me ""are you okay?"" like they thought I was about to breakdown. I said I'm fine and kept on working, but then the rumination kicks in . . 

Why did they ask that? Am I more anxious than I realize? Do I seem like a spaz who can't handle my workload? etc. 

 I try to think about the positive things that happened today, but then all afternoon and evening I keep coming back to it.

Any advice on how to actually stop overthinking?

Thanks",19Nov2019,1
5,"I’m 16/M. I was diagnosed with chronic depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder right around my birthday two years ago. Ever since then, I’ve been on numerous amounts of medication and I’ve been in and out of therapy ever since. I’m so tired of coming up with excuses of why I’m going to doctors appointments so much. I have a friend group that I feel distant from. I don’t really have a connection with any of them they kind of just call me when they need an extra man to play basketball. They are the only friends I have. I have so much trouble with girls. I have no female friends and I’ve lost numerous because of my depression. I’ve noticed trends that they stop talking to me when I open up. Things seem to just go terribly wrong when I open up. Due to this I have developed somewhat of a fear of opening up. I’m afraid, lonely, and most of all tired of it all. I’m tired of thinking and I’m tired of trying so hard to make new friends and keep the old ones I have. I’m open to any advice any of you have and would love to hear any stories you may have. Thank you.",19Nov2019,1

I really don’t know what to say I’m too exhausted and anxious to type anything. I just feel like shit and I keep treating everyone like shit. I recently broke up with my gf who I didn’t know if I actually loved or not but she became my best friend since we hung out all the time and now I have no one. I’m on tinder being a dirtbag trying to fuck everything I see and ask for nudes because I just don’t care anymore and want immediate satisfaction. I can’t really sleep. I’m sucking at work. I managed not to drink since Saturday when I threw up in my sleep and it scared me. I never do that. Idk what to do. Being a guy a don’t really have my friends to tell this too not because they don’t care it’s just I wouldn’t know what to say if they told me they felt this way. I just recently got my first place and it’s just lonely. I’m lonely. I’m lost. I’m scared. Idk what to do. I don’t even know if I want answers and I just wanted to get this all down.

9,"And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
The sun will return and you come back down!
The funny thing is all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends that I have, the music I made
The love that I feel, I just had to start again

The days are a death wish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless

The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless

Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Idle in the halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
I can fear death no longer
I've died a thousand times

A wasteful universe
And we don't know our soul was
Emptiness inside our heads
But no one dares to dwell

Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
You can tell me, what do you say?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?

Have you ever took a blade to your wrists
Have you've been skipping meals
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?",19Nov2019,1

I went in for an unrelated reason and the nurse asked me the ""depression questions"" (I think you know what I mean-the how often do you feel like___ kind) and that was that.

14,"Heads up, bit of a read - but really needing some advice, so i'd appreciate it so much for any help. Most of it's context, the last passage is brass tacks.
-------------
So after a number of years of on/off good and rough patches (panic attacks, empty-feeling days, standard) I'm trying to get myself to see a GP and possibly get a diagnosis, and some treatment. 

Having been with my partner, who is diagnosed BPD and MDD, a long time, I've seen my symptoms show as very similar to hers - I haven't done anything about it so far though because I'm relatively high-functioning, and usually my good days will come around just often enough that I get over that hump, and get distracted by being busy.

This past week however has been my longest stretch that I can remember having bad days. Exam time, uni assignments due, and I've struggled to leave bed, enjoy anything at all, even crack jokes, which I've been known to still do even on terrible days. As much as depressed me doesn't care about anything, I know I'll suffer for it when a good day comes around.

So with this, I'm looking to seek treatment. I'm quite cynical, and really hate the  introspective chats and D+M's that are the psych stereotypes, so I'm a bit worried what I'll come across. Any advice on what I should expect would really help.

P.S I'm in Australia if that helps specifics at all, but any advice is great.",19Nov2019,1

20,"I've been battling depression for nineteen years, and I'm just so tired and miserable.

I take my medication (even get it updated if it starts to fade), I've been going to a therapist, I'm going back to school, I have a wonderful dog, I have a supportive brother and mom, I have weekly game nights (D&amp;D) with a couple guys, I've even had TMS, been prescribed ketamine, I've cut out toxic relationships, I've stopped using Facebook, I stay away from movies and shows that encourage misery, and I've been trying to eat healthier. Most importantly though, I had stopped letting depression blind me with lies of a familiar comfort. I used to shut down suggestions because ""nothing works"", or ""no one understands"". I used enable my depression with fears that others would leave me or make my life harder if I started getting better. All it took (he said as if it was easy) was swallowing my pride and admitting that I was being too narrow minded.

For a long time, I was actually getting remarkably better. I'd never claim to be ""cured"", but I felt strongly in control of my depression. I felt like I could move forward.

Almost two weeks ago, I caught a cold and threw out my neck while coughing. Strangely enough, it was after I threw out my neck, and started getting painful headaches, that I seemed to entirely lose control of my depression.

I can't keep my thoughts away from so many negative things; deception, politics, prejudice, the cruelty of others, etc. Things I've been working on improving, suddenly seem impossible to overcome (my weight, my self-confidence, employment, companionship, etc.). I find myself unable to feel a passion for anything, nor a desire for anything. Yet, I strangely feel an overwhelming sensation of abandonment, hopelessness, and misery. Its as if I ""lost"" something without actually losing anything yet. However, being this way is putting my education at great risk. I can't get any work done and I've been missing too many days. 

To make a long story short, I need to get straight A's or I'm going to have some EXTREME difficulty going to college any time soon. This wouldn't be so bad if I could just get a job and fill my time that way, but I have an absolutely terrible time holding a job because I fall to pieces merely months in. I've never held a job for more than maybe a year because of my emotional instability (which I'm aware conflicts with my earlier statement of ""getting a hold of my depression"", but that's been a weak point since day one).

I feel like a terrible failure as I'm 30, still living with my mom, overweight, haven't had a close romantic relationship in thirteen years, failed miserably for most of my education, and obviously I'm an emotional deck of cards.

# TL;DR

Ultimately, now I just want to die using an exit bag. I don't want to die for the sake of dying. I think there are very few people who want to *just* die. Suicide just seems like an ironic safety net.

I don't want to keep suffering, and if there was a guaranteed way of ending my suffering that didn't involve self-harm, I'd take it. However, there are only potential solutions. Everything I've tried has been a potential solution, and though they've had great results, there was a lot of disappointment involved. I still encourage others to try everything I have, because overall they've helped so much! I still discourage suicide as a solution too, as it removes the potential of someone finding something that can vastly improve their life.

It's hypocritical of me to want to die. I know it is. I'm just in so much pain though. And I know I've got people who would miss me, but I'm just too exhausted. I can't take any more disappointment. I don't want to keep fighting. I'm proud to say I've fought long and hard too!

I don't want to keep fighting, but I will try. I honestly will try as best as I can. At this point though, I find it hard to imagine that I will die any other way than suicide.

Much like how I don't think many people die for the sake of dying, I can't just *live* for the sake of living.",19Nov2019,1

She said they do and told me to make an appointment after they were done. She asked a few more questions, like if I'm feeling depressed now or if I'm having suicidal thoughts. Since this is my first time ever opening up in the last 8 years that I've been struggling on my own, I almost broke down trying to answer her simple ""yes"" or ""no"" questions.

34,"I'm tagging this NSFW due to suicide talk, just in case, although I am not actively suicidal.. more like passively..

This might be a bit of a jumbled mess, but hey, so is my brain right now.. Fitting!

So.. I'm in a really bad place in my life, which is saying something because my entire life has pretty much been a complete shitshow.. I'm in my mid-30s, in case that is relevant.

I wont go into detail too much about my past, unless someone thinks that's relevant or something, but suffice it to say that literally every plan I've had to set myself up for success (all of them fairly solid, really) has done the opposite, and my entire life has been upended multiple times as a result..   


My current situation is... well I'm unemployed, and have been for some time because my degree is basically worthless in this area (I am not presently able to move). I looked for decent employment (see also: pays my bills) for about a year after graduation, plus the full year before, while I was still anticipating a degree, before throwing in the towel and deciding to go back for a master's degree.. I still have some of my GI bill left, so it isn't costing me anything, but I'm in way over my head on it, and I desperately want to drop out. If I do, though, I'm still basically unemployable... So lose-lose. My partner thinks I should keep going because ""you are strong and you are smart, and you can do this, even if it takes you a long time. I know you are putting yourself through this so that you can get a good job, and we can be happy down the line, so I think you should still do it for yourself, if you can, and I'll be supportive."" (paraphrased, ofc)  


My depression and anxiety have gotten me to the point of complete inability to do even basic shit, though, like homework (because I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, and that stresses me out to the point that I can't even start it..) or showering, ffs. It's all just too much effort, and frankly I don't seem to get anything positive out of anything I do, so why bother?

I don't even really have anyone to talk to about it, or just to talk to in general.. Because I'm unemployed and moved -a lot- in my life (7 times in as many years from grade 5-12, plus moving every 2 years on average the rest of my life for various reasons), I don't know anyone in the area other than my partner's friends who I don't even know that well..  I have one friend who lives 3 hours away that I talk to regularly, and that's it other than my partner (despite my now-declining efforts to keep other old friends in contact with me), and while she is a wonderful and supportive person, she also has her own shit going on and I don't want to constantly unload on her..  


So I don't talk to anyone about it until it boils over.. because there just isn't anyone.. I tried getting mental health support through the VA, but every time I end up with someone who wants me to fix something... and honestly, the only thing that actually CAN fix my problems... well it isn't mindfulness, it isn't introspection (I do quite a lot of that already)... it's a f-ing decent job so I don't feel worthless and desperate.. I just want someone to talk to regularly, but they don't do that, you have to be actively trying to fix something.. and that isn't really helpful for where I am right now... especially since, at this point, I have basically zero desire to work on anything about how I -feel- about the situation.. I'm not going to try to feel better about the shit I'm dealing with just so I can be pretend-happy... I want to fix the situation itself... The really sad part is that I've had this level of depression and anxiety for so long that... the last counselor I talked to said that my responses to the standard VA questionnaire were shocking, because I show literally none of how I feel.. I'm fairly upbeat and ""go-with-the-flow"" superficially, but make some really dark jokes for coping.. I'm so used to feeling like this that I just ignore it.. and keep on keepin' on.. That's probably not healthy.  


I've gotten to the point where I can't even eat, though... I have to force myself to eat one meal a day, and even that is a massive struggle.. I'm approaching the bottom of the ""ideal weight range"" for my height and sex, and it's alarming to say the least... I've changed out the things I eat for high-calorie versions (half and half in my coffee instead of 2%, butter on f-ing everything, etc.) but it's still a struggle because I don't have any desire to eat at all.. Nothing is appealing, and when I try to eat I get nauseated. Even my morning coffee is becoming a struggle to consume, and I actively look forward to that..  


I've been having constant emotional breakdowns (like once a week minimum) and I know it's putting a major strain on my relationship, because my partner then has to step up and support me.. which I know full well is unfair of me to do - emotional support is super draining, and my partner has a lot of other shit going on in life, too... It's worse, though, because I low-key resent my partner's success in life, since it didn't require very much effort to accomplish, it just all sort of fell into place (my partner now readily admits to not really being able to relate to my situation as a result, but it has taken a lot of difficult conversation to get to that point). It's frustrating to struggle so much and be comforted by someone who didn't have to struggle much at all.  


Needless to say, my partner is worried about me, my friend is worried about me, my step-dad is worried about me (my mom died when I was 21, my dad wasn't in the picture, and I was never in contact with any of my extended family, so that's really it..) and even I'm superficially worried about me.. really, I just keep wondering why I even keep trying... I don't have anything going for me, so why bother?  


At this point, I'm basically out of ideas.. I want things to finally change.. I want to find a silver lining to my miserable existence.. I keep going through the motions trying to make things better or at least more tolerable, but nothing changes.. I honestly don't want to do this being alive thing anymore.. I don't want to kill myself, mind (that sounds like a lot of effort, and.. meh), but I wouldn't really be opposed to dying by not my own hand..",19Nov2019,2
35,"Hi everyone,

My GF has depression but she manages it quite well where it's not noticeable to the public eye (colleagues and friends) but I know when she gets these swings.

However sometimes whenever she gets these thoughts or notices something that will trigger her that will all of a sudden put her in a  state where she starts questioning things such as myself and her happiness.

When this happens a few things I notice right away:

\-She starts replying with basic answers or one-word answers and not enthusiastic e.g sure, ok, etc..

\-She doesn't reciprocate questions back to me e.g how about your self, good and you, etc...

\-Doesn't send me Snapchat, tag me in memes or posts on Facebook and or IG or even responds to things I tag her

Overall she acts very cold to me. I understand that whatever she is dealing with she generally needs 1-2 days by herself to mull it over before he can talk to me again. I let her know during the time she needs alone that I will not pry and ask her about it but check in with her every few hours to see if she is ok or ready to chat. Once she is ready to talk again she would message me that she is ok.

My question is how should I approach her after what she dealt with or got over? Should I always keep telling her something like ""If you are ready to talk to me about it I'm here for you and ready to listen"" or do I not bring it up at all and let her approach me about it?",19Nov2019,2
36,"So, my life kind of sucks right now. I have a plan for what I can do to get myself out of this rut, but I still feel anxious and doubtful and just generally awful. I can't find it in myself to be positive or optimistic. I'm just about to graduate with a (useless) liberal arts degree. I have one more class to finish and I'm failing it because it's extremely hard and there's so much fucking work. I have to work full-time to support myself because I live in a major city and it is so so so expensive. I work in administration and my boss is literally the devil. On top of this, I'm dealing with a skin condition that's going to take a while to treat and heal, so you could say I'm broke, ugly and tired! How did I end up here? Why? I feel like if there is a God, he/she/it hates me. I feel like I'm a background character in a movie, especially when I compare myself to my partner. His career path has been so straightforward and enjoyable for him, he's so attractive and happy etc. etc. I feel like he's the main character in a movie and I'm just the supporting character. I know what I have to do to fix this, for example I have to keep on treating my skin condition and wait for it to heal. I have to create a portfolio so I can get a better job, etc. Regardless I still don’t feel okay. I lock myself in the bathroom at work every single day and cry my eyes out. I’m starting to feel physically ill from how upset I am about this, I don’t know what to do.",19Nov2019,2
37,"I've dealt with depression for several years now, but lately things have just been getting worse. I had a friendship breakup a little over a week ago, and things have been rocky for months between me and my best friend. I used to go to them for everything, and now I feel like I have no outlet for the random, stupid shit I like to talk about or the stressful bits of my day. When I try to talk with other close friends like I did with this friend, none of it feels right and so I feel stifled and alone. I'm reaching a point where I want to cry and just get in bed constantly, which I haven't felt in years. I don't know what to do. I'm not even sure if posting here will be much help, but I'm just kind of stuck otherwise.",19Nov2019,4
38,About a month ago the most important person on my life left me for someone else. I will be the first to admit it was a codependent relationship. We were together for around 3 years and i would have done anything for them and i only ever planned on spending my life with them. Now that that's no longer a possibly. Im lost and cant bring myself to do anything outside of just my day to day or being asked to do things. I just don't have any drive to do anything anymore i just don't care anymore.,19Nov2019,1
39,"I thought maybe having a regularly scheduled workout class would help me exercise more frequently. I paid $185 to sign up for kung fu, since I used to enjoy martial arts. I went to two classes and liked it, but I'm out of shape and the class was hard.

This past weekend I got sick, and missed my Saturday class. I thought I'd go after work today, but I'm so tired. Now I feel guilty about not going and anxious that the teacher is disappointed in me, and it's getting harder and harder to convince myself to go again. But, now I also feel guilty about considering not going since I spent so much money on it. 

How do I get over my feelings of guilt and inadequacy and just enjoy what used to be a favorite hobby of mine?",19Nov2019,1
40,"Relapsing

I’ve been suffering with depression for the last 5 years now but I started to get better. In may, I got sent to a psychiatrist who put me on medication (fluoxetine/Prozac) and also put me into CBT therapy and over time I started to feel a bit better. I had less anxiety attacks, I self harmed a lot less than I used to and I became less suicidal. I was even able to talk to my friends about how I was feeling and they were so accepting! By August, I had stopped self harming and had only got 2 scars on my arms.

However, at the end of September, things started to go downhill. I self harmed again (only once luckily but it was quite deep) and I became much more isolated. I began to struggle to eat and I lost a stone on the month of October. I’ve had massive mood swings of going from happy to desolate or had large periods of emptiness. I felt tired all the time and struggled to do simple tasks like getting up in the morning or revising for exams. My nihilistic attitude has come back in full swing to the point where I don’t even look when I cross the road. I just don’t care anymore.

I’m in one of my pits of emptiness and all I want to do right now is cut myself in order to feel something, even if it is disappointment. I don’t want to eat anything as I feel disgusted in myself and I feel like I don’t deserve to. I just want to stop existing and kill myself. 

But I don’t want to disappoint anyone.

Please can someone help :/",19Nov2019,1
42,"TW: Weight talk
....
....

So I went to the doctor today and they weighed me. I've gained weight despite counting calories and doing my best to eat smaller portions/better. My blood work, blood pressure, etc all have me at healthy levels. My doctor informed me that my depression medication can cause weight gain.
So I am left with the following choice: go with unregulated depression/switch to a new medication that might not work (I've tried 6 meds this one is the one that works) so I can lose weight
Or
Stay on my meds and have a harder time losing weight. 

Obviously the correct choice is to stay on them and just exercise and eat right to try harder and lose weight. But this is so hard as someone who has had an ED and has body image issues. I feel so frustrated and sad. I know the right choice to make but I just want to feel good in my own skin...",19Nov2019,1
43,"I’m normally quite a private person on the socials even the Wild West of the internet like reddit due to its status of being kinda tame 4chan so posting and asking for help is really tricky and I’d appreciate support. 

SOME CONTEXT DIRECTLY BELOW THIS LINE 

I’m in my teenage years the latter end and right now I am going through an extended period of depression which I can’t seem to feel an end to at least soon, my family has a prominent history of depression and generally bad mental health massively on my mothers side with several people who have taken their lives and a large parts of that family having what I can see as undiagnosed Autism as well as clinically diagnosed depression as well as many other stronger disorders such as bi polar etc u can guess running rampant my Ma’s side of the family so from a purely biological standpoint I’m more predisposed to have to deal with things like depression and general mood swings. I have a really bad history of abuse my father being horrible physically and mentally throughout my life and still today but don’t get me wrong I still have a lot a lot of good in my life , I have a passion for photography a lusting for knowledge and to learn with aspersions to go into research/ be a teacher as well as other things, I love writing , I just love nature and being outside and with people I love and care about such as my current girlfriend who is endlessly kind and great to me despite my many freak outs which are often due to my mental predisposition 

More of a rant this first bit but for anyone answering it’s helpful to context I guess 
———————————————————————

Very often due to things like stress etc I get very sudden and random mood swings or more specifically energy bursts of just absolute joy and happiness which can last for a while that can but not always turn into feelings of chronic emptiness, there is an inbetween ofc but that’s more me feeling really really grumpy and it’s easy to go from grumpy to sad/“depressed” very easily and one thing I’m asking here if anyone has any advice on pulling urself away from feelings of grumpy ness and anger when you can feel them latching on and allow yourself to feel as if you can let go. 

Also due to everything aforementioned on the top it can be said without a doupt that I’m constantly stressed and I don’t really know a life without it, the only times I feel
Kinda free and not stressed is when I see my girlfriend and somtimes see freinds ,but that stress can turn into a social anxiety , when I do photography, when I draw, or when I read and I have time for all of these things but I often find them so hard to do due to stress which causes grumpy ness which can cause more stress causing self hatred and damaging people around me as well as my mental enjoyment of these things. 

What I’m trying to say is I’m stressed out falling by the seems I love life I love my friends and I love my girlfriend and I love nature and deep down I know I love myself but I find it hard to enjoy life and everything due to stress and I’m just asking for techniques or ideas or just conversation about how to deal/cope healthy and stop myself getting into such a foul mood in the things I enjoy because I feel bad after which only contributes to the obvious cycle I’ve badly described.

Thanks for anyone that helps - M

Hello and thank you so much to anyone who is taking the time to read this.

So I'm a person who has a very hard time making long stories short but I'll try and keep my back story brief. I am a 20 year old who has been struggling with mental health issues for around 7 years now. The majority of that time my issues went undiagnosed until they finally reached a peak my senior year of high school and I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety (general and social). I began taking a lot of medications as well, which occasionally have seemed to help. I had convinced myself in the light of my mental health issues reaching a peak my senior year that I may not even be able to graduate, but luckily the faculty at my high school and parents were very supportive and I did end up graduating in the top ten of my class. 

Then came time to applying to university, which I had put off for a long time as it was really difficult to look ahead that far when I was struggling with the day to day. Fortunately, I got accepted into a quality university that I had really wanted to get into and by the next academic year I had my bags packed and was ready to go. Or at least I thought. To make a long story short inside of a long story short, my mental health took a drastic turn for the worse after the first couple weeks in University. I could barely eat or sleep, by the end of the term (which I did force myself to see through) I had dropped a class, and I was often too paralyzed to do my assignments outside of class.

 The counseling department in my university was an absolute joke, so I found myself often visiting the chaplain at my university who was an immensely supportive woman who by the end of the term suggested I should look into maybe not coming back next term if it would he best for me. So I made the decision to return home and attend a local community college and get some credits under my belt, as I had attributed the turn for the worse in my mental health to just my body and mind reacting to such a new environment and thought being home would make things better. 

And for a while it did seem to get better, but about a month and a half into my first term at the community college things got worse again perhaps even to a point that they could have been considered worse than when I was away at college. Once again I forced myself to see the term through and came out with one failed class but luckily good grades in all my other classes. By the time the term was over I had made the decision to leave university entirely. I had been working a part time job while I was at school so I simply asked for a full time schedule and for a while I felt pretty lost. It was immensely difficult answering the question ""How'd your first year of school go?"" and even more difficult explaining to people that I wasnt going back next term and that I didnt really have a plan besides working at McDonalds and living with my parents, you know, what every high school graduate dreams of doing a year later.

This is already gone on long enough so I'll fast forward to present day. Ive been out of school for three semesters now with my mental health ebbing and flowing the whole time. Ive spent the whole time either working or traveling (at the time of writing this Ive spent a total of five months backpacking Latin America, would highly recommend!) and pursuing hobbies. Ive spent a lot of time as well researching possible routes I could go down career-wise that dont involve university, but honestly I really do want to go back. I know a lot of university students often find themselves stuck there because of pressure from their parents or general society who often tell them that university is just always the best path after school, but I can authentically say after looking at the options it is what I want to pursue. The problems are:

 1. I will have to reapply if I want to return to university. If I recall from my senior year of high school this is a God awful and bureaucratic process that often involves fluffing up and polishing flowery cover letters and essays rather than just assessing a student based on their merits alone. Im honestly terrified of having to dive back into that, especially considering I'll likely have to present to admissions officers my college transcripts from those two terms I attended, which arent super pretty considering I failed a class and dropped one, and have to explain to them why Ive been out of school for almost two years now, and I have a feeling they wont like ""So could work at McDonalds and travel"".

and 2. I'm terrified if I go back to school it will just be the same story that it was the first time. I'll just become absolutely paralyzed and find myself dropping out again because I cant handle it. Just hearing my friends from high school talk about where they are now with scholarship applications, exams, term papers, extra-curriculars, it all makes my head spin just imagining being back in that.

Thank you to whoever took the time to read all that. So my question is, does anyone have any similar experiences regarding coping with mental health issues while at school or even returning to school after a mental health break? If you do, sharing your experiences and offering any advice would be fantastic! Even if someone is reading this with no similar experiences, any advice or insight you could offer would be great.

I realize that if college is not a feasible idea for me because of my mental health issues maybe I should look into something else, but I just cant stand the idea of looking back 30 years from now and kicking myself for not having pursued something I knew I wanted just because of my depression. The academics arent neccasarily the problem, I love learning and did well in high school, I just need to learn how to cope with my issues. Thank you all again so much for your time!",19Nov2019,2
45,"Lately I feel like I'm not myself. I've gained a lot of weight and my body no longer looks like me. I'm sad all the time and irritated and grumpy which is not me. I have anxiety that's only getting worse. I'm starting to lose interest in daily life. I have dealt with depression for some time now, and this is just another of many episodes. I need some encouragement and help to figure out how to fix or manage what's going on with me. Whatever I'm doing does not seem to be enough. Thanks.",19Nov2019,1
