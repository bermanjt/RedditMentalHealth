I've seen videos of one guy having sex with 40 women and young hot girls fucking old dudes. Sexually I am starved and emotionally I hate people and seem unable.

5,"I think that I've finally come to realize that I'll never be truly happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be perfectly clear, I remember the first years of my life to be invigorating and full of life. I don't seem to remember this darkness to have settled in until later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I' have been a  highly motivated individual the majority of my young adult life. However, I never felt as if I fit in. I had friends growing up, sure, but I quickly pushed many of them away after highs school. I couldn't bear the idea that those relationships would some day dissolve, so I suppose I prematurely ended them.

&amp;#x200B;

In my college years, I hid in the books as a way to shut out this world. Math, science, you name it, I was the top in all of my courses. It drove me to be successful. I suppose that success replaced the empty feeling which always occupied me. However, nothing seemed to satisfy the craving for happiness I so desired. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as that which keeps me going; pills have served an almost essential part of my functioning, otherwise I don't know how I would have made it this far. I have been on SSRI's the majority of my young adult life. However, the thing about medications is that they don't make you happy, they make you forget the sense of longing for meaning. Essentially I have dulled my senses enough to make it to 30.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose that the toughest challenge I presented myself was both a longing for connection, but also a fear of rejection. Probably just like you, I've never felt like anyone else. Although others have told me that I am liked and respected, I can't seem to find such feelings for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have managed to make it through college and medical school and am now a resident in Neurology. However, in spite of all my perceived successes, I still feel as an empty vessel. Others tell me to become more confident. I can't seem to believe this in myself as confidence seems to me to be another guise for being overly self assured. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I love the science of medicine, but I cannot stand to be around others half the time at work. Most others I have surrounded myself with have overly self assured opinions of their capabilities. However, my self doubts prevent me from feeling this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I was publicly humiliated for a medical choice I made during my overnight call, making a patient SAC status, instead of sending them to the ICU. A professor asked everyone in the room, composed of students, residents and faculty to raise their hands if they would have made the same choice as me. No one did...

&amp;#x200B;

 I just can't seem to do it anymore. I just was a sense of purpose. I want to feel like I belong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't recall the number of times I have stayed awake, staring at the ceiling, wishing for this life to come to an end. However, there are too many people I love far too much to ever leave behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've often felt music flow through my mind, it seems the only way to make sense of this existence. The only way to feel something at all. My secret dream would be to throw it all away for a life of art and self expression. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else struggled with such questions of purpose, and found that the lack of an answer was just as deeply troubling? I just keep telling myself that I need to hold on. Surely there must be something out there for me.",12Feb2019,1

14,"First of all, thank u for reading and second, please help if it’s possible 

I’ve posted for the first time recently before on r/depression, but I think that was more like a rant and I also think that you get more replies on this subreddit so I’m typing another post.

It’s exactly as my title says. I’ve met my psychologist (who I think is pretty good. Only my second psychologist I’ve met tho) and what my last few sessions with her had been her trying to get me to take my meds. One of her reasonings have been “It’s like fixing a broken leg instead of keep on walking on a bad leg. It might be hard at first but it makes your life so much better.” 

Which makes sense. I logically get it. But I’m scared. I’m scared of getting better. 

Already, I’ve forgotten the horrible things my parents have said to me and how they made me feel and made me develop depression so that I can continue to function and bare living with my parents. (*I tried to explain these things at the bottom of the post)

&gt;What if I get better and my parents say “What? We did those bad things to u? But look at you, ur doing fine!”

&gt;I feel like feeling terrible gives me a right to mad at my parents and I don’t want to lose it.

&gt;I feel like feeling terrible also gives me a right to have pity/empathy from others because I can’t rlly get much of that. And getting empathy makes me feel like I’m ok for being mad and sad and I’m not being crazy and that I don’t have a problem for the way I am.


These kinds of thoughts make me not sure/not want to get better

Have other ppl felt this way? I can’t find articles saying that things I am. Please help






*
My psychologist is leaning on the side of biological, but I can only think of it being situational and mayyyybe being born with being slightly more prone to depression. My parents have answered psychologists multiple times that I don’t have any relatives with depression, and before this manifested, I still procrastinated and forgot/lost a lot of things and had my mom say the usual “ur dumb, lazy, stupid.” But never had days when I had a dip in emotion. I even sometimes thought that I was smart. So I can only think that my depression has manifested from the cultural ways of my parents where they are nice good people, but my mom says a lot of “ur dumb, lazy. Why r u so stupid?!” in her anger (bc I’ve always procrastinated and lost/forgot) and rarely says anything positive about me &amp; my dad used to tutor me for math for a long time but raised his voice at me when he got annoyed/slapped the table w/hand or pen and once hit my back pretty hard in elementary school or middle school bc I kept on forgetting to write the negative sign.

I even hug my parents nowadays because when I want human contact that’s the best I’ll get. I have friends but they all like staying at home and don’t rlly chill together and we’re busy (taking a lot of AP classes although we’re seniors). We meet up and it’s fun but it’s all ways for events like a birthday or thanksgiving and we’re busy with activities the whole day and ppl talking, yelling, not rlly calm.

They also don’t give me empathy bc they’re like “positive vibes only!” “We know you can do it!” bc they care but don’t rlly understand that it makes it worse. I can try talking o them but I’m so tired at this point. I kinda wanna keep to myself (typical depression description) and just disappear.",12Feb2019,1
15,"I'm 44, I suffer of social anxiety, depression and codependency. For the longest time I've used music as a way to feel my emotions and I've always had a predisposition to addictive/obsessive behaviour. 

So today I'm exploring the possibility that I might actually have a codependent relationship with music, in the same way that one would be codependent on a person.

As we know, often due to childhood trauma, we are taught to divorce ourselves from our true feelings and that we are only allowed to feel what we are told to feel… or we suppress or greatly modify our feelings to stay on the safe side of our abuser. Coming into adulthood we develop a litany of dysfunctional relationships as we feel and act the way we think others want us to feel and act so that we get a sense of fitting in to our social environment and thereby gain a sense of safety.

In an effort to not lose touch with our true emotions, some of us maintain our favorite music playlists… songs that express our true feelings, or feelings that we aspire to. If we have an obsessive personality, we may then start to listen to music for many hours on end as a kind of escape into our feelings and emotions, or feelings and emotions we want to feel. The problem is, is that this can become a form of rumination… where we go over and over the same thought, feeling or emotion without achieving any resolution or closure.

By extension, at times we get obsessed with a particular music artist because we identify with the emotion portrayed in their music… on a codependent level, it becomes easy to let the artists feelings become our feelings… thereby blurring the line between our true feelings and our codependent feelings with the artist whose music resonates with us.

On a visceral level we even form an emotional connection or bond with our music in much the same way as any addict forms an emotional bond to alcohol or tobacco… with the added layer of a codependency emotional connection.

Our music can also become our escape from the emotional pain we experience in the world and it can become the protective bubble that we live in.

Without realizing it, while obsessed with our music addiction, we may convince ourselves that we are in touch with our true feelings, when in fact we are only mirroring the emotions in the music that we have become codependent on.

This is a new thought for me personally… what is my true self, my true feelings apart from the music I listen to? If I wanted to get in touch with my feeling of sadness, should I try listening to one sad song once, and then have silence to sit with my true feelings? If I identify with the feeling in a desperate or jaded song, should I listen to it only once and then practice silence to sit with my true feelings? 

The problem is that many of us are divorced from our true feelings and emotions, and sensing or feeling the emotions of others in their music is an easy thing for the codependent person to do… but a question worth asking if you are a codependent person is this: “Are the feelings that I feel while listening to music my TRUE feelings, or are they the feelings of the music that I have developed a codependent relationship with.” Only sitting in silence, with true introspection can answer that question.",12Feb2019,1
16,"It's around midnight where I live, and here I am composing a post for the r/depression_help subreddit, so you already know how my day's been going. I just feel disgusted with myself. I'll give you a little bit about my background. 

I'm nineteen years old. I grew up in an abusive household. My father hasn't been in my life since I was five. I dropped out of college twice in quick succession due to severe anxiety. I've resigned from four jobs in the past year due to my anxiety and depression. I don't have any friends. I'm experiencing intense questions surrounding my gender identity and sexuality. I'm suffering from acid reflex with no known cause. 

I feel like a failure. I know I need to ""pull myself up by my bootstraps"", but sometimes I feel like I'd be better off dead. The government wouldn't have to pay for my healthcare. My family wouldn't have to help me financially. Nobody would have to look at my depressing face. It would be paradise without a worthless cretin like me taking up space. What have I ever done to make the world a better place? Nothing! Sometimes I wonder if I should just run off and join the peace corp, or convert to a religion or something. You know, do something drastic, because why not? ",12Feb2019,1

I just wish I could stop existing or that killing myself wouldn’t hurt the people I love. These thoughts pop into my head randomly all day, every day. 
I attempted suicide when I was 18 and that was five years ago. I hadn’t realized I was suffering with depression until after that event and ever since then I’ve been painfully aware of my unhappiness. It’s impossible to even hypothesize what my own future will be like because I can’t see myself there.
Maybe today isn’t the day I end it but I do feel that that is likely how I will go, eventually. 
My dad has severe depression himself and on his side of the family. I feel some type of way that my parents never did anything to check whether I was suffering and to this day, neither of them go out of their way to contact me. My dad is a nurse and he’s complained to me about the people who come in who’ve attempted suicide, saying they’re just drunk, like I was, and like he knew I was. 
I’m just at a loss of what to do and how to heal.

I wish I was able to not cry when my routine was interrupted. I wish I could read body language. I wish I was better at speaking. I wish my memory was good so I wouldn't forget to do things. I wish I'd stop talking about my interests that no one else cares about. I wish I was smart. I wish I wouldn't blow up at people when I'm scared. I wish I wasn't so ugly. I wish I was healthy so nobody would have to take me to the doctor all the time. I wish I could see when my behavior wasn't okay. I wish I didn't break down so much even though I'm an adult. I wish I would shut up about things that hurt me and just take it smiling like everyone else. I wish I wasn't such a burden. I wish I wasn't me.

20,"I’m actually surprised I didn’t see this posted when I searched the sub, but there is an *amazing* podcast called “The Hilarious World of Depression”, hosted by John Moe. 

It’s a bunch of long-form interviews of really interesting people (a large portion of whom happen to be comedians) on how they struggle with, manage, and laugh at, their depression/anxiety/OCD. They explore their depression origins, treatments, failures, and successes. 

It’s authentic, raw, and lets me understand that I’m far from alone in this. I love listening when I’m alone in my car. It’s like having good friends in the car with me, talking about the good, the bad, and the ugly side of depression (and the funny).

I’m so glad I found this gem of a podcast, and hope that this post helps at least one person discover it as well.

One of my favorite episodes is the jukebox episode where listeners call in and explain their favorite song to help cope with their depression. The song plays in the back ground as the listener speaks about its meaning and effect on them. I use it to run to quite often.

I’ll post a couple of links. I listen on Spotify but I know it’s on Apple podcasts and all the others as well.

Happy listening!

I'm 25 and am working with kids with Autism as a behavioral therapist. Some days, I don't want to to go the the same, boring job and end up faking and calling in sick. Is it better to push myself through it, and teach myself discipline, or give into my depression and take the day off to do things that will make me happy (eat, gym, cook, read)? My employers are concerned with my absenses, and I'm scared to have that conversation with the. I've never held a job down for over 1 yr.

23,"(background: i have diagnosed depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. i take lexapro for this and find that it helps me most of the time.) 

let me just start by saying that i've had this sensation since long before i knew that i had depression. it takes me a looooong time to fall asleep on any given night, so i'd be a kid at a sleepover and as soon as i realized that i was the last person awake, i'd be hit with a feeling like dread in my stomach, bad enough to make me feel sick. i would also get this feeling almost every night from age 10-14, because i just dreaded the feeling of laying awake in bed, unable to sleep and just feeling so alone. i used to get up EVERY SINGLE NIGHT and go complain to my mom that i couldn't fall asleep and she'd pretty much always be like, 'well, all you can do is close your eyes and try.' 

now as an adult (20f) and living with my partner (22m), i sometimes still get this horrific sinking feeling of dread as soon as he falls asleep and i'm left awake. i don't understand why this happens. he sometimes works third shift or falls asleep on the couch playing games, so i sleep alone in bed all the time and feel just fine. it's only when he's here and asleep in our bed and i'm laying awake next to him at 3am unable to sleep that i start to feel so sick. 

idk. i guess it makes me feel a little better just to type that out. i'd really appreciate knowing if anybody else experiences a feeling like this. ",12Feb2019,1
24,"(I'm sorry if this is too long) 

um hello. This is my first post and I am feeling slightly intimidated so please bare with me... I always seem to struggle with physically writing about how I feel. While I was contemplating about writing this post, my feelings were very clear. But now, I just can't seem to spit it out. 

Anyways, I am 16 years old. I am writing this at 10:23pm, with millions of thoughts running through my head. I... I'm lost. Everyday I feel like i'm just floating. drowning. and struggling to grasp onto something that's out of my reach. My main problem is that i'm insecure. I hate myself, i truly do. I hate how I look - I'm ugly, I hate how I act, I hate the way I talk, I hate my weight, I hate everything about myself. And its because of this that I feel alone and depressed. I've always felt alone. I've never had anyone who cared or understood enough to talk to about my personal problems. Because of my insecurities, I always stay at home. I'm not sure if this is the depression part of me, but I struggle to persuade myself to go out. (for example, today I didn't go to school. I complained that I was too exhausted to go and I mean it's true, but I just needed a break.) Even if it's with family, friends or just for myself. and this just makes me feel even more lonely. I'm lonely but I have wonderful friends. I'm lonely and I have the greatest family I could ever ask for. and, I just don't understand why 

I struggle with depression, anxiety and stress (obviously or else I wouldn't be here). I get these small moments of joy and happiness but I feel my depression is always there. as soon as this burst of happiness, or freedom should I call it, is over, I suddenly fall back into my depressed state. I don't know what that means so if any of you guys can help, that'll be much appreciated. This is only one of many nights where I struggle to sleep, listen to somewhat comforting music, write in my diary about how I feel and cry for countless hours. I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop. 

I feel like i sound very ungrateful throughout this post. I sound selfish for continuously wanting more than I already have. I mean, I am more than privileged to have a loving family, a wonderful home, have an education, and all that good stuff. And I truly am grateful for it. As I should be because there are others that deal with worse situations. It is these things that make life worth living. I really hate my situation (regarding my mental health) because nothing unfortunate has happened to me. To others, I probably have a perfect life, yet I think? I'm taking it all for granted. I don't want to feel this way.

I also struggle with talking to others. All these emotions that I have just shared on this forum, have been bottled up in my mind for the past 4-5 years. It's just so hard pouring my heart and soul out to someone about things i'm going through when they won't listen or care. But most importantly, I don't want to receive pity from those I talk to. Everyone always seems to pity me and belittle me for being soft or seemingly depressed. It just sucks. However, writing this forum is very monumental for me. I'm proud of myself for seeking advice and not keeping my emotions bottled up. Even if this isn't the best way, it is a nice small step. but I'm trying.

It is now 11:41pm as I post this. It took me a while and I still feel like I have so much more to say. and I feel like I specified / wrote too much while also not specifying enough / writing too little. But I don't want to bother whoever reads this with more than what I've already written. so, 

Please help me. I'm trying my best. ",12Feb2019,1

27,"Okay let's start from the beginning of all this mess. On Oct 27th 2018 my girlfriend of 3.5 years and bestfriend of 6 decided to leave me. I dont really have an answer to why but she honestly changed as a person and she didnt enjoy our relationship. My only thought was that she wanted to be with other people. I'm not blaming her because honestly she was the best thing that happened to me and she is a wonderful person. 

This breakup catalysed my mental health and has eaten it's way through my life like a parasite. I went to the doctors a few weeks after and they diagnosed me with depression as well as social anxiety. They gave me some medication as well as a therapist program to follow up on and i have been going to councilling sessions at my uni and they dont help. This honestly terrifies me because I dont want to have this weight over my decisions in life and feeling lost in this huge void of just self destruction where I cannot win because I have no idea what the problem is. Ever since I've not been eating properly, I've not been washing myself as regularly im not enjoying any of the work I do anymore (which is a MASSIVE problem). I want to live and be happy and be myself again. I want to work for something and have a passion but all that's in my head is... her.

Sometimes I burst out crying because I get a glimpse of a memory I once had or the coldness of how she spoke to me when she told me she wanted an end to the relationship. I just cant. I hate myself I regret everything I wish I was someone else. I cant get myself to do the next thing i need to do because there is nothing anymore. My whole reason to being at uni has just dissolved into searching for something to look forward to. My natural treatments for this are games and sleep just anything to get my head to focus on something else, ignore the problem and it will slowly disappear.

My Uni work is feeling the blow though. Ive missed on a very important assignment to hand in and another that has hardly been done and even now I cant get myself to do the work that needs to be done. I hate it. My ex girlfriend tried to keep into contact with me she said she wanted to be my friend but she didnt feel like one. She spoke to me every 3 weeks presumably whenever shed get bored or lonely. She told me she kissed other people and at that point I was done. On the 5th of Feb I said goodbye to her and blocked her on everything. I got a text from some number a few hours afterwards but I just deleted it. This was an attempt to try and escape from it all. 

Now what? What is there? I feel like a failure for doing nothing. Right now all I want to do is sleep so I can disappear for a while. I really want to move on I want to do anything I can to atleast change my life even in some sort of way. I hate who I am, where I am and I'm stuck. 

I'm sorry for the long post. This account is recently made to try and keep updates on my life and have progress and to create this change I need. You can keep track if you wish.

I will delete this post in a weeks time (19th feb).",12Feb2019,1
28,"I tried posting something long ago here and it was pretty long. Didn't get posted I guess. So, today, didn't go-to work. Spent the whole day with YouTube, Pubg mobile and porn. Now going to meet my girlfriend. Faking smiles. ",12Feb2019,1
29,"(Before I start, this is a long distance relationship but we see each other every summer and we speak everyday)
Whenever my girlfriend goes through depression, she tends to isolate herself from everyone including me. At first I didn’t understand why because normally people talk to their SO about everything it came to my understanding that not everyone wants to talk and some people like to be left alone. Just when I started to accept it, she starts posting on social media  about coming back to her old ways. When we were only friends,this meant she’d go MIA for months and tbh that scares me. Mainly because that would definitely mess with our relationship. 
Sure, maybe it’s just her depression speaking. And she’ll feel better soon but I can’t help but worry. I sent her a few wholesome memes and a message telling her that I loved her and I was there for her this morning and that’s it. I plan on giving her space because that’s definitely what she wants. She normally replies telling me she loves me as well but stops talking to me. 
She’s at work atm so I understand if she’s gonna take that Time to clear her mind. 

I love this woman and I don’t want to lose her to depression. All I can do is sit and wait but it drives me crazy. She and I are normally inseparable. We do everything together. We y’all all day everyday. But sometimes depression decides to shove its way in between us and brings her down. 
Makes me wish I could physically grab depression by the neck and tell it to fuck off and leave her alone. She’s gone through enough.  

If she needs a few days I understand and with Valentine’s Day coming up I hope she loves her roses I had scheduled to deliver to her. And I hope that helps her at least a little. This is gonna be a rough day for me. I worry about her. 
Am I doing something wrong or am I doing the right thing? ",12Feb2019,1
31,"I'm going to therapy for the first time tomorrow and I'll find out if I'm going to be diagnosed with depression. A lot of my issues have stemmed from problems with my mom, and I don't know how to tell her what I've been going through. While I have confronted her about it, she manipulates me into feeling guilty and invades my privacy. Currently, I'm a senior in high school so it's hard to avoid tension with her. I was wondering if any of you all have been through something similar, and whether or not I should tell her I am depressed.

34,"I recently lost all of my friends (also this is at school) as I depended on them, while depressed, one of them asked for space and stopped speaking to me entirely and blocked me and everyone else in the group slowly began ignoring me too. I've overheard the one I trusted most saying everything I said in confidence and the whole group now villainises me as if I killed someone when obviously I hadn't, and with no chance of reconciliation the only way to truly move on now that I'm alright by myself is to make new friends, but I don't know where to start, or even how or when to initiate. Is it even okay to talk to someone in public provided they're not busy or going anywhere? What other places could I even go or try? People in my classes generally make fun of or pick on me if I speak up at all, so in all my classes I'm esse tially forced to be quiet and keep my head down so I don't get physically bullied to add to being mentally bullied.

tl;dr
Lost friends, they turned against and villainises me, and I don't know how to make or maintain new ones. What do I do? ",12Feb2019,1
35,"I am 14, from Latvia.

I decided to come here and share my story because im at a loss for words, i don't know where to go.

I was born in 2004, but my story starts as far as i can remember, so around 2011.

I had it good, an only child, i had all the atention i needed, good grades, friends, a growing interest in computers. But i was mentally/emotionally weak, i could be driven to crying pretty easily, and my parents, having no prior experience with children and coming from the country side had a very bad habbit, whenever they came home, at around 6, 7 or in the evening they would like snap, or release their inner frustration at me, heartbroken i was, it would be fine if it happened once in a while but this happened every work day. I'm not sure, i guess the stress went to my head and my brain responded by telling me that what they said was lies, they love me, they wouldn't hurt me. I remember when i went to wash my teeth i would just sit there and process everything that happened and blatantly lied to myself. On weekends we went to my grandparents house, i had sweet loving grandma and i really loved her, weekends were the only time it wouldn't happen. I remember sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness, but then arose my savior video games! How i love those, still do, really the only reason i'm here, they raised me. Then they started to claim i'm 'addicted', they wouldent let me use the computer for weeks, and i got sader and sader. Huh.. Now that i think about young me made a really good analogy, i was like a wall and they constantly were breaking it, but i alone couldn't rebuild it fast enough. I didn't mention this yet but all of this was a repressed memory, recently only remembered this after an anger breakout.this went on for years and years.

Snap to present day.

Regular school kid on the surface, my grades dropped from 8's to 6's, i've been in a volleyball team since 1st grade so im pretty good but i don't even like the sport anymore, i started going only because i got cornered by my dad. I'm learning programing, for 2 years now. Insecure and anxious as hell. Depressed, contemplated suicide a few times. the bad depressed side of me is pulling me twoards drugs and all of that. Even though i forgot everything i still flinch and pull up my arms when they yell or get close.(I only remember a few times they hit me) 

There's a problem that apeared recently, whenever mom tries to reach me i just can't say anything, i feel like i know that it was a result of constantly being broken, i am so conflicted, we were talking and she asked me the same question but i couldn't, i wanted to do it with all my strength, we sat in near silence for nearly an hour, i was devastated that i couln't do it so i  said no, and went to sleep. My personality is splitting, on one side there's the person everyone sees, the one who loves mom and wants her to be happy, but the other part thats winning i'm afraid doesn't want anything to do with her, it doesn't want to do anything, my only passions are the remnants of the old me, a passion for computers and video games, the story with video games is bad in it's own, i can only play on weekends and after the divorce it's now not all weekends so i've had a grudge on them for a while. Because i 'hurt her' she is now not letting me use the computer in Riga(where i live during work days) aaand she talked to Dad and they supposedly agreeed for me to not be able to play even in weekends.

The reason i'm writing my  story here is because i don't know who is right, it was the hardest thing to tell my mom about what i felt,but she sat there nearly fully quiet and gave me a generic apology, i was in tears and coulden't speak atm, but it hurt me so much when she seemingly ignored it, the day of our fight aka sunday in anger she referenced it in a joke, this made me so mad. like b\*\*\*\* w\*\*, am i supposed to say HAHAHA you got divorced without a man you're useless, go DIE. Is this what help looks like???

Sorry in advance for horrible formatting, don't have much time. 

I couldn't write anymore, and fix the test because she'll be home soon and i don't have time.

&amp;#x200B;

If i have time i might post part 2 explaining more about my dad, the divorce and my frustration with him.

It is very important for me to know your thoughts, please coment.",12Feb2019,1

38,"I’ve been struggling again and getting more low and unhappy. I’ve spent the last year off with chronic illness- I basically had to be at home all the time. Now I am doing better in that sense, I’m working part time and spending more time with people.... but my mental health is rapidly declining. I’m having urges to do the damaging behaviour I did years ago and can’t seem to shake them, though thus far have avoided acting on them.

I am trying to be open with my mum and my partner, but I don’t like how worried they can look. I am still taking meds and am restarting therapy.

I was wondering if anyone can relate with this after seemingly getting themselves ‘back on track’, and maybe suggest how they found ways around slipping into old patterns?

Thanks ",12Feb2019,1
39,"Honestly I don't know, I am 17 and I think I have depression as I show many of the signs but I can't go to my doctors for help. My parents have already paid for me to go to therapy but that was more than 3 years ago and I lied to get out of it. And before you think Wtf is wrong with her, I lied because for every session my mum stayed in the damn room, I couldn't take it. They think I have  gotten better now but I have only gotten worse. My self harm has gotten really bad recently, I have started drinking alcohol to be happy and I have started to think about suicide again. I just have no idea what to do. Please can someone give me advice? I'm tired of feeling like this all the time ",12Feb2019,1

41,"My appetite is enormous. I crave empty carbs and sugar to try and get through life and I never really feel satisfied. I hate how I look and am getting past a healthy weight, even with lots of exercise. I kind of have motivation, but keep on comfort eating and gaining weight.
When all you want to do is cry into a carton of ice cream under the blankets, and constantly stuff your face with food, how do you ignore or reject that feeling to eat healthily?",12Feb2019,1
