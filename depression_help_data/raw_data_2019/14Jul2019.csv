2,"I'm new to Reddit and I'm going to try and keep this short and as non-whiny as possible. A couple months ago my BF and I decided to take a break for the summer. In his words: ""I love you, but before we think about marriage, I want you to take some time to yourself to figure out if I'm really what you want."" (He's also taking time to work on some of his self-esteem issues.) It's fine, but he was like also my best friend, and it's left a huge void. I live and work in a pretty remote area, and the few friends I have live in the city about 40 miles away. Recently, the stress of being isolated has really gotten to me and caused me to have seizures (I've had epilepsy since I was a kid, but it was under really good control until the past couple months.) This has fed into its own stress because it's dangerous for me to be alone and have a seizure. Because of all this, my driver's license has been cancelled until this fall, assuming I have no more seizures until then. I have to bike 5 miles one-way to and from work. So other than work, I don't really do anything.

My friends don't care to come out here (I don't blame them; there's nothing to do here). I can't go to the gym or see my therapist for our weekly sessions as they're both 15 miles away. So my day consists of me biking to work and biking home. I have no friends here, nothing to do, no help, and I'm starting to get stir crazy out here in nowheresville. I'm resorting to just taking Tylenol PM and sleeping a lot, which I really hate and would rather not do... but I'm at a loss. I've always been a well-adjusted individual without any serious issues, but I'm crying and becoming so depressed and moody and I just really don't want to be like this. I'm starving for human contact.

What would you do if you were in my situation? Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",14Jul2019,4
3,"Hey redditers, I can’t talk to anyone in my actual life so I was hoping you guys would help out. I’ve been shut down by everyone my whole life. Never fit in with any groups, all my “fiends” never invite me to anything, and out of 300 “friends” on snap/insta I only got 10 happy birthdays! I’ve just given up on trying for people in general.",14Jul2019,1
4,"So background info I am 23 \[M\] Toronto ON, I have a steady part time job and I am going to Uni. I usually disregarded my mental health and engage in unhealthy relationships in my teen years. 

But recently like last month I have been getting more weird intrusive thought like killing myself or harming others (non of which I would ever act on but they are still there like wtf brain). 

Now in my young adult years I am mostly distract myself with friends and my go to my usual vices (Alcohol and Weed- I know that's not sustainable but still it worked for me for a while). 

The problems would usually arise where I wouldn't see my friends for a couple of week because of work which which would be a bummer but it would be fine because I had my work to distract me.

 I would sleep for from when I would get home till an couple hours before my next shift. I thought that this was normal because I would work really hard at work. But the real shit started happening a couple weeks ago where plans with friends would fall through and I would catastrophize things to the point were I would just shut off from work and would get the feeling of that I was about to cry and that I just wanted to die (even though I wouldn't do it still makes me feel fucking awful).

I tried to turn to my friends to talk about this but it mostly got the ""I am so sorry that your feeling this way"" or they would try to bond with sharing their experience which really just turned into me trying to help them but failing. 

I went to my family after a really abusive relationship in my teen years they told me that ""isn't much we can do since we don't have money to spare for it."" But really fucking hurt was my sibling making fun of me for needing help and tell me ""that only the rich can afford to have those problems."" I thought that my work would have something and to no avail there wasn't anything available for part time workers :) . I tried to go through my uni which had a waiting list for a couple years so that was fun :)

So here I am at my last resource random nice people on the internet. If you know of any sort of help groups in Toronto Ontario where I could get help for depression. I don't have a lot of money because I pay for most of my Uni tuition but I do have some spare cash from my paychecks. Is there any support groups or counselling that I could get a reduced rate for being a student in Toronto Ontario. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for anyone who reads this or tries to help. I really don't know where to go for stuff like this. But this was also lethargic even just getting it all out there. I hope you all have a good night and I wish the best.

About a year ago I managed to drag myself down to my university's counseling center, but my first appointment ended pretty badly and I never went back.

7,"It's difficult to deal with in the long run. You may not be able to win over your crush when you become elderly, for example or after they have married/rejected you. 

&amp;#x200B;

To my mind, it seems like the best available, reliable outcome is to imagine the person doing gross things so you lose the emotions associated with your crush. This sometimes slightly helps me but also leaves a weird feeling of malaise/boringness/lack of meaning since those emotions of being in love also created feelings of meaning and happiness. Also, a problem with this strategy is that you are still thinking of the person. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, just find new things to distract you with"" 

Right? Yet, for plenty it is ends up not being so easy despite them knowing they need to distract themselves 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to remove the person/images of them from my life in all ways possible, but a certain person reappears in my dreams and I guess this reoccurrence makes me feel a sense of longing and emptiness without this person.

8,"Hey reddit, I thought I'd reach out here and see if anyone around wants to have a discussion...

Recently, I guess I've just been feeling defeated. I was fired from my last job due to the manager and me clashing, and I'm now having problems again with this new one. She's actually a nasty ass bitch (backstabs and mutters rude and blatantly condescending things under her breath about me), and I'm wondering if work is for me. I am at the stage now where I am struggling to smile at work. I hate it so much. I know I have some behavioural issues from my family trauma, which I'm slowly working through with a psychologist, but this just feels fucked. I don't think I can keep bouncing from job to job til the therapy kicks in, if it ever does... 

I'm beginning to question whether I'm cut out for the corporate meat grinder. It's really hard for me to deal with this bs, and frankly, I'm exhausted. I am also not sure if I could do labour or a job which requires little or no contact. I enjoy a good balance--given the opportunity and luck. Despite landing some decent jobs in the distant past, I never studied hard enough and long enough to get the paperwork, carve my own niche career and jump into a self-sustaining career. I am hoping next year I'll go back to study (something?) so I can escape the 9-5pm and never have to deal with incompetent and rude colleagues sitting next to my cubicle for 52 weeks. 

So my question is, is there anyone out there who will share any motivation, ideas, or inspiring stories of resilience and freedom? I'd love to hear a little motivation right now.

Cheers!",14Jul2019,1
9,"Ever since I was young, I've been lonely

Even when I talked to people, I felt lonely, for my head was somewhere else, and, in this place, there were only me and myself

Seemed to be impossible to truly focus on anything around me. I got to the point where I could elaborate whole phrases that matched a given context, without even noticing it.

Two minutes later, *puff!* it was gone from my memory

I needed a link to connect me, my head, to the real world

That link was you.

It's not like the world before you was uninteresting, but you were way to astonishing to ignore

After that, everything made more sense, everything became more interesting, and I thought it was alright, as it was in fact, for much longer than I expected that my mind would allow

But, what I failed to see is that this bound, as much as it had awoken me to the world, it became something so strong that it became exclusively unidirectional

Then, of course, loneliness came again with everthing else around it

On this day, I made the worst mistake in my life.

I took that bound and broke it into pieces

What's the reason of selfpreservation at this point?

This reminds me of a story...

A Giant Lord, whose left hand wielded a great shield, and on the other hand, a great sword, which he used to protect the one he loved

Sadly, fool as he was, he lost the one he loved, and threw away his shield, for he had noone else to protect

Now he awaits for the final blow to take him away

More than ever, I feel like I have no escape, no conection, no shield

The anhedonia now surrounds me

I loved you from the first moment I saw you, to my last second

Thank you for showing me the experience of having a real life

For you, it was worth every second",14Jul2019,27

I'm just occasionaly sad, the rest of the time I rarely think about all of this. In those sad moments I go as far as to wish I could stop my existence. But I can't because I can't do that to my parents. And I would never be able to do it because I would be too scared, and sometimes I have hope, everyone always says that it gets better. But most of the time I'm not sad. I suppress everything. So most of the time, I'm ok. Not bad, not good. I smile, I laugh, I don't cry. I don't even know if those are real emotions in the ""happy"" moments. And I dive into my Internet addiction or whatever it is. All I do the whole day is watch youtube videos, series, play games. For more than 2 years now. I'm studying at uni, but I never did anything at home. I procrastinate so badly. Everyone always says they are procrastinators too, but they don't get anywhere near to how far I'm gone. I can't find any motivation. I have no drive for anything, I just exist. I have no hobbies, no friends. At least I have my family, but deep down everyone is alone. I have no goals in life, I have no dreams. That's why it would be such a relief if I could just die. But I really can't. 


I feel so alone and like there is no one who understands me. No one could. Because I'm spoiled, I'm lazy and I've never felt real pain, nothing bad ever happend to me, I have all the opportunities a human could wish for but I ruin them.

Right now, it's 3:35am and I have been awake for the last 95 mins just wanting to hear my father's voice. To know that all that I'm doing for my own family is enough; that I'm not a failure as a son or as a husband or father. Sure, my wife tells me that I'm not a failure, but it's not the same. I just want to hear my father's reassurance one more time.

I can't find a voicemail or a video. Not a single one and it's crushing me more and more. So I sent him a message on facebook since I know his cell phone is long disconnected and his number more than likely recycled.

Assault with a deadly weapon? Yeah it was a metal spoon I threw at, I did that in frustration like I was going crazy and didn’t know how to stop. BUT it was an unfair game of what happen because I got ripped off after I helped him pay his internet bill, but it was an agreement. and he fucking acted like we never agreed on it. 

but not only that I threw the spoon at him, he fucking splashed his hot coffee right at my face and also attacked me when I was covering my face in pain. 

I can’t keep the story straight because RIGHT NOW i’m losing myself in my own fucking head. 

And sometimes I just want to end it all and ignore all the bullshit and worry about after life. 

If God loves us, then why does he allow sin to happen? Like most people are stuck and don’t have hope for shit like that. If Jesus died for our sins, then why did he came back alive? 

I don’t care if I receive death for mockery, because I feel like life isn’t fair. And I don’t care if I’m delusional for saying shit like this. because I was ONCE a believer and a follower, i’ve lost soo many friends and love ones close to me when I used to be a believer and while I was in bad shape during that clinical depression bullshit.

and Heaven and Hell? I don’t care if I get my ass beaten many times for blasphemy. It’s just the way how God’s world works.

20,"Throw Away Account.

I (f32) have been with my boyfriend (m26) for almost three years. He suffers from depression, and has elected to go without medication. Instead he eats healthy, exercises, abstains from drugs and alcohol. He is not interested in therapy.

He and I have a lot in common, and while we are frequently intimate I have found myself less interested as of late because he has just about giving up on grooming. I’m also less inclined to invite him out with my friends and their partners because of it. The man that used to get monthly haircuts and beard trims has been looking rather shaggy for the last few months. He will shower, but I think he’s usually just rinsing as his hair doesn’t smell or look fresh, and he has to be reminded to brush his teeth or put on deodorant. Ick.

His apartment has also gotten to a point with dishes, laundry, and general disorder that I can’t even be there without feeling a bit disgusted so it’s easier to hang out at mine, but then I find I am doing the dishes, laundry, and general chores for both of us while he begs me to come hang out with him saying, “It can wait for later.” However, I am fastidious and to me, it can’t wait for later.

I hate the resentment I am currently feeling toward him as I love him dearly. If it weren’t for the cleaning and grooming issues he would be close to perfect. What is the best way to suggest he work on his hygiene and cleanliness without offending him? Will he be capable of change? We communicate well otherwise, but I’m so afraid of offending him. I love him dearly, but this is a dealbreaker for me, and I don’t foresee us moving forward (or in together) if this is not addressed.

Anything and everything that has to be done always falls on me, and that's not just in the relationship, but just in life.
I'm only a temp, but I still struggle to find the motivation and energy to even go to work the days I get called in, some days I even cry knowing I have to go to work when all I want to do is sleep. 

I just wanna take a voluntary month off where me and my daughter just goes out and discovers the world, but of course if I don't work that'll never happen, and I barely get work enough to make it through the month.

Guess I'm just in the bottom of my depression where it's all just a circle of negativity and need to vent.",14Jul2019,1
