0,"According to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) from several years ago, 41.6% of adults in the United States are Vitamin D **deficient**, which means high likelihood of feeling fatigued, in pain, and depressed. Especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your Vitamin D deficiency could be contributing to depression. 

If you're unable to find time to go outside and get natural Vitamin D, try taking 1000 IU of Vitamin D supplements each day. I noticed a radical change in my mood when I did. Hope this helps. ",15Jan2019,1
1,"I’ve been depressed for a long time now. I’m in my mid teens, and something which has stuck with me ever since I first developed this depression is what my mother said. She had recently been to visit a fortune teller, and now I’m not one to believe in that sort of stuff, but this is different, bear in mind this was about a year and a half/two years ago. 

She asked me if I was depressed, and I was shocked at first because I wasn’t actually feeling that way and this point in time, and I said something that was completely ignorant and stupid. I told her that I was “too mentally strong” to become depressed, which I now understand is extremely ignorant of me, because your mental state alone doesn’t necessarily “prevent” depression. 

I struggle terribly with sleep, which has become more prevalent now that I have anxiety creeping up on me, too. Worrying thoughts keeping me up and night. It’s gotten to the point where I have actually went into school without any sleep whatsoever once or twice a week. But then I’ll be the opposite, and won’t *actually* go to school as I would’ve slept all day. Everyday, it requires and immense amount of willpower for me to simply get out of bed. 

I’ve just woke up from a nice sleep, and it is now 12am. 

I’m going to the doctor tomorrow. I’m going to explain to him how I’ve been feeling over the course of 2 years. I’m going to explain how I can feel anxiety creeping up on me like a predator. 

He’s the only doctor I’ve ever really had trust in, I get a vibe off him that he actually cares. 

I’ve spoken to this doctor in the past regarding my sleep, as I have tried to allocate my problem with sleep as something which is not associated with depression, but it is simply not true. 

I’ve really got a good outlook on tomorrows session, and I really can’t wait. I’m hoping to get this problem sorted once and for all, granted it might take a couple weeks. 

I advise all of those who are currently suffering to weigh out the benefits and disadvantages of seeking help. I say this because the one thing that was putting me off receiving treatment was that I was scared, and the whole stigma of depression. 

Nobody in my family knows how I feel. Nobody but one friend knows how I feel, and I still haven’t told her all of it. 

I wish you all the best in your journey, and I appreciate your time given if you have read this. ",15Jan2019,1
2,"I’ve never dated anyone before. I’ve always been lonely and too afraid to talk to girls. I know us guys are supposed to initiate but I literally can’t do it. My friend introduced me to a girl who was really nice to me. After a while, she even said she wanted to date me. But it slowly devolved from being smitten, to just friendship, then to acquaintances, how I’m sure she hates me. So to keep it short, she never answers my text so I text her cousin to give the information to her. Somehow there was miscommunication and he told her that I’m done talking to her when I meant I’m done having to be the leader (I was the one who had to plan a date) now I think that’s why she hates me. She left me on read when I tried to explain to her on Instagram what I meant and she blocked my number...I’m so heartbroken. I probably don’t deserve her anyway, I’m so clingy and anxious...",15Jan2019,1
3,"I can't take much more of this. I'm at the end of day 4 and I still feel hopeless quite a bit of the time. Just like my world is ending or something, lots or rumination about the past, and things i could have done differently. Im kind of trapped in the house at the moment so im not getting much social interaction which sucks, because i enjoy having people to talk to. I guess im lucky in that the physical symptoms weren't too bad as i wasn't doing all that much this time.

Anyways anyone who's been through this have any idea how long it takes to at least feel some semblance of normalcy?

4,"Some prefacing: I’ve previously been diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety and, whilst I had gotten over the depression for a good few years, returning to high school (spent 2.5 years home bound and 1.5 years online schooled due to health problems) this year for 11th grade has brought my depression back, probably worse than it’s ever been.

High school feels like a useless endeavor to me. I feel like I’m learning nothing, and I maintain extremely high grades without trying (I hope I’m not coming off as arrogant, so if I am I deeply apologize). Every time I have to get up in the morning to go I want to cry. It’s sickening to me to fathom that I have to go to a place that I hate for 9 hours, to do essentially nothing, and be around 2400 people (which scares the ever-living heck out of me), against my will. I would like to graduate early but I’m not sure I can at this point since I only just caught up from the 4 years I was on homebound and online school.

 I’ve seen myself becoming mean and it’s scaring me, because I know it’s not me but every day I’m getting more depressed by school. I’d like to go to college, but I don’t feel like I can withstand another year of this personal hell. I don’t even get the enjoyment of talking to friends, which (my understanding) is what makes it bearable for most people.

 (Warning: this is probably going to cross into a rant about my anxiety as well). I feel like it’s borderline impossible for me to make friends aside from the ones I’ve had from like 5/6th grade. The first semester of this year I at least had 1 thing making it worth going. There is a girl I like in my 1st period and seeing her every day and say hello to each other at least made it somewhat bearable but then I asked her out (only girl I’ve ever asked out) but after that she just ignores me.

If I try to talk to anyone about it, I generally just get “I’m sorry” because they don’t know how to respond. I would appreciate any suggestions that anybody has, because everyday it becomes more unbearable.

5,"I don’t answer texts. I don’t answer calls. Anyone who cares I push away. I just hide from life. I know it’s selfish and I don’t know why I do it. On one hand I can be out going, but that’s only when I’m in a place I don’t know anyone. I feel safe. The second someone I know is around (other than my immediate inner circle) I become very quiet and I get this feeling I’m constantly being judged. I don’t have social media for this reason. I feel like everyone thinks I’m a dick or I’m weird because I never say hi to anyone if I see them around. I just try to make it look like I don’t notice them even tho it’s obvious I do. What is wrong with me? ",15Jan2019,1
6,"Some background information: My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasn't a bad break-up, just a sad one. Shortly after the break-up, I noticed I wasn't dealing with it well at all. I couldn't do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn't do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasn't angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I'm okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.

At this point I have accepted she won't talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March/April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it.

So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)(so a double depression), and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder (e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti-social, existential OCD). I am still at the early stages so I won't have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the break-up. Still, my ex thinks she and the break-up are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she won't speak to me nor believe me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now here is my dilemma: I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again; that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown man's body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life won't get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I don't see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesn't make me happy. I don't even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say: ""Move on!"", ""Man up!"", ""Do \[this\] or do \[that\], I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. It's not even that I don't want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but it's like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know it's the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee I'll get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And don't get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesn't do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward won't make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing won't make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel it's the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself; that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore. I am hopeless, desperate, and dysfunctional... What can I still possibly do?!**

Call me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again. Do it if you want.

Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr: GF of 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago. I want her back, but I made every mistake there is. I plunged into depression and I got diagnosed with several mental illnesses. I feel the pressure to move forward, but it's crippling me. I am too weak and scared to go on, especially when I won't get my ex back. I feel absolutely worthless and pathetic. Right now the only solution seems to be suicide because even if I go on I won't be satisfied and happy...

12,"Recently I (20F) ended a ‘relationship’ with a guy, basically because I knew he didn’t like me as much as I liked him and because I felt miserable after we hung out when I didn’t get very much attention or the right kind of attention from him.

I’ve become super destructive in the wake of ending things with him, and I think this kind of thing is the excuse I’ve been looking for to completely go crazy. I’m meant to be saving money for rent and also a bond payment, while also looking for a new job and place to live, and it’s caused me so much stress. I don’t have any money to be sparing on partying or even just recreational activities because I have so much to pay for in the way of groceries, fuel, rent and applying for rentals once my current lease ends in a month.

Now that I’ve been hurt emotionally by this dude, I’m just going out and doing drugs, getting drunk, spending money on stupid shit and ultimately coming home and either sleeping with people I shouldn’t be or crying myself to sleep and self harming. At first I told myself it was because of the breakdown of a relationship I thought was going to blossom, but now I just think that was the tipping point and this has been building for a long time.

I don’t know what to do to break myself out of this self destructive cycle. As soon as I feel like I’ve calmed down, I get bored and lonely and use dating apps to find random guys to put my attention towards. I recently let a guy slap me and choke me to the point of passing out because I wanted to punish myself for my recent behavior. If I can’t find anyone to hang out with, or my friends won’t answer my constant messages, I just drink until I fall asleep and repeat the cycle when I wake up.

What can I do and who can I contact to put an end to this. I’m on my second week of seeking out anything and everything to keep myself busy and I’m spending too much money and heading towards a complete nervous breakdown, but even knowing this I can’t stop myself. I’ve been on a waitlist to attend an initial meeting with a counselor at Headspace, but I couldn’t make my last appointment due to having to work and the next available appointment isn’t until February.

21,"About a year ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, for a while it was really bad but things slowly improved. I went to the doctors, got prescribed medication and I felt like I was improving. I didn't think I'd ever get that bad again but I feel like I'm falling back into those ways.

I currently live at home with my parents, I'm 23 but I don't mind, I have a close relationship with my parents and they have been nothing but supportive for me. I'm currently studying for a masters degree which finishes in September so I feel like I at least have some direction in life.

However, lately I just haven't felt myself. I have absolutely no motivation to do things, even the things that I want to do. I can't seem to sleep at night and I usually wake up late (around 10.30am) but end up getting back into bed and just looking at my phone until around midday. I barely go out. I moved to a new area back in May of last year and I have no friends here, it's pretty rural as well so there isn't many places to go and join clubs/activities and I don't drive.

So I feel sad, it’s ok to feel sad- I’ll do something that usually distracts me or makes me feel better and eventually that feeling goes away. I want to nap- fine I’ll take a nap- eventually after an hour I feel rested and move on with my day. Typically, I go back in forth about whether or not I should take a nap, judging myself for wanting to nap and wishing I had more energy or could power through my day like all my “normal” friends. This turns into laying in bed for an hour spiraling into utter exhaustion so that I have to take a two hour nap just to recover.
