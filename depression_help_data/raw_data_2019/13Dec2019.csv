1,"So I just joined so I apologize if this is in the wrong place, but does anyone feel that they will never find the medication to treat your depression?  I've been battling this misery for over 20 years, and I think I have been on more meds than a Walgreens is allowed to carry.  

I just went to my primary doc because of headaches, fatigue, and spots in my vision, and for the 1000th time he attributes the symptoms to depression and anxiety.  Based on scores I received when he asked me about my depression, he wanted me to go to the ER, which I flat out declined.

So...tomorrow I am going to an urgent care mental health facility, and I'm sure they will put me on yet another myriad of pills.  My questions are:

1. Were you ever lucky enough to find a medication that worked?
2. How long did it take before you felt the medication actually working?

Thank you for any help you can provide.",13Dec2019,1
2,"My depressive thoughts have been explosive today. I have walked myself off multiple cliffs (figuratively). 

I drafted four 2 week notices to my boss. 
I obsessively imagined staying in bed for two weeks.
I ignored a call from my sister. 
I have almost burst into tests 10x's. 
I am having obsessive thoughts about how I'm a terrible person, deserve nothing, nobody cares, etc. 

Holy f*CK. 
I'm so tired of depression. 
I become so self-absorbed. 
It's not who I am. 
It's not who I want to be.",13Dec2019,1
3,"Well, basically I'm what you'd call an absolute and utter fuck up. I ruined my first year of college by missing classes, smoking and playing a stupid mobile game, but rather than improving and learning from my mistakes I'm on the path of repeating what I did in my first year due to the same stupid mobile game that my fuck up self couldn't stop playing, it gave me a weird self-gratification that I don't believe my life could give me, and honestly being good at that game is probably my only achievement worth shit.  At least in my first year, I was passing 2 or 3 classes, this year I've absolutely failed everything in the first semester. I recently just finished talking with my mom; shes devasted. She told me that she hates my dad for letting me go to a catholic school rather than a private one, and said if I was sheltered none of this would happen. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not good for anything, nor is my garbage life worth anything. I want to just end everything right now, maybe then my parents won't have to waste any money on such a useless human being like myself. I've thought of it countless times but this is the closest I feel to actually doing it",13Dec2019,1
4,"i feel kind of wrong posting this but i am legitimately asking for opinions/help to handle a situation...  My gf has been extremely depressed her whole life and suicidal, i'm not angry nor hold it against her. I suffer depression, am on medication to try to help and other things to try to improve my quality of life. i \*somewhat\* in my own eyes at least, understand a tiny bit of what she's going through. a tiny bit.

However, this is where i need help.  love her more than I can explain, and plan on asking her to marry me in the next few moths.  That said, she has gotten to a point where she constantly, 24/7, belittling and putting herself down. From  saying how she isn't good enough for &lt;literally any person she's working with currently&gt; or how she always messes up &lt;activity&gt; (which she doesnt...), etc.  I'm not angry about it, i've tried to suggest she should talk to someone who can help to get through whatever things may be bothering her, but she refuses. I understand being scared about talking to someone at first,  but I am afraid for her safety now... I don't know how to 'suggest' seeking help without it coming across as insensitive or something like that when it's 100% as pure as it can be from my heart. i'm just very concerned and want her to be ok, but she refuses to try to seek help and gets furious anytime I suggest it ( I can understand why, but i cant sit back and watch someone destroy themselves....)

any advice, at all, is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for reading this&lt;3",13Dec2019,1
5,"Hola my fellow redditors (redditees??). 2019 was a shitty year. Fell in love, had my heart broken. Then did it again. Twice by the same girl. I dont remeber a thing before I was 10 years old coz those years weren't the best of my life. Guess my brain just erased those memories as they suck ass. 2013 to now have been hell on earth. I started cutting myself as a way to block out the pain that came from every direction; school, home and family, work, and society as a whole. I'm not bipolar but the type of mood swings I have beg to differ. I get more and more tired everyday. Waking up in the morning is harder than calculus tbh. I'm losing hope. Things that used to interest me dont excite me anymore. The world is dark as fuck and theres no light. Even religion doesnt give me the hope it used to.
I dont know what to do, yall.",13Dec2019,1

7,"I’m a 24 Y/O female who is struggling with some inner demons, and I’ve been debating seeing my physician for some help - but I feel stuck. 

Backstory - I am 24 years old, engaged to a wonderful man. Working in a job I love (that pays JUST enough to cover my bills, and not much more). My friends are spread all over the country so I rarely see them. We live 30 minutes away from the nearest city so we are isolated, and my fiancé is in LOVE with his job. So he is very rarely home. 

Lately I’ve been feeling incredibly overwhelmed when I am alone. I feel as though I’ve lost myself somehow in these last few years. Whenever I’m alone, I cry. I cry to the point where I cannot breathe and I don’t know how to console myself. I find myself having thoughts that I should just move away, that no one wants me here. That I was only proposed to because it was the right thing to do at the time, not because he loved me. During these episodes, I find myself thinking about MANY years back when I struggled with self harm, though I have not harmed since those days. It doesn’t help that I did not want to move out of town, yet I’m often alone in this house - and paying bills for this house that I didn’t want - leaving me in a tight spot financially. 

So my question is - if I feel so low when I’m alone, but completely fine and happy when I’m surrounded by other people - is this really depression? 

I know the people of reddit are not doctors, and my best bet would be to see my physician. Thing is, my physician is an older man, with very old school tendencies (his visits often include a scolding about my lack of religion, and always a smack on the hand about having pre marital sex). Aside from his personal views, he’s a damn good physician. Will order any tests he sees necessary as precaution, and he will spend all the time in the world with you to get your health issues sorted out. That said, I know since his personal views are so narrow minded - he will have some old school thoughts regarding mental health. 

So I guess I just want to know - do you guys think this could be some kind of fun depression/anxiety combo? Or am I just bad at coping with being lonely? Or is that something else in itself? 

Where do I begin coping? 

NOTE - if the consensus is that it sounds like depression, I will be seeking help from my physician. I just don’t want to open this can of worms with him if I don’t have to. 

TLDR; happy when with others, upset when alone. Lonely or depressed?",13Dec2019,1
8,"I have 4 siblings that are all better looking than me. They all have redeeming qualities but I dont. I have a chubby face, bad skin(was bullied and judged a lot for it growing up), weird hair, and I'm pudgy. They all have friends and or a gf and are doing well in school. They have no major health problems. I'm single, no friends, and failing out of college.

I used to be really into lifting and had a decent amount of musscle. Even then my current gf wasnt attracted to me and even admitted that my siblings were more attractive than me. I stopped lifting because I have asthma and it got bad. I started drinking a lot to cope and gained almost 20 pounds.  I also have sinusitis and cant breathe through my nose making me a mouth breather and giving me very chapped lips. I cant sleep well at all and have nightmares or wake up in the middle of the night. The more I think about it laying around all day alone  on my phone the more unfortunate I feel. Everyone I know that is ""successful"" (has a lot of friends, a job, doing well in school, is liked, and confident) hasn't had the hardships I have. I feel like it's just a pissing contest but it's the truth.

I know theres people that have it worse than me. That only makes me feel better short term and then I go back to feeling sorry for myself and pitying myself. How do I accept that fact that 95% of the people in my life have it easier than me?

9,"I feel like for me, the worst thing about depression is how tired and unmotivated I always am. I can never leave bed. I have nowhere to go cause I don’t have any people to hang out with.

10,"I have to rewrite all this cause I’m dumb and didn’t copy it. 

Anyway, I’ve posted a lot on r/advice and other places on how I feel.

I just want to know what I should do?

I don’t wanna feel like this anymore. I just wanna feel good, better. I’m tired of being sad and angry at everyone and everything. I just wanna know what’s right and what I should do. 

I don’t want to kill myself. I feel like if things don’t get better soon, I might kill myself. I might end it cause I’m done with the bs. What the heck do I do? I feel like crying right now but I can’t cry because I can’t. I just can’t. I feel like a failure. I feel so angry at everyone. I feel like to die, to scream, to punch the wall, and whatever else. I don’t wanna resort to drugs to feel good. I just wanna be me. What the heck do I do? Someone please tell me.",13Dec2019,1
11,"We have been together for almost a month after “breaking up” for two years. Anyways, she didn’t text me at all today except for in the morning and at lunch, after that, I didn’t here from her. 

Fast forward to about 8:30, she texts me saying that she is sorry, and that the reason why she didn’t text me was because she was busy. I respond with okay.

She then calls me saying someone was apparently bullying her by calling her anorexic because she is skinny. I ask her if she is okay and she says yes and she hangs up. But then she calls me again when she got home saying that she wishes she had a better life and that everything about her is messed up. I ask her what’s wrong but she says she doesn’t want to tell me, she wants to keep everything to herself. I keep on pushing, trying to get her to tell me so that I can help her, only because I am worried. 

After a while of texting back and forth, she says that she’s not going to tell anyone because she knows how to deal with it herself. She also mentioned that she was going to hurt herself. 

Other things have been said by her, but I don’t want to make this too long. I don’t want to get all in her business but I’m genuinely worried about her well being. I don’t know what to do. Should I tell her parents? Advice would be helpful.",13Dec2019,1

20,"I'm extremely confused. He has broken up twice before because he feels broken and like a burden, and the many break ups has taken it's toll on me. But at the same time I feel bad for moving on now and not being there for him. I still love him and I'm afraid if I let go I lose him. But I'm also afraid to be hurt even more by holding on. Staying friends seems soooooo hard. Especially if one of us starts to date again. And I have a feeling he soon will - he is the kinda person that would try and distract himself from the pain like that and he gets lonely easily. I don't think he'd find a replacement for me, but even if it doesn't mean anything, I would have a hard time being there for him and not wonder if he saw someone else

... What's the right and kind thing to do?

Btw, there's no doubt that he has a depression. He is on medication (just a fyi to those thinking it's a scam to break up easily)

21,"Sorry in advance if I format this incorrectly. I want to give a trigger warning that this post will include the topic of suicide.

This is kind of my last resort, I know I shouldn't expect strangers online to help and I really don't even know what I need or want from this but I guess just someone to listen. I have been having a hard time but unlike previous times that I've felt sad, I can't link this to anything. I'm 21 and just opened a store so that has caused some stress but I'm doing what I really want to do so I should be happy, right? 

Everyday I just get worse, my chest feels heavy and I just feel constantly sad and for the past few weeks the thought of suicide has come up in my mind more and more. I have tried talking to people, my boyfriend says he wants to help, and I know he cares, but he doesn't know what to do and I can understand that. I don't want to put my problems on him. I have tried talking to my family and I always get the same ""your life is good, what do you have to be sad about?""

I'm just at home right now, alone, and the thought of suicide is now starting to feel more and more real. I don't want to be sad but I don't know what to do and I am in so much pain. I also don't like the idea of antidepressants because I was on Cymbalta for anxiety (before I felt depressed) and it completely f'ed me over emotionally and physically (that's a story for another day) so I'm really weary of going on another antidepressant. 

I don't know what I want from this but thankyou for listening.",13Dec2019,1
22,"So my ex dumped me about 3-4 weeks ago. We talk a bit through Snapchat/iMessage because we had an amicable breakup, nothing was toxic just didn’t work at that time, simply lost feelings and the generic needed time for herself. However about a week after ending things I ignored her texts for about 3 days and she started ignoring my snapchats. When I finally texted her she got angry that “now you can reply”. 

Fast forward to now, I haven’t replied to her in a day and she is again ignoring my snapchats. 

I can think of a couple reasons why, because she feels I’m being mean. Since we were friendly and didn’t have a bad breakup she expects friendly encounters and not being ignored. Or she still has feelings and gets upset. She does struggle very bad depression, which played a part in the breakup if that means anything now I’m not sure. Maybe she feels abandoned.

24,"This is my first time telling anyone about this so excuse me as I'm rambling. And please don't say anything like ""Thank you for saying this and taking a big step."" That really makes me feel worse about myself. 

Honestly I'm getting really sick of feeling sad and angry all the time and when I'm sad I couldn't stop crying and I couldnt control my tears which is pretty bad in Singapore (where I'm living) where general people will isolate you when you show any signs of mental health issues. And I couldn't make any friends here because of my nationality and all the prejudice I get just by being myself has been repeating itself in my mind every day. Not only that but also workplace bullying has led me to be even closed off and led me to not be able to leave the house because I felt as soon as I step out of house people will judge and isolate me which make me feels like there is no point of going out anymore. 

I know ""iTzzZ NooO BiGG DeALzzZ, all the teenage girls hv this once in their lives."" (From the two psychiatrists I've visited and I'm 26F) but I really wish I could move pass all these experiences and how it makes me feel all the time but I couldn't manage to find a therapist who I can trust and is empathetic. And I couldn't afford it regularly since I'm couldnt force myself to work for the past 8 months. I hv tried getting help from public services here but the experiences was truly horrible and it has made my condition even worse.

I've been reading books hoping I could find an answer but that doesn't really work and it couldn't calm me down.

I really need help to get out of this 'cause I don't wanna keep spiral into this again and again.

I met a girl recently playing games online and she seems really nice and pretty, she's from another country. She suffers from depression. Met her almost 2 months ago playing a game and I can feel the vibes between us. Sometimes she gets out of control and Im trying to help her by talking with her and staying late just to keep her company. Been like this for days. Nothing serious yet

Yet I also had a gf I cheated on who was away from the states for a month. She was also nice to me. I  dumped her as soon as she came back and found out about this girl.

31,"Hi, 
   My name is Nemo, I’m 20 years young and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. But lately, life has almost been unbearable. I can’t shake these intrusive thoughts anymore. Nothing in my life has changed since the last post, I’m still an emotionless being. I lack enthusiasm or just general apathy towards anything that I do. I don’t have any hobbies (except I do read from time to time) or interests. I’ve tried different forms of activities such as painting, hiking, yoga, etc. Nothing seems to peak my interest, and when it does, it doesn’t last for longer than a week or two. The only friends I have at the moment are internet friends. As of late, they seem to be too busy to even hold a conversation, which at first made me feel lonely. But now, I’ve realized that they most likely don’t want to talk to me. In turn, I constantly try to “change” things to make my life more interesting but I just end up doing the wrong things. For example, once I starved myself for a whole month In order to feel in control of my own body/emotions. It developed into an addiction. I tend to force myself to be interested in current affairs that way I seem more interesting and/or relatable. I end up just feeling lost. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I try to find an identity in the things that I own because I lack personality and interests. It just has become so mentally exhausting trying to constantly articulate these feelings and what they mean. Hence why I’ve tried to write this down. I want a passion, an interest, something!! I’m afraid that I might never figure out who I am or at least who I want to be.

34,"I didn’t know how to title this but I’m genuinely seeking some advice or comments from an outside perspective on my situation here. 
Details below:


I’m a 26year old Caucasian male, about 220lbs, and 6’ 1”. I suffer from Depression, Binge-Eating, mild ADD, and Anxiety, but I have not received an official diagnosis from my Doctor or my previousTherapist... just prescriptions.

Currently I take the following Medications (prescribed by my Doctor):

• Escitalopram 20mg (have been taking off and on since 2015– with a more consistent treatment starting in May of 2019 after having stopped cold-turkey in November of 2018. No taking 1per day)

• Vyvanse 30mg (started taking in May 2019, 1 per day. Did go up to 40mg and then back to 30mg)

• Trazodone 50mg (started in May of 2019, taking only as needed, off-and-on)

• Bupropion Hydrochloride (started taking last week in addition, 1per day)

When I first started taking the Vyvanse and my Escitalopram consistently, everything was great. Exercising was easier and enjoyable, I lost weight, my appetite/eating was under control— all during the summer. Now, 6months later in the winter, everything has just taken a steep decline, I’ve put on weight, and I’m constantly having mood swings on top of everything else.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts at least once a day for as long as I can remember— knowing I don’t have the courage to act on it. But lately the courage is making itself known and I’m more drawn to the idea of just ending things more than ever before. 
I’ve isolated myself socially, and my career has taken a downward spiral. I’ll be unemployed and forced to find new work after my current project as I’ve been let go from the crew I’ve been with for 3years. 
Not to make this a sob story, but I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel numb and lost.
(I’ve tried therapy with a psychiatrist and that lasted 10sessions before I stopped going back in July because my benefits ran out. It didn’t really help me in the long run. I also don’t talk about my mental illness with my family at all).",13Dec2019,1
