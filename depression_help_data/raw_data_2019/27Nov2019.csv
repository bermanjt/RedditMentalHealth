0,"I was used by a guy (who I thought was my friend) as an ego boost until 3 months ago when he found another girl to talk to. I was there for him every time, every day and at the end he stopped talking to me except when it came to work matters, avoided me like the plague at work and always lied about what was going on. We three worked together and he and this girl who is now his girlfriend (who at the time had another boyfriend) played me and completely humiliated me in front of my colleagues. He tried to make himself look like the good guy and he told lies left and right and also publicly showed me and everybody that I was no one to him by arranging for this girl to have the better work schedule when I explicable told every manager that I needed a more flexible schedule because of my studies (also I've worked there for years, she was there for just 3 months), but I guess when you really want to sleep with someone you forget everything else? 

I've been struggling with my self-worth for a while now and it's been 2 months since I left that job/and last saw them both but I still can't stop repeating every damn memory in my head of every mistake I've ever made, of every time I was treated as a substitute to something, as a toy to be played with. I saw some of the red flags but I was so lonely and depressed and I lack the social skills to have changed that so I stayed...made a fool out of myself. And now I keep comparing myself to a damn teenager and crying my eyes out because my fears have actually been confirmed - I am a worthless, boring thing that crippled itself emotionally and mentally by being too sheltered and too afraid of everything. I guess I'll always be the substitute, the second choice, the better-than-nothing person. 

I don't know how to overcome this situation. I've tried taking up new hobbies and educating myself but I either don't have the motivation to continue or I give up by how afraid I am of the information I'll have to process. I am in a constant state of panic because I am 5 months shy of graduating but I have no idea what my degree is even about, nor do I actually want to do something with my life. I have no dreams, no desires, no prospects, no social life. And all of this brings me to this realization - she is better than me, a lot of people are better than me, but how the hell do I deal with the reality of this situation now? How do I pick up myself up and start from zero in the middle of my 20s, how do I even convince myself to break all the unhealthy habits and thoughts...",27Nov2019,1
1,"I'm going into a depression, every time I've tried to get close to someone it's been taken away. My dad passed a month before my relationship started and my mom was never emotionally there and with my ex, they both said one thing and the opposite the next. My family's really not there for me, the only love and emotional support I've gotten was from him and his family. It just feels like I'm never going to have any meaningful relationship, I've never felt that love from family or otherwise. He said he wanted to be with other people and highlighted my flaws. He got aggravated when I got anxious and lied about his true feelings. I feel flawed and broken I’m scared to be depressed again, I don’t wanna go through that hurt. I just feel alone, I just want a hug, I want someone to hold me and tell it’s going to be okay. I’m so scared of being alone it feels like I have no one.",27Nov2019,1
2,"Let's dig into my life,
Not just the past, 
But my present too,
It's all the cold truth.
When I was a baby,
Not even born yet,
My dad wanted a little boy,
My mother's ultrasound said I was too,
Until I came out,
Poof,
Hello mister,
Would you want to hold your baby girl??
My father did,
Although he didnt want to.
He didn't want his first to be a little girl,
He wanted a boy.
To him,
I'm the disappointment, 
He left my mother,
But soon got back together,
Then he got what he asked,
A little boy,
To carry on his name.
He stayed,
Until my brother was two, 
Then told my mom to lay in the bed she made.
My mom busted her ass,
To make a life for my brother and I,
This is when all our lives took a spin.
She met a man at the bar,
She thought he was dashing and handsome, 
She really thought,
He was the one.
When she turned up pregnant,
She got engaged, 
To a man full of hate,
We now all sit and wonder,
Why was that our fate??
He constantly beat my mother,
My brother and I were to young to know what was wrong, 
As he slammed her into the wall.
Once she was on her feet,
He kicked her to the ground, 
Put his foot on her temple, 
And put all his weight on her.
The blood, bruises, screams and cries,
Was killing my brother and I inside.
The neighbors called the cops,
They came and arrested the guy.
My mom was still stupidly in love, 
And decided to stay.
My youngest brother was born not to long after,
The abuse she took made his due date come up faster,
He came out, 
Quiet as a mouse,
But looking all around. 
I remember the man who beat her,
Hold his child,
His eyes lit up,
And he managed to smile.
He acted so in love,
My mom believed it,
But he still continually beat her.
A year later, 
Was the wedding,
They had a beautiful reception, 
But most do.
I saw how happy my mom was,
Today was the day,
But slowly,
Everything turned gray.
I was nine around this time,
And this was the day,
The hell broke loose. 
I'm not gonna say what all went down, 
But it stared with my mom,
Chasing my cousins out of the house.
My mom packed our bags,
And said we were leaving. 
We went to my grandparents, 
And that's when a cop came to see me.
It's hard to write this part,
Without tears in my eyes,
Even to this day,
The memory hasn't died,
But it's a open scar in my life.
I was sent to a hospital,
They did a kit on me,
And everything that I told the cop,
The court now knew was true,
My mom did my trial, 
And locked my cousin up for fifteen years,
When most people in this situation get one,
My mom hugged me when she said,
We won. 
That was when the man she was married to,
Lost his job,
Because he came home,
To comfort my mom through this time,
This added to my already broken life.
He left every morning, 
Came home drunk every night.
There were times, 
Mom paid my babysitter extra, 
To let my mom, my brothers and I,
To stay the night.
His aggression grew stronger. 
I somehow knew,
I needed to talk to my mom,
Because this has been going on way to long.
I was ten at this time,
And I told mom,
""I never want to get married,""
My mom looked at me puzzled and asked
""Why?""
My answer was
""Because I dont know how to fight.""
My words pushed her,
To file for divorce. 
Before she could do it,
He was already out the door. 
My mom fell into depression, 
And we ended up loosing our home,
We stayed at friends houses and eventually got a apartment.
But everything reverted,
Right back to where it started.
Fast forward, 
Now I'm almost twelve, 
And my mother remarried that man,
She honestly thought he changed??
Yeah right,
He never put hands on mom again, 
But my brothers and I, 
Were his next target.
He started by yelling, 
Over stupid things like 
""How come supper isn't done yet??""
""How come the house is a mess??""
""Why is the dog on the couch??""
""Are you done yet??""
If things didn't go his way, 
He went ballistic.
He would beat my brother with all his strength, 
He would continually slap my other brother upside his head,
As for me, 
I got most of the verbal,
He would call me a stupid bitch,
Then threw the supper I just made on the floor.
As the years went by,
Things just got worse,
But jump to fourteen,
And my only escape, 
Was leaving on the weekends.
I had a best friend at the time,
But yet again she was another lesson,
It was still better than staying at home,
Where I truly felt alone.
This girl taught me how to apply makeup,
And tried getting me with men,
When she knew I already had one.
Some men tried their best,
To change my mind,
But I simply said 
""No,""
And they still let it slide.
I had enough, 
And just left.
I had enough,
That's not how I wanted to be brought up.
That's when I started staying home,
Eventhough everyday,
I dreaded going back,
When everyday that man wanted to attack.
My mom was never home,
So she didn't know,
The screams my brother would let out every night,
Sometimes I was scared he'd loose his life.
My stepdad beat him,
Until he couldn't speak, 
My other brother, 
Just watched and weeped.
I was in my room, 
Trying to cut out the noise.
I wanted to call the cops,
But I was afraid of never seeing mom again. 
So I stayed quiet,
Until he was done.
Then one day,
I finally had enough. 
I told my mom,
""I know you dont want to hear this, but it has been going on way to long.""
My mom shut me up,
And told me to tell someone else.
The next day,
I went to the councilor, 
I told her everything, 
And watched her tears fall down her face.
She told me to stay in the room,
Because she had someone she needed me to talk to.
A hour passes and the door opens,
The lady said she was from CPS, 
And asked me to tell her everything.
I was fifteen at the time,
And although I was scared I'd never see my mom,
I was more scared for my brothers and I. 
I told her the whole story, 
She had the same reaction as the other lady,
And quickly ask my brothers for their side of the story,
It was the same story,
But told different,
They tried everything,
To lock him up,
But because there was no physical evidence, 
They couldn't do a thing.
My mom always tells us,
That she is sorry,
To this day, 
She feels the heartbreak,
She doesn't like to show it,
But you have to take the mask off sometimes, 
Even when you dont want to.
Fast track to seventeen, 
My mom decided it was time to leave, 
We left our homestate, 
To find a better life. 
It worked for a while, 
For everyone but me.
Everyone was so happy,
But my life got worse it seems. 
I quickly fell into a depression, 
And kept a mask on,
Showing a happy face,
Knowing my real one has seen better days. 
I was stuck in that state for a year,
When I decided to leave,
My mom didnt like it, 
But at this time,
I was graduated, 
And eighteen, 
There was nothing she do to stop me,
I hopped on the plane,
And said goodbye, 
Praying that what I was doing was going to be alright. 
I was doing alright at first, 
I was working a good paying job,
I even started going to college. 
Then things went down hill,
My car was constantly breaking down, 
I got fired from my job,
And my teachers just quit,
As hard as that sounds,
I swear it did.
At nineteen,
I dropped out of my class,
And I still pay for a class I didnt learn shit in.
Then I met a man that I used to be head over heels for in highschool,
He has a son,
And was still so charming,
I asked him if I could come over and chat,
It turned out,
We had the same feelings like we did back then,
I stayed over,
We had a amazing night,
Little did I know, 
He was definitely going to be apart of my life. 
I remember first meeting his son,
It was honestly amazing.
Once we laid him down for his nap,
This man and I went downstairs, 
We then cuddled on his couch.
I never felt a connection this strong,
He made me forget what was going on in my life,
In short minutes, 
My scares from my past,
Suddenly felt like they were healed.
I honestly believed it was fate at first,
But things got much worse.
We were talking for two short months,
I knew I was falling for this guy, 
But one day fucked everything up.
I started getting symptoms of a pregnancy, 
I told him,
And he didnt believe me.
We also worked together, 
That was was not a plus, 
But the symptoms I described, 
Slowly showed.
Once it hit two weeks,
I took a test that showed ""invalid,""
I bought another,
And it showed negative. 
I went to a doctor, 
And they said it was my thyroid, 
And that I'd be fine.
Soon after,
He went back to the baby mama, 
And a week later,
I got on a plane to move back with my mom.
My depression emedietly came back,
But I had to push through,
And keep my head up.
I was in that state for five months,
It was hell.
About three months in,
He messages me,
My body felt like I was on fire,
The resident I was helping, 
Was blind,
But could tell that my mood switched.
He gave me the strength to talk to him. 
So I did,
And got a ""I'm sorry,""
And for a second chance. 
I agreed,
But let him know,
This time is the last time. 
He understood, 
And two months later,
I moved back to my home state. 
I dont know what's going for me as of now,
But hopefully all goes well,
And I'll be fine.",27Nov2019,1
4,"Ive struggled with this kind of depression on and off for a couple years I know that I'm not just a lazy person because I have been able to work very very hard at things in the past but I have been unemployed since halloween and I am having real trouble doing even the basics. I am living with my parents at the moment and they have been beyond amazing to me and I really really want to just get a job and stop being a burden on them but for some reason I really have trouble getting myself to stop procrastinating and I've only applied to like 10 jobs since I quit my last job a month ago (It was a horrible job so I do not regret quiting). I rarely make food for myself which causes me to lose weight and I was already underweight before I became unemployed. I feel so ashamed of myself, every time I start to do something productive I start to worry I'm going to do it wrong and so I stop doing it then I feel worse and go procrastinate on reddit so I feel better for .02 seconds then I feel worse for procrastinating. How do I change these destructive habits? I really want to be a better person and not be the reason my parents are stressed out but every time I try to change I just fail and go back to the same routine of procrastination. BTW sorry for my bad grammar I'm just typing what I'm thinking.",27Nov2019,1
6," A little over a year ago I hit a wall with my depression and decided I had to do something. I had recently turned 30 and didn't want to spend the next decade like I had the last one. I could barely function and had lost all motivation to do anything. I mean, my bar was low. I wasn't trying to be superwoman or anything remotely extravagant. Just a normal person who could provide for herself, enjoy her hobbies, and socialize with her friends. 

So I took time off work to start the process of seeing a therapist and look into medicine, if that was the right thing for me. And let me say, trying to get help and traversing the mental health system is the most frustrating thing I've ever done. I've had appointments cancelled just days ahead of time after waiting a couple months to go. You think you've finally found the right doctor because they're not too far of a drive, but then they don't take your insurance and won't let you pay out of pocket... or they're just not accepting new patients at all. The most recent let down, which I guess led to this rant, is that I had an appointment scheduled today, but was cancelled yesterday because the doctor unexpectedly quit. So that's neat and probably not a very good sign.

And while certainly no one's fault, the stop and start roulette spin of trying to find the right medicine is exhausting.

It's just excruciating to try and weave through this obstacle course of phonecalls and paperwork when the entire reason you're doing this is to feel better because you don't feel like doing the most mundane of acts and are passively hoping that you'll get T-boned the next time you're driving somewhere.

What a defeating feeling it is to stand up and say, ""I need help!"", forcing yourself out of your comfort zone, and just getting nowhere. I'm depressed about my depression.

Thank you for attending my pity party. There are no party favors.",27Nov2019,1
7,"I'm strongly considering going on antidepressants, however the majority of my social life is centered around going out with friends and colleagues and getting drunk off our asses, and if I do go on antidepressants, well, my main issues are centered around feelings on abandonment and isolation, so my main concern going on them is that the feelings will take over and I'll just isolate myself completely, thereby negating the effects of the drugs, does anyone else have experience in antidepressants? how did you maintain a social life when you couldn't go out anymore? how did you cope with the lessened opportunities to go out and enjoy yourself?",27Nov2019,1

9," On social media, I noticed that someone was really struggling. They were saying very depressing things and appeared to have suicidal thoughts. I do not know this person and we have never spoken before. But I care for people  who are struggling and I wanted to show him that he isn't alone. I wanted to give him strength to power through his struggles, so I sent him a quick message. Did I say the right things? I don't really know how to  approach situations like this. Here is what I said:

""Hey, I've noticed that you've been struggling a lot recently and I am concerned. I know that we are complete strangers who've never talked  before, but I just wanted to tell you that I support you. While I don't know exactly what you are going through and in no way can exactly understand your struggles, I want you to know that there are people like  me who support you and I am always here to listen to you if you need someone to rant or talk to. You are important and you do not walk alone.  I'm not aiming to fix all your problems through this simple message, I know I can't do that. But I wanted to give you encouragement and let you know that you can power through these obstacles. I am always here. ""

10,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for almost 7 years now. I’m at the point in my life where I truly can’t handle it anymore. It has taken over my life and ruined me in many ways. However, I’m worried about reaching out for help. My physician has been a family friend since my birth and I worry what they will think of me. Whether they will lose respect for me or not. I worry about medicine making me fat or killing my sex drive. I worry about it not working. I worry that if I eventually stop, I will spiral back into my old mental ways and it could possibly get worse. I’ve thought about CBD oil or products, but due to my job, if THC was found in my blood, I would be fired. It is legal within my state, but my job is not tolerant.

12,"Starting off this by saying in NO WAY am I at risk of hurting myself. I might have low points but I will NEVER turn to suicide or self harm. And I'm not putting down people that do, I get how that feels, but for me it hasn't been an option. 

Recently my ex of almost a year broke up with me to date the girl he told me not to worry about... Turns out that he has loved her for more than half our relationship. He finally decided to break up with me three days before our one year for her... Since then, they have been in a three month relationship. He seems as happy as can be, meanwhile I'm struggling. 

The first few weeks of the breakup I was struggling going to a well paying job I had at the time. It got to the point where I couldn't go to work or even classes without crying. Then, I decided to quit because I couldn't focus on work because I was so heartbroken and overwhelmed from working two jobs. 

Fast forward a couple months, I thought I was in a better place. But recently, I have started slacking at my favorite job and in my college courses. I just feel so lost, and have lost love for my passions. I have been going to therapy for my anxiety but never was able to gain the courage to talk about how sad/depressed I am. 

I don't know what the point of this post is but I'm hoping that someone can tell me that it does get better. Because right now I am considering dropping out. I already stopped showing up to my favorite job (pretending that I'm sick and probably on the verge of getting fired) and started skipping my classes more. I feel like I can't talk to my family because they won't understand. All I do all day is sleep and eat one or two meals a day depending on how long I sleep. 

I would tell my work about my mental struggles, but I feel like if I tell them the real reason that I have been skipping that they'll judge me or won't have sympathy/empathy for me.

13,"You have to understand. I was the girl who did all the right things growing up. Never drank smoked, slept around, went to church, the works. 
However, I made one bad choice and it has dominated and ruined my life. 
I have struggled with depression my whole life. But since ‘the choice’, my depression has spiraled out of control to the point to where I can’t handle anymore. 
My family has moved away, I am getting divorced, losing my job, physical health depleting; a lot at once. 
So, I reach out for solace from my husband and my parents. They left me and literally said, “if you can’t beat this, we can’t deal with you anymore” 
How do they think that I feel? That I choose to live with this? 
My parents and husband have done everything for me, they truly are wonderful people, but they have never dealt with depression so they don’t understand suicidal thoughts and so on and so forth. 
So, I sought therapy. I did however lie about suicidal thoughts because I heard about the terrors of being forcibly hospitalized. 
I opened up, but each therapist seemed to just be there physically and not mentally. I opened up about everything else, but it was always the same cookie cutter answers and “coping strategies”.
I have sought help from one person after another. But one thing in common from every person, not one truly cared. Or if they do, they can’t handle the truth. That I’m not getting better. So I fake to the best of my ability to them now because I don’t want to lose them. 
But, I am dying everyday I am awake. When it gets to the point to where I can feel myself winding down and unable to fake, I make excuses to leave and then deal with myself.  
If the closest people who love me more than anything in the world can’t handle me? 
If my therapists tune out? 
What else do I do? 
I’m not trying to seek attention. I seek answers. 
I’m no longer living. I’m just dying slowly.

17,"(22f) I'm in a rough spot mentally and it's just getting worse. Depression has come and gone since i was young, normally its easy enough to manage until its over, but this has been much longer than normal. I feel like I'm drowning and can't get back to the surface for air. I don't like talking about whats wrong or on my mind, which makes working with therapist difficult, ive had about 6 different therapists over 12 years, even tried things like Better Help. 

I'm a full time employee and student. I did look into therapy again but anyone covered by my insurance only has openings during my work hours. I don't currently have the money to afford online therapy again, and kinda want to look for something else since therapy/talking isn't quite my speed. I don't even like talking to my friends or family. I've tried writing but that doesn't bring any relief or clarity.

I'm in a really bad place mentally. It's getting harder for me to sleep and eat, I'm waking up after about 3 hours and have a hard time getting back to sleep. I am probably only eating a meal a day right now. I'm struggling emotional and pushing people away. I'm trying not too but i just feel miserable when I'm out with anyone now. I haven't yet, but i keep wanting to go back to self-harming but I just tell myself that's not going to help either and try to avoid things that trigger that behavior.

20,"Hello, I'm 23 at the present moment, I've been on therapy and antidepressants for almost three years, had some highs and bearable lows through this time, but I had some ""breakdowns"" that really feel worse each time it comes around, like a never-ending cycle, and I'm passing through one right now.

I feel helpless, unable to reach out to anyone either because they don't care, or they just don't know how to help me and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like my mood naturally pushes them away.

I don't know if I want to hear anyone say ""hey pal, this is temporary, you'll feel better later"" because this also means that I will feel like this again in the future too, and I just need it to stop once and for all, I don't know if I can fight much longer.",27Nov2019,1
21,"What does it mean when a depressed ex says they want space?

My ldr gf of about 1.5 years broke up with me 3 days ago. She said it was nothing I did but that she’s bad with relationships, loses interest quickly, guessed she didn’t want to be in a relationship, needed time for herself and thought she needed to be alone maybe forever, that I deserved better and that she didn’t just want to be with me hanging on just Incase she developed feelings again or got better. She struggles with heavy depression and isn’t really getting help but has managed it herself in the past to a degree. Anyways I’m hurt but I’ve accepted it. I would like to attempt a respark when the time is right, we had a pretty solid relationship until things started going downhill about the first week of October and ever sense then it was downhill. I’d like to attempt a respark because I truly see the amazing person she is, and because I did make some errors which I believe caused her to lose interest, such as blaming the downhill slide in our relationship on me being a bad bf, or too often telling her it’s gonna be alright or too often bringing up her depression when I should’ve just listened and validated her feelings but let her know I supported her etc. 

I’m mostly wondering if what she means is she really wants space or to be alone or if she feels that way but secretly doesn’t want that? We’ve texted and Snapchat occasionally, I give some time in between answers and she does too. Before we broke up she said she didn’t want to be near people, didn’t answer her friends or what to be with her family really. I do believe that a lot of it is her depression but also that I kind of took her for granted and I’m working on bettering that part of myself now Incase the chance arises. Is it a total waste to try to get her back? Does she even want that? She’s happy to be friends but should I truly just give her space and see if she comes back or whatever? I’m just a bit lost about the next steps.",27Nov2019,1
22,"I don't know how I am still going. My parents got divorced when I was 4, and my dad has struggled with alcoholism for as long as I can remember. My dad tells me my mom wasn't around when I was young, but I don't really remember her being around when I was young. Now everything is great, my dad only has a drunk outburst every few months, and my mom and dad see me equally. When my dad is drunk, he tells me how worthless I am and htere have been times where I had to leave my house because I don't feel safe. He would never hurt me but it makes me extremely uncomfortable being around him when he is like that. When I was 10, my dad and I moved into our new house with my new stepmom. At first she was great, but I soon realized I would have to get used to them screaming at each other every night. The police were called multiple times. When I was 14, they began the process of getting a divorce. She got the police involved and my dad and I weren't allowed to be in our own home. I spent a lot of time at my moms house during this time. Watching my dad being baraged and hurt by her was one of the hardest things I've had to go through. Don't get me wrong, I have a wonderful dad, but it's only when he is drunk that he isn't the best. Now they are divorced and I live with my parents equally, so that is good I guess. I have also experienced 3 family deaths within the last 4 years, which hasn't been easy. When I was 14 I got a boyfriend, which is something I had been trying to do for years. It was great at first, but he eventually showed his true side. He yelled at me and told me I was a horrible person, and pressured me into doing sexual things I wasn't comfortable with. I feel liek a whore for giving in. He would get mad and I was too young to know how to get him to stop. He was 17 when I was 14, my mom told me to date him. Dating him ruined most of my friendships, which was very difficult for me. My old 'friends' would yell at me in the hallways at school and were suddenly very hostile. Shortly after I turned 15, he broke up with me. I was very very dependant on him, so it basically broke me. A week or two after he ended things, I attempted suicide. I ended up spending a month in a mental hospital, which impacted my grades a lot. I was put on antidepressants which made me numb, and after I got out, I was told I was transferring schools. I didn't have much say in this. I was cutting regularily, but I was going to a private Christian school, which meant I would have to stop. As soon as I transferred, I wasn't allowed to see my old friends anymore. I soon found a new boyfriend, who ended up breaking up with me once school ended, which hurt. Now I have to see him at school with his new girlfriend whom he treat a million times better than he ever treated me. I don't know how I am still going, it just seems like I  have gone through a lot more than most 16 year olds. How do I forget the past and keep going? I don't know what to do? Btw thank you so much to anyone who bothered to read this monologue, it means a lot.",27Nov2019,1
23,"I have had depression since I was a little kid and being bullied ruthlessly. I tried to commit suicide 3 times between 5th&amp;7th grade. I have struggled with weight issues and self esteem issues. I graduated high school with a promise that my future would be different. Spent the next decade getting my undergraduate degree and working full time. I struggled every step of the way and frankly, should have been kicked out of school. Once I graduated, I thought things would finally change. But they haven't. I'm now facing tens of thousands of dollars in debt between school and credit card debt. With the holidays and my wedding coming up, I'm petrified that I will never get out of this hole. I feel immobilized by everything and it reaffirms my thoughts as a kid that life is just not going to be what I want. I don't know why I'm posting here, but I don't want to keep burdening my fiance or my family with my issues anymore. I already feel like a massive burden on those around me. Sorry for the ramble. I'll probably delete this later today.",27Nov2019,1
24,"Heyo, I'm from the UK, I'm 20M, idk how long I've been depressed for, don't really remember not being depressed if that counts. I've been trying to do better, but it's really hard. I had some councling with my uni and that helped, but I ran out of sessions about a year ago and idk how to get help from a doctor. Like I know how, you phone up and ask for an appointment then it goes from there, but I can't seem to bring myself to phone. It just feels wrong
I find asking for help really difficult, it took me my whole life to ask from the uni, but I can't seem to muster the feeling to phone the doctor. Any of you have the same feeling? Any of you find a way around? 
Thanks if you do :)

25,I started taking medication for depression a few years ago until my psychiatrist and I found that velafaxine was actually bringing me up emotionally. It didn't seem to be enough so she added lithothyronine with good results. However I've always had a huge drowsiness reaction to antidepressants and a few weeks ago it started to get worse. I've been sleeping almost 12 hours every day... So I'm taking a third medication; modafinil. It has helped me get rid of the sleepiness before so I was sure it would work this time. It didn't. So I just want to know if anyone out there has a similar experience with antidepressants and drowsiness and how you dealt with it. Not looking for a prescription but I'm feeling quite desperate. 'Wasting' my day like this only contributes to feeling bad so I want it to stop.,27Nov2019,1
26,"Hi everyone, I don’t know if this is the right place but I really need some advice right now. 

My husband is seriously depressed and struggling with feelings of self worth and that his life is worthwhile. Flare ups like this have happened in the past where we go through a rough few weeks but this seems even more extreme than normal. 

Ive been supportive in every way I can think of but I’m at my end of how much more I can do. Luckily he’s started therapy but it doesn’t seem to be helping yet and I’m trying to take as much of the household burdens off him as I can so he can focus on himself. Plus giving him all of the time and energy as I can. The main problem is that I can’t be there all the time (my job demands a lot of travel) so it’s really hard when I’m not physically there all the time. 

Does any one have any suggestions on how I can be more supportive? Or what I can do when I’m physically there vs away?

TIA",27Nov2019,1

28,"I’m 24 &amp; I feel extremely lost. I’ve had over 20 jobs in the past 2 years. It started out due to my anxiety &amp; getting overwhelmed so I’d just up and quit. Now it’s 2019 and I just quit another job which leaves me depressed which equals a never ending cycle. I feel like I’m legit ruining my life. I have no money, just bought a car (impulsive move for the 100th time) and now I’m jobless. I keep repeating the cycle of quitting my job because I either get super unmotivated or super un-fulfilled and unhappy. I’ve been seeing a therapist for 3 years now and I feel like I should be stable and on track. I’ve just gotten my medication changed to a mood stabilizer so I hope it works because nothing motivates me. Idek what I want in life anymore. I sit in my house thinking constantly about how unhappy I am, how obese I am, yet I just eat nonstop, quit my jobs&amp; sulk in my misery. None of my hobbies excite me anymore.

31,"Does anyone else get completely exhausted the holidays? Not just normal exhaustion obviously. I only have so many spoons (energy) and having to be in social situations really drains me.

My fiance is close with his family and I really like them. I also really love his/our nieces. But spending the whole day with them is exhausting and thinking about it feels daunting.  I feel like a bad person because I just want to cocoon on many holidays and he wants to be with family.

There have several times (not holidays) where I have not attended family get togethers because of my depression. My fiance just tells everyone i am ""sick"" and ""not feeling well."" But I hate feeling like a disappointment...

Anyone experience something similar? Or have advice?",27Nov2019,1

34,"So I’ve never been one to vent or one to share my story to others just because I’m scared that people might judge me in a way that might hurt me! But I’ve built up the courage to tell my story and to see what other may think about where I’m at in my life. Get ready because it’s a road that may touch you or offend you. So I worked for Lowe’s for about 7 years. I’ve been on my own since I was 15. I’ve never been given anything in life. I’ve worked for everything I’ve ever owned. In 2012 I was forced by a store manager at Lowe’s to lift 80 to 100 pound block out for a compactor in witch doing so in 118 degree weather I heard a crackle from my neck to my tale bone crack. Right their and than I knew something was wrong. Mind you working for the company for 7 years I had over 200 hours of sick time and was 2 I. Regional sales I decided to file a workman comp claims even knowing that management fronded on because it hit the bottom line. For most people that do not know Lowe’s is a self insured company by Sedgwick meaning they pay out all cost. So by doing so and being in management after 2 weeks I was fired. This was in 2012. Since than I have not work and have had 5 spinal surgeries. I’ve even had to pay for my own surgery because a ime doctor said he believed I didn’t need it after the fact I had the surgery. In 7 years the most medication I’ve been on is 12 different medications at once. I was taking about 800 meds a month. All this had lead up to extremes repression. In fact so much that I tried to kill my self because was in so much pain.  It didn’t work. But the funny thing was most people that care about quality of life would care for a person that tried to take his life that had 2 kids. Not Lowe’s. In fact opposing counsel just wrote a email saying “what’s up with that” I guess I’m telling this story because for the past 11 month I’ve been in so much pain trying to fight for my life waiting, hopping for surgery. Hopping that Lowe’s would just approve it but they didn’t. In fact we have had to go to court to have a judge to decide on it. For the the past 2 years I’ve tried to settle my case full and final. For those that don’t know full and final means that Lowe’s will no longer be responsible for my medical or work any mor but yet they refuse to do so. Even if I co to use to tell them all I want to use the money for is for medical conditions. My depression has gotten so bad now that I’ve pushed everyone away. My phone no longer rings, I no longer receive text. If I died today no one would know. No one really care about my story. But I’m telling it anyways because depression is a real and should not  looked over when someone says they suffer from depression. This is my story this is my life and these are the the people that have not cared about quality of life. Lisa Lamont mailto:llamont@klbllaw.com.

I've definitely been aware that I've been emotionally abused for years. Yet, I can't imagine my life without him and I feel like I love him. There are good things and I stick to them. It's like he's kind of..gotten rid of everything else in my life that makes me happy - my friends, ect so I have to depend on him. That's gotta be a sign of npd, right? Guess I wouldn't know, I have no right to assume anything. 

Right now I'm at a point of severe depression.

I try my best to be nice and considerate all the time, but I'm told that I'm mean and rude everyday, It hurts me a lot to know/be told that im a horribly rude person. It breaks me

 I don't feel worthy of anything.

 I'm always wrong in everything I do. -Doesn't even have to be about the relationship, I'm just wrong.

I'm crying and hurting all the time

I'm lashing out emotionally and misunderstanding/being misunderstood all the time
