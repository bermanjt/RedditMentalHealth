0,"I‚Äôm a 23 year old mother, I have a wonderful husband, a nice house and a well paid job. Apart from a heavily traumatic past I have nothing to be sad about. But I am sad, really sad. I never want to do anything anymore, I cry all the time, I have serious thoughts of cutting myself and even thoughts of suicide. I even have moments where I feel like I‚Äôm watching my life not actually part of it if that makes sense. I wouldn‚Äôt commit suicide, because I couldn‚Äôt do that to my daughter. I don‚Äôt want her to grow up thinking that her mummy would rather die than be with her. But I sort of wouldn‚Äôt mind if I had a fatal accident, which is a terrible thing to say/ feel but I honestly think it would be better that way... 

I don‚Äôt know why I feel this way, there‚Äôs no reason, I just do. I feel useless and worthless and hideous and just terrible. How do I go about getting help when I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs wrong? It sounds ridiculous. I just don‚Äôt know üòî ",06Mar2019,2
1,"I was wondering if anyone else has any advice after going through the same thing. I‚Äôm currently at university over 100 miles away from home, I‚Äôve been here almost 7 months and I still have no friends.  I came to uni optimistic about meeting new people as I‚Äôve moved from a small town to a large city. The problem is I‚Äôm very introverted and although my course makes me interact with people I don‚Äôt really say anything off topic of our work. I‚Äôm so lonely as I‚Äôm used to seeing my friends at home every day and I‚Äôve gone from that to having no one to talk to. Should I consider transferring to a uni closer to home or does anyone have any tips on how to make friends and be more outgoing. At this point I‚Äôve just gotten so sad the thought of having a conversation with someone sends me into a panic. Thank you in advance to anyone who responds ",06Mar2019,3
3,"Hello

So my whole adult life I have had periods of extreme motivation and prolonged periods, sometimes years, when I would just be turned off emotionally and motivationally. Some of my friends have been diagnosed with severe depressive disorders and they say I remind them of themselves. 

I want to start writing a diary of my mental state to habe some clarity of my situation and to help the doctor.

What sort of information should o write about? What should I pay attention to?

I'm working on coping with PTSD and an eating disorder. Once you mention ED, it seems like everyone backs away.

6,"I feel as though I‚Äôm invisible or just an after thought of everybody including my own family. Until my sister moved out I was rarely told anything important by my parents. It just seemed that they would forget that I was there. At every family event I would be by myself and every so often would actually be with someone.

I just feel like everyday gets worse and worse. It‚Äôs like as I get happy, something else happens so that I‚Äôm just back to being sad. 

Being a senior in High School makes everything worse because you see everybody being happy and talking with someone as you are sad and walking by yourself. I‚Äôve only had one person actually come up and ask if I was okay in the entire time I‚Äôve been in school. Your teachers tell you to be in a group of 2 or 3 but nobody ever wants to be in a group with you. 

Sorry for rambling, I just had to get some of the stuff I‚Äôm dealing with off my chest to try and feel better",06Mar2019,4
7,"Told my husband I was depressed and thought about hurting myself.... he took me to the park to walk around while he hung out with his friends for a few hours, because ‚Äúgetting out of the house and in the sun would be good for me‚Äù 
Even though he was hanging out with his friends and I just followed them around quietly. 

He still hasn‚Äôt said one thing to me about what I said and is acting like normal. I don‚Äôt think he really cares about me. He tells me he does more than I know but he‚Äôs in the living room watching tv while I sit alone again secretly crying. 

I feel like I‚Äôve tried to reach out and tell him I‚Äôm sad and miserable and I‚Äôve told him I think somethings wrong and I need help but he does nothing, he doesn‚Äôt even talk to me about it. 

I feel so alone and when I try to reach out and talk to him it just makes me feel more depressed. Like why would I think anyone would care. He‚Äôs probably so annoyed by me. 

I‚Äôm being tested for Lupus. The doctor said he‚Äôs pretty sure I have it and I‚Äôve been so scared and just not feeling well and I try to talk to him about it too but I think I just annoy him.

22,"So,
Last night I watch the ""Leaving Neverland"" documentary with my mother. This hit me very hard because I was manipulated and sexually abused from when I was really young until I was 13 years old by my grandfather. When I watched it, I was like looking in a mirror of what happened to me. I believe that it helped me and here is why.

When I was a kid, I was constantly bullied and had no friends whatsoever. I was facing my parents divorcing and physical and sexual abuse at home since we lived with my Grandfather. He knew how to manipulate me because I would escape from reality on a computer. I would play games, watch Youtube, etc. So, he would let me on the computer if I let him do things to me. I was so addicted to the one thing that made me happy that I would let him do it. However, I did tell my mom for years that this was going on and she didn't listen to me. 

Then, when we moved and had no computer with no internet he'd manipulate me more than ever. I felt so sickened with myself. I still do. I feel so disgusting as a person. I struggle to this day.

 Well, when watching this documentary, the victims explained that Michael Jackson would shower them with toys, records, etc. and one even said he would do sexual favors for jewelry. He was only 10 years old. He was manipulated by an older man by the thing that made him happy.

 I was astonished. I have felt so ashamed and disgusted with myself for so many years. It was nice to feel that I wasn't alone. 

When I came out about my abuse when I was 13 years old to a doctor, I begged her not to tell my step mom. I didn't want to break my family apart. I didn't want to ruin my family. She said I had to or she was going to, so I chose to tell her. So after my dad and step mom found out, he was charged with sexual abuse and guess who wasn't on my side... My own mother. She said if I was abused, why would I go over there so much after we moved.
So, I wasn't allowed to see my mother for a bit and I had separation anxiety towards my mother at the time so I broke down.

In that documentary, those kids wanted to return to Michael because they were showered with gifts and his attention even though he was sexually abusing them. So, I hoped she watched that documentary with understanding to why I always wanted to go back. I was manipulated like how those children were. I felt and feel a little less alone and a little less disgusting.

My grandfather killed himself in jail and my grandmother died three weeks later from cancer. I think that is what gets me the most now. I feel like me coming out killed my family. My family is officially broken and it was all because of me. My uncles treat my mom bad (Not because of the abuse, but they are just bad people in general) and what kept us as a family was my grandmother. I have yet to fully forgive my mother, but I still love her. I live with her now and as we do not get along really, but I love her and she is not physically well nor mentally well. I am 23 now and it have almost been 10 years since I brought up my abuse to a doctor which happened in September. I hope someday I will be able to fully move on.

i have anxiety, depression and anorexia and i‚Äôm in a pretty bad slump rn. im in therapy and on meds and stuff but i‚Äôve started to abuse my ADHD meds because they suppress my appetite but they also make me very flat emotionally and numb me out a bit. I‚Äôm
taking double my prescribed dose (40mg Vyvanse which isn‚Äôt a dangerous amount so medically it‚Äôs fine) pretty much daily and I‚Äôm starting to see physical side effects (shakey, fast heart rate etc).

I go to therapy once a week and this morning she told me she was going away and won‚Äôt be here the next 2 sessions. my mom is also going away next week so i‚Äôll be completely alone at home and won‚Äôt have anyone to keep me accountable for anything.
