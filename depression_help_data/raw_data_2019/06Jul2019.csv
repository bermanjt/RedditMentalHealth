0,"Hello, 

I decided to sign up here because I am struggling with how to ask for help. 

I have had depression for my whole life. Trauma as a teen and young adult did not help. 

At this time I am very highly functioning and have received a lot of support. 

I went to therapy for years and have done CBT, as well as Psychodynamic talk therapy. Both helped. 

Now, I'm 32. I guess I thought it would get easier, and I'm experiencing a lower low than I ever had that seems to be spiraling by the month as I realize that no: it is not getting easier as I get older. 

There isn't a breakthrough, there is just this treadmill of life where I have to consistently work through all of the ""tools"" I've learned over the years and use willpower to stick to healthy coping mechanisms. 

Eat right, don't drink, get exercise daily, have proper sleep habits (even if I feel a hypomanic episode coming on- force myself to go to bed and do relaxation exercises). 

At this point I have also recognized my unhealthy ""drama/distraction"" old habits and I abstain from those as well- making smart and careful social choices. 

No one knows that every day I feel so fucking sad. 

I don't want to complain, because I know how much it can damage relationships. 

I crave intimacy and care. 

But I know that if I really let people in, that they will become burned out by my constant darkness. 

I'm considered the most optimistic person, among my friends. I work hard at non-judgement, holding space for others, positive framing. 

I try to be of service to my community and I volunteer with local arts non-profits, when I'm not working. 

I try to be as kind and positive with my family as I can. 

I just want the pain to subside. I need a break. I'm so exhausted. 

I tried medication earlier this year, I went on Welbutrin and after six weeks I was still experiencing constant headaches, auditory symptoms, brain fog, and I didn't really feel ""better."" 

It was so discouraging, but caused me to realize that I have no choice but to double down on the holistic treatments, no alcohol, be mindful of stress, be kind to myself as much as possible. 

I don't know what to do. I want and need a break from this treadmill. 

I'm afraid to tell loved ones what I'm dealing with. I don't want to complain- I'm grateful for everything I have in life and I do have a very good life.

It makes me feel self-centered and ungrateful to say this ""out loud,"" but I also feel like I'll explode if I don't say it: I'm incredibly sad, I don't like anything about myself, I hate myself right now, I'm not proud of anything I've done, I feel ugly, I am lonely, I am in pain. 

Thanks for listening/ reading. 

I'm open to advice. I'm also grateful to just have a space to be honest about how I'm feeling.",06Jul2019,3

2,Recently been thinking about going to my doctor and asking about some of my anxiety or thoughts that some people have told me is indicative of depression. But I don’t know if I want to be prescribed antidepressants as I feel they may have fairly negative did effects. I unfortunately also feel that therapy seems like a waste of time and money. My main question is how much do antidepressants help actual depression and how much do they help anxiety and what are usually the side effects.,06Jul2019,1

4,I feel like I have to do this anonymously because just how much I feel like a burden. I feel so lost right now. I just graduated college and I feel like there’s nothing else in my life to look forward to. I have a decent job but it’s really slow all the time. I’m good friends with the owner so I feel like I’m trapped and can’t find a different job even if I wanted to. And even if I did what the hell am I gonna do? This kind of depression usually only hits me in the winter. I feel at a loss. My boyfriend is so supportive of me but  I’m tired of constantly leaning on him for support. I just have no motivation to do anything right now. I’m not hungry but when I do eat I eat a lot because it’s the only thing that I can latch on to. I’m craving attention so bad and feel really needy. My family doesn’t talk to me so I don’t have anyone else I can reach out to. I do talk to one of my family members but again I just don’t want to talk to anyone who is close to me because I feel like it’s going to push them away further if I tell them how much of a hard time I’m having. I don’t know if just saying this anonymously to a random group is going to help but any encouragement would be amazing.  I’m not really feeling suicidal but I have no way of knowing if I could get to that point if I don’t feel better. I don’t self harm. I really appreciate any kind words. Thank you so much,06Jul2019,1
5,"Hi everyone so I am just done. I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.

More than anything in the world I want to feel love. I want to fall deeply in love with a girl and care about her more than anything. I feel as if I finally took a stand to this cold world and was pushed down farther than I was before. I was once full of hope for the future and excited for what could be and now I am completely hopeless. This girl is going to the same community college as me next year and I just hope that I will get another chance then to make up for what I should have done in the past. I care about her so much it makes me sick. I just feel like I will never find something like this again in my life or will have able to have the same happiness from it. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do and how to forgive myself for my past. Thanks so much!",06Jul2019,1
6,"Narcissistic father that always put extreme pressure, guilty and shame on me for everything that I did that he did not liked, even with me always being ""a good and quiet kid"" in the eyes of everybody. I no longer live with him, but still he feels the need to pointed out, in the few times that he sees me, about how much weight I've gained and I ""shouldn't be a coward"" right after my psychologist talked to him about the serious risk of suicide and how I was in a very bad mental state. Refuses to offer any significant help to pay medical expenses for ""being in debt"", despite having a very good salary for the standard of my country.
Living with my unstable and emotionally dependent mother, that resents my father for having divorced from her almost two years ago and for his actions towars her, my older brother and me. Has being more involved with her religion, but in a unhealthy way.
Both of them rarely had friends and clearly have psychology issues that they refuse do deal with.
Born and living in a country with economic crisis for years. Very bad political climate, with scandals arising almost everyday. Main parties with populist tendencies, while most of people has very poor understanding about politics.
Never had any kind of relationship with another person, be serious or casual. Always extremely shy in any ambient, have few friends. 
Melancholic since I was a children, having many episodes of depression since my teenage years. Always had the feeling that something was wrong with me, barely had dreams about my future and being happy in general. Almost without things, hobbies or places that interest me, getting worst after the start of my college degree (in a area that my father put big pressure to get in since childhood).
I like to make poems, read and talk about politics, philosophy and economy, listen to music, watch Netflix and football (soccer for usa readers), but even trying to do those things it's hard because of lack of attention, energy, motivation and concentration.
Most of the time everything feel worthless, like everything and everyone are rotten by nature and a positive outlook is pure illusion. Never used drugs, barely drink alcohol and rarely have impulse problems, being able to always exercise self awareness, self reflection and self control about my actions (probably on a unhealthy level)
Any help about how to learn to have more positive feelings and view about life, create new meanings to things?

7,I work at taco bell and this guy was at the window liked so much like one of the teachers I had in highschool. He was the nicest person I ever met off a year I just about lived in his classroom. I would get to school at about six and he would get there at about 7:30 and I would stay there until it was time to get to my first class at 8:10. I had his class right before lunch so I would always stay during lunch so I would be there for another hour. Then I had study halls e last to periods of my day so I would go there for an hour and forty minutes before school ended and he would let me stay there until four most nights but on Tuesdays and Thursdays he hosted games club so I could stay there until 5:30. When I started that year I was kind off delusional. It seemed like there was just a plot to keep me unaware of how much I'm hurting the people I care about. I was really suicidal so I it seemed like at any moment I could let something slip and I'd end up locked up somewhere forever. Everything was a haze. I can't remember most of it and I couldn't then either. I could always ask him what was going on and he'd explain it to me very patiently and clearly. He quickly became the person I became the most worried about hurting but he also felt like the source of stability that it was hard to believe that he wouldn't be able to handle something. I've graduated and for the most part I can get what I need to do done but every once in a while I remember how things comforting and safe things were and I just become so useless.,06Jul2019,1
8,"When I ask to join a server with all my old friends who disliked me, I get a blatant ""fuck no"" from probably all the moderators. Everyone there is my friend, and I just want to feel happy again when being with my old friends.

I know I hurt my friends emotionally, but I've changed and I'm doing better. But... They just won't move on, and them not moving on lead me to doing bad things to myself (cutting, hurting myself, contemplating suicide). My life doesn't feel the same anymore. Discord is my only source of friends, I have no friends IRL, so I look forward to seeing other people. But people decide to be toxic... And just won't leave me alone when I'm trying to move on. 

Yes, I've gotten a few disabilities from trauma. Alexithymia, higher emotional sensitivity, voices in my head, anxiety. It sucks. I wish it would go away.

I wish I had friends. Real ones I could hug and kiss. So I can be happy. My current new friends on Discord think I'm a snowflake because of how sensitive I am, but I always try to explain what I've been through and why I act certain ways.

She's in her late teens, she's part of the LGBTQI+ community and recently (within the last 6 months) came out to my parents, she's at a highly demanding academic summer program and over the past year I've seen her shut down more and more.

Now it's 2 or 3 times a week), she talks to me about feeling empty, overwhelmed and just straight up depressed and while I've done as much as I possibly can. I'm at my wit's end.

15,"  

Apologies in advance for how long this is. I’m not honestly not even entirely sure why I wanted to post this here. I suppose I need to say this somewhere that seems a bit more real than just my brain. Somewhere I can actually hear myself say it rather than just let it go on loop in my head, until all the words lose their meaning and the whole thing ends up drifting away from me like an empty boat aimed at some dark shadowy place out of sight. I’m just afraid that if I don’t really try to say this properly, then it’ll go to that place and this moment will be just one more thing I let float away from me. And I suppose this whole post will probably be as self-absorbed and over-described and rehashed as I’m worried it will sound. Probably even more than that. But I couldn’t give a shit anymore, because more than afraid of what I’m going to sound like, and how I’m coming across, and what people might think of me, more than any of that, I’m just tired. And I’m sad. And I want to get off this ride I’ve been taking myself on for way too long. And I know that probably sounds like a pretty ominous start to a post on a subreddit filled with some pretty ominous posts, but don’t worry, it’s not going to be like that. This ain’t gonna end with someone needing to call an ambulance. Not fucking today. 

But first, an intro.

If you ask me on any other day, I’ll say I see myself as a basically lump of a person. As a meat sack. I imagine myself sometimes as like a piece of soft and sagging flesh, like the human equivalent of that part under the arm that jiggles when you move. And my greatest fear is that I’m going to sit on this couch and waste until I eventually kill myself, or until the world moves on and I’m left sort of stuck here in my own pocket of time. And then I kill myself. And honestly, a lot of the time suicide seems like the best non-solution I’ve got. It’s the one I understand the most. Because where suicide is a small and easy full stop, the other option is something really long and complex and so impossible to understand from where I’m standing that it starts to looks as if there’s just no way it’s possible. That it’s basically beyond me. And this is where it gets really tricky, and this is the part that I need to say to myself. 

But, before I do. I need to stress that this is not at all meant as a comment on anyone else here. Y’all keep doing what you need to do to keep those chins right up high, and don’t let anyone tell you that you aren’t doing otherwise. Because I’m certain everyone here is doing absolutely everything they know how to do to be and get better. So don’t let this little rant of mine feel like another voice of criticism, this is really just a conversation between me and me, one that’s been a long time coming. But anyway. Back to rant.

From what I can see of myself, the real guilt and shame of it all is that there are definitely things I could be doing. Tricky, complex things sure, but still small and manageable things I can do every day that I’m simply not doing. That what feels to me like barely managing to stay afloat is actually surrendering one inch at a time. That what I’m really doing is buying into the depression paradox that I can’t unfuck myself because I’m already so fucked up that it’s going to be impossible to even try to fix it. That I can’t fix my own problems because I’m going to fold when it gets tough. And then, when I do fold, I’m going to cry and hate and blame myself for folding and then use the whole cry/hate/self-blame experience as fuel to beat myself up so bad that I can feel like justice has been served for giving up. That I’ll punish myself on behalf of the depression so it can trick me into feeling justified to say “Stop! Please! I’m already in so much pain, why are you making me do even one thing more.” A sort of you-can’t-hate-me-if-I-hate-myself-more strategy. And therefore I win. Or the depression wins I guess. It wins by having me prove to myself that I’m useless and feckless and that clearly the whole thing is not my fault because when I try to fix myself, I end up being in so pain that I have to stop, and so clearly the whole thing is because of some inherent quality I’ve got. That I’m fundamentally weak. And therefore, that there’s no point even trying.

And this is where the truly evil part occurs, the real grotesque sharp-toothed evil-eyed element of this whole thing, because then I get to believe it. Because I want to believe it. Because then I get to vindicate myself. I am no longer pathetic, a wastrel, not doing enough to help myself and unable to do anything. Instead, I’m damaged. Deformed in some way that’s just too hard to pull apart. Which is bullshit because I know this is just what the shitty black tarred side of my brain wants me to believe. I know what it wants more than anything else is for me to buy so deeply into its power over me that I start believing it is me. That I start doing its job for it. And I’m so fucking done with it. I am seriously **so** fucking done with it. Let me just say that again.

I.

Am.

So.

Fucking.

Done.

With.

It.

I’m done with this pathetic vagrant type of life I’ve been letting myself live, this habit of settling into something and then immediately looking for an exit strategy because I certain it’s not gonna work. I’m done with dipping a toe in and letting the depression convince me that it’s too cold, or it’s not the right colour of blue, or that it’s just not the right time of the year to start trying to fucking fix myself. I’m done with doing the depression’s job for it. And so this is it. This is my promise to myself. I am going to make the depression fucking work for it. And if it wants to kill me, it’s going to have to kill itself first trying to figure out how to do it. I am not its fucking slave. And here are some other things I’m going to do.

I’m gonna keep going to therapy, even if some days it feels like it’s not doing a fucking thing. I’m gonna keep going. 

I’m gonna stop letting the depression tell me that I’m fundamentally damaged. It’s not true. There are, for sure, a lot of things I need to work out, and I’ll do it one step at a time, but I am not incapable of taking those steps.

I’m gonna stop beating myself up when I go for one of those steps and miss. I am not going to punish myself for missing. Not only is that not fair, or even realistic to believe as being possible, but it’s just plain unhelpful in trying to get back up again.

Here are some other things I’m going to do.

I’m gonna mediate more. I’m gonna exercise more. I’m gonna attend to my thoughts more honestly. And, more than anything, I am going to learn how to live for the sake of fucking living and not for the sake of just surviving.

That’s it. Rant over. I’m going to put on some shoes and then go have a smoke outside and try to see if there are any stars out tonight. Then I’m going to go to sleep and wake up and try as hard as I can to remember how I feel right now.",06Jul2019,52

He's so calming. I told him that I self-harm. And he didn't say things like ""Oh just stop. It's useless. Why are you doing that?"" like most of the other people. He tried to find a solution. He was worried about me. I saw how he paniced when I told him that I cut. And to see how someone cares about me helps.

You're a wonderful person

I have so much to talk, but there's just too much bad things happening. 4 days ago I got an illness called ""pneumonia"" and I am trying to recover, I have no clue how it will go. I hope the best for myself cause I want to live in this world and make my hobbies come true... This is just a small part of my life issues... So young, yet so many problems... Feels like I want to cry but I'm on antibiotics right now that prevents my tears to go out. I just wanted to share a small part of my problems in my life with you people.",06Jul2019,3
