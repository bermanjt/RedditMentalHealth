0,"I am scared of going into adulthood. I am 17 and was diagnosed with autism at a very young age. I get extremely overwhelmed and I fear I won't do well in college. I am also very self conscious about everything I do. I belive I am very unattractive no matter how many people say otherwise. I just feel self pity all the time it's just so overwhelming I feel unhappy almost everyday. I seen to annoy people with this state of stupor. When I realize how many autistic people don't have Jobs or end up single or end up dying earlier compared to neurotypical I just feel like shit. Knowing this is something out of my control. Everytime I self stimulated like tapping or flapping my hands this always annoys people. It just crushes me knowing how people see me as a joke or think I'm irritating.

1,"this is a long thing

hi. im 13. ever since i was like 11 ive had a bad week every couple of months where i’ve thought of suicide and such. since about january though, it’s become every single night i’ve thought and done some suicidal stuff. i haven’t ended up in hospital, and nobody has ever noticed this. for the past 2 months it’s just been 24/7 suicidal thoughts. 
the issue here is, i don’t really have the other symptoms of depression (weight loss/gain, not leaving the house, etc) i don’t do the stuff i like to as much though, but it’s not noticeable. i don’t have a good relationship with my parents where i could tell them this stuff. they give me the responsibilities of my parents, but the freedom of a 4 year old. 
i just want help with this stuff, i hate wanting to die but it seems like the only way i could get out of this hell that is my life.

basically, how do i tell my parents (or someone that can help) that i feel like this.",08Jul2019,1
3,"Just a little background, I'm currently in college and have autism, depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD (I was sexually abused when I was 15). I'm also in counseling right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a really loving, supportive family and equally loving and supportive friends. I had a pretty good childhood--I struggled with autism, but my mental health struggles didn't really start until I was 14/15. People say you should be grateful for having that much support in my life, and I am. When I'm really struggling, I keep reminding myself that I have so many amazing people in my life who really love me, but lately, it doesn't feel like it's helping. It feels like no matter how hard I try, no matter what I do to help make myself feel better, I'm just as bad as I was before, if not worse. I don't want to die, but I keep wondering what's the point in trying anymore. Then, I feel really awful and ungrateful for feeling like it's not enough when it should be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so stuck and don't know what to do. Every day I wake up, I feel trapped and hopeless. I notice that I'm more moody and tend to isolate myself more. Family and friends say that they love me, but inside, I feel like such a burden. I feel like it'd be better if I wasn't in their lives anymore, but I know they'd still be in a lot of pain, and I can't do that to them.",08Jul2019,1
6,"Hey guys,

so I'm in the middle of battling my depression and I have found there are several things right now that are helping me keep it together, so I thought I would share in case it might help others on here that don't know where to start on their road to recovery.

1) Have daily rituals. Being in the pits of despair gets worse when every single day blends into the next and lacks structure. I'm not saying have a schedule that is so down the letter it doesn't leave you any freedom; what I'm getting at is more like a tiny list of positive rituals that help evacuate emotion and then come back to a more positive place of positivity and proactive mindset. Three that I find are consistently helping me are journaling (once in the morning and once in the evening - look up the 5 Minute Journal app on Google Play for an excellent example on how to get started), meditating (check out 10% Happier) and working out. When you meditate, actually allow yourself to completely evacuate the emotion, and in your workout, push with everything you got. You will for sure notice a shift in how you feel and in your general approach to life. You'll feel lighter with less anxiety buildup from constantly fighting your emotions instead of caring for them properly.

2) Cut out toxic people from your life. Those individuals that keep kicking you when you're down, treating you like you're worthless, trying to discourage you from going thru with your projects - keep your distances from them or say your goodbyes if they refuse to treat you with the respect that you deserve. Life is far too short and it's already hard enough fighting a war against intrusive thoughts without giving undeserved space to people that refuse to treat you like a fellow human. Sometimes those people can be hard to push away (for example if they're colleagues at work) but tuning them out in one way or another can be a healthy option.

3) Find mentors. When we're in our worst moods it's sometimes difficult to have perspective on where we're at in our lives. So looking to people that have battled their depressions and come out stronger can be an inspiration to move forward and pursue passions. YouTube has a lot of awesome vloggers that literally sometimes help me get out of bed in the morning (bigknowno being one of them). I also look to actors, writers, etc that I admire and follow their careers, watch their interviews, follow their social media etc. It's a way to get the inspiration to change the way you live and the way you use your negative emotions in a positive way to go towards progress.

I hope this has helped someone out there and if you guys need an ear, my inbox is open.",08Jul2019,6
9,"Hi, so I'm a 34 white male living in the U.S. I know that I won the generic lottery, but it doesn't mean that I don't have problems. So if you'll bear with me, I'll try to explain my situation as shortly as possible. 

I've dealt with Depression my entire life it seems. It reared its head at 11/12 &amp; never left. I kept telling myself that ""Things will get better. Life will work out in the end"". That's simply not the case. This depression is crippling, it destroys every desire I have for ambition. I've been treading water &amp; it's all I can do to keep my head above water. So I went to college... then dropped out. I started creative writing... then stopped when i hated what i had written. I make an effort to get my health in check... &amp; my entire life deconstructs &amp; all I have to console myself is food. I'm 358 lbs, my blood pressure recently skyrocketed into hypertension 2 over the last 6 months.

Needless to say, while I am intelligent, not socially awkward (I've worked in customer service &amp; commission sales for 15 years) , caring, considerate, honest, kind, etc. I don't put the best face into the world &amp; I have little to no success romantically. 

So as my 20's rolled by I slowly started realizing life just wasn't going to work out the way I wanted. Just because you're the nice guy doesn't mean you win. Now, I realize in large part my life is not what I would like it to be because of decisions (conscious &amp; subconscious) that I have made. About 5 years ago during a pretty terrible time I said out loud to my best friends (who are all married &amp; have kids) that all I want from life is 2 things. 
#1. To be happy.
#2. To find someone that I can love &amp; that loves me back. 
Still haven't met those 2 things &amp; I'm 34yrs old. I've had my shot at life. I stepped up to the plate &amp; struck out. 

I've only had 1 romantic relationship in the past, and it was bad. It lasted a year and we got together when I was 19. She was emotionally abusive, manipulative, withheld affection, etc. &amp; on top of that she cheated on me numerous times. The reason I bring this relationship up is I am 34 years old, and this is my only experience in a romantic relationship. I've been on dates, I've made friendships, but nobody seems interested in me romantically. I don't think others realize how utterly painful it is to spend your entire adult life without romantic love. No gentle caress, no ""I love you babe, have a great day"", no physical intimacy, &amp; (obviously) no sex. I've had a few one night stands, but those are worthless. There's no emotional connection &amp; no intimacy.

I'm still trying, I'm on 4 different dating apps asking women out. I've been going to therapy for the last 6 months. But it doesn't change the fact that I am sobbing right now as I write this. Or that I want to put a gun in my mouth. I just don't understand why this has to be my burden. Other people don't have to deal with depression this bad. Its destroyed my life and I just want the pain to end.",08Jul2019,6
10,For some background I'm in the military and I just have a hard time finding any kind of anything to do anything outside of work sleep and something mind-numbing to do in between. I've never been to a counselor it's just not something my family have done or probably will do. And I know they say that it's not going to affect my career anyway and no one has to know. But still I wonder. For the longest time I thought I was just lazy but even with the military lifestyle I can't pull myself to do any kind of social interaction or anything outside of the basic necessities. And even then it's tough. I just need help deciding whether or not I should try counseling or therapy or whatever you want to call it.,08Jul2019,1
11,"Things have been going great. I've made decent friends, my gf may have finally found a job after moving away for school, where it's been a struggle for her, I think I may have finally decided on a path to take for school. 

I hate everything. I feel so ashamed of myself for not having things where they need to be, or should be at this point. 

Since my GF moved away, communication has been scarce. The area she lives in is terrible for any kind of service, and apparently her phone has problems connecting to anything and everything (we have the same phone but she's a complete moron technologically. Conversely, I burn microwave noodles where she cooks beautifully) and it makes contact hard. I have no self confidence. Haven't had it in years. Hell, I made this shitty alt so no one would piece together who I am because I feel like I'd be a burden on them. 

Of my friends, the ones I've started hanging out with, I don't have a lot of contact with outside of one night a week. My online friends, Q, as I'll refer to him, is a good guy, but doesn't seem to take a lot of things seriously, even though we've had deeper conversations. R and T are good, but not usually available because of work/life reasons. G doesn't have a lot of life experience and can't offer much in terms of help. M is on vacation, and I don't feel like I should be attempting to bother him when he's supposed to be having fun. 

My problem is that I feel like no matter what the scenario is, I'm intended to fuck up. Any chance I do get to talk with my GF usually ends up with her getting upset or mad at me. She's incredibly strong willed, but I disagree with her on certain issues. It causes us to butt heads, but she's been the best I've ever been with in terms of how shes treated me. 

I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to do or say something stupid that makes her not want to be with me. I can't shake the feeling that my choice to pursue in life is stupid and that I'm a fool for even considering it. I can't shake the feeling that I'm already too far behind in life to even start making a difference. I don't know what to do. I feel like talking about it with people I know isn't the right path because I would just bother them, but I can't keep it in. Even as I type this, I consider just deleting it and forgetting the whole thing to keep trying to handle it alone. 

This post is a complete disaster from start to finish, but my mind isn't exactly a calm puddle, it's a chaotically roaring and waving ocean of discontent. Nothing feels like the right choice. 

I feel like I've done nothing but cry for attention, but I constantly suffer alone. And more context is probably needed for everything, but I just don't know what to do.",08Jul2019,1
12,"So I'm 17 and non-binary, I have a wonderful boyfriends who has already graduated highschool and lives 2 hours away.

I'm scares he will find someone better and leave me since we don't see each other super often and he will be meeting new people.

My home life is a mess and my parents are overbearing religious fanatics who give me no privacy and almost put me into a conversion camp when they suspected i was gay. They don't know I'm nonbinary and I dont think I'll ever tell them. My meds aren't working as good as before and i feel like everything is just falling apart.

16,I’ve been in the military a little over 4 years. These last few months I have found myself having very little to no fulfillment in my job. This has caused me to dread going to work everyday.  I hate this job with a passion. Every day is the same shit. The majority of people I would with are shit. The senior leadership is unsupportive and seem to only care about points on their NCOER. I have a lot on my plate right now ie; obtaining custody of my two younger nephews and trying to cram 3 months of online college into 2 months. I am constantly in a bad mood and fall in and out of depression. I’m gone all the time and miss my wife. I am so proud of her strength and support through this.

17,"Ive been trying to write my suicide note for about a week now and i cant think of anything to put on it. Whenever i look up ideas on google i get the usual bullshit like ""you are loved"" or they try to tell you to just keep it to yourself (in other words a fake suicide note you use to vent) like if i were loved i wouldnt be trying to write my suicide note.

Honestlh its not like it matters if i leave a note no one will read it just like no one ever reads/hears my pleas for help, or my attempts to just have a conversation with them, my friends ignore me, support sites ignore me, whenever i try to make friends on a friend sub everyone ignores my comments/posts and if they dont they ghost me after a few messages. No one gives a shit about me when im alive why would they care when im dead?

Im not looking for fake ""people care""s or ""i care""s im sick of strangers telling me they care when theyve never met me because if they did they wouldnt care. I just want ideas for what to put on my note, im trying to not make it an angry note otherwise id be able to write a book.",08Jul2019,1

I dont sleep anymore, its getting harder to get out of bed to work a shitty job every day. I think about suicide a lot and it would be so easy (mentally and physically) to end everything right now.

Atm i'm on my 3rd day of comeback from depression i quit mastrubation, alcohol and drugs im struggling hard but i know if i continue my current life i'll eventually die. And i dont want that... i want to live and be happy i never had a girlfriend i never had a real friend because of this issue... i pray to god to everyday hoping he'll he'll help me and get me away from this dark place.

27,"I wrote a long post here and while writing it went away (no draft was saved for some reason) so I lost about an hour of typing... so things won’t be as detailed this time. (I will have something like this I use for my side thoughts I feel should be added in)

Sorry things might be all over the place thought process wise, I have never posted anything like this before and have only talked about this once recently with my mom. 

Not sure where to start so I’ll introduce myself. I don’t want my name to be public so for the ale of introduction I’ll go by Ace. I am a 23 year old guy and I am dealing with depression. 

In my post that seem to just have got lost I went into detail on my symptoms with some back story on them but since I’m not feeling up to it nor do I know when I will feel up to it I won’t do it. So here is a list of some things I deal with from my depression that I know of so far. 

(Went on Google and removed things I don’t know and/or don’t deal with) 

- Mood: anxiety, guilt, hopelessness, loss of interest, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, mood swings
- Sleep: early awakening, excess sleepiness, or restless sleep 
- Whole body: excessive hunger, fatigue, loss of appetite, or restlessness
- Behavioral: agitation, irritability, or social isolation
- Cognitive: lack of concentration, slowness in activity
- Repeatedly going over thoughts

There was two things I removed that I have or am starting to deal with. Excessive crying, recently I have been getting more emotional when trying to share or open up about everything and my whole situation and by recently I mean past few days. I’m also not sure if it has anything to do with an injury I have been dealing with and everything associated with for that and depression or both clashing together. So right now I won’t list it. The other thing is suicidal thoughts. I use to tell myself when I was younger “if things stay to hard to get to hard I can always just end it” and I used this thought to get myself through though times basically just a thought of, hey you have a way out, don’t stress over it to much. (Not sure if that helped or made things worse for me) but I haven’t had a thought like that in years and I never actually planned it wanted to die I just mentally wanted to give myself a way out. Not sure if that would be considered suicidal but either way I don’t have that thought. However sometimes I see life as meaningless (like what is the reason we are all here, what is the end goal of our lives, though these seem like suicidal thoughts I never want to die or kill myself after, I just wonder what the point of everything is but I think that’s normal to think about as humans we have curious minds. Apparently some people think of death and the way they will die out of unintentional curiosity so I think my brain is just doing the same with the point to life)

Any ways, other than dealing with depression I deal with anxiety to points of panic attacks (use to hyperventilate before I knew they were panic attacks, have only hyperventilated once since knowing it was caused by panic attacks and I only hyperventilated because I was dizzy from medication (injury related) and not thinking straight so was panicking quite a bit) 

I also deal with allergies and I don’t mean your typical Sprit time allergies or oh I am allergic to a few foods I mean I went to my allergist and she said it was the worse case she had seen in her 20 years of being an allergist. ([My allergy lists with my name cut off for Privacy](https://imgur.com/a/frakwj9) and some things not marked I am allergic to but don’t show because the doctors had to end the test early due to my reactions. 

With everything mixed together it sucks. 

Trying to hang  out with fiends I feel like a bother because of my allergies, they can’t order foods that have or contain, peanuts, tree-nuts, Chicken or Turkey. Because just the smell alone is something I can react to. Then with the thought of being a bother with just these 4 foods and me knowing I have way more I personally have to avoid sucks. It also limits the places we can go to eat and with anxiety it causes panic attacks because the stress of having to tell everyone at the table of my allergies (though those who I have gotten close with will say something for me not even knowing of my depression and only a little of my anxiety)

Waking up and getting out of bed is hard, my body it fatigued and I’m just tired. I use to force myself out of bed with my body hurting and my head feeling heavy and my eyes still tired though I had 8 - 9 hours of sleep but more so of the time I spend an hour or longer laying there before I even attempt to get out of bed. 

The simplest of tasks are such a hassle and feel so exhausting. I can do nothing all day (lay in bed and watch TV) but the second I am asked to do something or am needed to do something I feel stressed and hounded by the obligation. 

I get some mood swings that are triggered by the most insignificant things where I will feel unliked, unloved, and alone. 

My little brother is homeschooled and acts younger than he is, he always wants to do something but I always feel stressed out, anxious, and crippled by emotion/thoughts when he wants to do something. I feel bad because I want to because he is homeschooled and I think he is started to get depressed and I feel I can’t do anything about it because I can’t even do anything for myself other than isolate myself which by isolating myself pushes him away and making him feel even more sad! 😢

I’m not on any medication, I won’t take medication, I won’t do therapy because just the thought of it makes me uncomfortable and I don’t want to pay to feel uncomfortable. I have thought about trying to smoke weed since some people claim it helps but with my allergies that doesn’t seem like that will ever happen. (Have considered seeing my allergist again to ask about my allergies and if I would be able to smoke weed but it’s only been a thought I’ve had 2 - 3 times in my life) I am 23 and never down any drugs or drank any alcohol (I just don’t see a point in any of it)

Dealing with all this I turned to working out and it benefit me a lot, I felt more confident and had was less mood swings, slept a bit better, and much more things became better. Though getting up and doing things were still hard and I still dealt with other parts of depression such as anxiety, and my panic attacks, and I will always deal with my allergies which is always depressing for many reason which maybe I will fully go over in its own post if I’m down for it one day.

I got injured over a year ago and haven’t been able to work out since and with that many of my symptoms are either coming back or are just amplifying to a point where I notice them again. It sucks because the whole situation my injury (which I am still dealing with) is stressful and just making it hard to get back to where I want to be, I keep telling myself though that once I recover from my injury I will get back into my routine but we will see how well that goes. 

Sorry again, this post was made more to to get things off my chest and maybe try to talk about things or get some helpful tips to dealing with this. Look at this more of a general layout of what’s going on in my head right now, there are some things I would like to have added and did elaborate on in my deleted post which I may do another time. 

If anyone has some tips if he’ll of dealing with some of the things I am going through it would be greatly appreciated.",08Jul2019,1
28," 

I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but I'm just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I don't sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and I've only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I don't know if it's residual or it's because everything's physically taking a toll on me.

Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed.

And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. I’ve been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined.

I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I don't think it is. I've tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but it's not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. That's not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I don't get how nothing can happen, and I really don't get why I'm still doing these things when I'm not under stress (which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started).

I can't meet a paid professional because my parents wouldn't ever believe me. They're not bad people but they're ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with 'real trauma'. They'd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, I've tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldn't let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it.

What's wrong with me? I'm just stuck. I don't even know why I'm making this post. I think maybe writing about it helps, but honestly maybe I'm just trying to reach out for help. I'm not really sure about my feelings at this point.",08Jul2019,3
29,"Now I was what you would call a typical troll. I have had depression for most of my life, and a learning difficulty on the autistic spectrum. It makes it hard to be social. Im in my mid 30s never had a gf, and its heartbreaking sometimes just to want to cuddle and have nobody. It led to me gaining weight especially after my mom died. I was so miserable and unhappy. I used these things as excuses. I was super miserable and mean. I used to find other people as damaged as me and we would “beef” online non stop.

I have a mean streak and when i get mad or rejected, i used to say some truly horrible things. I was awful. I say this not to excuse but for context.

The last year or so i have tried my best to be better. Losing weight, stop letting my illnesses be an excuse. To be a nicer person. Yesterday i failed and got into a beef here on reddit. I feel so let down in myself. I let myself get upset and went back to my mean streak.

I dont wanna be mean. I want to be good. Thats why i try to help ppl here with advice or always being here to listen. I know its not much but its all i can do. I figure theres people like me going thru this stuff and maybe i can help them just by talking or listening. But i fail myself sometimes and its just as disappointing to me especially when im trying to help others.

I am still very alone and sad sometimes, but i know ive made some progress. Im still trying to be better and lose weight etc. I just let myself down. I have to start over.  I just wondered if anyone else related.

I cant help sometimes feel mad at society or angry because i feel alone. But i wont let it define me. I will be better.. im so glad sub forums like this exist. I truly want tobe better.",08Jul2019,3

32,"I never want to get out of bed but I have to, I've got my nephew to watch and also my uncle needs help with various things, and my mom as well, and I know I'm expected to clean as well, and I have tons of errands that I have to run. 

But I don't want to do it at all. None of it. I'm actually really tired. My doc has referred me to an infectious disease specialist and a rheumatologist  but I just don't want to go. I have zero energy and it could very well just be depression. I've been dealing with these thoughts and emotions for about ten years and have always been very high functioning to the point where if I talk about this to my family no one will believe me or will just say snap out of it. But I'm literally so damn tired. No energy. Face on the ground, don't want to get up. I can't push myself anymore like I used to and I'd like to dissipate into thin air at this point.",08Jul2019,54
35,"Some of you might know me, I'm Mat.

I judge myself with every breath I take, any action I take I'll always overthink it ""did I mean it?"", ""I'm I a nice a person?"" 
""I'm I a good soul?"", then my heart would fall, my mind would go to the dark side, and my demons would sometimes take over.

I've become twisted, I enjoy hurting others, my soul is locked and I really can't take it anymore.

I've asked for many things as dose everyone.

But now all I want is a hug.

I'm sorry to those who i spoke big to, but failed.",08Jul2019,1
36,So I went to Rite Aid to get a refill but I’m not due for another one for another 43 days and insurance wouldn’t pay for it and it would cost me 84 out of pocket. I don’t have that and I’ve already been 3 weeks without it. I don’t know where else to look. What can I do?,08Jul2019,2

38,"""just don't be awkward"" ""be happy"" ""just get over it"", we've all heard some variant of it at some point in our lives when asking for advice from a friend, they think they're helping but it's honestly the worst thing you can tell someone and here's why:

1. it isn't real advice: you're not giving us any real info on how to not do it, it's like giving instructions to someone finding a destination they're travelling to and only telling them the last last turn on the route while leaving them to figure out the rest on their own
2. you're stating the obvious: it's the goal of people dealing with mental health issues to not have them, when they ask you for advice and you tell them not to do X thing, you're basically just restating the idea that's already in their heads
3. it's demeaning: you're making it out like they're making a conscious decision to be anxious (whether it is or isn't in their control, one thing it certainly isn't is a conscious choice they're making) or to be depressed, what you're basically telling them is that it's their fault and that they should feel bad for feeling bad in the first place
4. you aren't taking their feelings into account: by saying such a cut and dry response that doesn't leave much room for further conversation you aren't acknowledging that they're really going through something that's bothering them, you're trivialising their issues and making them out to be something that isn't worth talking about
5. you're reducing their confidence in you as a friend: it might not seem like an obvious thing, you or even feel like something that isn't your fault, and you may not notice the immediate effects of it, but because they trusted you with your issues but they trusted you with that information and because of #1 through #4 they may lose faith in you as an individual
6. you're making it harder for them to talk about future issues: this is another one who's consequences might not seem immediately obvious, but because they weren't able to trust you with whatever issue they came to you with, they'll remember the interaction they had with you which will make it harder to talk about them with others in the future

While there isn't a hard and set rule for dealing with a friend or family member struggling with a mental illness, there are certain things that are almost universally damaging to someone's confidence and their general trust in humanity and this is one of the worst pieces of advice you can give someone, so please, whatever route you take in order to help someone close to you, don't just tell them to not have whatever issue they're having, it does so much more harm than good",08Jul2019,12
39,"idk man guess im making this post looking for help hoping someone out their can give me some advice that I haven't heard before but, (probably wont listen like I always do). idk man its to much for me to handle maybe this is a goodbye letter.

41,"I got soo much trust issues

I don't consider my friends friends no matter how many times we talked

I never took someone who loved me seriously. If any girl told me that she loves me i take it that she Doesn't mean that

Keep in mind that i rarely go out with friends

(I take me pc to their place and we play games on it

I always go for nerds because i know they won't tolerate and do anything fishy

And i never ever EVER had a gf
