So what helped you guys during your leave days?",19May2019,33

2,"So today I hit my breaking point and finally decided that I need to talk to my doctor about getting help for my depression. I’ve never been formally diagnosed, but I’ve come to understand it’s been something I’ve struggled with since my teens (23 now) and just couldn’t put a name on it. I’m sick of feeling like my brain is in a fog and incapable of thinking on a deeper level. I’m sick of not being able to make and maintain meaningful relationships (romantic and otherwise). I’m sick of feeling like my life is going nowhere. I have dreams of working in the medical field one day, but I’m deathly afraid that my depression will hold me back. I’m just sick of being sick. There has really only been one person I have ever talked to about this and I’m pretty sure my parents are clueless. I know I need to talk to my doctor about getting medication, but the thought of doing that makes me hesitant to go because I’m afraid of breaking down and crying in the middle of my appointment (I am not one to really show my emotions). Does anyone have any advice on how to bring this up to my doctor without completely losing it?",19May2019,1

5,"You all most likely know that men aren't told or really allowed to cry. Probably many times you've heard men dont cry, or suck it up. Many men have gone their entire lives trying to stifle their emotions and their feelings, like a bad cough. I know one young man who was beat by his father, and his brother anytime he cried. His mother would always say things like, suck it up or boys dont cry. And for a very long time he didnt know how to cry, and he didnt have any dreams at all, except the same nightmare onse every two months and it was that he cried, then he was beat. Now he wants to join the military it has been something he's wanted to do for a long time. He recently got a little better and finally started having dreams, but he's decided that he needs to go back to not feeling. A 17 year old has decided he would be better off not feeling, then not being in the military, he didn't even cry when his grandfather died.

Often times men dont even talk about their problems at all and most say that's how it should be.
There are many things that the military takes away the it never really gives back. One such thing is empathy after all, you can't kill a man if you are thinking about his kids. People need to understand what our military, and what many men have to go through just because we've deemed it not socially acceptable for men to cry. The military harshly punishes those who talk about their mental issues often seeing then as unfit for service. 22 veterans a day kill themselves not because they've gone to war, research by the department of defense says there is no correlation between deployment and suicide. They kill themselves because the can't cope with their feelings, they dont know how. But we see it as normal for a soldier to never cry after losing a loved one often saying, suck it up. 

When will our soldiers get their right to talk, when will they get the right to feel again. They are human to and deserve the right to be human and not be some machine that we use up then cast aside. We need to let them know we are here for them. But of course that won't happen for awhile will it. Because... men dont cry.",19May2019,3

## How do you make huge changes in your life?

📷

Hopefully this will not be as cringe of a post as I feel it to be.

First, thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering it.

I am going to be 26 in 1 day and I am completely unsatisfied with my life. I want things to be different but something keeps holding me back.

First, I managed to leave the house only to come back 3 times.

I have failed school a bunch of times as well.

I had a car and wrecked it driving while sleepy.

I have Credit issues.

I have Avoided Legal issues.

I have Avoided Tax issues.

I have had multiple jobs and been fired from them.

I am not an independent adult.

Everything in my life is fucked right now.

I have the worst work ethic imaginable.

I am lazy, and unmotivated.

I am a professional procrastinator

I dont even think I possess consistent self discipline.

I put myself and find myself in great positions only to self-sabotage by avoidance and procrastination.

When I start things, I start with so much bravado. I out perform and everyone likes me. Then i loose steam and flunk miserably. Then everyone hates me. This is in everything (Jobs, Relationships, School especially)

I start things but never follow through with them.

I have such big goals and dreams for myself. But I get in my own way and fuck myself up. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

I feel like its either because I dont believe in myself enough or that I feel that I dont deserve it.

I am told that I am smart and have the potential to achieve great things but i dont live up to my potential. That I sell myself short 100% of the time.

My relationships with people are atrocious. I feel as though I cannot effectively communicate well.

Sometimes I feel like I dont understand people well because people say that I ask the same thing over again. Or im not satisfied with their answer.

I hear a lot that I am not capable of things.

I constantly hear: your telling me you want change, but i feel you dont want it bad enough.

I dont want to go through another year of being a mediocre human being when I feel that I am more than this.

I honestly feel like I this is a symptom of me not understanding myself and what motivates me.

I really want better for myself but i have this extreme feeling of apathy.

I dont want to continue this cycle.

I just dont know where to start or even begin to fix this massive clusterfuck.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering",19May2019,2

10,"Hello and thank you everyone.

I've struggled with depression for almost two years (I'm 26), was suicidal one year ago and this week I've reached a new low. I'm feeling terrible. I have no meaningful friendships because I isolated myself overtime, I try to go out and make friends but it's difficult and, above all, something inside my mind keeps telling me that human relationships are worhless because no one would be there for me if I needed it. I'm becoming angry and bitter at everyone who has a social life better than mine, and I'm disgusted with myself because envy is wrong and I shouldn't be envious. 

I also feel a burden to my family because I can see that my Mom is very worried for me. My Dad has suffered from depression for almost all his adult life, but since last year he has found a wonderful therapist and has made tons of progress. I feel like I'm inferior to my father because he's been able to recover while I haven't. I'm on antidepressants and I've seen a therapist for about a year, she helped in some ways but I feel that we hadn't grasped at the very root of things. I don't feel ready to look for another therapist right now. 

I have a younger sister and I'm feeling tons of guilt because when I'm crying or suffering I'm basically catalyzing all my parents' attention on me, and I don't want that because my sister is younger, she needs them more than me. 

I also feel like I'm being a terrible girlfriend. Since last week, I've never wanted to see my boyfriend because I feel that going out is a worthless activity. We haven't had sex for a month because I've lost energy for everything. And obviously I feel terribly guilty for all of this. I think I should break up with him so he can find a woman better than me. 

I just want to disappear.",19May2019,2
11,"Before I saw her at the shops, I felt like I was handling everything just fine. I stopped having panic attacks, I stopped feeling sad for no reason and I just generally felt happy. After I saw her though, I started having a really bad panic attack and I hid in the public library bathroom for almost 40 minutes because I didn't want anyone to see me crying and having a breakdown. That was a few days ago and every night since then I break down because I think about her and what she did that caused us to break up. I know my initial reaction to seeing her was stupid because she didn't even see me, and I know that its stupid and irrational of me to continue to let it affect me. I feel like all of the progress I've made has been thrown out of the window.
Sorry for the long post, I just don't know who else to talk to about this.
TLDR: I stupidly overreacted to seeing my ex and now I can't get over it :/",19May2019,2
12,"Today, from one of the comments on one of my posts, I learnt about Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) and it made me think… C-PTSD has more to do with long term duration of trauma rather than,  but not excluding specific traumatic events.

On my journey, I've learnt about the importance of exploring and reintegrating the subconscious where our traumas are suppressed into. That lead me to consider the fact that our subconscious is somewhat incapable of differentiating in a rational way that a current situation or trigger is NOT the same as the similar trauma of our past… it therefore reacts to a disproportionate degree to our current life, be it codependency, depression or anxiety.

What I've also just started to realize, which I spoke about in my last post, is being able to achieve a state of “allowing” …by this I mean allowing whatever intense negative feeling you are feeling whether it is anxiety or depression, shame or guilt… this seem counter intuitive because our automatic inclination is to deny, suppress and distract ourselves, especially with things we know make us feel better.

Being in a state of “allowing” does not mean enjoying the feeling, in fact, it's painful… but I've been trying to just sit or lie down and allow the fullness of the feeling to flood over me… not even analyzing it… just telling myself as one commenter put it “… it's okay to feel… I have the right to feel the fullness of what I feel because my childhood was traumatic and my current life is also miserable…” 

That's when I realized something important… what if, the reason we feel intense anxiety, depression, fear, guilt, shame etc is because our subconscious is trying to figure out if our current situation is the same as our past trauma, but it has no way of being sure… and we don't allow our subconscious to be sure because we are always denying, suppressing and distracting ourselves especially with positivity.

What if, the key to recovery is allowing our subconscious pain to flood over us without any resistance while we constantly reassure every part of ourselves that it's okay to feel whatever we are feeling and helping our subconscious to differentiate between the pain of our real past trauma and the real trauma of our current life?

I've heard new agers say “what we resist persists” but today I think I get what they mean…",19May2019,6

I was reading an article today, on how negativity leads to depression and it got me thinking about one of the main reasons I do Gratitude Bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

It forces me to look for the positive every day.

&amp;#x200B;

You see if I worry about what is bad in my life, that list seems to be never-ending, but if I focus on the little things like: 

* grateful to have a roof over my head
* grateful to have food in my belly
* grateful to have a friend to hang out with today.

Then, I keep myself positive and it that effects my depression in a positive fashion.

today, I am grateful to focus on positivity

20,"Story ahead.
Hey, just here because I need some uplifting words, honestly.
I’ve been depressive for some years now, it started out really bad when my mother died in 2015.
Been depressed since, and back then I made a huge mistake by taking a credit to help a family member. I didn’t think I’d pull through till now, I thaught I’d be gone from trying to make much out of life anymore.
I then was admitted to a hospital, got a little bit therapy but was left to my own devices halfway through. Skip to. year 2018, I was about out of depression for some days, then my father passed away aswell.
I went through all the stuff again, denial, telling myself I’m strong enough, ignoring my symptoms. On top of that I was loaded with the responsibillity my father collected over 70 years of living, I’m too young for that responsibillity, way too young at my beggining of twenties to mid twenties. This responsibillity includes being the father to another disabled person and a lot of households.
Because of those responsibillities and the laws of my land I had to take up another credot to cover all the bills
I’m at a point where I have to pray every night that tomorrow there won’t be another problem I have to pay for. I hate money, I resent the concept of money already. I’m happy if I start the month with 300€. I tried a lot, dissolving some of my savings, selling my life insurance, selling all my personal belongings, gofts I’ve gotten from my parents and hold my dear life onto, usually.
The responsobillities are too much, I’m back in the hospital trying to make my best of it, I work with medication and meditation everytime a problem arises, but there’s too many..
I pulled through this for a year now, but the end of the inheritance is months if not years of work away
I know one day I’ll be able to live a life again, but everytime I even think about the work it dreads me, I get a cold all over my body and I’m left crippled in the position I took when the thought hit me
I don’t wanna work on it anymore.. but I gotta.
Can someone please tell me I’ll be able to pull through?
To be able to go through all this misery so I can actually reward myself with the actual inheritance and not just it’s responsibillity?",19May2019,2

23,"So I’ve kinda been struggling with a lot for a while. I started seeing a therapist almost a year ago and things have gone well. 

Recently (the last month or so), I’ve been actually kinda happy. But the more I think about it, I’m not sure if it’s true happiness or what. Nothing in my life has really changed, things that I thought were putting me into depressive spirals are still there, and every now and then I do have them and they hit super hard.

But it doesn’t feel like I’m actually happy. Almost like I’ve just become numb to everything and I’m just like...empty I guess. Part of me feels like my brain is tricking me into feeling this  faux-happiness when I know I shouldn’t be, part of me feels like I’m overthinking the fact that I am happy because I don’t think I deserve it, and then part of me truly believes I’m getting better.

I guess I’m kinda just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and just what’s going on. If talked about it with my therapist but talking about it with more than one person is nice. Thank you.",19May2019,8

I’m currently on my city’s bus heading to my boyfriends work. I just got into another huge fight with my mother. I’ll try to keep it brief but we were arguing about temporarily moving in the summer. She has to move for work but this year is forcing me to come with her, even though I feel like I’ve given her a thousand reasons why I can’t/don’t want to, like the effect it will have on my mental health, ( such as not seeing my friends for months who are my main support system), only getting two weeks with my boyfriend before he leaves for college, and the fact that the two of us in a small space for weeks usually leads to more fighting. I’m honestly terrified that moving will cause me to spiral further into my depression or even send me down a path to suicide, but I don’t know how to tell my mom that she’s the main reason for my depression/self-harm without putting myself in physical/emotional danger. I’m just really scared. I packed a backpack of clothes/toiletries in case I decide not to go back home tonight, but I honestly just don’t know what to do.
