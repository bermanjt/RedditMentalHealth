0,"Dear readers,

I am at a point in my life where I have gotten so entangled in debt, pain, sadness and hopelessness that today I have decided to hit the reset button on my life. 

3 years ago I was a happy and deeply spiritual person. I got together with a woman that I fell madly in love with. 

The first 6 months were great and I was the best version of myself ever.

Then the abuse started. She beat me on my birthday for doing a drug that I told her I was going to do weeks in advance. 

I was punched clawed and spit on. Then she drove my vehicle home from where I was supposed to be camping for the weekend with the woman I loved so much. 

A week later I found out she was pregnant and we tried to work things out. Later I got slapped around for waking her up. By saying I love you before going to the gym. 

I started to resent her. 

She was so abusive during the pregnancy that it drove me into a porn addiction. That subsequently led me to getting a blowjob at a massage parlour. After she had again stormed out of the house because of something I had said or done. Which didn't take much to trigger. 

When she was pregnant I got her a remote car starter so she wouldn't freeze as it was winter and I just wanted to do right by her.

I was constantly being torn down by this woman. But I was the abuser. I had gotten some ""toys"" because I wasn't able to please her at the time. 

She threw a tantrum and I drove 50 km to a sex toy shop and spent 250$ on a vibrator for her. At 1am. Having to get up for work 4 hours later.

There was so much I did. I never asked her for anything. The house was dirty I cleaned it. She was tired after work I made her tea and ran her a bath. 

Even after all of this I wasn't doing enough. 

I have literally decayed inside to the point that I am now a shadow of the man I used to be. 

So I have decided after long and careful thought that it is time to end this fucking sham of a life. There is only one thing left to do. 

So this year I am going to celebrate my birthday and that night I am going to end my life. 

I don't want to die but she has already made very clear that it her and my son will be better off with out me.

She wins. 

I was to kind and loving to deal with someone as abusive as her and I am now reaping the rewards of my poor decisions. 

Sincerely 

Just another guy that's been taken advantage of for the last time.",17May2019,3
1,"Today I finished two projects for my courses that are due next week. I'm taking my CBEST test on Monday and I've been studying for it for a month. I changed my bed sheets, finished all the laundry, did the dishes, and worked out today and I still feel like I have done nothing.

I feel like a complete failure every single day. I feel like I'm not doing enough every day even though I'm doing everything I need to be doing and taking little strides in the right direction. I just hate it. I'm sitting here thinking, ""Well what the fuck are you doing resting? Go outside and run again."" My brain tells me I am a failure because I'm not in a career yet or that my accomplishments mean nothing.

Once I get my CBEST I'm going to go out and apply for a substitute teaching job in hopes that I will feel more fulfilled.",17May2019,10
2,"So uh, something happened a few minutes ago. And this feels like the place to ask for help, so someone very close to me was told some awful things. And I've been trying for a long time that she was worth everything to me, even though we broke up a while ago (we're working things out) and I felt completely broken when she sent me a discord chat she was having, somebody told her this stuff.

Person: Don't be sorry.

Person: I'm sorry.

Her: Why.

Person: ... Realizing that no will love you in the end and no one will care if you die.

She actually agreed to it, it makes my blood boil every time I see it, I start crying and thinking about the worst possible things that'll happen, and I'm very scared that she's gonna hurt herself. She's been going through alot recently and I want to help her. The truth is that I still love her and I want to do everything I can, I've been trying to keep myself from doing violent acts to myself. 
I need some help right now on how to deal with all my feelings, I'm angry, scared, worried, and depressed. I don't know what to do, does anybody have any advice? I know my thing doesn't have enough karma things and my post may be deleted (I'm still new to Reddit) but anything will help me. Please and thank you.",17May2019,2
3,"I had a really bad episode of anxiety over the last week. My therapist prescribed me 0.25 mg Xanax. I am supposed to consume half a pill everyday. I've started feeling really anxious in public spaces, which has never happened before. I'm at the worst when I'm surrounded by large crowds now. I just don't want to get addicted to Xanax or to start being dependent on it. I need some advice as I'll be in Paris for three days next week before I leave for home.",17May2019,1
4,"Ex girlfriend who I dated awhile back (we stay in touch as I know she struggles with depression) she told me yesterday that she is suicidal and has been cutting herself. I want to tell her family because I know they aren’t aware of this but I don’t think this is my place to speak out. I just want her to be safe and get the help she needs. 

I did get her to finally see her universities psychologist who was the one who diagnosed her and prescribed meds. I don’t know what else to do. 

Any advice would be great thank you.",17May2019,1
5,"So my mom has been betrayed by a close friend by her, and i won't go into too much detail because it's very personal and complicated, but she has been struggling emotionally and physically. She struggles with POTS,,and her heart rate and migraines have been worse than ever. In very worried about her, is there anything I can do to support her emotionally and physically?",17May2019,3
6,"When all I’m going to do is get a job in hopes that I can live comfortably, hope that someone can settle for me or want to be with me for life, hope I can feel fulfilled in the future. All of this hoping and not a lot of reasons to hope so far. It just feels like I don’t matter in the grand scheme of things or if I wasn’t here nothing would change. Things wouldn’t be better nor worse but it just wouldn’t matter.",17May2019,1
7,"So a little content to what Im about to say. So my biological family and I arent on good terms. My mother neglected me and mistreated me for most of my life and knows it. She tried to convince me to leave the person that has helped me the most. Now, my fiancée was abused for most of her life from when she was 7 to 18 and shes now 21, we both are in fact. I helped her run away from that house(she was 19 sonit wasn’t illegal). She stayed with me and my mom. When I told my mom, she said even with paying rent she could only stay a month. So at the end of the month we moved into a room we rented and have been only the two of us, for the next 3 years, with next to no friends at all. So now with that, heres whats been going on. 

We have been trying to send her abuser to jail for 2 1/2 years now being in and out of court and police. Its been a fucking nightmare. But a couple days ago we finally did it. We finally sent this disgusting person away. He got 25 life sentences, and has a chance of parole after 323 years. Its feels so good to know that hes gone forever and now she can live at ease. She got a new job which gets her healthcare so now shes setting doctors appointments, therapy, dental, pretty much 3 years worth of doctors appointments and checkups. So fucking happy, she can finally pave a new path to a healthy life. Shes been so brave throughout everything and I am so proud of how far shes come. Shes made leaps and bounds with her mental health and its so amazing. 
I have been working the same night job and, at my place we fold towels all night and the company is finally stopping that service. Now my fingers wont be in so much pain from my cuticles wont rip off every week. I have to essentially make a fortress of them and the heat radiating from them makes me sweat non stop the whole night. It feels good knowing that it’ll be soon. Ive made great progress with my own mental health. My depression was starting to get really bad, but my fiancée has been thhe most supportive and understanding person. She listens to me when I need to vent, and she lets me cry and is just incredible. Ive been going from extremely depressed 5 or 6 days out of the week to now 3-4 days and it doesnt seem like much but in my world its like night and day. We both have a couple friends and they are the kindest, funniest people out there. They care about us and always down to hangout. Im even starting a band with one of my friends. He even calls me his best friend without me saying it, and that may be a little weird but no one has told me that in 3 years. The best friend I had in highschool randomly just stopped talking to me and so having someone thatll do that randomly makes me feel so fucking happy. We are starting to get more and more financially stable, I should be up for a raise soon. We are engaged and starting to plan our wedding ceremony(its gonna be super unconventional case thats how we roll). Once I can afford it, Im gonna start going to therapy and get the proper help I need. We are gojng to come into a rather large amount of money and so we are planning to move out of state. The summers get to 120F, and we are both winter people that love pine trees, snow, rain, fog and any cold weather and we decided that either Washington or Oregon is gonna be where we go in the next 5 years. 

I didnt think I would be even alive to see all of this happen. I was getting suicidal and it was bad. If I was alone I would have done it. But I didn’t. And thats what matters. And just look, its been really hard and seemed never ending but little by little everything is getting better. Everything does get better, so dont give up. Tell yourself that your strong snd you can make it through this. I believe that everyone in this group will eventually get better. Eventually the storm is gonna pass and the sun is gonna shine in your life. So please dont give up just yet",17May2019,1

9,"I’ve always tried to put these thoughts off and ignore them but today was different. I’m 23 and I don’t really have anything in my life. I’m recently unemployed so no job, my bank account had an overdraft today so now I have -$29, no relationship ever, no experiences, no education besides high school and 1 year of college, no connections or social circles anymore, no solid plans for the future, and only a couple friends that I could still see in my life 5 years from now.

I’ve completely vanished from social media. I have nothing to offer so I just don’t post anything. My last Instagram post was in 2016. I’ve been completely forgotten about by all of my peers. I sometimes wonder if any of them would even know if I were to die.

I used to have a fire in me. I was such a confident extrovert. I used to have big dreams and now most of them are dead after I learned the harsh and unforgiving reality of the world. When I was younger I used to fear for the day that I’d live and feel like this, and now it’s actually here. In fact, I hate thinking about my younger years because of the obvious contrast in happiness. I was so full of life and positivity. So adventurous and thrill seeking. Now I feel like such a fucking loser. I don’t know what went wrong. In order to save my life I need to drastically change it, but I don’t even know where to begin.",17May2019,3
10,"So, I'm 15. Pretty young, I know. But I have no fucking idea what the hell I'm doing. Schools literally fucking impossible, and my home life is about as bland as a glass of water. I have no idea what I'm going to with my future, and to be completely honest, I don't think I'm gonna live to be 18. It feels so long from now. A year feels like a decade. All my life is going to school, and coming home to watch YouTube and play video games. I also have ADHD pretty bad, but medication never seems to work. I'll just get tired and sleep all day. Everyone in my grade level has a bunch of close friends, and maybe even a girlfriend, but I'm just annoying and fucking retarded. And most of my friends from middle and elementary school have started hanging out with other people. All my teachers despise me (my art teachers cool tho), and I'm one of the least popular kids in the school. Bullying personally doesn't bother me, usually because I make it into a joke, but it gets annoying when people will be dicks just to be annoying. I'm always distracted with school life and how to improve it that I can never focus on my life out of school. All I do when I get home is lay in bed and play FPS games or Minecraft on my laptop. And obviously, living an inactive and boring life like mine will make you depressed as fuck sooner or later. I don't have any self-esteem issues, and my family is pretty cool, but dear god, is my life boring. And before you say, ""Well grow a pair and do something about it!"", I'm just gonna point out that I can't. The only thing to do in my neighborhood is walk to Publix, and the fact that I live in a damn hot part of Florida kind of takes that off my list of options. And like I said, I have no friends that are willing to hang out, so that's not an option either. All my siblings are younger than me and are never up to *anything*, and my mom and dad are always too busy to make any plans. Education is a big problem for me, too. It's always little things, like the fact that I can't remember a pencil, or how I manage to lose *all* my papers. School is just tiring and boring. I know I sound like a whiny bitch right now, and I honestly hate reaching out for help, but it's my last resort. My life is confined to my house and school, which I am complete garbage at and am thinking about dropping out. I don't believe I'll be able to make it to 18, and I spend all day sleeping. Maybe it's just classic depression, or maybe I'm just too retarded to act on it. I'm just asking for help. Don't sugar coat everything, either. Tell me if I'm being a pussy.

11,"March 26 2018 I was diagnosed with MDD aka major depressive disorder aka clinical depression. I was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for DECA. This diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. Naturally I started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. April rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. It all came to a head when I wasn’t allowed to run for student government next year and that night, April 18th 2018 I overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with NyQuil. I laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then I had a dream where I died and everyone I knew wasn’t the same next thing I know I wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and I knew what the universe was trying to tell me. So eventually I continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because I knew school wasn’t for me. I spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. Fast forward to October and for DECA there was a fall conference that I was really excited to go to and I knew would help put me on track. I was denied because my “penmanship showed I didn’t care.” I again felt so defeated and started skipping school. My friends wouldn’t try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. My grades where dropping and I was just feeling like killing myself again. This time around I knew better so I started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. I got stuck on a island (I live on the west side of WA), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and I was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. During this rebellion I found this app called Yubo and for the next few months I made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. Also during this time I switched to online school. I eventually was banned off Yubo because of “threatening behavior.” But the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that I still talk to to this day. All of my “problems” seemed to go away once I deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday I got myself a puppy. Now I’m going back to my seasonal job at Nordstrom and I’m only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. I started off on the top, hit ROCK bottom TWICE, but with the help of therapy, support, Prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage I’m in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20’s debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt&lt;3.

Even small things like that really make me think, why cant you just say no to your father? Am i being petty?
Also, he will cut our time and conversations short as his parents ‘need him’ (they will ‘need him’ to go to the shops for him as they are too lazy to do so, iv seen it happen myself) &amp; he so reluctantly does so. Iv been at such low points in my life and he says he has to go cos ‘his parents need him.’ Its like hes married to his parents, he literally jumps at their beck and call and of coursd i love my parents im sure all u guys do but to empty your bank account for them month after month after working hard, and to ditch your girlfriend with no issue is worrying. Also, his parsnts want him to get married at 27, so guess what? Our marriage plans are on hold because of that? His parents do nothing majof for him,  he lives at home and pays for the bills, his car, his phone, his expenses himself, his father has even thrown him in prison after a false accusation however my boyfriend still is obediant to him parents.

It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didn't. 

All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesn't leave the house, doesn't help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I don't think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isn't a problem. 

He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isn't going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. 

I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesn't seem to be working.

17,"Hello all, first post in this sub. ((If this is the wrong place for this, please excuse my mistake. I know I have depression, but not sure of anything else. So I'm not sure if anyone else could relate...) 

(Background story:) I was diagnosed with clinical depression last year and have been on antidepressants (Zoloft, 50 mg) for a year now. I've noticed in the past few months, I've been either leveling/bottoming out, the medicines are not working, or my depression/mood in general has gotten worse. I am working on seeing another therapist to see if I can get to the bottom of a few other things - I am not convinced I have a text book version of Depression, and want to see if some of my other mood swings can be described. 

So the question - I sometimes have moments of severe energy boosts. I feel like the world belongs to me and I am ready to take it all on. It is sometimes coupled with very severe mood drops immediately afterwards - insecurity, anxiety, doom-thoughts, unexplained sadness. (I have never been diagnosed with Manic Depression but do wish to bring up the possibility with my new therapists.) I'm having another moment of happiness and power. I am scared I will suddenly feel down again and won't have the same motivation I'm feeling right now to finally take control of my life again.

TLDR; I am feeling wonderful right now. So motivated and happy. I'm worried it's just another manic (?) episode -- How do you tell the difference between feeling genuinely happy - and - your strange brain chemistry making you feel manic?

19,"Since I was a child I remember not feeling good in this world, or at least in the place where I lived. So I would often daydream, and I did that probably till I became 22. That is when I realized that I can not run away from the reality and that my dreams of changing it are somewhat not probable. That was also the time when I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and I've changed a lot of different medications for it, as well as going to the therapist regularly, since then. None of those helped that much. The things that do help from time to time is reading books, watching movies, basically escaping the reality again. I don't see that as such a helpful way of confronting the real world. I'm 25F and I got a new job, that will start in June. So, that gives me some hope, because I won't be able to do my usual overthinking about every single thing that I've done, and then make myself miserable about it. 

I just wonder, did you ever feel like dissociating yourself from the world totally, or from the time you are living in ( for example I watch many things on the internet that were made in 60s, 70s..listen to the music from that period of time ). I know that there are people like that here, but it would give me such a comfort to actually read that some people go through this too. I'm afraid if this would be a life long thing. Living life where joy comes just from the imagination in my head. That thing stops at some point and you have to figure it out, how to get that joy from reality. **But what if it is not possible?** 

Just to add, I do have many reasons why my life is like this, I can't write it now cause it would be too long, but basically I had too controlling parents with horrible marriage, full of hatred and yelling. My wish is to gain money from the jobs that I don't like, in order to do creative hobbies that would make me a bit more satisfied. But I always feel depression as something reassuring me that I shouldn't even try, like it is telling me to look at the facts, my whole life I want to escape, and I never did. Makes me wonder if I'm fighting the lost battle.",17May2019,5

Hi to all my fellow codependents, anxious and depressives! It's been a while since I've posted anything useful… in the last few years I've learnt a lot… I've learnt about grounding and mindfulness exercises, shadow work, inner child work, reintegration of suppressed aspects of myself… but I sit here today going through an intense day of anxiety and depression all the same… even though just yesterday I had one of the best days in a very long time…

I know my childhood trauma, I know why I suffer depression and anxiety, but just knowing doesn't change anything… today I finally understood what it means to stop resisting and be allowing… most of us, most of the time just want the bad feelings to stop… we try to distract ourselves with positivity, we try to suppress with medication or worse… but today was the first time I think I sat here with my pain and told myself  “…you know…it's okay… it's okay to feel the pain I feel, it's okay to feel depressed, it's okay to feel anxious.” Let's face it… life is very hard… and the world we live in can be cruel, indifferent and uncaring. We had childhood trauma that was unimaginably abusive… the fact that we have any semblance of sanity is at times a miracle. 

And then I thought back to my childhood, remembering being violently screamed at, verbally abused, and physically beaten if I cried or felt sorry for myself… I was taught to be ashamed and guilty for feeling sorry for myself… when I was in intense emotional pain, I was taught that I had no right to feel that way… what's changed? Today we still feel bad about ourselves for frequently feeling depressed and anxious and needy. 

What did we want and need more than anything else during the intense pains of our childhood? Love… REASSURANCE that we are truly valued and loved and it would have been nice to be hugged and cuddled as a child when we were crying, instead of being humiliated, shamed, ridiculed, beaten and screamed at. What's changed? Each of us still desperately wants someone in our life to constantly love, cuddle and reassure us of their love care and affection… but many of us don't, and many of us have such a deep empty pit of worthlessness and unlovableness inside that it seems that no one can fill it anyway… 

Try this… start with yourself… if you feel depressed or anxious, remember your abused inner child,  and tell him or her that it's okay… give them a wink and say you understand and agree that life was and is hard… give yourself validation for your right to feel exactly how you feel… don't continue to do the job of your abuser and ridicule yourself for feeling how you feel, there's no shame in it… your feelings are valid… from time to time, stop running from your pain, stop denying it, suppressing it, trying to change it… allow yourself to feel what your abuser didn't let you feel… be considerate, allowing and REASSURING towards your pain.",17May2019,3
21,"This is from a podcast I wrote into a while back asking for help, with some slight updates. Probably the best explanation I can give without writing everything all over again.

 

I'm in my late 20's, marketing professional, never been married, but been in serious relationships essentially back to back since I was 17. I moved to Colorado a few years ago after one of the relationships ended, because it was what I wanted to do. I've always worked in corporate America, but I've always been active, enjoyed doing things outside, and wanted to have fun as much as possible.

Since moving to Colorado, I've gotten into skiing and climbing in a big way. I've been exposed to a world of outdoor recreation as a lifestyle and profession I didn't know existed when I was making choices about my future. I had always assumed I'd go to college (which I did), get an office job (which I did), have a family, and be happy. I've been on this road a few years, and the happiness is nowhere to be found. Instead, I dream of either throwing off the burden of society, selling all of my possessions and living in a van … or wishing I had spent my college years learning the skills necessary to become a mountain guide, ski patroller, raft guide, etc.

I sit in my cube, wishing my career revolved around being active, staying fit, and planning fun trips or outings. Doesn't even have to be crazy; I really enjoy taking new people out to climb for the first time. Having been an athlete from age six through college, my self-worth is definitely tied to body image and being good at physical activity. At this point, I feel lucky to have zero student loan debt, and am in no hurry to take on any in an attempt to switch careers, especially to one that is very competitive, low paying, has a low ""retirement"" age, and that I'm not convinced I'd enjoy.

Further complicating matters is having a somewhat serious partner. I've already expressed to this person that I don't particularly want to get married and more than likely don't want to have kids. These are for selfish but important reasons. I know I feel my best when I have time to myself to work out, get outside and climb and ski, and don't have many obligations financially. Children are expensive, both monetarily and time-wise, and I don't think I'd be happy giving up my activities to go to soccer games and ballet classes.

I know it's tough for my partner to hear about me wanting to move into a van and live a nomadic life, because that doesn't jive with her path. Part of the reason I don't want to get married is because I'm not entirely sure which direction my life will head. Maybe I will work up the courage to become a mountain guide and spend half the year in South America. That doesn't lend itself very well to being married and raising a family. It's also easy to say that I'm making a choice by staying in this relationship, and that's true, but at the same time, it's very difficult to walk away from someone who cares about you and supports you.

At the end of the day, it comes and goes in waves. There are days when I'm glad I get to leave the office at five, go to the gym, come home and take a real shower. Other days, it's all I can do to fight the urge to send a text saying, ""I bought a van, and I'm hitting the road. You can stay or come, but I'm leaving."" I just don't want to wake up one day, feeling like I missed an opportunity to live my life in a way that makes me the most happy, bogged down with commitments, unable to make a big change without significantly altering other people's' lives.

I think the crux of my struggle is: how can I identify with confidence what is going to make me the most happy in the long term? I feel like that's what my mental theoreticals always come back to. Would I be happier foregoing ever having financial or personal stability and having adventures all the time, or would I be happier being financially and personally stable and adventure less often?

I feel my depression and anxiety has gotten significantly worse in the last, say 2 years.  Living has become exhausting and emotionally and physically draining. I do enjoy things, but the amount of work required just to be alive sucks the joy out of every minute I'm not out skiing or climbing. I'm in my late 20's and am struggling to imagine a bright future. I feel like an asshole because I'm far, far better off than a lot of people (college grad, no student loan debt, have some decent job experience) but I'm not very interested in the field of marketing I'm working in (food and consumer packaged goods). My significant other and I just bought a house, which is scary for a lot of reasons, including the idea of now being tied to something permanent for years. 

Its exhausting to wake up every day and just know you're going to have to grind in order to exist with any meaningful quality of life.  But I'm too much of a baby/ scared of walking away from the life I've known (comfortable upbringing, always enough food, money for new clothes and shoes as needed, could go to the doctor as needed, etc) for a more vagabond, freewheeling, less stable life. 

Finally, I know I should see someone. But 1. I can't really justify paying for it. I'm not sure exactly what my insurance covers, but from what I've read/ research into some therapists in the area I've done, most don't accept insurance or don't want to and discourage you from using it. Not that it would help a ton, with a moderate deductible, I'd still be paying out of pocket for a while and 2. the thought of trying to find someone I connect with, bringing them up to speed on everything, and finally getting to a place where I'd actually be getting helpful advice (if we ever even get there) is daunting. 

Fuck, that's a lot. Honestly, it just feels good to put it out there, but if you have any similar experience, things that worked for you, anything, I'm all ears. It's tough to work through this stuff without any support. Because my significant other plays such a big part in these topics, it's hard for her to be objective and she gets upset when I bring some of this up. My family isn't really big on talking about stuff like this, and I don't have a ton of close friends I'd feel comfortable sharing all this with, but on the internet, I can be anonymous and be true to how I'm feeling. 

Thank you all, and best of luck to everyone else struggling.",17May2019,2
22,"It’s not that I’m entirely giving up, it’s that I’m accepted my destiny a little early. Here’s why : 
-I’m 30. 
-Live alone. 
-Very few friendships. 
-Estranged from family. 
-Single. 
-Shit job. 
-Eternally broke. 
-Shit car. 
-Shit apartment. 

I can’t afford the dentist, and teeth are rotting out of my mouth with people now being able to tell when I speak. So when I do make my way out of my apartment to be social, I don’t talk, or smile really. 

Jobs in the area I live in wouldn’t be able to pay me enough to afford my apartment, but my car won’t make it far enough to get a different nicer job. 

I do smoke weed because it’s the only thing that calms my anxiety with life entirely. I think it’s better than drinking, or doing anything else destructive. So, drug tests are an immediate fail. 

I am able to recognize that, in life, our only destiny is to eventually pass on. 
I’d like that to come sooner than later because this world was not meant for me to exist in it, I’m not good enough for it, and it doesn’t give one fuck about me. 

I know I didn’t really go full detail into this, but I’m just saying that I have no hope for the remainder of my life, and giving up is the only thing I have left to do, and I just desperately needed to get this out of my head. Also, to add to the eternally broke thing, I pay my bills. Have food. The essentials like toilet paper, etc.. but that’s it. Almost like I live less than paycheck to paycheck.",17May2019,4
23,I'm seriously losing my mind  I need inpatient hospitalization . I'm having a complete codependent breakdown. I can't go to the hospital. My cat has cancer and had surgery Thursday. I live alone and work for myself. I can't afford life with working six days a week. Not working would just add more stress to my life.  I have noone here in this city except my bf (ex) who has completely lost it due to heavy drug use. I'm NoT metally capable of dealing with a drug addict making me question myself. And I'm not mentally capable of detatching .,17May2019,3
24,"I make a big effort to combat my feelings of self-hatred and low self esteem by dressing eccentrically and by priding myself on the two subjects I’m good at: art and writing.

I’m taking college-level english courses and recently I’ve been doing extraordinarily well in my assignments and exams, but I still feel shitty; like nothing I ever write or create will ever be good enough. I’m afraid for no particular reason that people will think I’m faking my abilities; that people will think I plagiarize my work or that I get help from other people. 

I’m about three days behind in all of my schoolwork and I have absolutely no incentive to learn the concepts. I feel like learning doesn’t matter anymore. I don’t see the point in caring about school. I don’t see a future for me and I feel like my grades will never be where I want them to be. Nobody is proud of me for anything I do. People essentially ignore my achievements. 

I don’t feel unique enough or intelligent enough for anything. I feel so exhausted during the day for no reason and I just wanna crawl into a hole and rot away so people won’t have to deal with my shit anymore.",17May2019,1
25,28/m here been with the girl of my dreams until just  a couple days ago. Having our ups and downs fights and all that leading to several breakups. But finally decided to go all the way and become engaged. I suffer from PTSD and.she suffers from several mental illnesses as well. In the beginning all was great. Until I had found out she had been lieing and going and doing things behind my back. All which was forgiven. Numerous accounts text apps and always trying to find something that I had done wrong. In her relapse it was the worst because even when I knew the truth she would never confess.  Being a single mother I know her struggle because 4 kids alone is hard on someone. She despite all that has been my rock the one who saved me from my living nightmares. What can I do I'm lost and shes lost to her addiction to which I'd always give in. We enabled each other. I love her enough to tell her all my wrongs but she seems not to do the same for me. I think shes betrayed me before this time. I want to forgive but I feel I deserve the same truth I've shown her. I'm not perfect but its driving me insane. She gave me hope and believed in me. Should I surrender? But I feel if I do I may see my lovely succumb to her demons as many loved ones before. If there is a miracle or if their is a God I could sure use him now because if I lose her I feel I will lose myself.,17May2019,1

28,"Tl;dr How can I motivate myself to clean when I dont even feel like moving?

I currently am an unemployed military spouse. I don't have any friends and I don't do anything all day. I've had depression and anxiety for around 6 years. Now that i live alone with my husband and I'm not working the expectation is that I keep the house clean. The problem is that I don't have any motivation to actually get off the couch and clean. However, when I look around at my messy house I get anxiety which means I just sit here on the couch having panic attacks and not doing anything about it. What are some strategies I could use or try out to help motivate me to clean and then keep the house clean?",17May2019,4
29,"Of harming myself. Of thinking on what i would make my last day on this earth. I have asked for help and it has gone on deaf ears. So congrats, you win i give up.",17May2019,6
30,"When I wasn't living in this pit of hell that I exist in now, I helped people all the time. I think I even saved a couple lives. But now that I am at my lowest, ever, not one person gives a shit. I am looked upon as a person with ""bad vibes"", and nothing more. I am so fucking done with life. I never knew how to *live* anyways, but now that every second that I live is another reminder of how bad shit is. I just want it to end!!!!!!!!!!!! I gotta stop this pain!",17May2019,1
31,"I'm here to tell what scares me the most.. if anyone cares. And tell my life story, i'll try to keep it short I don't like people feeling sad for me. When I was 11 I was never accepted socially by anyone. That resorted to me finding lost souls like me and doing bad things together. We where kids at that time but adults didn't care that much for us. We found ourselves in situations that could get us killed by adults or something other. What makes me really mad its because I never was given a chance to be a kid. Other kids my age were given support and aid if something was wrong saying they were just kids. Meanwhile if I was dead no one would care, they would even praise it. I was living in rundown home more like a shitty RV. It mad me so sad and furious. Students and teachers were all looking at me like I wasn't even a human being. Teachers using me as an example of how students will end up if they don't study calling me retarded, disgusting etc. Fast forward in present. My father is dead and my mom is sick about to die as well. My father was never here but my mom was only person that gave a crap about me in this world. If physical illness doesn't kill her mental one will definately since its inheretable. My older brother suffers from mental illness already. Severly injuring me and my younger brother multiple times and tried to kill us. But I don't hold it against him I still love him. What troubles me the most is soon I will be all alone in this world only one left that could understand me is my younger brother but he is lost as well. What I'm most afraid is that I won't be able to fullfil my career and become a cop. I always wanted to help and save as much as people as I can. I already got student loans and I'm afraid i'll fail. I need to get drivers lincence in order to get in academy but I need to pay for that too. It really makes me afraid that i'll fail.",17May2019,1
32,"hi, this is literlally my first post ever on reddit but ive been reading reddit posts lately and its becoming home for me

little back story im 18 years old born on November 21st 2000, I live in the tiny state of Delaware, I went to a military based highschool (fulltime JROTC USMC) I went there for 3 years and I failed the first 2, I finally passed some of my classes on my 11th grade year but my counselor told me that I need to do night school plus another year of highschool

I ended up dropping out and going to a in residence program (I live there for 6 months basically) and its a military style program, its based in D.C. so theres a lot of kids their that thought they were ""thugs and gangsters"" and I was the only white kid so it was hard for me to adapt to them all but eventually they accepted me lol (they even gave me the N-word pass)  this program allows you to take the GED test but in DC when you pass the GED you get your DC Diploma and so after 6 months of grueling pain and learning a lot I graduated and I cried when they told me I passed. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* graduated on December 15th 2018. 

I got a job at lowes being a  cashier  2months later, that's where I am now... me and my mom have had a great relationship for years... but recently I feel like she doesn't listen to me and shes just being a bitch basically I hate to say it but. and we have been growing apart for the last months to where im about to move out but I cant I don't have the money and no where to go. I feel lost, I wanted to go military but I got declined by a lying ass AF recruiter telling me my ADHD is a definite no factor (Ive had problems my whole life with ADHD) so I feel so lost right now and I don't know what to do with my life right now, ive been single for the last 2 years of my life because I got cheated on and its pretty much broken me. im having suicidal thoughts and its seeming like the only option at some times but I don't want to kill myself I just want a different life... I always say ""I hate the cards I was dealt in life""...",17May2019,1
