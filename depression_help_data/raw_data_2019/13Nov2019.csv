0,"I googled how to kill myself last night. All i found was a bunch of posts saying why you shouldn't. 

My whole life has been pain. from the first memory I can remember. My dad used to kill dogs infront of me. My mom left me. I was the oldest of 4 and had to raise these hellion children who didnt want anyone to tell them what to do. When I was 15 I almost killed myself. My dad used to leave guns laying all around the house so one day I took one, sat in my grandmas car and held it up to my head. I had written this long letter to my family telling them who much I love them and how they'd be better off without me. When I held the gun to my head I got this feeling. This unexplainable feeling that there was more for me than this beat down trailer that rarely had electricity. Im now 27. Ive been down so many dark holes i cant even count. At my lowest I was doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on and trying to get so high I just die. This angel came into my life and literally saved me from all of my demons. Made me feel loved and accepted. He kept telling me I wasnt crazy. That I was more than everything Ive been through. I believed him. He was perfect to me. Absolutely perfect. I got clean, and moved into my grandmas house. Shes pretty crazy so she SWEAR TO GOD randomly threw all of my stuff off of the balcony. this was unprovoked. That was 3 years ago. He saved me from that as well. She basically pushed me to him. Which wasnt good for either of us because we were trying to do this in the healthiest, best way possible. For 3 years, we had the most beautiful fucking relationship. The purist. 

He started going through a bad time. His mind kept telling him he was nothing. I tried to be there for him, but I just couldnt stop feeling neglected. I couldnt give him his space. He kept telling me he was about to lose it. And I kept demanding empathy. And then turn around and wipe my tears just to check on him and make sure he was okay.

Yesterday he broke up with me. He boxed all of my things and brought my cat to my grandmas and told me he has to do this for him. All I wanted to do was scream at this man because hes throwing such a good thing away. But all I could say was ""I just want you happy"" 

Now, Im back in the same spot I was in 3 years ago. With the grandma that threw my stuff over the balcony. I dont know what to do. I was just getting my life on track and starting to feel good about myself. I believed in us so much. 

Now all I can think is, how could this man go from loving me so much, to boxing my stuff up and dumping me out like garbage. I asked him why this couldnt have just been a break and not a break up. He said this is what he needs to do for himself. Im trying so hard to get mad. But im just hurt. Im heart broken. 

I put so much of my love in and thought we could work through anything. I was wrong,

Im trying my best to keep on a good track. Everyone keeps saying how strong of a person I am. How much Ive gotten through. But this just.. broke me. Im fucking broken. Im not strong. 

I dont know how reddit works. I just got on here to keep my mind busy and put my feelings out there because I cant keep putting them on everyone else. If you read all of this, thank you.",13Nov2019,1

4,I don’t know what to do about it. I feel so bad about myself and the fact that I did it. I feel like I’m betraying the people I care about. I’m only 15 and I don’t know what to do with myself.

5,"So, I'm 16(???) and I was going to do the deed last night.

The long and short of it is that I've been depressed for about half my life and been suicidal for about a quarter of it.

I feel like an idiot and attention seeking little kid for posting this, but here we go.

I have meds and I was planning on using them to hopefully die. My mum, however hid my medication so I didn't go through with it. I didn't exactly have a plan B and I'm absolutely terrified of pain and death. Which seems really stupid but whatever.

I didn't want to go to any of my friends or relatives because I thought that I was already enough of a burden as it is. I've gone to select friends and family before and they all have enough going on without me telling them this BS. I wasn't even man enough to go through with it so why bother someone? Which is also a bit stupid to say seeing as I'm posting this on Reddit. My reasoning is ""No one would be on this subreddit if they didn't want to be subject to all the stuff that gets posted."" So I am posting this on here because I feel absolutely terrible and want someone to help me but I trust neither my psychiatrist nor my psychologist to not put me into a mental hospital. I've been there three times before, I don't want to go back.

I am gonna regret this, but I'm posting it.

Sorry if I'm breaking any rules. I didn't know where else to go.",13Nov2019,1
6,"Hi, I could use some advice. In two semesters, I’ll be graduated with my AA and my high school diploma. I’m an all A’s high achiever type person. Sadly, my perfectionism is my undoing. I got second place in a competition a couple months ago, and ever since I got the results back I haven’t been able to convince myself to work at it. I know it’s stupid. I just feel so hopeless even though I sort of won. 

I can’t think about the future. There’s a massive mental block there. I thought I would be dead by this point. I’m too afraid to be an adult.

What can I even do after college?

There’s just no point.

I feel like I’m just draining everyone’s resources because even posting this may detract some from helping others.

What did you do after college/school? What keeps you going? How am I meant to return to what I’m okay at when I feel so much self-hatred toward what I create? Or when I’m not a good enough judge and I think it’s really good when it’s really not? How do I continue better?",13Nov2019,1
7,"Just a little rant about how much I love my cat peter. 

My aunt found him in a log pile after their dog chased away the mom, so I had to raise him by bottle since before his eyes were even open. He’s ashy black with the cutest little white patch on his chest and faint darker lines all over him. 

This little chonk has my heart. He is so sweet and snuggles all the time and just really makes my life better. 

The last couple days have been really, really hard. He noticed me laying on the couch staring to the abyss and just jumped up and literally could not be bundled closer to my face. The lil nug just forces his way in when he knows I need some help. 

I freaking love support animals. They’re amazing and truly make life so much better. 

Peter, you’re an absolute king and I adore you.",13Nov2019,1
8,"I’ve been experiencing a deep painful feeling that makes me lash out in a murderous anger when they slightly irritate me. It’s like my ‘sanity strings’ are slowly being cut by dull scissors, and I can’t even stand a scratch. It’s just there’s a voice telling me to do it, it’s telling me to make others experience my pain. In the last few months, I have cut off 2 important friends of mine. They were always there for me, and I cut them off because of such small things. I told them to screw off, and that I hated them so much I could kill them in front of a crowd, and not feel a drop of guilt. I’m now even considering a plan to commit suicide when I’ve married someone I hated so badly and leave a note saying it’s all their fault. It’s all so they can also relate to me.

 Whenever I feel this deep anger, I just want to cut someone’s throat open, so deep that their blood will come out like a waterfall. The thing is, though, that same voice keeps telling me I’m not worth enough and that others who are, need to experience how i feel. It keeps saying that what my siblings say, like how I’m going to be a garbage man, I’m going to end up a whore, and that I should just die. I’ve become so numb to their comments that I even agree.

Could it be anger issues, am I sadistic, or is it even mild or severe depression? If it is, could there be an online way to solve this quickly so that no one knows what’s happening behind the scenes? If there is, please please tell me. I feel like I’m going mad every second, I’ve even started skipping school days even though it’s my first year of middle school.",13Nov2019,1
9,"Cold,
All I feel is cold.
I dont mean the weather feels cold,
I'm a cold and broken person. 
Its something I had no choice,
But to get used to at the age of 9.
The depression hit at 10,
Self harm started at 13,
And at 14,
I thought my problems were solved.
This man is the definition of narcissistic, 
Controlling, 
Manipulative, 
And cold to the heart.
4 years go by.
I honestly felt like,
A queen,
More than a queen, 
A goddess. 
I never loved anyone,
The way I loved him.
When he finally proposed, 
I thought,
This is it,
This is the one that will never hurt you,
Or walk away.
He wasn't the one to walk away.
The day I got the ring,
Was the day,
I found out the cold truth.
He was cheating on me with a member of my family. 
The betrayal I felt was more than I could bare.
I threw the ring into the cool pond water we were standing next to. 
With tears in my eyes,
And my heart slowly breaking,
I drove off into the night.
He still says sorry,
But even I know it's a lie.
Now I'm with someone new.
I still feel with him,
Itll be the same fate.
It's so hard to love someone,
When the stitches from before, 
Still haven't healed.
4 years,
And I cant love the same way I did before. 
I care so much for who I'm with.
I'd take a bullet for him,
I'd take a punch,
I'd do anything to put a smile on his face.
I see the mask he puts on,
Because he knows what it's like to be me.
I hope one day he can take off the mask,
And accept his demons,
Just as he has accepted mine.
So we dont have to be cold anymore,
Instead feel the warmth,
Of the love we have for each other.",13Nov2019,1

When I've confronted my parents about this, they've also seemed confused and apprehensive to go forward with anything.

14," I've been suffering with depression since childhood I guess. Several factors such as family breakup, being forced by life to work at an early age, and getting zero caring from anybody around me. My parents got divorced when I was 12 and it was the most devastating thing happened to my life ever. It wasn't a normal divorce like what you see in movies no, it was more intense and on the long term. They left me to face the world's disgusting and scummy face. I lived with some friends for about two weeks or so till I found a fixed place to live in. I had a hobby which was learning programming and getting involved in tech events. However, I had to transform this hobby into a money-making job to to fulfill my financial needs in the time that I need caring and love as a child, can you imagine that? I know that there's a lot who've been through such situation but humans handle such cases differently. For me, I've never felt what family love and caring means as no one has ever asked me about how am I doing in my life as a child or as an adult. Even when I loved a girl once she broke me in pieces because I was overreacting to everything around me. I fucked up in high-school and had to study in a private university in an attempt to study something I'm interested at. (FYI; Computer Science). I can't study or work as I get panic and anxiety attacks all the time and I try to hide it. My first semester grades are getting fucked up, I hate going to college and I don't care about it except at the financial point as I think I might become financially broke at sometime. Oh and I forgot to write that I've been doing weed lately in another attempt to heal my soul from all this shit that's happening to me, it's kinda fun and kinda sad as sometimes when I get high I remember all the bad and shitty things that happened to me since I was born. Miserable childhood, more miserable adulthood. I hate every member in this family, I wish If I could kill everyone who was part of the process which made me a psychopath. Fuck it. That's my life and I've been thinking seriously about suicide for a long time but I'm too scared from death to take that step. I've even looked for therapy but apparently here in this country where I live there's no good mental health therapy at all, they're all money diggers. There's a lot of details that I wish If I could explain but I just too tired to write it. I don't know what to write, I'm just so tired from everything, I think I need someone who can feel me and understand what I've been through, I cry most of the time alone. And yes, I've been taking irrational decisions and actions lately that almost everyone I know started noticing it.",13Nov2019,1
15,Some times I wanna fucking die and I delve in these non sensical delusions to make the hurt go away for a few minutes. It helps. Not in the long term but it helps. Nothing will ever change I will forever be subject to this never ending purgatory of which is known as life. I do not know why I am here and why I am still here or why I have chosen not to leave. All I know is that I am here. Nothing has changed as a result of my presence. Why bother. Sometimes I wonder this. But in the end these delusions often help me get through my day as they inspire me to actually work and give me a false sense of hope that things will get better and everything will be fine. But it all gets shattered the moment when reality hits you. The fact that you are not as useful as others and that your purpose is just to be here and nothing else.,13Nov2019,1

As if depression will give me some unique identity or make me feel more appriciated by myself. I know it makes little sense but I would appreciate any tips on how to get out of this situation.

I work full time, have some significant health issues, and have four animals to take care of - one of which is currently experiencing illness. All of this is very overwhelming, but so is my urge to sleep. When I’m not at work, I just want to be at home asleep. I was in a great habit of going to the gym three times a week, but this sleepiness combined with the time change (getting dark at 5:30pm) and cold weather make it easier to say forget it and sleep the evening away. Waking up in the morning is a monumental task - sometimes I can barely do it and I’ve missed work because of it. So far my job is not seriously impacted, but I’m worried it’s going to be.

27,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 20yo Brazilian/Naturalized Italian who lives in Brazil, I have depression for a long time, I remember wanting to kill myself since 2008 (was 8yo) my dog at the time felt that I was sad and start to lick me and that motivated to continue, the thoughts of killing myself stopped then but I guess my depression kept going and during that time and when I was supposed to make friends I just make a few, that aren't that much helpful because all the want is to play videogames/work but I'm not like that anymore and I don't have any problems with them, my problem is that I don't have anyone to go out and live a life, this wasn't that much of a problem when I have girlfriend but she was toxic and end up throwing me from a stairs and I have to broke up with her (witch I don't regret), problem is know I feel alone.

Another thing is about my jobs, I made a specialization in a area that is stagnated, I never find a proper job, all jobs where entry level jobs that I have where shitty for some reason, or I wouldn't get payed in time, or it was a too stressful, or the environment was too toxic, but anyway, end up that I've never found a decent job. Right now I'm unemployed/under unemployment security (witch end this year).

Conclusion, I feel that my life is really fucked up, no proper friends no job the only reason that I'm alive is that I live with my parents and I don't know what to do, I feel locked in this situation. Sometimes I think I'm killing myself because my track record is so fucked up that I don't think things will get better, right now I taking a antidepressant (venlafaxine hydrochloride) that is helping me to don't feel as bad as before, some days i even feel good but my situation hasn't changed and I wanna know if u guys have some advice.",13Nov2019,1

30,"As the title suggests, life's been quite hard, even more now than before. But before I dive right into it, let me give you some information first. I'm 16, living alone with my sister(26) since my parents are working out of state. I had one girlfriend, we broke up. She never had time to meet for half a year straight. That kind of fucked me up, since every time she would give me another excuse, and it broke me. Slowly but surely I began to ask myself ""what the fuck is wrong with me that even my girlfriend doesn't want to spend time with me"". She's a great person, but also a massive asshole. Well, for a very long time, everything I do seems to fail. It's getting worse and worse and with that, I also get more depressed. I'd shrug it off as being just something every teen goes through, however, it became quite clear, that crying so much you literally don't have the water in your body to produce any more tears at 3 am is not something you do because of a fucking teen thing. The most recent example of that happened with a girl I had/have a crush on. We've been texting, always into the very early morning hours. Sounds fucking amazing, right? Well a couple of days ago I asked what she was doing, she replied with ""I'm about to text a guy I find really lovely"". I kind of broke. Of course, I didn't say anything to her, especially nothing with me having a crush on her. She can be with together with anyone she desires for. I just kinda felt really sad. Oh yeah, and also my parents' marriage is going down the drain as I'm typing this. They really can't stand each other, ever since I can remember. I'm trying to make everyone around me happy or laugh, that's kind of my thing, but seeing those 2 people I really care about fight day in and day out makes me sad as well. I really don't know what to do tbh. I just wanna feel happy again.

31,"So today at work, my team finally received our end of year performance appraisals for fiscal year 2019. I had been anticipating this for quite some time because based on our evaluation from our supervisor we can earn bonuses at the different tiers of evaluation. All year long I’ve been struggling on and off with my depression, making it difficult to work at times, but I powered through. Time and time again was I praised for my good work and contribution to the agency. For once in a good while I began to feel like I was doing something with myself. But then I got my appraisal. I didn’t score as high as I wanted to, and the explanation for why was lacking and vague. And now, despite still having earned the second highest available evaluation, “highly successful” I feel cheated and my mood and mental health are spiraling downwards. I feel like I’m not good for anything, as if I couldn’t even just earn a simple “outstanding.” I have people depending on me and I couldn’t even provide the best for them. I feel selfish for even wanting to vent, or for wondering if I’m even in the right for feeling so lost... and a little bit betrayed. Maybe I’m just acting like an entitled child.

For reference the tiers are:
Outstanding
Highly successful
Fully successful
Minimally successful",13Nov2019,1

I hate that I feel that way, I was pretty depressed a few years back and now I feel like I might be relapsing in a way. The thing is though, my dad's coming to see me in a few days, so he's going to be able to tell that I haven't been that great. Usually when people come to visit me I try to hide all evidence of depression (unwashed dishes, clothes everywhere, general messiness) almost like an addict would hide their evidence. But now I don't even have the energy for that anymore. I'm thinking of just admitting to my dad that I'm not that well, but I know that would break both my parents' heart. I just want them to be proud of me and I feel like right now I'm not someone anyone could be proud of. I want to be able to function on my own and do great things but apparently I'm not capable of that. Anyway my point is: Should I be completely open with my parents about how I've been feeling? Even though I know they'll be incredibly worried about me and maybe even disappointed? Should I start therapy again and never talk about depression with anyone else but a therapist?

Either as a way to meet people or express myself. And I want to have something that I'm passionate about, that I want to work towards getting better at and eventually have some sort of end result. But I just have never done...anything. I still play video games, sure, and a lot of the time it's the only thing I do. But I want to care about more things than that. 

I've tried to get back into writing but the past 3 years of university have pretty much made the craft unenjoyable for me. Either I'm dreading having to do it in general or over analyzing everything I write to the point where I can't stand to look at it. I've tried getting into so many things- like crocheting, colouring, wire art, actual jewelry making... all just ended up as clutter in my closet and wasted money.

I feel like maybe the part of me that has passions or is creative just died and I can never get it back. And now I'm just a shell of a person who only plays games and has no personality. This isn't the person I want to be but it's always the person I go back to being.",13Nov2019,1
