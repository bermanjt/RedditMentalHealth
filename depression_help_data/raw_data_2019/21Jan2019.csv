0,"Screw my life and my feelings

When i tried to forgot all about love, i didnt know every moment of my life there is something about love around me. Great, now i need to survive around these stuff, even now February is getting close, that means it's coming, the Valentine day.... These days are the worst days of my life, because all i want is forget all about love, but this is getting more and more, and one day im not going to resist anymore.

I see my vision burns, i feel my memories make me depressed. And now i need to forget all about Sayori, a cute DDLC (game) character who i accidentally fall in love with her, until i know she's not real, is only a game. That makes my heart worse, all my stress and my old memories came back... Now i want to stay alone forever, without any happy person, only with depressed people like me. And that's how i want to live. My parents don't want me to stay alone, but they can't stop this depression. Today me and my family go to a café, a place which reminds me one of my dreams (and even a part of the game) before my life screw up, when... I don't wanna think about it right now, but the place always reminds me the love. Great. Another torture time. So i started to write this and hear A7x music, it helps too much, because i just got depressed an i change it to be angrier when i knew we are going to the café and hearing their songs. Now i stopped playing the game and i stopped looking at her, but is hard to forget it, because she started to appear in my dreams. Now i just had another dream when i fall asleep yesterday:

I was in a café, playing Dayz in my Computer, waiting for a cinnamon cappuccino, and i pause the game to look around, and (again) i saw Sayori on the other side, eating some cinnamon buns, and you know what i do??? I didn't move. If i move, that would make my life worse, so i resume my game and i just started to be a little happy. After a while, i see my clock and it's too late, so i see Sayori again, and she wasn't in the café. ""Finally. She's gone."" I take my stuff, i close the computer,  i paid the bill, and i walk home. After a moment when i was walking, i hear my cellphone. Someone is calling, so i answered. ""(I always say the same thing) Yellow?"". I hear a girl giggling. ""Looks like you ignore her... Good. Stay still like that and you will be happy."" She finish the call. ""Hmmm.... Who is she?"" I dunno. I called her back. She answered. I just have only one question, so this would be faster: ""hey, umm.. Just a question. ¿Who are you?"" She takes a pause: ""im not gonna tell you until you finish. Goodbye."" And she finished the call. I guess that's what i want, but what she wants to me???. I finally reached to home, i open it, and then i see a mail. To me, from anonymous. Ok... I read it:

""Save your Sayori. She will die if you still ignoring her. Do it for her."". 

I wake up. Wait, what? Now i just got a little confused, but I'll do what i need to do: Still ignoring her, forget it man. Unforseen consequences still there. If you want to stop me, try it.

This is the first part of the story. The second part will appear at Januray 25th.",21Jan2019,1
1,"I put this on r/healthcare but I think they removed it. Still new to reddit, so not sure, but I'm also struggling with the depression associated with all of this. This is mostly a rant, but if anyone also has any ideas, let me know. Cut out some of the wording due to slightly NSFW. I apologize if I'm in the wrong with any of this, but I'm doing this mostly by myself, and I have the mentality of a 2 year old when it comes to anything related to insurance.   


State of Indiana, been applying to get on HIP/medicaid for the past almost 5 months. I have gone through multiple seemingly-unnecessary hoops just to even get considered. Got all the documents they requested and more, pretty much every possible document to prove I exist. And what do I find out? I need everything again because they LOST MY DOCUMENTS. You kidding me? Had a meeting yesterday in regards to my case, they couldn't find my case for the first 20 minutes, and when they did find my case, none of the documents were listed. I've already declared bankruptcy due to a hellish amount of medical bills last year, and the bills are piling up again. I'm t1 diabetic, on hormone therapy, pending possible thyroid issues, and am dealing with a lot of mental illness issues. Diabetics are cash cows, and without insurance, I'm looking near $350-500 a month just for ONE VIAL. Also on duloxetine (expensive, max dose) and lamotrigine. My sugars like to range around the 250-350s, and I've had frequent hospital admissions due to ketoacidosis scares. I need my bloodwork done to check all of the above, but the last time I went in, I was thrown a $250 bill, with minimal bloodwork. I'm unemployed right this moment due to having to handle the side effects of all this crap (can't wake up, oversleeping, insomnia, pain, constant nausea, lack of appetite, low sugars exacerbating the insomnia, etc.), and I genuinely just want my healthcare so I can see a doctor. I want to work, and I'm sick of medical issues getting in the way of that. As I type this, I've had concerning pelvic pains for the past 3 days, but I can't afford to see my doc right now. Plus I'm running out of insulin (and have had to take less just to get me by), and my antidepressants that will cause a huge number of problems if I stop taking them suddenly. I am sick of being screwed around by everyone. It's defeating, and makes me feel like nobody really cares. I'm getting negative thoughts again, and it's overwhelming. Can't afford a therapist, either, right now. ",21Jan2019,1
2,"Does anybody have any experiences of having to work really hard to get over somebody?

For coming on four years now I (m, 20) have struggled to move on from unrequited feelings I held for a straight male friend of mine. These feelings coincided with the onset of my depression and CBT would suggest that these feelings served as an important factor in the worsening of my mental health.

After basically four years of being apart from him since we’ve left school and having blocked him on social media to get some space, my feelings, although diminished, still exist.

Despite being in a relationship with a girl I care about enormously, and having gained a new circle of friends and experiences at university, I still love him. I still find myself crying sometimes about how much I miss him, or about how if only I was with him and could be happy.

It’s almost like my brain has inextricably linked my happiness to him and I worry that without someone getting past him I will never get to a better place mentally.

Does anybody else have any experiences like this, or any advice for dealing with this sort of thing as a depressed person?

Thanks

TL;DR - still in love with a straight friend after four years of being apart and not seeing him on social media. How can I get past this?",21Jan2019,1
3,"So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, she's depressed, and she's revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time.  She's tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really can't do it herself.  She fell today (and has multiple times before) after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead. I told her that she doesn't wish that and she's not thinking clearly because she's drunk, and she told me she feels the same way when she's sober. I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you aren't thinking clearly by definition. I didn't explain that to her though.  A lot of my family struggles with addiction and depression, and I'd say my grandma is in a better state than most of them.

 I'm curious what steps anyone here has taken in getting a family member the help they need. What resources are available to me and how do I help someone who is fortunate enough to at least want to help themselves?  Thank you in advance.",21Jan2019,1
4,"Hey hi uh, first off i don't know if im posting in the right place because i dont know if im depressed or anything but i know somethings wrong and i just gotta share it somewhere heh. Also, im a 12 year old girl in 7th grade, i think thats important to get say? Ok this is going to be all over the place im sorry, im really bad at organizing thoughts and everything. I think everything changed in the middle of this year. I used to have this best friend id known for like 3 years, we were so similar. I knew her family and we just had each other and i really loved her. I wanna say middle of last year i got a ball python, id been preparing for him the whole summer and i was super excited, we took a trip to Chicago to meet the breeder and it was great. Anyway i got Geno and then just fell in love with the reptiles and my mom spoils me and idk now i have 3 snakes and 2 geckos and i know thats stupid ill get into that later. But basically i would always talk to friend about how much i loved them and everything. She ended up getting 2 geckos and at first i was really happy for her. We hung out like everyday during the summer and 7th grade time we have most classes together. At first everythings fine ya know, but then i guess one day something clicked and literally i felt like a completely different person. Still do. I started feeling just stupid hate towards that friend, i think one of the causes for the click was how much the animals were stressing me out and seeing her literally looking at geckos online all the time and everything annoyed me so much, i didnt even talk about the animals outside of home anymore. Shes so nice im so mad at myself because she doesn't deserve this, but i just cant stand her. I also just started in my head feeling so aggressive towards everyone. Im a nice person on the outside but inside im, idk lol. Anyway i stop talking to her and around this time and i make a couple friends who are just great. I wont share names bc they all have reddit and i made a new acc just for this and i dont think they know about this sub but idk lol. Anyway its this guy and this girl and particular and they add me to a group chat on Skype and idk im just happy with them. But I'm always thinking they hate me and everything,,  i try to be funny sometimes and theyre so nice and i just feel like i annoy them. Also, they both have so many other friends. Like thats great thats not whag im saying, i just. Idk i want someone like my old friend i guess who i can know cares about me 100%. I know the new girl (idk what to call her lol uh kate) , kate, i talk to her sometimes. Well twice but she says i can any time and i dont more bc i dont want to bug her. But one time she said that shed be with me through everything and that made me really happy. I know how stupid it is reading this like 12 year old drama maybe im sorry. I feel so dramatic and stupid all the time ugh. I feel so much older than i am. Ok, moving on, school now i get stressed out everyday. I have it, i dont understand my math like at all lol. Last year i had it all under control but idk its all moving so fast and i just dont care enough to try anymore.Everyone else kinda jokes about it in the gc and ik they struggle w it a little but i literally dont understand. Ive just stopped turnimg in assignments i just cant really deal with it. I have, what, a D in that class? Thats the lowest ive ever had in any subject. I feel so empty all the time i feel like theres 100000 things in my head and im just hollow all at once. Whenever everyone talks to me irl i just try my best to be funny and i laugh so much which is annoying and im sorry i cant control it i, dont want to mess the friendship i have with them up like i do everything else. Um, at home i just live with my mom. My sisters moved out and my parents are divorced, i see my dad mondays thursdays and every other weekend. Im even still not that close with my dad but i think hes really cool. Im with my mom most often (i dont sleep over at my dads since my sisters stopped going) and ive been just cold towards her lately bc i don't want to answer her questions i just want to lay down and watch stupid videos and stay up until 2am because my anxiety from a couple years is back and bad. My new obsession with creepypastas and horror/crime stuff probably isnt helping lol, but it actually doesn't get to me as far as anxiety goes, i feel the same i remember feeling when i was 9, except this time i dont really have anyone to help with it i just cry heh. I dont tell my mom any of this. She makes a big deal out of everything which shouldn't be an issue but i her positivity just really annoys me sometimes. I love her and i feel bad for treating her like this but i dont know what to do. If your curious yeah ive had thoughts if suicide. Im a smart kid ive planned it all out, but ive also considered my future. I spent so so so much time fantasizing about it. I want to move to canada. I want to be an artist. I draw alot btw. Im not great but ive improved for sure over the year bc ive been drawing alot as i deal w this. So i dont really want to give that little chance of a happy ending up if i dont have to. Maybe something else worth mentioning is how often ive also thought about just pain like in general. Im not trying to be edgy or anything heh, i just for some weird reason wish i got stabbed or shot or something. Not for the attention but just for the pain. I havent done anything i dont think i will i just, idk. Well i used to scratch my hand raw when i got nervous but my mom saw and got mad at me. I still have 3 purple scars on my hand lol. I found confort in it, i wish she didnt take it away? Again im not trying for attention or anything i just want to get everything i can out. So about the animals now. I love and hate them. I love them, obviously, but i hate them bc they stress me out so much and i feel so chained down by them. I wish i didnt have them but now that i do and ive bonded with them kinda i dont really wanna let them go.. Ive thought about rehoming 2 of my snakes i just dont know. Me and my mom both spent alot of time and money on them so i feel like id just be letting her down. And it hasnt even been a year! I just cant really believe im that un responsible. I have an Instagram i use pretty often, whenever i feel a certain way like really happy or really sad i post a picture of something. They dont have to be good, sometimes i filter the heck outa them so i just have the orig pic and it makes me feel cool for some reason lol. Its i_z_z_y_i if your curious lol. And there's also this song, not too late by lemaitre and it just makes me feel good for some reason. I listen to it when I'm really feeling bad and nobody knows about it. And im starting to learn French again, its a good very temporary distraction from everything but eh. Theres more things id want to touch on i guess but i think that gives you a good idea of my life so far. I dont mean to be dramatic i just feel like it shouldn't be this hard. Maybe so, maybe everyones gone through this lol. Yeah idk if theres anything actually mentally wrong w me, i dont talk to my mom about this stuff. My head is just so crazy and i feel so out of control and tired and useless all the time. Sorry its long, thanks for reading and any advise you may give. ",21Jan2019,1
5,"My title is stupid. Couldn’t think of anything more clever. 32 year old female from Pennsylvania. 
My depression is bad- I have had it my whole life and am on highest dose of Zoloft possible. Have been for a long time.
I realize I switch in meds would help but of course I am uninsured atm (can’t afford it- trying to get Medicaid but that’s a nightmare)
I feel like I’m failing at everything. I’m in my last semester of grad school- I just don’t want to do anything.
My motivation is zapped. I need help figuring out coping mechanisms.

I’ve been working out joined a gym, I’m an artist so I do that whole thing- but literally I’m having trouble motivating myself to do ANYTHING.

I’m so sad all the time. Reddit please help.

My boyfriend and I are super poor and can’t afford to do anything atm but pay rent and life basics. I realize this is only temporary but it always feels like a struggle. I know im not special or different and my life is generally lucky and good. I am fortunate for all I do have. However I just feel so sad always. It’s not a way to live. 

What can I do to quell these depressive symptoms when I can hardly get motivated to do the bare minimum?

6,"I few weeks ago I posted needing support and this is my update. I went through some horrible things and had to do things to keep myself going. I was clouded by fear and emptyness I just kept tripping and falling g deeper. I then proceeded to try to commit Suicide by OD and failed. Doctor said if I had 5 more mg it would've done it. But he said ""You may be dead right now mentally but your body physically fought to live. Showing that you can still find peace"" Which changed me. IT MADE ME FEEL EMOTION. IT MADE ME SMILE. IT MADE ME REBIRTH INTO WHAT I AM NOW. I still have dark times but I know I can always get up and Fuck the World. And so no I'm here tpying to in hope that one person will see this and give them hope or feelings to live and go another day. To give them the motivation j was starved of for years and what costed me friendships. It will be hard guys . You will have to make hard decisions and may have to cut relations .

7,"Ok so where to begin....uh....so she has Seasonal, Persistent, and one other type of depression, this winter she has been hit pretty hard, and it’s come to a point where she says “I don’t know” or “I feel numb” when I try and ask her about just about anything.  We’ve had a rough couple years in our marriage, almost ended up divorced but I’m not willing to give up on her....

Anyways, the type of stuff she says she doesn’t know about is really hurtful for me, like I ask if she thinks we will get better as a couple because it’s something I really want to happen.  And she has taken to accusing me of only wanting her for sex, so I’ve asked her if she would prefer to not have sex for awhile and again she says she doesn’t know.  And I ask if she is upset with me when she seems to be, but she says she doesn’t know, and when I press to make sure she isn’t just trying to spare my feelings she tells me she isn’t feeling anything at all.

All of this is fairly upsetting for me, and I end up falling into my own depression as I begin to feel utterly useless and like I can’t do anything right, and I end up having to fight this 2 front war where I’m trying to keep her from falling to her depression while also fighting my own.  

So what can I do to help her?  I’ve done some googling but haven’t found anything really helpful, a lot of vague things like “eat right”....",21Jan2019,1
8,"First of all, sorry for using a throwaway/new account for this. Some of my RL friends know my main account, and, well, you'll see why I don't want them to know some of this stuff.

Honestly I think I just need a place to offload all of this crap, and to be told I'm not alone in this.

**Reasons for me to get professional help**

* It's been like this since 2012, and although there have been brief periods of normalcy, it's not going away.
* It's gotten to the point where I know this can't be normal. Like in the beginning, I thought it was just a temporary thing, but... you know what the turning point for me was? I read on the internet that suicidal thoughts are abnormal and I was on the floor the entire afternoon thinking, ""wait, normal people don't have a near-constant voice at the back of their heads telling them to kill themselves on a daily basis?"" It probably sounds dumb when I put it like this, but essentially that's what it was. I realised that most, or many people don't experience this.
* Sometimes I have phases so bad that the experience in itself is traumatic - so like, I feel bad, and then I think about that really awful time when I felt even worse and drive myself to a panic attack which ends up in me feeling even worse and really awful, just like I feared. Does that make sense? I feel like it's some variety of PTSD, almost.
* It's called ""mental illness"" but it's gone past the point of simply being ""in my head"" and I feel tired and sick all the time. (My physical exams come back generally fine - there's nothing else, so I imagine it can only be this.)
* I feel like it's a matter of time before I slip into some kind of metaphorical sand pit and do something irreversible to myself. Or that it's a matter of time before it gets so bad that I can no longer keep up a facade of being a functional human being.
* One of my close friends died by suicide last year and at the funeral, her mother went around and begged all of us to  talk to someone if we needed help. (The family was aware she had some issues, but had no idea things had gotten so bad for her. In fact, she seemed happy, and like fools we all lapped that up and thought it was a good thing, when in fact it is a big sign in a depressed individual that they have a plan for suicide. But hindsight is 20/20, I suppose.)
* I feel like if I look hard enough, there *is* still a part of me that wants to feel genuine enjoyment and excitement again.
* Life is so exhausting.

**Things that are keeping me from getting professional help**

* If I get an official diagnosis, I have to report it to my employer and to any and all future employers, at least in the country where I'm living right now.
* I can't afford to lose my job.
* As a foreigner, medical care - especially psychiatric care - costs a lot of money. It's literally hundreds of dollars an hour and I don't even want to think about how much medication will cost, if it gets to that.
* My insurance doesn't cover psychiatric care or counselling - insurance in this country generally doesn't.
* I feel like I'm bad at everything I do, including the thing that I'm trained to do professionally - I don't feel like I'm worth the help.
* There's still such a stigma around mental illness. I'm already in a variety of minorities (trans in a country that isn't accepting of trans people, visibly and audibly a foreigner, and I'm the only person in my circle of friends &amp; workplace who is of my nationality/race/religion. There's a lot of microaggressions to deal with, and it takes an emotional toll). How could I deal with the added stress of having a diagnosed mental illness and having to navigate with that at work/with friends/with family?
* I feel like if I talk to a mental health professional, all of these other issues apart from my emotional issues will come out, like my being trans and potentially wanting surgeries related to that - and that is linked in with why I don't want to have to report this to my employer. People here are generally bewildered at best, and hostile at worst to LGBTQIA+ folk.
* I've seen a counsellor before and during the first session I just told her about all of my issues. It was basically a list. And then she asked me, which one do you want to focus on? And I had no idea - all of them seemed to be equally urgent, swords that seemed to be inches away from my face. So I stopped going. They didn't call back. And that was that.
* I don't want to talk about it with my mother, or have her know. She will cry, it will be awful, and I don't have the energy to deal with her.
* I have friends I can talk to about this, but I don't want to burden them. Which I realise is hypocritical of me because I wish my friend who died by suicide had just called me and told me about how she felt. If it meant that she would be alive today, I'd take any call, I'd listen to her any time of the day or night. But it's shitty for me to say that when I'm also the one who didn't contact her for a month assuming that she was busy &amp; happy with her new job when in fact she was suffering and being driven to the point of suicide by her mental illness.
* I've had a couple of friends and family die over the past few years, for various reasons ranging from cancer to suicide. It's probably ironic but like, I'm so afraid of dying that I can't help but feel like being suicidal might sometimes be preferable to being afraid of death. It's like, at least I want the thing, you know?
* Like, I don't necessarily want to *die*, I just want to sleep forever, or not have been born at all. That would be nice.
* Recovery means having to be disciplined, having to go through lots of uncomfortable things, facing my demons head on, embarrassment, shame, and working hard. How can I go through that when I can only just get out of bed and put on a facade of being a functional human being?
* Inertia. Like, getting help means actually contacting someone, arranging an appointment, going in for regular treatment, sticking to some kind of treatment schedule.... just, no man, let me rot in bed.",21Jan2019,1
9,"I can't self-diagnose myself, but I think I am in trouble. It started so gradually, but I am sliding and need to correct myself. 

I haven't unpacked the suitcases from vacation a month ago. I keep the clean clothes in the hamper and the dirty clothes on the floor.  I sleep so much. I let my hair grow to my butt, haven't shaved in a month, and my eyebrows are a jungle. I have 2 papers to write, I live on bananas and captain crunch, and I don't care enough to do anything. I've been half-heartedly beating myself up for my laziness, but now I wonder if it's a symptom. 

My roommate is amazing, so when the dishes pile up and the trash stinks, she takes care of it. All I can say is ""thank you"" and she replies that it's her mess too, but I know it's 80% me. Why can't I just *do the damn dishes?* 

I recently went to a grad school town hall on mental health and I was so shocked about how many of my classmates have openly sought help for their struggles. I am so happy for them, and it made me realize that I could do it, too. I'm a little worried that our school's counseling center is going to put me on some waiting list or farm me out to an expensive outside therapist, though.

I don't feel attractive. My friends all make more money than me and are pairing up while I stay single. My dad's a jerk, but he also loves me and I can't reconcile the two. Work is stressful.

But these are issues I can work through. If you got through this novel/diary entry, I'd just like to say: thanks for listening, and I want to get help.

I have a plethora of issues among them being a very low self esteem along with bad anxiety and depression, all of which burden me in many ways. recently, I have noticed that they causes me to put every human being other than myself on a pedestal. This negatively hurts me as I never trust my own answers and am too nice to others while asking for the same in return; thus not seeing them as people. Resultantly I feel I am in a place with zero true friends and women who are attracted to me but don’t like my soul. I also cannot try to do anything as my low esteem makes me feel like I will fail.

16,"Hey everyone! 

I was depressed for over 3 years, life kept dealing blow after blow, but I started getting better about 6 months ago. When I first started getting better, I would be good for a week or so, absolutely positive and feeling so much more like myself, and then all of a sudden I would feel really really down, as if I fell back into depression, for no reason at all. This would last for a short time, some times only a few hours, or days, at most a week, then I would feel okay again. As time passed, these moments, what I came to call ""Relapses"" (please excuse me if this isn't the proper terminology, its just what I call them) came fewer and farther between.

18,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently began seeing a psychiatrist by my own accord who prescribed me Bupropion extended release (generic Wellbutrin XL,) and I've seen a huge improvement in my mood and functionality. Long story short, it's made a vast difference in a lot of aspects of my life and I plan to continue with the treatment indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I'm currently covered by Medicaid under New York State, which covers my prescriptions and psych appointments. I'm going to no longer qualify for insurance, either this March or next March, and paying $600 or more a month for private insurance is out of the question. I have previously missed doses of my Bupropion when I couldn't get a hold of my psychiatrist and could not get a refill, and experienced some major and debilitating withdrawal symptoms, including dizziness, faintness, nausea, etc.

So I know eventually I'm going to need to find an alternative way of getting this drug. My question is does anyone have experience with retail sites like Planet Drugs Direct or something similar, or another means of getting the treatment that you need outside of the conventional medical system? I can't be the only one that's had this problem.

19,"For the longest time I hid my depression in order to not 'cause a scene'. but it weighed too heavily on me, so I started opening up more and more, and after a year I'm at the point where if someone asks how I'm doing, I'll say exactly what's up. And I feel more lonely than ever. Not only do most people laugh it off and ignore it, the people who actually respond and try to help will give it 5-10minutes, and then pretend everything is normal, and then not talk to me for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know depression lies and tells you no one cares, but I'm having a very time arguing against it anymore. Almost everyone I know (except my parents and grandma) know I want to die everyday, yet there'll be weeks where none of my so-called friends will ask me how I'm doing. I don't reach out to them, cuz like I said I'm done pretending, and I don't wanna always be a downer, especially for people who haven't asked. So like, what?   


I just feel so lonely all the time. A 10minute conversation with a friend is helpful, and at that time I do believe they care. But I can just feel myself getting more and more bitter and resentful towards them, pretending to care for 10minutes and then don't check up on me for weeks? It gets me hopeful only to be plummeted deeper down.

20,"It feels like three struggle always comes full circle. I struggle with food and marijuana addictions. I have an amazing husband, job, house, friends... But I can't seem to keep my shit together with any sort of consistency. I'll lose weight, quit smoking and feel amazing for a bit, then it is worse the next time around. I'll gain all the weight back and fall into worse habits. 

It feels like it's a constant battle I don't care to fight. I need help, I really don't see the point anymore.",21Jan2019,1
21,"I hate myself, deep inside. I don’t feel ugly, I’m not stupid, I’m getting better in every aspects of my life, social, emotional, mental, since the start of my recovery. But I hate myself, I’m full of hate, anger and pain. Since I have start to feel better everything changed. I was not feeling hate, just rejecting people for they were representing for me. But now everything I’m feeling against people is just a reflection of my own hate. I can’t stand myself, every time I’m thinking about something, getting mad, it just my own hate running out of me. And when I realize I'm not controlling anything, being mean to others, I'm hating myself even more, and punishing myself ( self hitting, cutting, food privation). I’m not saying other are never wrong, I’m saying I’m projecting myself on others, and this is why I have so much problems with people. I dont know how i can stop all this hate running in me.",21Jan2019,1
22,"I stopped taking my meds last week (adderall) because my tolerance grew and I don’t want to up my dosage. 

Ever since, I’ve been experiencing the worst depression I’ve had in forever. The rollercoaster I’ve been riding for the last week brought me to the point of wanting to just end it all a few nights ago. 

I was feeling really guilty this morning for what I have been putting my loved ones through. I almost fell back to where I was a couple of nights ago. But instead, I got out of bed, and just took a shower. Now I’m laying in my moms bed. I haven’t said anything to her. But I’m feeling a lot better now. And I was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  

Thank you all for your posts in this sub. I stumbled on it this morning and it motivated me enough to get me out of bed. I didn’t even have the strength to move before. 

I’m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again! ",21Jan2019,1
23,"I’ve got a little brother staying at home with our parents while I’m off in college. He gets extreme mood swings every now and again. He gets in arguments with our parents over little things. He’s also suffering from depression. He could be grand and jolly one minute, but a short while later he’s crying and could be holding a rope saying that he wants to kill himself. He’s been stopped a number of times in the act of attempting it. It’s starting to create a lot of friction in my family. I can see that as much as my parents are doing for my little brother, he doesn’t acknowledge it and is causing them to get extremely frustrated. I’m home most weekends but I call him every now and again. What can I do to help him? What can I do to help my parents?",21Jan2019,1
24,"I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel in control.

I hate the person who currently lives in my body. He’s a whiny, self-loathing, dramatic, irritable, pathetic, useless, tired, annoyed, pessimistic piece of shit.

The worst part is that I have some sadistic part of myself that wants me to suffer, doesn’t want to get better, that doesn’t ALLOW me to get better.

Seriously- Whenever I start thinking more positively or want to do something productive / that I want to do / that could help me, that one part of me DOESN’T ALLOW IT.

I don’t think I can get better if it keeps going like this.

I can barely function as a normal human being. I don’t want others to see me like this. I want to escape, at least for a couple of months. I don’t want any responsibility.

I just want to get better.

I don’t want to do anything that doesn’t directly contribute to me getting better.

Sadly I only go to the psychologist once a week (only for less than an hour) and the therapist isn’t scheduled yet...

It’s getting hard to go on like this.",21Jan2019,1
26,"I, for approximately 4 or 5 years, struggled with major depressive disorder/MDD where I sometimes went a month or 2 feeling like everything is pointless and that I'm worthless and not worth living. Sometimes I would have fun doing something only to feel down later again. Often times I would have thoughts that would question and doubt everything. At the time I was on and off dating and after some time breaking up with my ex repeatedly. I have always been a romantic and dreamed of finding a girl who I give my life to and grow a family with. For me she was that person. I loved her more than everything and always felt like I didn't deserve her. I would tell myself that without her I dont have a future worth living. I would cut myself whenever she was upset about something I did or said, or even if it was something like her feeling down about something and I would feel helpless. I would tell myself that I needed to better and always be there for her. She told me multiple times that if for any reason she felt like breaking up that I should stop her because she didn't want to lose me and that she would be making a mistake. But every time that she said that she needed a break or that she wanted to try being with someone else, or once or twice her friends convinced her that she should break up with me because our relationship was unhealthy due to my depression and causing her to worry constantly about my safety. And each time I let her go because I could only feel like it was best for her. And each time I would regret things that I could've done differently and would constantly think about her and wonder how she was doing and feel like killing myself to end the cycle of pain for both of us. But now I no longer have depression, at least not as often. But now I feel like it's too late to try to build a future for myself. I dont think about committing suicide actively anymore, but now I'm just letting the days pass by while i wait for my death. I attempted suicide i believe 3 or 4 times, each time i did it in a way that wouldn't for sure kill me, at least not right away. Each time I took a large amount of aspirin or some painkiller, I cant remember the exact amounts but each time it was approximately between 30-70. I would take them right before going to sleep, thinking I would leave it up to chance whether I wake up or not. I believe I took almost the whole bottle all together. I figured from what I read even if it wouldn't kill me immediately at least I might end up with a stomach ulcer which would hopefully kill me within the next couple years. I also smoke cigarettes and starting a couple years ago I had started drinking almost every other day with a friend just to try to forget about everything and stop thinking about the pain. At some point I ended up with a stomach ulcer, self-diagnosed cuz I refuse to see a doctor because I dont want my family to find out, and I would continue to drink red bull almost every day sometimes multiple times a day which seemed to worsen the ulcer quite a bit. This is quite nasty which is why I prefer to not mention it to most people, but the reason that i believe that I have an ulcer, besides the stomach pains, is because I sometimes shit out blood. Sometimes I'm fine for a month or so and sometimes it happens multiple times a week. I think it's at the point where I'm somewhat anemic now. So overall I have fucked up my body and life in multiple ways but now I'm just kinda stuck. I dont necessarily want to die rn, but I dont want to live for more than another 7 or 8 years because I just dont have any goals in life. I dont have any motivation to try either. I give up easily and I'm lazy. I dont want to put in any effort to have a better more stable life and job because I'd rather just enjoy as much of my life I have left. I also dont want to try being in a relationship again due to my lingering feelings for my ex and because I cant allow myself to love another girl. Idk what to do or what is the best choice. I feel hopeless still and feel like even if I try to live and move forward it would just be too hard and pointless in the end. What should I do?",21Jan2019,1
