1,"I want to share my current state of mind, because for some reason reading other people’s stories in this sub brings me a lot of comfort. I want to reciprocate that feeling.

I feel like I’m a waste of space sometimes. Everyday I wake up, not having anything exciting planned. Most days I’m just going through the motions, I just sort of “exist”.

I have friends, I have a family, people say the nicest things about me, but I don’t believe it. There’s a girl who I should be with, but I don’t let her love me. I don’t let anyone love me,I push them away, I hurt them. When things are going good for me I blow it.

Maybe it’s because I know  I’m not who they think I am. I just tell them what they want to hear. When I speak my mind no one listens, no one really cares. They’re just enduring it, just like Im enduring them. It’s not a conversation, we’re just waiting our turn to speak. 

I’m in college now. Every friend I’ve made here has just used me for something. The latest friend I made, he just used me for drugs. He’d just come over and smoke my weed. I haven’t heard from him since I told him my stash went dry. It’s rare that I find someone who I can actually connect with. I have a few close friends and they honestly are the only ones keeping me going at this point.",25Apr2019,1
2,""" But even as I exit my latest depressive spell, I remain mindful of the people who are still there. I know what it means to smile for a photo and feel like you're lying. I know what it means to feel a vague sense of sadness over not feeling sadness. I know what it means to comb the Internet for a video, an article, a book, that explains what's going on inside your seemingly broken brain. To know depression is to become familiar with one of its paradoxes: the feeling that you're missing out on the full human experience is, in fact, a large part of the human experience.""

3,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 7-8 years.  It hit a very low point about a month ago, and I knew I needed to change before it was too late. I am forcing myself to go out and talk to people, I'm trying to pick up hobbies, and I set up an appointment with a therapist for the first time. 

At my low point I tried opening up to my parents about my issues. I took a few days off to go to my parents house and let them read through my journal since it was easier for me to convey my thoughts on paper rather than speaking. I didn't get the response that I wanted. It was along the lines of its all in my head, and I just need to be happy. I know they just want the best for me but it didn't help. I told them that while I appreciate their help,  it was making me feel worse, and I asked that we don't talk about it anymore. They agreed.

Everything went well until today. I have always spoken every day or so with my parents, and we have steered clear of my depression for the past couple weeks. I felt myself improving and actually somewhat optimistic for the first time last night. Today my dad asked if I was enjoying any of the hobbies I am trying. I answered honestly that I didn't, but was still going to force myself to follow through with them and hope for the best. He was frustrated and said some rather hurtful things to me. I don't think he realizes how much it hurt me, and I truly think in his mind he thought he was helping.

Since this morning my parents have called a couple times, which I chose to ignore. I don't really want to talk to them. Last time I talked to them about my depression I was essentially unable function for a few weeks afterwards. I felt so down and like such a waste of space that my productivity just flat out died. I don't know whether or not to call my parents back now. I can't afford to miss a few weeks since I have some major deadlines coming up in the next two weeks. Should I call them back, or continue to ignore their calls?",25Apr2019,1
4,"   I am currently 19 years old. Idk how it happened. it felt like yesterday I was 14 years old. I don't remember anything that happened to me in the last 5 years. I always had a problem with my emotions. I always feel like there's a constant weight pushing me down. I'm currently trying to learn to write software, and even had a job making a website, but they let me go since I couldn't be productive after I got dumped by my ex. My therapist says I have the symptoms of depression, and I didn't even think about that until now.

   I could never get any good grades in school, and even had to go to an alternative school where all the rejects go. I had teachers there wonder why I was even there, like they knew I just wasn't like them. In 2017 I had my first programming class. It was something I was looking forward to my entire life. I finished two year's worth of class work in 1. Which means this year, I'm just working on my own project (a lame text based adventure game that nobody cares about). But it just doesn't feel the same anymore. I used to love going there, I used to love programming. I used to love people, and I used to love myself.

   I guess it's just all the stress from the breakup, me getting fired and nobody caring. But I thought I should be over this kinda stuff, right? Like, the 5 stages of grief or whatever. But I feel like I'm stuck wherever I'm at. I don't see a future for myself. I don't really want to go down this path, but I don't have the motivation to do anything about it. So, yeah, idk what to do anymore. Maybe I'm just being stupid, maybe I should act my age. I always keep forgetting ill be 20 in 5 months.

   Anyways, I didn't know where to post this, so whatever I guess.",25Apr2019,1
5,"I made a post on r/depression that hasn't gotten a lot of attention, and right now my head is throbbing, I feel like puking, I cant stop picturing myself hanging dead from the ceiling. 

But its not me that's the problem. It's what I cant get away from. 

My mom decided to drive after taking ambien. She crashed into my grandma's front yard and she nearly killed someone. She also fled the scene. She's in jail at the moment, and I'm positive she's still delirious there. She takes ambien, among other drugs to help her sleep on a daily basis, if not more often. 

Now the rest of my family is either dismissive/enabling her or they are pressuring ME to nurse her. Because its ""tradition."" 

And how they dont realize that I'm still a danger to myself, let alone to others around me, it really irks me. And I've told them, I need independence or I'm gonna crash, but they still dont get it. 


Please, somebody help me. All I can think of is killing myself, because I believe that would help everyone get their shit together.",25Apr2019,1

They turn off the wifi most of the time so i cant go online, they put cameras and voice recorders in my room they are always watching me. They said they are sending me to a mental institude in Mexico, my therapist says I might go, or i'll get into the foster care system. 

&amp;#x200B;

So then about a year ago I started daydreaming that I had the perfect life and that i was beautiful, i wasn't shy, I was smart, taleneted, I looked my age, I could do whatever I want, I could wear pants and I was confident, I had friends, I was just like the girls on instagram, I was able to get out of the house and go places and smile and laugh, I imagined i had other parents and basically I made imaginary parents and imaginary friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I daydream in that world like 9 hrs a day, I found out its called maladaptive daydreaming.

I pace in circles, talk to myself, laugh to myself, cry to myself. The dreams are so vivid.

I didn’t take it because I can’t afford that. My regular doctor is in my hometown 30 miles away. They have been giving me a months worth of samples. I just have to call when I need them but I have to drive to get them. It’s been 3 months. I’m tempted to just ask my doctor to put me on something else. I don’t want to deal with the same thing next year. I went to get it today and i asked the price at the pharmacy. $89. Even with the savings card I get. I feel like I’m almost in tears every time. 

I support myself, im starting school soon even though I have loans already to pay off. I can’t help that I have severe depression but I refuse to pay that much for antidepressants.

13,"Since I’ve came home I’ve been isolated. Why do I still feel this way? I mean, I really am, but then, am I? I don’t see or speak to my family for long periods of time. I keep saying I’ll call, but whenever I do, it’s pointless anyway. The conversations are always the generic same things over and over again. So I don’t bother. The people I message, they never respond...I don’t understand it...even my own mother...I can’t stop thinking that maybe there is something wrong with me. Why won’t people talk to me? I can talk to anyone at work, I engage with thousands of people per week. 

I make coworkers laugh and it seems like they all like me. But none of them know me outside of work. I made one friend who’s coming to the gym with me. It should be interesting because it’s a hot yoga class and it’s his first time...seems strange I think to most people. But not to me. It’s just a thing I do and I think other people would love it if they gave it a chance and just didn’t think it was only for women. But even him, I text him, and he never responds sometimes. Is it just what people do?. 

Also, why does it have to me that always makes the first contact. Ok I texted every person from the gym, all of them answered. All had really good conversation (or so it seemed) all seemed willing to come over sometime or meet up. But none have responded since. Not one person has visited me since I’ve moved here. Think about that. I’m in one of the best locations in the world. 13 min from Times sq. It’s been almost 5 months. Not one person has even contacted me about coming. 

I don’t post my life on social media. Is this my repercussions? Abandoned and outcast? What more reason do I need to move to San Diego. Why not? No one here cares wether I’m here or gone. What I love about my attitude towards this is that I’m in the best shape of my life. And all I can think is, I’m better off alone. So is it my fault then that I’m alone? 

Without filling your social media with your day to day life, you stop existing to other people. That’s how I feel. In today’s world, people only want to know you if other people see what you’re up to. But idk.",25Apr2019,2

It’s a popular thing nowadays among youth to claim to have anxiety or depression, when in reality everyone gets sad or nervous sometimes. Get over yourself, holy shit. You are in charge of your own happiness, and if you really cared (or it really affected you), you would do something to take charge of it.

17,"Hi, firstly, I'm sorry I always keep coming back here with annoying posts about how sad I am and my situations.

Anyways, I found the root causes of my depression and it mainly revolves around my physical appearance and my inability to talk to those around me. It also doesn't help that I ruin my home life for everyone. My parents, especially my mom said that she hated coming home from work because of me. That I make her life hard. That I make everyone in my home unhappy and everything is my fault. Which I don't quite understand because all I do is stay in my room and cry every day of my life. 

I'm becoming more distant with my friends. I'm not too sure why but I can't be bothered hanging out with them anymore, because all the time I just feel insecure, self-conscious and not too good. I feel like I have to please them all the time and its just really frustrating.",25Apr2019,1
18,"It happens sometimes, and tonight is one of those nights. The depression is floating back in again. I dont think it's ever going to get to ""well controlled"" or whatever doctors say depression is supposed to end up as.

So I thought I might as well dump out here what's lurking in my head right now just to get it out there and maybe get some words of support about myself. I might as well get to it.

So one of my major symptoms in my depression is feeling horribly lonely and unloved. I see people happy together or shows with happy couples or people who just seem so in to other people and I feel like that kind of thing wont ever happen for me. No one actually wants someone boring and useless like me. Everything that I can do, someone else is better at it, so theres nothing that sets me apart, nothing people would want. 

I know in my head that the way I am right now I shouldn't get into any kind of relationship. No one should have to be subjected to what's floating around in me and no one should have to try and fix me. That's not right. I've spent a lot of my own time trying to fix other people to make myself feel better. Maybe I thought by fixing someone else my own problems would be fixed? Doesnt matter really. Either way, I know that I should focus on helping myself and getting myself to a spot where I can be stable. But I cant help feeling that even if I was ok, I wouldnt be able to find anyone who would want me. That's a hard thought.

My other thing that sits on my head is that I feel pretty worthless. I'm not going to make anything of myself. No one will remember me. Yes, I just got a pretty stable job, but it feels unimportant. Who would ever think about a laborer? Who admires someone who works in a manual labor field like me? So it feels like I'm not going to get somewhere in life. I know I can live a life now, but is that ever going to be one that's worth remembering?

This turned out a lot longer than I thought it would. I'm just going to leave it here and try my best to not get worse tonight. Hopefully I can get some kind of sleep and maybe feel better tomorrow?",25Apr2019,2
19,"I've known that I suffer from mental health issues pretty well since I was like 9 but I've never professionally addressed it until... well I have a doctor's appointment scheduled for about a month for now. I mention this because I've been going through normal break up woes that are greatly intensified by my mental health issues that I've left unattended to my whole life. Even when my life is good I go through weird mental stuff but when shit is already bad it is not fun. I've had these episodes where I don't physically attempt suicide but I just sit there all night in my dorm thinking about how much sense it would make and how much easier it would be if I didn't have to go through this shit every fucking day. Outside of those episodes I know suicide would be really dumb, but I've had that moment like 5 times in the past month, it scares me. I'm seeing a doctor for potential medication options and therapy referrals n shit, but I've had friends report me like literally 3 times within a two weeks span just because I mentioned what I was going through. The first time I def understood but after that it felt like I can't just talk to them as supportive friends without seeing my RA the next morning...

But still, even when I'm not dissociating all night... I fucking hate this shit. I've taken steps to make things better like weight loss and music and hanging out with friends more, and those things have been going really well too, but I still miss her. The pain is worse than anything else I've gone through, and I can't help but feel like if I wasn't mentally ill or at least was taking care of it by that point that things wouldn't have ended. I've never had something go south so fast, we went from complete love for each other and talking about how no one had ever made them feel like they did at that time to her telling me she kind of just wanted to be friends in four months, I'm still not over the whiplash even though it's been almost four months now since we split.

I hate making a mental health thing about heartbreak, but that's all it's been for months now. I never thought I could reach a point where I'd lose 10 pounds, make tons of new friends, get my grades up, cut down on all the smoking, make the best music I've ever made, just be on top of my shit in general more than ever... and still be this fucking upset. all the time. I just want someone to tell me that she probably does still love me and I should just reach out to her, or that with time us two will come around again, but I know that shit's not true. I literally can't let go and it's embarrassing and frustrating and infuriating and unbearable and illogical and fucking stupid. idk. i dont even know what this post is for.

25," Hey, before depression took over my life I\[23F\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.

At first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that ""bad phase"" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was ""this is almost acceptable"".

After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.

But I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like ""you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression"", ""depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life"", ""depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back"". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",25Apr2019,41

While I’m here, I would love to live life authentic to who i am.  That doesn’t mean running down the streets wearing lipstick and a rainbow flag.  the funny part is I have actually been fully out with every friend I’ve made since my first day of college back in 2013, but it’s something that only like 3 friends in West Virginia knew and they have since moved away.  While I’m here,  I just want to be unafraid of acknowledging my fundamental truth (like if someone asks me if I’m seeing anyone, i wanna be like no i haven’t met the right guy yet), go to the local pride organization’s summer picnics, and go to the one gay bar in the region because i have literally no friends left in this town and my parents don’t want most people they know to see me because they’re very embarrassed that my mental health collapsed and i had to move home.  I want to just be myself and unashamed.  

My mom is completely opposed to this.   She knows I am gay but my stepdad and 8 year old brother do not.   My stepdad is a very successful business owner in our region.  She says the things I mentioned earlier are selfish because I will damage my stepdad’s reputation and being out will result in my little brother getting bullied at school.  She says that i owe it to my stepdad and his dad for them to not have to deal with awkward questions from their friends. She says that when I recover and relaunch my life I’ll be going to a more metropolitan area anyway, so I should do the right thing and wait until I’m far away enough that no one in town will know about that side of me.   

They legitimately are doing a great deal for me.  They are giving me a place to live during this total collapse of my life and are paying for my therapy and other incidentals like food, so do I owe it to them to suck it up and go back in the closet until I relaunch my life?  Or is there a way for me to be true to myself even while I’m staying in “their” town while I recover my sanity?

Thank you for your advice, Chris",25Apr2019,2

30,"Apologies for how garbled this will probably be; I'm not the most eloquent when speaking about myself and am unsure what advice, if any, I'm after.

So I probably suffer with depression and anxiety (social and general) and as of very recently I've been dreaming of plans to do something ridiculous. In my dreams I've meticulously planned my demise and wake up every morning with an impending sense of doom and the motivation of a lump of granite. I've been like this before but had acquaintances and a job, and as of the last few months I have neither, but would like to have both. I've become reckless, taking out credit cards and maxxing them out, driving with no insurance and after drinking. This worries me. I've also taken to getting really drunk and starting fights with the biggest, angriest looking guy in the pub, despite being small and with a normally nervous disposition! I wake up feeling guilty after a night like this as it's so out of character; I usually really enjoy talking to people (before my social anxiety has left me feeling so awkward and uncommunicative that people pick up on it and they, in turn, get nervous and leave).

I've had CBT therapy before, which hasn't made any noticeable difference as far as I'm concerned. Possibly because I feel I have a really poorly developed sense of self. I hung out with people I didn't like in school just to be able to hang out with somebody and changed my personality to match theirs. I had no support at home (working-class Irish Catholic mother and middle-upper class Catholic father. Asking ""How are you?"" with any sincerity in our family is unheard of), and spent most of my time at home in my bedroom or out at acquaintances houses for days, sometimes weeks, on end. 

So I am now 28 and have no idea what I like and dislike or even who I am, despite trying many different things. I'll do an activity for a while and try to enjoy it, and then suddenly lose all motivation and love for said activity until it feels more like a chore. The best way I can describe the feeling is like all my positivity and sense of who I am is stacked on a top floor of a skyscraper. There are no other floors on this skyscraper and suddenly the floorboards of that floor break and everything that I've built on top of it falls for an eternity, with me in the middle of it trying to grab all the bits of me and put them together whilst falling through nothingness. Or a bathtub filled with all the bits that make ""me"" up, and the plug gets pulled and all the bits start going down the drain and my hands aren't big enough to stop it all draining out even though I try. Once this has happened I have nothing left of myself and I suppose I give up, and end up in a situation like the one I'm in now.

I don't like speaking to people about this and even if somebody sincerely asks I can't vocalise it and even completely forget how I am. Hours later I'll think about what my answer should have been and kick myself for not helping myself. Any advice? TIA x",25Apr2019,5
31,"I've been going to therapy regularly and started taking medication and I have felt zero improvement. I'm more and more frustrated with my doctors because nothing is working and I'm just sort of done.

Things are getting back to as they were, bad. Even though i have been seeking therapy for the past 4 months. Therapy did help me, i was motivated to do stuff, I was not overthinking much, i was gaining confidence and most importantly i was much healthier mentally and physically.
Suddenly since yesterday i have been getting really bad. 
I have noticed that i have started pulling out my hair unconsciously, my body keeps jerking, different body parts are numbing and twitching all the time, severe tightness all over my skull.
I am getting extremely sad, at first i was unable to cry and express grief, now that i tried writing my feelings down... i cried uncontrollably. I am distancing and hating everything i love. Either I can’t eat or im eating too much.
Even though im not suicidal, i am not able to see anything at the end of the tunnel.

I just need help.

33,"Hi everybody! Where I live, the waiting lists for mental health care are really long. I've been waiting for months now and was told today that the waiting time will be even longer than expected due to some of the therapists being ill. 

I feel like I can't wait much longer, because I am getting worse over time and I really don't know what to do. I was hoping that therapy would help me.. Do you have any advice for me on what to do untill I can get started with therapy?",25Apr2019,3

37,"Hey there. It would mean a lot to me if my post wouldn't die in new, because im putting all of my emotions (and time) into it, even though I should probably be learning for final exams. Sorry if some grammar-stuff or anything like that sounds weird, but English isn't my native language. Also this is a repost from the subreddit r/depression in case I don't get any replies over there.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if you have some good recommendations, I've been listening to a lot of emo-rap lately (like *Roses* from *Juice WRLD* or *Loyalty* from *Clever*) because I can actually kinda relate to those songs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I basically have no one to talk to about this, except you guys. I feel like, if I tell my parents I would most likely insult their parenting in some way. In school (and that's a fact, not just my way of thinking) everyone would probably make fun of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Some nights I'm laying in my bed, staying awake until 4 am, thinking about what a mess I am. On other nights I'm sitting in the window frame^(?) of my room, enjoying the view, listening to music, sometimes while crying. I could probably talk endlessly about why I'm feeling down, but I think I'll just stick with the main reasons here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 10, maybe 11, I had exactly 7 friends. Since I was the one who always had to text (really cheap first smartphone with no apps or games) or call the person I wanted to meet up with I got quite annoyed by it. I just stopped contacting them to see who at least was interested enough in our friendship to contact *me*. This lead to me losing 5 friends.

Even my *best* friend, whom I'd known since I was born, was amongst them. At first, I tried to keep up the conctact with him (while this little ""experiment"" of mine was taking place), because I really didn't want to lose him as well. But then he did something, that really **yelled ""I dont want to be around you"".** I sadly don't exactly remember what he did, because a lot of time has passed since then, but I felt absolutely betrayed. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I did, that made them ***hate*** me. I **hated** *myself* for beeing so stupid, that I didn't even know what exactly I did for them to despise me. Even though as of now I think I didn't do anything silly for them to turn their backs against me.

This happening, while puberty kicking in, you guessed it, didn't quite end well.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year later my grandfather got cancer. I kind of wished I'd have been  around him more towards his death, because we really had a stronger bond than most grandfathers and grandchildren have, but it was just too painful too see him this helpless. He almost comepletely stopped talking a few days before his death because it would hurt him. Meaning, he only said something when it was important. I remember visiting him a week before he passed. After I got up from his bed and told him goodbye he said, in this really weak voice, just ""goodbye"". We both knew, that it would probably be the last time we get to talk and see each other, which was the case.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 my father got cancer. Due to surgerys, he luckily was able to survive. Though, because of the surgerys, he mostly wasn't able to work for 2 years, which is why my parents and I (to this day) have financial problems.

&amp;#x200B;

^(At this point I've had depressions at least for over 4 years. -&gt;) About 3 months ago, it started too look like it was going uphill for me once. Even just thinking about getting happier made me cheer up a little. I had (and actually still have) a huge crush on a girl from my class, because she basically was the first person in my life to tell me I'm cute, or give me compliments at all. We also listen to the same music, do the same stuff in our free time, etc. The only problem was, that she had a boyfriend. So I figured it's just her way to express herself and doesn't really mean she's interested in me. But then she broke up with him and I was kind of hoping for a chance. After seeing and spending time with her in class almost everyday for about another 2 weeks, we were invited to the same party (pls dont think of me as an extrovert lol). We were sitting inside the living room, just talking about stuff, when she suddenly outed herself, saying she was probably lesbian. This hit me genuinely hard because she was, and is, the only girl I **really** showed interest in so far. Especially, because I was just a few days away from asking her out for a date. I instantly knew she wasnt lying, because she was still quite sober, and usually people (especially if she would've been drunk) dont just make stuff like that up, out of nowhere.

My self-esteem has yet again hit rock bottom. I was finally having the hope to get out of my depressions, to get happy, to not be lonely. But that hope was crushed in an instant. Out of nowhere. It hit me like a truck, and It's like I'm still in a coma. I guess I'm just not meant to be happy.",25Apr2019,5
38,"I constantly feel this way. Perhaps it's not depression maybe something else. Anyway, I feel down on myself or just outright nothing and lay in bed. I understand that I need to do something but I never want to do the things I need to do. There's not much to this, and I'm unsure if this makes sense. I think i picked the wrong sub/flair but I'm not looking for advice just words I guess.",25Apr2019,3
39,"For over a year now, I've been struggling with severe major depression. Before it hit me like a train in January of 2018, I was a happy college student, majoring in Electrical Engineering and my main hobby was music. I was so avid about both these things that I made an Arduino play an original piece that I composed.  


I was even learning foreign languages--Russian and Japanese--as well as improving upon my skills in German.  


Then, it happened: winter break came after the final exams of my first semester. Finally, I had the time to do other stuff like play *Rainbow Six: Siege,* my favorite video game. Basically, I did this for two weeks straight until Christmas. Well, I started to notice that, instead of instantly, I took thirty or so minutes to get out of bed. However, I attributed this to laziness and me needing a break.  


But when I got back, this persisted. I couldn't help it...but I thought that maybe it was just that the break wasn't long enough...But I was wrong. So horribly mistaken. After only a week of classes, I slept four twelve hours. I didn't get out of bed for another four. ""What's wrong with me?"" I thought to myself. Indeed, something was wrong with me.  


Eventually, I had to leave college because it got so bad that this was happening every day. On top of this, I withdrew socially because I didn't want to be seen like this; I thought people would think of me as lazy.  


Fast forward a year and I'm still not cured. I'm still unhappy. In fact, my hope is rapidly deteriorating and I really need some kind of magic pill or something, lest I do something that most would advise against...But my suffering seems not to want to end! The only way to be cured, I feel, is to quarantine the disease that afflicts me by ending its existence...That is to say...ending my own existence...

Finally the weekend comes and I feel relieved that I have time to myself but it’s too much time and before I know it I’m pretending to everyone that I’m fine when honestly, I’m not me anymore.

42,"It felt like I have had this battle with depression since I was a kid. I make plans and I set goals for better improvement like working out and going to the gym but my anxiety gets the best of me of being in a closed space with a lot of people.

 

I want to eat healthier but my budget.. it isn't something flexible where I can buy what I want when I want. Usually leaving me barely scrapping by for food. I work at a local fast food restaurant, I get discounts so I eat there. I know it is not healthy.. and I feel extreme guilt when I eat there.  

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue with myself is the Commitment. I have had this problem with myself for oof i don't remember. This is why I am out of touch with a lot of things. I do not know anything that is well known in mainstreams, academics, or anythings. I learn about things for a brief moment and I drop the things of whatever I was trying to commit to. Like drawing, creative writing, learning languages, health improvements,  and the list goes on.  Which is one of the reasons why I don't have a clue of a future career (major) to do or plan for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be stuck the way I am. I do want to improve. For myself this time. I did in the past before for someone who ended up betraying my trust.

The sucky part with myself is I am falling in love with someone, again. We both are aware that we like each other, we are not ready to date.  We hold hands and kiss each other on the cheek, but nothing too serious. Cliche as it sounds, I am hurt from my past. I do not want to hurt or burden them.

44,"Hi, I'm not even sure I'm in the right sub-reddit but I don't know what to do with myself anymore. My mom used to joke and tell my dad and I, ""You're all lucky, you can get away from me but I'm stuck inside my own head"" and sadly as an adult at around the same age I feel the same. Mental illness is genetic I know. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where I'm stuck in my own head and I just need to ride the emotion out and I'll be better later because honestly I am like this almost every day. 

I'm lonely. I don't have any other words to explain it. I'm an introvert that is turning recluse and I'm happy yet at the same time I need someone. I realize how incredibly ridiculous this is going to sound so feel free to tell me to fob off. 

I'm married to my soulmate and I'm so incredibly lucky/blessed to have him. I wouldn't be a functioning adult without him. He has an incredible family who has accepted me as their own and supports me in ways I'm amazed that they do. I should be happy and grateful for them in my life but the truth is I feel empty in the friend department. 

Growing up I didn't have many cousins and no brothers or sisters around my age to play with. When I started school I was still a loner. Not that I wanted to be, its just that I'm like a wallflower and people easily forget me. When people set up plans to hang out and get drinks after work, or go shopping or anything I'm not the first person to come to their mind. I guess what I'm saying is I wish I could have a best friend, other than my husband. I have social anxiety and very rarely I get the feeling people want to spend more time with me. My anxiety makes me think its something I've said or done but in reality I'm in my 30's and no one has best friends anymore.

47,"I’ve always knew I was a depressed kid since I was in the first grade. Would constantly cry and had trichotillomania. My parents being immigrants and unaware of the stress and pressure put on me as a child were oblivious to my struggles and exasperated my symptoms through more yelling and harsh words. Fast forward to high school/ college, I worked my tail off and managed to get into medical school, telling myself all the pushing and pain was worth it, mom having polio/being wheelchair bound as my inspiration. After 6 months into my first year of medical school I had burnt out so badly I had to take medical LOA. It felt terrible but I knew of some in my family and friends who have done so before. During my time off, I tired SSRIs/ antidepressants and had been feeling terrible from the side effects(only been a few days). It has gotten to the point where I am debating if this whole med school thing is worth it. I was depressed before and had been finding ways to cope, but medical school was so much pressure that my coping skills were inefficient. They had gotten so bad that I was fed up and had thought of hurting myself (didn’t do it though). Now, in my time off I feel great. I can eat well, enjoy my life and don’t feel bad at all. But, the faculty at my medical school wants updates and progress on my mental health (meds/therapy) to ensure I come back ready to work hard. The thing is, I wonder what it would be like to do something else and not feel woozy/ numb from the meds. I want a good life without the use of medication (I know that it is possible for me). But the thing is, medical school had bruised me so much, for me to get through it and repeat the year (the anxiety, depression will come back) I feel I would need some sort of medication for me to even consider coming back with the same horsepower and calm mental state. 
TL;DR: Didn’t feel the need to self medicate for previous depression/ anxiety that was manageable till medical school. Feel strongly to want to be a physician but wonder if it’s worth it knowing I can chose to enter another program without resorting to medication to deal with the excess burnout/stress on the long road to be a physician.
