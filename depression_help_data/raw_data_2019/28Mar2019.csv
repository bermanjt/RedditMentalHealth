0,"I’m hanging by a thread and that thread is ripping and ripping. I was almost admitted into the psych ward Monday morning but I talked my way out of it; I can’t do it, I can’t afford it, I’ll lose my job. The walls are closing in on me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so alone and empty. My life is so alone and empty. I’m not sure how much longer I will be around. The thought haunts me, it’s always with me. I don’t know what to do. I just want to collapse in somebody’s arms. All I think about is dying. I’m so alone. Please bring me back. Please bring me back.

I’m just so low and my quality of life is so low, I can’t handle it anymore. Everything I want to do to better myself and my life, I can’t do. I can’t go back to school as I planned because I owe money to the university out of pocket that I can’t afford to pay. I can’t move out of my father’s apartment — where I live from a couch and everything I own is thrown into the basement, therefore I have no distractions — because I have no money. I can’t get a different job because this is the only type of work I know how to do; I have no skills, no real degree. I feel so hopeless. I have no money, no quality of life, no real reason to live. I’m in sinking debt. I’m 31 and I have nothing to show for it. I look around and I see people with real lives, full lives; families, a home, a career...I have nothing. I don’t think I’m ever crawling out of this depression. This is my life now. I can’t get it out of my head. She’s living her best life...and I’m barely hanging on. I miss her so fucking much...

I want to feel alive again. I want to be happy again. I just don’t see it happening.

And when I came back to classes, I just became more and more depressed and I often cried because of it. I'm sure it was because of how I was lacking in my class and I compared myself to others(I know, I shouldn't be doing that. But I still do it). And the teachers were pin pointing and asking questions and I couldn't answer them while others were giving answers, made my brain tell me that I'm so worthless.

5,"Yeah, I’m probably the most depressed I’ve been in my life as I’m typing this right now. My mom just came into my room-I’m fucking 21 btw- and asked if I needed to go to another counselor or therapist. I’ve been to 3 counselors in my life and haven’t felt any different from when I walked in. The first couple were about my late father, who passed away when I was 14. I knew he was going to die for a couple of years so I didnt need any consoling. I don’t see a point talking about my problems because I know the what the answer is. It’s going about the answer that takes away all of my motivation, happiness and pride.

I couldn’t possibly be anymore of the middle of the pack than I am. I have spurts of greatness, but when the moment matters, I never fail to embarrass myself. I’m so average at everything, it makes my suicidal thoughts easier to think about, since it would probably get the job done. It breaks my soul everytime my mom asks me about a job interview that I skipped, a job that I gave up on, or just asking about my mental health in general. I can’t look her in the eyes and tell her I’m not okay and that I’m not the son she loves. She has done everything right as a parent and I let her down constantly.

I’m at a crossroad and I’m just about to lose myself. I don’t want to see disappointment anymore in those I love. I have had my opportunities squandered and it crushes me looking back at them. Can’t think of anything right I’ve done in my life now that I think of it. I’m just a colossal mess that hinders growth to everything around me. I’m not religious, but if there is a god, please send me some kind of blessing that redirects my life.",28Mar2019,2

9,"I’m not okay, and I know I’m not. When I try to explain what’s wrong with me, I just feel like I’m whining and being a burden on those around me. It only causes me to push them away more. I feel like I’m stuck. Like I can either only stop telling them what’s going on in my head, or just lie and pretend like it’s all okay.

I’m being told to see a therapist, but I’m a full time student and have three jobs just to stay afloat. It’s hard enough just getting through that. And no one around here has any late night sessions I can get.

I feel like I’m supposed to be the strong one. I always have been. I always am the shoulder for my friends and family. Even my parents look to me to be the emotional support at times. But who is my shoulder? I don’t know who to turn to now. Or how I can help myself to make these heavy feelings just go away.

I’m sensitive. Sometimes even the smallest of things will have me sent on such a spiral where I feel like I’m underwater and can’t breathe. Like I can’t get out of bed to go to class. Or I’ll cancel plans with people just because I don’t have the energy to leave my apartment.

11,"To begin with, I'm not sure if I truly do have depression or not, so bear with me. Also, please forgive my bad grammar. I'm writing this off the top of my head, so I don't really care about grammar correction. 

My dad was a paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed anti-vaxxer who came from a screwed up, dysfunctional family who are responsible for most of the reason why my life is horrible today. In the meantime, my mom was the sane one who was just trying to make ends meet. My dad went insane when I was 5-years old, so he decided to pull me out of school and have me homeschooled. It was a horrible decision. To this day, I still resent him for it, as well as my mom for allowing it. 

I was homeschooled and extremely lonely. The sort of emotions and situations that I went through were just weird. I don't really know how to put it into words, other than that I felt like I was missing a huge part of my life. Of course, my mom always tried to boost me up by saying I was a smart child, but I was struggling in mathematics. I'm not sure if I just couldn't understand, or if my mom didn't have the patience to teach me well, but she was always blowing up on me because I couldn't get it. It made my self-esteem even worse than it already was: not only did I feel like I was dumb for not understanding math, but I already felt like a weirdo and a loser at such a young age for being homeschooled. 

To make matters worse, we were a family of night owls. I would go to bed past midnight and wake up past noon, and since I didn't go to school, my dad didn't see it as a problem. I went on sleeping late and waking up late from the time I was 5 to the time I was probably in 6th grade.

There weren't that many opportunities for me to socialize and make friends. I did make friends with a few of the neighborhood kids, and my mom eventually managed to meet other homeschooling families later on in 5th grade, but for the most part, I was alone. 

I excelled at reading and history, but it was always math that I was weak in. I'm not sure if it's because my mom ruined my confidence for it at such a young age, or if I've just always been deficient in that area. I can't say for sure, but I guess it's a combination of both. 

In the meantime, my dad quit working and decided to stay at home all day playing video games. That's what he's still doing now; he's been bumming off of my mom since 07. During this whole time, he was very controlling. He didn't let us eat out, and I would be punished for eating a candy bar that didn't say ""organic"" on it. I understand the health aspect of it now that I'm older, but what he did to us back then was just obsessive. He filled me with paranoia, and my mom couldn't bear to divorce him because I would cry and beg her not to leave my dad. Nowadays, I wish my mom would have just went through with a divorce, but I didn't think that way as a child. She was pretty much forced to put up with his delusional bullcrap for 15 years, and she still is.

I grew up with this heavy feeling of loneliness and paranoia that I couldn't tell anyone about. I couldn't tell my mom. My dad was too stupid to understand. My grandparents were on the same bandwagon as my dad, so I couldn't tell them anything, and my mom's grandparents couldn't speak English. There was no family who could intervene.

 My mom made my self-esteem even worse because she couldn't put up with how nervous I was. She was always frustrated that I couldn't swim, that I couldn't open boxes and packages of food, that I couldn't tie my shoelaces, blah blah blah. Both she and my dad *insisted* that NORMAL kids my age knew how to do ""basic things like that."" They made my self-esteem even worse. I was 9-years old and already feeling like a failure and a friendless weirdo. I had poor social skills. I felt stupid. 

(I did learn how to do all these things, by the way.)

I did fairly well at school up until 5th grade. For 6th grade, my mom decided to enroll me in an online school, and during my first year there with the new curriculum, I really struggled. The only subject I did very well in was history. 7th, 8th, and 9th grade were pretty much a repeat of 6th. Now that I'm in 11th grade, I'm seriously freaking depressed, because I can see that I'm lazy and messy and my future is bleak. Sometimes I just feel like giving up and disappearing out of everybody's life. It's so pointless for me to be here. 

I still don't have any friends. Being ostracized is normal for me. 

Why'd I post this here? I just needed somewhere to vent, and I really wish somebody on here could give me advice, because no one else in my life really cares.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I respect other people's political views concerning vaccines. This post was meant to disparage only my dad for personal reasons. If you don't believe in vaccinating your kids, that's fine; I respect that. It's just that my dad went overboard, that's all. 

TL;DR: I was homeschooled all of my life because my dad was paranoid. I grew up feeling lonely and empty inside, and now that I'm in 11th grade, my future is bleak and hopeless.

12,"I’ve struggled with depression on and off throughout most of my adult life. The most recent time where I felt on a high was the last trimester of my pregnancy up until I got back from visiting my family with my son about a month ago. 

More and more, I am beginning to trail off into thinking I’d be better off just gone. Never planning or acting on it, just wondering what life would be like if I vanished off the face of the earth. Immediately my mind thinks of my son. He needs me. How could I be so selfish to have these thoughts? How could I? 

Just as I am starting to have doubts about my relationship with my child’s father, I find out he had been cheating on me up until two months before I found out I was pregnant. I confronted him about it, and his response was that I already knew about it and he didn’t want to talk about it again. 

Which, is true. I did find out about one secret relationship he had. What I didn’t know was that even after confronting him back then, he still went and saw the same person and a month later sought out any available individual to give him oral via Craigslist. 

I feel... so utterly worthless. Like I don’t matter. I feel ashamed, used, embarrassed, and lonely. 

Even as he is sleeping so peacefully beside me now... I’m tortured with all these thoughts. He made it obvious he didn’t want to talk when he got home. I guess my feelings just don’t matter. I’m stuck in this situation and have to live with it until I’m able to get myself and my son out of it, I guess. Who knows. 

I’ve never been enough for the person I loved so much. I was so excited to start our own family together and now... I just feel completely empty. I just want to be a good mom. ",28Mar2019,2

19,"What makes you feel intense shame, guilt and worthlessness? Sex? Porn? Alcohol? Drugs? Cutting? Codependency?

All of our addictions and self destructive behaviors have one thing in common, they provide us with a maladapted form of pleasure and comfort that invariably makes us feel more shame and guilt, forming a self destructive feedback loop.

Many therapists treat the symptoms by distraction with positive activities, or medication to treat the resulting symptoms of depression and anxiety, or maybe they explore what the pay off is that we get from self destructive behaviors and then try to replace them with less self destructive coping mechanisms.

This is like treating a headache with painkillers when the problem is dehydration… dehydration is the cause of the headache and the most effective way of treating your headache is rehydration, perhaps in combination with a pain killer… but to have pain killers every day for the rest of your life for a dehydration headache does not make any logical sense at all.

So too, we need to focus on why we feel intense and disproportionate shame, guilt and worthlessness in the first place. 

Usually, most of this sort of thing begins in childhood. In the worst of cases we are violently abused physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically and usually for no reason at all… as a child we then learn that we are essentially a bad, worthless person and we feel intense shame and guilt for being a bad, worthless person, even though we don't know why, and we accept it as fact.

From then on, every “bad” thing we do confirms that we are a bad worthless person who deserves to feel intense shame and guilt. As we get older, things such as masturbation, romance, sex, alcohol, drugs all are viewed as naughty, or bad and by then filling any emotional need, dulling any emotional pain fills us with even more shame and guilt… but by now we accept that a measure of pain, shame, guilt and worthlessness is the “normal” price to pay for a tiny bit of dysfunctional pleasure, comfort or escape.

The cause is easy to identify… early childhood abuse… treating it is difficult, and requires the courage to come face to face with your darkest buried fears and traumas. Most of these intense emotional traumas are almost inextricably linked with thoughts of guilt,  shame and worthlessness… and as such are stored deep in our fight or flight response. That is why we usually first put up strong resistance to probing our childhood traumas… our mind knows that this is an area of extreme seemingly inescapable pain and so must be avoided at all costs, which is yet another reason why distracting ourselves with self destructive behaviors is done.

Let's make it simple… if you were a parent, and a stranger came into the room and started yelling and screaming abuses at your child,  ridiculing and humiliating it and then physically abusing it, what would you do? How would you feel? The appropriate response is to get angry, stand up, fight, defend your child at all costs. WE are that child… and more often than not we tell ourselves that we deserve to feel worthless, ashamed and guilty.

Whatever it takes, don't give in to rage at any individual in the present moment, but in a controlled way do whatever it takes to allow yourself to switch from feelings of guilt, shame and worthlessness into sheer anger and defiance over the abuse and injustice perpetrated against you in your childhood that made you feel that you are a bad person who deserves to feel ashamed, guilty and worthless.

Anger is a very important emotion to master if we want to drive change in our mind and life… not anger at an individual, but anger at the injustice itself so that you reinforce your right and determination to treat yourself better and to start teaching others how to treat you better.

Only after processing our injustices with disdain and anger, in a measured and appropriate amount, can we achieve resolution to the deep psychological scars in our mind and achieve peace and acceptance so that we can move forward in a productive way.

22,"Hello, I've struggled with depression (diagnosed) until last year, so I'm pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and she's now convinced that she has depression, I didn't say anything because I don't want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I don't think so (but again, i'm not the one who should say it). First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and it's always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldn't (and sometimes still can't) get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. 

All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I can't really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like ""oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple!"" and I was like wtf, first of all I'm not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.",28Mar2019,2

Two days ago without warning he broke up with me saying that he doesn't want to hurt me and that he is not stable and can't treat me the way I should be treated. He left and I sent him a message that I consider it only a break for him to sort things out. He didn't reply and we have not talked since then. He is a Doctor and met my friend his colleague in the ER and asked her about me then told her that he is about to enter a depression episode of bipolar and he doesn't want to hurt me with his problems and he is not stable for a relationship.
I don't know what to do
I am worried about him
