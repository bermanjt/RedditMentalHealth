0,"I'm at a loss. I'm not exactly sure if this belongs here, because it's difficult to say at what point normal grief turns into depression but considering that I've struggled with depression before, I guess this is the right sub.
Exactly four weeks ago my younger brother (24) committed suicide after battling depression for years, unbeknownst to anyone. We were very close, he was my everything and now that he's gone I feel like I don't want to and also cannot live without him. The thought of never again being able to talk to him, hug him drives me insane. Since he died I've spent hours every day just crying. And it feels like being back in my worst depressive episodes, but multiplied by 100, knowing that it won't be over in a few days. What makes everything even more difficult is the fact that I'm currently in a different country on a working holiday visa and have to find a new job because they let me go at my old job because I wanted to go home for two weeks for my brother's funeral. I have no idea how I'm supposed to write applications, go to job interviews, sell myself and pretend I'm the right candidate for anything when I can't even get out of bed and brush my teeth. There's nothing that I enjoy anymore, all I'm feeling is this gigantic pain, it's unbearable. I miss him more than I can say, I can't believe this is actually happening. And it's not getting easier, quite the opposite, I feel like the pain is getting more intense every day, although I would have never thought that to be possible. I don't want my parents to lose another child, it would be the death of my mum, but I don't think I can tolerate this pain any longer. Life without him makes no sense. What am I supposed to do?",05May2019,3

10,"Hi so my friend is depressed. She's having a really hard time finding help from a psychiatrist. When she went they didn't help her. I'm one of the few people she's told about this. Recently she told me that she started cutting and I'm the only one she's told about this. I don't know what to do other than keep telling her that I'm open to listen anytime. I feel really helpless and frustrated and sad because I feel like there's nothing I can do. I want her to get help and I want her to stop cutting but she's addicted now and refuses to tell anyone else, which is understandable. I promised I wouldn't tell anyone but I feel like I should. At the same time I think that if I told someone it might end our friendship and the trust she had for me. If that happens I'm worried that she'll have nobody to talk to.

12,I dont know what subreddit to post this in. So i choice this one. My life currently is.. Shit and i want to make a change but im finding that difficult. About 1 and a half year ago i weighted about 220. About a year later i lost about 80 pounds and went down to 160. I gained alot of friends but i always favored one friend. He was a great guy and we lost weight together. He knows all the friends i know. In short we had a argument and well we went are separate way. After this the next days were hell. He made it seem like i was some type of villain and had 80% of my friends switch on me. A month later i broke my hand and had to stop goalkeeping. Sadly i stopped playing it to this day. Those months were depressing and it lead me up to this moment today. I gained 20 pounds and want to change my whole life. I dont know where to start or what to do. I need help im slowly just watching my eyes fall right in front of me and at this right im going to end up being just a junkie,05May2019,4
13,"While I am not depressed rn now I am feeling pretty damn shitty about myself some back story.

Me and My GF have been dating for about 5 months now and its been great. Sure there has been little stuff that bothers me but who doesn't have that, and it doesn't make me love her any less. 

Tonight was prom and I was really excited I couldn't wait to talk to all the people we knew and dance and eat. we had talked about having sex afterwords witch I was eh about but she really wanted to so I said sure. She wanted to leave early so we could have some sex and wanted to leave early, which I was really Sad about because I really wanted to keep interacting with people TBH I didn't really care about sex like I just wanted to dance and have fun at prom THIS WAS OUR LAST YEAR.  but we left anyway, now this is on me, I should have said ""I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE"" but I just hinted at not wanting to, so this is my bad. I just wanna stop here stories not done I know but I want to be. Heres what happened She gets anxiety and has a lot of guilt about sex(Christan)  which I totally get and I'm ok with, but we left from early to do this. So we stopped at a park and looked at stars  we did this in silence for a long while and while I was staring up at the constellation Something in my BROKE, when I closed my eyes all I saw was A black lighter without the find and steal, however it burned brighter as a result, but It needed another lighter to light it . She asked me how I felt and I said I felt Grey, and I felt like nothing, I felt like that lighter. I could burn so bright but I need someone to light me. We had plans with friends so we went there and I said nothing, which is really weird because normally I'm the life of the party, but today I just wanted to DISAPPEAR. I drove her home without saying a word 

The sex is not really important I think the answer is I feel like I lost an opportunity  

I want to tell her how I feel but that would hurt her and I  do love her 

I just feel really shitty, perhaps this is irrelevant here but I don't know where else to post I need help 

IF YOU SEE THIS I AM SORRY   
I LOVE YOU 

I AM SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT I Know i shouldn't post this but I want to say something",05May2019,1

15,"I'm not sure where to speak about this or who to speak to. I basically hate hanging out with my friends and I never go to parties. I love them but that's exactly why I don't want to be around them.
Today is one of my close friend's birthday party and I'm terrified to go. I've cried 4 times today, about an hour each and I feel like I might just sit there with the face that makes everyone ask if I'm ok. I don't want to ruin it for her. I want the attention to be on her, not on my zoned out face.
 Every one of them is sick of me making excuses for not hanging out: ""my parents won't let me go untill I clean my room"", ""I twisted my ankle"", bla bla bla. I'm sure they realize they're all lies by now. At this point having fun is just another errand I have to get out of the way. 
I hate that they don't hate me for this. I don't deserve any of my friends and they don't deserve to be treated the way I treat them.

16,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have time to talk, but a lot of people have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",05May2019,1

20,"Hi everyone,
My boyfriend has been in a bad place, and despite my best efforts to motivate him and give him advice, I feel like it’s only going so far, and though through my own depression I try to look for positivity in everything, he doesn’t feel the same way.
He took the nursing school exit test once and didn’t pass, just barely, and he’s waiting to take it again. He is trying his best to study for it but finds himself wanting to help other friends because he “can’t say no” and his study habits aren’t so great. I’ve given him advice for those, since I’m a teacher, but he’s still not taking it.
Besides me, he feels really alone and he lost contact with his old nursing friends since they passed and he feels like they wouldn’t want to see him. I keep telling him to just try to reach out, but I think I’m sounding like a broken record.
His family and friend relations just add onto the BS he’s dealing with, along with money troubles but I won’t go into specifics there. It’s just that he’s really losing any motivation and hope and confidence, and the confidence was his trait i truly envied but admired. I truly worry that if he doesn’t pass that he might make a terrible decision, and he’s even said it.
Does anyone have any advice either on ways to motivate oneself or to study despite feeling like this? Or does anyone have suggestions to get help for him: psychiatric help wouldn’t be feasible financially but I’d be willing to help in some way.
I genuinely appreciate your help and I appreciate all the people brave enough to seek their own help here.",05May2019,2

23,"Good day everyone. To start, thanks for taking time to read this post. 

I feel like the most useless son right now because I can see my mum suffering and going to a dangerous path and I don't know how to help. 

It started last year February when my brother's wife was about 6 months pregnant and lost her babies (twins) due to complications with the pregnancy. It really messed my family up and my mum took it especially bad because they would have been the first grandchildren for her. It incident brought pain to my brother and his wife and everything they saw reminded them of the loss so they eventually moved overseas for a fresh start. This move again had a very negative effect on my mother who felt not only the loss of the grandchildren but not felt that she was losing her son and was not going to see him again (my mum, brother and wife were really close and spent a lot of time together). 

My mum has been slowly going down a path where she feels like its not worth being alive, she just stays in bed mostly, on a whole bunch of meds and sleeping pills, hardly wants to go out. We went to visit my brother last year and she was so energetic and vibrant, but as soon as we got back it started again. Now its even worse because she and her best friend had a falling out. She sits and cries and if I try and help she just says no. She doesn't want to go speak to a professional because she says she already knows what they will say (she briefly spoke to a professional with my brother and wife after their loss).

She has good and bad days, today was a bad day. I was talking to her and she just started crying, saying she wonders if she is such a bad person that her friend just left her, that everything always goes bad, that she has let people down..she takes things on that aren't even her responsibility. What scares me is when she starts grabbing her chest and stammering, I am worried about her but I don't know what to do.

I went through my own state of depression last year and just gave up, and I would have still been there or worse if I didn't make drastic changes in my life, all thanks to my parents. They don't know bad I got but their actions saved me. Now I want to help but how do you start to get someone help when they dismiss it? Where should I start? I am completely lost and would appreciate any advice on how to approach this. 

Thanks in advance.",05May2019,3

Hey... So this post is probably going to be a bit messy, since even writing this is hard right now...
I’m gonna try to make this short, so here it goes. Today, like many other days, i’m feeling down... I’m not tired but just so low on energy, so low on energy that i can’t get anything done. And my room looks like shit, I haven’t eaten proper healthy food in way too long, haven’t worked out, haven’t gotten anything done... And i need to clean my room, i need to finish a translation job my dad asked me to help with, I need to make dinner, I need to take a shower... But i just can’t.
I’m so tired of not doing anything and then feeing guilty about it. Basically nothing feels good, not even laying in bed and watching netflix like i usually enjoy...

So tell me, please... How can i get things done today?",05May2019,3
26,"So 2 weeks ago the best relationship I was ever in ended. It was totally out of the blue, completely blind sided me, and there were no warning signs. No arguments, no red flags for either of us, no signs of hesitation or growing apart until it suddenly ended. I've been struggling heavily.

Dont get me wrong, I've been heart broken before. I'm 34, I've been in other relationships in the past which didnt work out and while they hurt, there were always warning signs and I always was able to reflect.upon myself and try and learn from the experience so I would be better prepared for whatever came next. While I've been really depressed before from endings, this has felt entirely different. I am having serious trouble doing basic things or finding any joy in life. I've been doing all the things that help me normally get over this stuff, going to the gym, working on my art, focusing on training dance and circus (I've been a visual performer for a decade), hanging out with friends. Nothing helps. 

A bit of background about how the relationship ended. 2 days before we split she began to get pretty distant in texts, something really unusual for us. I tried to dismiss it knowing she was stressed about her finals. The night before we split I mentioned I had a surprise for her, I had planned a spa day for her because I knew she was stressed. She never responded. The following day I knew something was off, so i asked if something was wrong and maybe i was just imagining things but i felt like something was amiss. She said that she did have stuff she wanted to talk about but it wasnt because of me or us, that I'm wonderful and she's just done a lot of thought about her own situation. She wanted to have the convo in person, but after 30 minutes of stressing and feeling crazy anxiety I asked if I could call her because I couldn't take my mind off the situation and I was at work. She called me up and that's when we had the break up conversation. She said I was amazing, everything she has wanted in a person, that she has never opened up to someone so much and she cant express how wonderful our relationship has been, but she still has a lot of barriers and boundaries she built up to protect herself and her heart from past really bad relationships and she wasnt ready to let those guards down. She said she didnt want this to be our end, but also didnt want to keep me waiting indefinitely while she figured her stuff out. I tried and tried to talk to her, to express that when something is healthy and good and supportive hold onto it because it's rare, but nothing helped to alter the course or change her mind. We spoke once more, briefly, a few days later. I really missed her, and made the mistake of reaching out. She expressed she really missed me as well, and that the break up was much harder for her than she had expected, but she still felt like it was the right choice and she needed time to figure herself out. We haven't spoken since. I had to delete her number and our texts as rereading them was killing me, seeing her photos was heart wrenching. 

I cant shake this awful feeling that there is more to the story than she is letting on. She said a few times that she didnt meet anyone else, that there isn't a reason she isn't telling me, but I'm having a lot of trouble accepting and rationalizing that she ended things because they were too good and it spooked her. I know it wasnt due to disputes or obvious mixed feelings, because we both were clearly head over heels about each other. Since the split I've been having a lot of trouble doing anything. I wake up thinking about her and it brings tears, and then my mind wonders if she is thinking of me, and the next thought is this awful irrational ""shes probably laying with someone else right now, not even concerned with you at all"". Its driving me crazy, and I cant tell if it's a legit crazy thought or if maybe my intuition is right, just like it was right that something was up. Life tastes like cardboard, and instead of getting easier after several weeks, it's only gotten harder.

I know this sounds hella dramatic, but it feels like the light in my heart that has always kept me up and positive and hopeful even through the worst times has gone out. I want more than ever for everything to just come to an end. I won't end it because I cannot deal with the grief and sadness it would inflict on my friends and family, but I also feel like I have less will to live than ever before.

I dont know what I'm asking for really.. maybe someone to tell me it will be ok in a way I actually believe? Maybe someone to tell me to trust her for what she said as to why it ended and convince me to stop spinning out and finding alternate reasons for why she ended things. 

I need help :(",05May2019,9

During these long stretches of work my depression starts to get pretty bad. Then I get upset with myself because I feel like I’m being a complainer or a wimp.

It confuses me and hurts.

Do people who deal with depression use Facebook as a tool to escape and maybe convince themselves they feel better by being able to be whomever they want to be since it is behind a computer screen? If you were going through a depressive spiral, would you still be able to log on and post things about happy stuff going on in your life and interact with people?

33,"POSSIBLE TRIGGER FOR DEPRESSION 

When I was younger I became what I call borderline suicidal. I knew exactly how and where I would end my life but knew I didnt want to just yet, I litterally procrastinated my own death to put it that way. This was a result of years of bullying. Physical and emotional abuse and just pure isolation in general.

Im a lot better now and am acctually seriously proud of how far I have come, never really realised how bad I was until I got better. So thats the backing to this.

Ever since I got better around a year or maybe two ago (its hard to put a date on this stuff) Iv had a fear of falling back into depression. To give more detail if i have any kind of empty or even an indiffrent feeling, I panic. I start breathing heavily, iv even broken down crying before, fully weeping over basically nothing.

Its easier to control in public but even then i still get a paniced, tight-chested feeling that only stops when I keep telling myself that I am feeling this so that means im feeling something (which sounds counter productive but somehow it helps sndbfjf) or if i completely distract myself.

I was just wondering if it is possible to have a phobia of a mental illness or if anyone can help me work out why this is happening. 

Iv taken depression tests to make sure its not come back and they all seemed fine.

My past interest I don't care for, my friend group keeps shrinking, my workload keeps increasing, and now I'm crying posting this stupid cry for help on the internet. Is there something wrong with me?",05May2019,2
36,"Hi, I’m new here. I’m sure this question has been asked already, but how do I help someone that I suspect is depressed? Long story short, my daughters father seems like he’s depressed to me. Sleeps all the time, drinks excessively, can’t keep a job for longer than a few months to a year. But he won’t talk to anyone. I tried going to a therapist years ago (for something else) and he wouldn’t show up or wouldn’t talk if he did show up. Sometimes when he drinks, he’ll call me and apologize excessively for things that happened when we were together. 
Anyway, is there any way I can go about helping him? I’m pretty sure he’s not over me so I don’t want to give him any false hope by calling him all the time or visiting him often when it does t have to do with our child, but I do want him to be healthy and happy again.",05May2019,5
37,"(TL;DR: I am looking for a psychiatrist for the first time and would like to know what to expect from a ""good"" professional and what to expect from medication.)

Finally after almost 7 years ignoring my problem(s) they have become such an unbearable weigth that's been dampening every aspect of my life to a point where nothing matters, the only things that make me get out of bed it's the pressure of bills and not losing my scholarship in the university and frankly even this is starting to lose importance.
 I just can't take it anymore, so before it gets even worse I am trying to make something about my mental health.
And for that I am looking for professional help,but I've never been to a psychiatrist and am afraid of wasting time,effort and money, so I would like to hear your thoughts and experiences to know what to expect. I know it's not easy and there's nothing like a magic pill, but it's a long way to go and I feel like a good start could make some difference in the long run.",05May2019,6
38,"This is my first post, so please pardon me if I make any mistake.

Well,first of all, I had an exam held all over my country last year and I got way pretty less to get accepted into medical colleges. So, I dropped a year and started studying for the next test. Yesterday was my test and when I checked the answer key today, I'm not getting enough marks to get into a govt. college. I had spent hours of countless studying to get a decent score but to no avail. Heck, even when I was down with dengue, I kept studying. My parent's can't afford to pay for a private college nor can I drop another year. My parents' had high expectations of me and I'm about to shatter all that in a few hours. Why am I such a worthless piece of trash? I only wanted to help people in need and looks like I can't even do that. If I don't get a seat, then I might as well kill myself by jumping into an oncoming train. Tell me fellow people, why doesn't life reward you even though you worked hard like a fucking dog.

Sorry for troubling you guys with my unnecessary ranting.",05May2019,6
39,"It’s a true story about a case involving the legal rights of mental health patients. I liked it bc of the theme of helplessness the mentally ill feel and how we aren’t taken seriously in life. But at least at the end of the movie, we’re vindicated.
