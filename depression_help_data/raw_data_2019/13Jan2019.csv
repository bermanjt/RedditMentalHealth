0,"4 years ago, February 2015 I started crying all the time and believing in crazy stuff, so i went to my first psychiatrist and he gave me some antidepressants and told me that i would be fine in 15 days , 20 days later i returned after having sleepless nights and going crazy like feeling i was going to die or loose my mind.He gave me a bunch of antidepressants and antipsychotics and i became normal again but in January 2016 i had a relapse and i changed my meds but the next year (2017) i had another relapse so i went to my new/current psychiatrist and he was shocked  how many drugs i was taking and was afraid to remove them but he did it gradually, however i had another relapse the following year and i recovered. This year i'm feeling better with a minimum of antidepressants and no antipsychotics. The problem now is that he told me he wasn't sure what i have and these past months i started doing many stupid mistakes with big consequences and i forget a lot of things or misunderstanding simple problems and it's starting to make feel angry about my brain betraying me. 
Any similar cases?

Ps: before depression i was one of the best students and in one year i became one of the worst.",13Jan2019,1
1,"I've spent the better part of my life lost in a haze of depression. It started when I was around ten years old, shortly after I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and robbed me of my teenage years. I have been unable to hold down a job since leaving high school (I'm 21) and these events culminated in me having a public breakdown at work. I left, have spent about two years in therapy, and started seeing a psychiatrist last year.

Nobody knew exactly what was wrong with me, but I was miserable and constantly thought about killing myself. I was hallucinating. Paranoid. Unable to trust anyone else (not even myself). Felt like I was a stranger to my own family.

And then it happened: I finally got diagnosed. I have severe Bipolar disorder with psychotic features and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Ever since I started on the Abilify I've been getting better but I don't know how to handle this ""new normal"". I can actually feel things again, where I couldn't before. I can think. I still doubt myself all the time, terrified I'm going to end up where I started, or slip back into the depression. It was so bad I'm honestly shocked I didn't end my own life. I tried when I was fourteen and it didn't happen--obviously--but I still feel like one day I'm going to end up killing myself. 

I just want to know if these changes I'm feeling are going to be permanent, or if I'm going to have to deal with the ups and downs like I was before (I'm afraid this is the beginning of a manic episode or something). If anyone out there has experience with something similar, please help if you can. I feel very fragile right now and I'm not sure if I can take another bad depressive episode.",13Jan2019,1

3,"Hey y’all. I have been having a rough few weeks and I just don’t know how to focus on studying. I have exams in 4 days and I just am struggling. What has helped you? 

Btw I haven’t ever been given an official diagnosis on depression, a few years ago I was told by a therapist (I saw someone once, Insurance didn’t cover and I felt uncomfy) that I have many symptoms that align with depression, I didn’t tell them everything though. 
I’ve never been treated for mental illness (did get diagnosed with GAD) yet I can tell things are getting worse. 
Anyhow thanks for listening. I’m not very good at explaining. ",13Jan2019,1
4,"I was in a mental health inpatient facility for two months from September to November. When I got out, I felt better than I have felt in years. Not cured, but able to cope. 

I visited my father over Christmas and had a frank discussion with him about some distressing things from the past, and now have to reevaluate my position on family members and events that hurt me in the past,  and my sense of identity all over again. 

On top of that, I just moved from my city to a bigger city two weeks ago,  and am having a lot of difficulties in my new place. I don't have enough furniture so I have nowhere to puy my clothes, there's so many bugs and poisonous spiders, the sink leaks, I've run out of money, I haven't finished setting up, etc etc etc (its a never end storm of bullshit). 

When I moved, I said goodbye to the psychologist I have been seeing for 2 and a half years. Now I have no psychological support in my new city at all. 

And on top of that, I'm autistic, so I don't deal with change well at all. I don't feel comfortable in my new place and all my routines are out of whack. Everything feels wrong and my anxiety is through the roof. Because everything is different, I'm struggling to remember to eat or look after my hygiene regularly, or take my medication. 

My depression has been slowly creeping back in and getting worse since Christmas. I didn't notice at first because I thought, since moving was so difficult (and the weathe is so hot here) it was normal to be sleeping a lot. But its not just sleeping a lot;  everything is an effort, I feel hopeless, I feel confused all the time, I'm sad constantly. 

Without a psychologist, I don't know how to work through the problems that talking with my dad brought up. I can't talk to my mum about the lies she's told me or the abuse I suffered at her hands without risking losing the only support I have at the moment. 

I know I should be trying to eat regularly, get enough sleep, exercise and look after my hygiene, but those things are so, so hard right now (both with the depression and with my routines being all obliterated by moving) and they're just not enough to stop this downward spiral. What else can I do. Please! I've had one good month for the first time I can remember, and I don't want to go back to how things were before. Please, I need advice on what to do!",13Jan2019,1

7,"When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that I'm trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself there's no honor in it anymore, it's just another job. I don't exercise by myself anymore. I feel like I'm not progressing anywhere in life being in service. I'm just a body and if I wasn't here doing what I'm doing, there'd just be somebody else doing the exact same. I'm replaceable. That's the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and that's the only thing I've been looking forward to since I've been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. There's nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like I've tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.",13Jan2019,1
8,"Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my life’s kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me (human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful) or for some periods of time feeling like I’m buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didn’t work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. I’ve now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month.
I feel as if I’m being sucked into a giant pit of despair I can’t get myself out of and It’s progressively getting harder to leave bed. 
I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because I’m terrified someone’s going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and can’t leave the car so I just go home. 
I can’t sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that I’m a giant burden to everyone in my life so I can’t talk to them about when I’m struggling. I’ve isolated myself so much over the past few years I don’t have a single friend left. 
I’d like to try medication again but I’m too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it? ",13Jan2019,1

10,"I keep telling myself to be better, to try harder to be who I know I need to be and to do. But I am not this person you see. But I need to do this, to carry this through, to be this person. I don't see any other way. I have never allowed myself any other option, because option is a luxury that I cannot afford. But I feel like I am splitting apart. How do I carry on this charade? How long till it becomes reality? What is even reality? I keep asking myself, why is this so hard for me, where to others it seems to effortless. Am I really that lazy? I do waste time. But its like an effort to put up the effort and it makes me ashamed. I should be more responsible. I should feel less guilty. I should be more put together. I should not feel so trapped in my own head that my actual identity starts to feel so fake. I feel fake. I feel like an imposter in my own life. But I have to make it. ",13Jan2019,1
11,"I don’t know what to do. I’ve been feeling so so low the last few days. It got better for two days and then the lows came back. I feel like I don’t matter and I feel so alone. I’ve always been the quiet kid in the corner that no one really noticed and forgets about. That’s the way I feel now.  None of my friends call/txt to check in on me and ask me how I’m doing even though I’m there every single time someone needs me and I am always listening and helping everyone else with their problems. I’ve tried talking to my SO but it’s so hard for me to fully verbalize everything. I blame my mom for this. She always made me feel like my feelings don’t matter and that every time I tried to open up to her, she would either shut me down and tell me I’m being dramatic or use it against me later. So I learned how to internalize everything. 

I also keep going over and over in my head conversations I’ve had with people in person and through txt message. I keep thinking that I should have said this or that instead of what I said. I keep questioning everything and creating these scenarios in my head and fixating on them. My mind keeps telling me that people hate me and everyone makes fun of me when I’m not in the room and that no one takes me seriously. 

It’s like I’m screaming and no one can hear me. I want to cry but no tears come out.

Sleeping is almost nonexistent even though I’m so tired all the time. The minute I get into bed my brain kicks into overdrive and I can’t turn it off.  I haven’t slept well in 3 days despite working 12+ hour shifts and taking a sleeping pill. 

I don’t know what to do and I feel really lost.  I haven’t tried therapy because I don’t know where to start and I’m scared that I’m just going to be told I’m fine and that there’s nothing wrong with me.

I’m sorry if this seems jumpy or doesn’t make sense, I’m kind of all over the place. ",13Jan2019,1
12,"  Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit. Apologies in advance if it isn’t well put. I will attempt to the best of my ability to convey my thoughts as coherent and correct as i possibly can, if at any point i am disrespectful in any sense it is undoubtedly not my intention, rather just bad writing. I just felt that i needed to write something eventually, because these thoughts have been encroaching and eating me from within. This purpose of this post henceforth would just be for me to express myself, at least for once, as genuine and straightforward as i can. 

  A little bit of background about myself, I am currently the age of 20, of chinese ethnicity, residing in Malaysia. I am the only son, and my parents and I do not talk often, they used to argue and quarrel alot when i was younger which caused me to be partially traumatised ( not going into specific details) in which i probably coped by kinda being angsty at home and indulge into computer games. In the asian society here, most families i would say are conservative and as such you wouldn’t have much room to express yourself genuinely. Particularly on emotion, here mental issues are not really viewed as something of substance. Just to conclude simply, my emotions and intentions were suppressed since young. This is basically just an attempt to show pre-hand the experience of my upbringing. Also, i wouldn’t say all this contributed to how terrible i handled social situations, which i deeply regret now, but i also do feel that in the past years i wasn’t really someone who was ‘real’  or just genuinely me. There might be some innate psychological wiring within me that is unrelated to my social construct, which i am not ignorant enough to just blame it all on my circumstances. This perhaps also contributed to the fact that i have not many friends now, but on this point i am aware that past mistakes are unavoidable and it really isn’t an issue for me right now,

  Currently, i am sort of in a culminated existential crisis. I have many problems. I am very self conscious, I literally hate myself. I feel ugly from within and out. I feel like i have no identity. I am lonely, nobody to reach out to. I am constantly worried about my looks and how other people perceive me. 
  
  When i was in college,   i took a course which i had no passion about. Not to say that i am unwilling to put in the effort to pass the course, or anything really. The funny thing is, my parents at the time did not explicitly  tell me to take the particular course, but due to constant relatives advice, and the feeling to live up to society’s standard, I myself came up with the idea to take the course and sort of forced myself, or lie to myself that that it really is my passion. In my final year i really crumbled, and was depressed. As mentioned on how i got into computer games, i actually got really good at it. To the point where i was confident in becoming a professional player. So i was constantly in a dilemma between focusing purely on school and   sort of chasing my dreams ( which i realistically had the potential to ) I was messed up. Basically it got to the point where i couldn’t handle school work and i was in such a troubled state of mind. I suppose for adults this is when you will head to the bar for drinks to ‘escape reality’, so to speak. So i opted to delay my exams and intended on studying for the period of time. I didn’t attend classes ( i was really confident that i could study on my own, but more to the fact that I was left behind on the topics so i felt the need to go with my own pace) when i did go to classes tho i would have terrible stomachaches because i felt everyone  judging me, from the bypassers, students, to the teacher. Its like a judge always on your head staring down at you. I puked after. 

  Long story short, i couldn’t focus on anything whatsoever as the problem never went away. I basically ignored everything from practical to mental and just played games. My comfort zone diminished to the point where only my room was where i could be safe. I did not even pursue my dream of becoming a professional player for the particular game, but instead i played this MMORPG game and for a substantial period of time all my problems were non-existent and i was immersed into the game.  An MMORPG game is basically a game like War of Warcraft where you can level up, interact with other players, and do dungeons and quests constantly. It was like a different world from which we live in. I found temporary solace.  Eventually i met a group of people who became my friends and i ended up in a relationship with one of them. It was an online one, and we did have video calls often. We played the game invariably everyday.  I was reluctant to tell the person that i was actually in a supposed studying period for my delayed exams. Perhaps a sense of pride, but probably more towards the fact that i was oblivious to the practical world and wanted to keep it that way. 

  Later, i eventually passed the course. It was time to go to university. Based on my past experience, i wanted to try something different. So i took a different subject. Amidst everything, i broke up with my online partner and suddenly i felt really bad and lonely. Speaking of partners, as mentioned when i was younger i was immature and ended up breaking up with this one girl whom i really liked mainly because i felt ‘ugly’ simply put, which ties back to my self conscious problem. Although i have moved on since, it always leaves a slight sense of regret and bitterness whenever it comes to my present mind. 

  So basically right now, i would say my depression has culminated to the point where i had almost lost my life. Had i been unlucky or any slight missteps i would not be here today. I am still putting on a mask for everyone, going for classes, in front of friends and family. I feel like history might just repeat itself and eventually the burden will be too much and I would just perish by my own hands. Within all this cynicism i believe that there is hope for myself. I don’t know but i have no passion for anything right now. Everything is overwhelming. Loneliness, passion, responsibility, morality, purpose all of it is just too much for me to handle by myself. I have tried, very vehemently, to force myself to think only in a unidimensional manner, to only focus on one thing, and to shut my brain from any thoughts that would eventually lead to more thoughts. It has utterly failed. I would say, loneliness especially made it really hard to do so.  As when one is alone the proclivities for such thoughts are unstoppable. 

  I have lost my purpose to live. It seems the root of the problem is from within myself and the only solution is for me, and me only to change. I have really tried. The sudden realisation that my life is a mess and everything i had done is a mess is overwhelming. I do not see a future for myself.  That being said, i hope everyone can overcome their own personal problems and depression. Since this is a problem within my own mind, please do not feel bad if you don’t know what to do in order to help me.  I think only I can save myself. Or otherwise, maybe ill just die a nobody.",13Jan2019,1
13,"Hi.. I am not sure where to turn and found this subreddit.
My husband has parents that are cut off at this point.  If you really want to read through the history I have posted elsewhere about it.
I can't shake the feeling that I am somehow ruining his life because I wouldn't put up with them trying to abuse us.  He had assured me that cutting them off is what he wanted, he just couldn't face them himself at that moment.
I have a friend who has on more than one occasion suggested I am the dominant person in the relationship and making my husband do things he doesn't actually want to do.  I have cut her out from my life as much as possible because it sent me into this tailspin that I can't get out of.  The last thing I want to do is hurt or ruin his life.

And yet perhaps I am anyway.  I am 4 months pregnant with our second child and extremely moody.  Everything is setting me off.  I end up apologizing but the damage is done and I can't blame him.  I told him I was afraid he was going to leave me.. he said he had thought about getting a divorce when I'm really angry but it doesn't go anywhere because our first child is his world.

My father had a lot of anger issues.  I'm afraid I'm going to be just like him and ruin our children and my marriage if I haven't ruined it already.  I have been crying a lot off and on since last night.  I'm currently hiding from my family because I just can't get it together.  Am I add horrible as his parents have said I am?  Why can't I make these thoughts stop?  I'm usually not this deep into depression but I literally can't see a way out other than leaving him with our daughter.  I feel like neither one of them needs me.

I have a therapist.  I will call him tomorrow.  But just wondering if anyone can help me today.  Please.  Thank you and I hope this doesn't trigger anyone else.",13Jan2019,1

My college is in the city and I go to parties and I go into the city and I feel like I’m living the way I should be, but for some reason everything just feels off.

I have a lot of good stuff going on but none of it feels right and I don’t know how to fix it, and I just want to know if this is like a starting stage of depression or if this is something that’ll pass in a couple more months.

21,"Hi everyone, I could use some support over something I did that I'm really beating myself up over. 


I've been in a difficult relationship with someone I loved very much. I'm in therapy for PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and have been trying my hardest to be 'normal' throughout it. 


During this time, I've been using alcohol as a negative coping mechanism. I've been getting really drunk, blacking out, and then having panic attacks about the unresolved trauma I'm  working through. This has happened about 4 times in the past 7 months. 


My partner has been as patient as he can with it, but we finally broke up due to an instance a few weeks ago that I keep replaying in my head. 


We had gotten into a fight earlier in the day, and I came home and started drinking. We made up, and he asked if he could come over. He knew that I had been drinking, and asked that I stopped before he came over. 


I didn't. I wound up getting blackout drunk, and having a huge panic attack. I was screaming and crying and couldn't be calmed down. It lasted for about 2 hours - just me screaming and wailing and crying so loudly that I shook the bed and couldn't be consoled. He wound up leaving because I just wouldn't stop screaming and crying and he didn't know what to do. 


We ended up breaking up, and he told me he thinks I'm a high functioning alcoholic. 


I'm so ashamed and tearing myself up over this. It was a hot night, and all of my windows were open. I'm pretty sure my neighbors heard me screaming and crying for hours, and I'm mortified. How do I ever face them again? What do I say when I see them, 'oh yeah, sorry about all the carrying on. I got blackout drunk and panicked and screamed and cried for 2 hours.' 


I'm so filled with shame. I can't stop thinking about it or beating myself up over it. I feel so weak and powerless, and I hate that I hurt someone I loved with my actions.


He knew that I wouldn't remember how I acted, so he took a short video of it to show me. It was terrible. I didnt even look like myself. I was so drunk, and I was covered in tears and makeup. I had an empty wine glass next to me. I never thought I could look so out of control. 


I'm looking at my drinking, which has admittedly gotten pretty out of control. I bought a book on alcoholism and am going to start attending meetings. I don't want to be this person anymore. 


How do I stop beating myself up over this? I'm having a hard time looking at myself in the mirror right now and seeing a good person. I ran into a neighbor today, and could barely look them in the eye. 


Any advice on how to move on from this? My therapist told me that its okay, that I'm just responding to working on trauma in a negative way, that I'm learning and won't repeat the same mistakes again. And if I do, it's okay - it's all a process. 


But I don't believe that. I feel so ashamed, and like I'm a terrible person. 


Any advice or support is appreciated. Thanks everyone. ",13Jan2019,1
