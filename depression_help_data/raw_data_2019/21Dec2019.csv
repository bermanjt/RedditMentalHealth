0,I’ve lost control of my life. Everything I’m doing sucks I find no joy in anything I’ve lost direction of my life. I don’t see a future for myself I’m failing classes I lack motivation and feel like a complete waste of space and a disappointment to my mom. I’ve also been putting up this stupid fucking front to my friends pretending to be happy and fine but I can’t bring myself to tell any of them how horrible my life is because I’d feel like a burden. I don’t know what to do anymore I feel like shit.,21Dec2019,1

2,"Over time due to just life happening I have lost almost all of my friends and people I love. I may hang out with someone once or twice a year. I listen to books and I seems to me that the only people I truly know now are just characters on the books I've read. I work to much to go out and I don't know of any groups to join to possibly meet people to hang out with. It may seem somewhat stupid but I hate the fact I know more about fictional people than the people that are in my life (co-workers and some family). I don't try isolate myself but I can't seem to expand into the world more.           


I know this sounds pathetic in a way, I just need to get it off my chest because it getting to be to much. I know no one real, and characters can't talk back. I can't help but cry sometimes, only to fall asleep with a book playing and alone again.

Thank you for you time.

5,"I've never properly talked about this before, and I don't like to bring attention to myself and take up the time of others, but I know I have a problem I need to solve.

I am almost 27 years old. Around 7 years ago I was 'diagnosed' with depression, possibly due to starting university and my parents suddenly getting divorced. Within 1-2 years, both of my parents re-married and I eventually moved house three times. Although this was a while ago, I believe this may play a role in how I am feeling.

  
To the point - for some reason, after I achieve something that I believe I should be incredibly proud of, I shrug it off like it is nothing, or feel that I don't deserve what I have achieved.  
For example, over the last few years, I have completed my bachelors degree in teaching, passed my teacher exams after studying for months, completed my practicums, and have finally completed my Masters Degree, and I can finally teach in my own classroom.

I understand these are great feats, however, inside I feel worthless and view my own achievement of this as something that just happens. Around the time of my graduation, I couldn't help but look at the event as something that wasn't that special and didn't tell anybody about it. If these feats were completed by somebody that I know (a friend or family member), I would feel genuinely proud of them and want to celebrate, but for me I just can't give myself what I want to give them.

I have two incredibly close friends who have just recently moved into their own houses and are engaged to their partners, and I couldn't be happier for them. I am beginning to believe their success also affects my train of thought in terms of my own progression, though. I always hear that you should never compare yourself to others, and I understand everyone's life events are varied in terms of time, but this might be something that links in with my lack of care for my own success. I don't know.

To distract myself from negative thoughts, I always do things I enjoy; Go to the gym, play video games, watch movies/anime, catch up with friends for coffee, but eventually the thoughts always catch up to me.  
I'm just worried that slowly but surely, my thoughts are getting more negative.   
I begin to stress over small things more easily, realise that I'm beginning to look away from people that make eye contact with me, and feel more nervous/shy/awkward in social situations.

Sorry for taking up your time if you're reading this, I've never really brought it up in detail to anybody before and now I'm doing it here. Any kind of opinion/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for reading.",21Dec2019,1

9,"I keep asking myself why am I such a fuck up?, Why can’t I just fucking be happy?, Why does every little thing make me feel like I’m one step closer to a mental break down? 

I’ve lived a good chunk of my life with depression about since the closest thing to a father died when I was 11. I was later diagnosed with manic depression, social anxiety and one therapist diagnosed me with agoraphobia (only because I would shut myself off months at a time). Things got worse when I found out I had a genetic condition in my back that made it calcify and I was recommended to not work anymore (I was always thought to work hard for your things) and try for disability and I’ve been in a battle with them for a few years now. I get help from family and my girlfriend but, I just feel like a fucking moocher and I know me not having money effects everyone around me. At one point I considered that everyone would get some relief if I was just to die (this wasn’t my first time having thoughts like that.. I’ve had them a lot through my life) but, I couldn’t never do it myself so anytime I went out or drove I was hoping something would happen that would just lead to that conclusion. My memory is horrible now to die to getting too high of a dose of medication that resulted in memory loss. I was recently told that I needed to stop having so many negative thoughts that negative things happen when my life is driven by negativity. But, my issues I don’t know how to stop... it’s takes everything in me just to get out of bed, just to take a shower and just to walk out my front door. The littlest of things at this point can set off my thought process “Why am I a fuck up? Does everyone hate me?” I just want to be happy and I have my moment... we’ll split seconds where I do feel some what happy... but these days anything can bring me back into that dark place.",21Dec2019,1
10,"I’m sorry I know I posted early this week I’m just going through lots rn. 

For all of my freshman year of HS I was very very close friends with this girl named Em. We did everything together went to movies gossiped practiced our instruments. Just very very close. That summer we decided to start dating, she was very conservative and didn’t really want to kiss/hold hands or anything like that for a long time. I knew I really loved her because of that. I knew it wasn’t just lust that made me want to be with her 24/7. It felt genuine. My parents loved her and for two years we dated talking constantly FaceTimeing all night just everything. Then she decided she only wanted to be friends which hurt but I kinda knew it was coming. I’m a total fucking waste of a human for this next part, but the second month we were together I cheated on her. One time and one time only, but I never told her. When she found out she was destroyed and never wanted to speak to me again. Because of my own stupid fucking desire and lust I lost one of the best friends I ever had. I hurt someone who was truly special to me and I wish I could just let it go. I really fucking hate myself for it. I’ve never felt like o had that genuine connection again with anyone, and I hate myself for being so fucking pathetic and not able to just let her go. That’s the biggest thing that drives me mad about being home. I want so desperately to atone to restore our friendship but I know I never will and never can. I think that’s the emptiness I feel so often, it’s been so long sense I’ve felt passion like i had for her. I’ve had flashes of passion, moments where I’ve felt alive but it always fades away. And being home, and seeing all the little places where I’ve tucked away the gifts she gave me makes me want so desperately to cut again to feel some sort of something even if it’s pain at least it’s real. But I can’t do that either, I don’t want to hurt my parents like that again so it makes me feel fucking stuck and dumb and alone.",21Dec2019,1
11,"I'm in therapy for dysthymia and anxiety. I find that it's hard for me to be open minded and willing to make the changes my therapist recommends. I'm aware that I am the only one who can bring change to my life, but my mind just comes up with excuses, like ""I don't have time to be social"" etc. Having to find time to do these changes like exercise or being social actually worsens my anxiety. Also I think since I've had dysthymia for so many years, I've just started viewing my pessimism as me having a more realistic and therefore correct view on life (which is so not true). How do I get over this and actually commit to making the changes my therapist suggests? I feel like I just say yes when she asks me if I am willing to make changes because I don't want her to think I'm a troublesome patient.

12,"I'm 36F, nurse, bad at relationships, unmarried and no kids, depressed as far back as I remember, severe anxiety disorder, self-doubt, self-hatred, hopelessness, currently panic. I'm at work right now on a night shift, my usual shift. In my job, there's a lot of time I'm alone, and until the last half hour out of twelve, there's no support from any other nursing or medical-type people, it's just me, the whole place is my nursing responsibility. Tonight I've been so anxious that I'm panicking and suicidal and want to die before morning comes, I can't face the duties and difficulties of my job any more. But I couldn't do that to my patients- ""my kids"". They need their morning meds. And don't need the trauma of seeing me dead. Neither do my coworkers. And there is no one to call in to help relieve me. And realistically, there is no real means/method here that would be successful anyway.

And I can't leave  this building for my entire shift. It's me alone and panicking. I'm not sure what to do. I can't seem to get any work done tonight. I've cried several times- not where anyone at all could see or know. But it all feels beyond what I can bear. I need help right now. But there's no one to reach out to. There's no backup if I needed a day off, needed to see my therapist or even go to a hospital. There's no one. Especially right before Christmas. I can't keep going anymore. That's what it feels like. But it's the holidays. I don't want to hurt people. I don't want to ruin Christmas. But I feel terrified and hopeless and overwhelmed and alone.

13,"So I’ve seen in here and other places before of people asking for advice when they are dating someone WITH depression, and how best to help their loved one. But my question is the opposite. What is the best way to approach my boyfriend who *doesnt* have depression? 
 
** I do realize that everyone is different and what works best for them may not work best for another person. I’m just at a loss and need any advice you lovely humans can give me ** 

I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about 6 months now. And let me tell you, he is the light in my life. He is like literal sunshine. He is always happy, and outgoing, and he looks at things logically. It’s something I’ve never experienced in a relationship before - my exes have always had some form of mental illness. So while on one hand it is amazing having him, because he can help remind me to not take life too seriously, it can sometimes be frustrating when he doesn’t understand where I’m coming from. I’ll give an example: 
Tonight, I got home from work. I’ve been feeling really hopeless recently - I work in human services and sometimes the job gets pretty brutal - and it’s been a rough couple of days. I’m getting sick, my SO is sick so we haven’t talked much because he’s asleep 90% of the time, and I haven’t been processing my emotions correctly. But I get home, and just lay on the couch. And he’s reminding me I need to drink water, cuz it’s the most important thing to recovering, and I tell him I have to WANT it to be able to drink it. Like... some part of my physical being will reject the idea of water until I either WANT it or I absolutely NEED it. And he said it was weird, cuz he’s never had to think about wanting water. He just drinks it. And I was already in a negative mood, and i vented about how frustrating it is to not be able to do so many things ( like drink water or even simply get to my room) because my body doesn’t want to. He responded saying that I just “needed to get up and do it” and I know he means well, but the response rubbed me the wrong way. Because I *cant* do that. And he said his brain is fried from being sick, and I snapped and ended the convo. And I feel really bad and I know an apology is in order. But my question I guess is... 

How can I help make it easier for him when I’m getting into a depressive episode? I take my meds daily -though sometimes I fail at even this but I’ve been doing really well - and I’m working on getting into therapy. But I know those aren’t always permanent solutions. How can I help him when I’m in a hard place? I don’t want him feeling shitty because he can’t help me. Have any of you gone through this? What did you do? I dunno... any help would be much appreciated. 

Thank you for reading this long thing. And thank you all for being amazing humans.",21Dec2019,1

16,"About 5 years ago, I was seeing a guy. It only lasted 9 months but he did a number on my self esteem and self confidence. I am a bigger girl and he would say things like “I should be happy to be getting his attention” or just making demeaning comments to me. He wasn’t a looker himself, I say this now. Honestly, I was just so excited that someone took an interest in me. We were together all the time. I would be at his place most of the week. We texted all the time. 

I finally came to the realization that I wasn’t myself. I was drinking ALOT when I was with him. I would get sick because of all of the alcohol I drank. To be honest, I believe he was an alcoholic. Anyhow, I broke it off with him. Two coworkers sat me down and basically told me how this guy was breaking me down. He was. 

I felt awful the week leading up to me breaking things off. I felt euphoric after. Then it kinda came crashing down on me. I no longer felt powerful me. I was sad. I hated myself. I lashes out at my friends. I grieved a lot because I didn’t understand why he did that to me or why I let him do that to me. I’ve never been loved before or in an actual relationship.  I haven’t been since. I’m scared but I have have lost who I am along the way. 

I’ve been in and out of therapy since last year. I just recently started going back. My friend saw me typing a note to myself on my phone. It said I want to die and I’m not worthy repeatedly. I honestly had been thinking about it. I had the thoughts but no real plan. I just hate that how I keep thinking back on the situation and I can’t get the strength to move on from it. 

It sucks being depressed. I have no energy for things beyond working. I go to the gym sometimes. I need to go more because I continue to let myself be fat to protect me from the interest of men. It just sucks and I hate being this way. I was never like this before him.",21Dec2019,1

Lets start with the fact that I'm short 5'6 and bald at 24, I was having problems with this for the last couple of years.  
Never had a girlfriend in my life, so I decided that I need to up my confidence and start asking out some female colleagues as I don't have a possibility of meeting girls in other places as I don't like partying.

So I did, and guess what, none of them even accepted to go on a single date, always telling me some excuse like: ""I have a birthday to attend to and have a busy week"", without offering other solutions.   
In the summer I decided to buy myself a car thinking that it will bring me happiness as I wasn't having success with women, this of course was me trying to find happiness in other things than myself.  
Guess what, I only had headaches with it even though I enjoyed driving it, but ultimately I managed to crash it. Had a couple of bad months stressing about fixing it, but the cost was too high and in the end I sold it.

In the meantime a new female colleague arrived in my team, she had a boyfriend until recently so I never bothered with her. She showed signs of interest, always answering playfully and asking why I wasn't going where she was going. So this week I asked her out, at first she said yes, of course, but then when I mentioned a day she said that she has a birthday and she's having a busy week, also she will be gone out of the country for the next couple of weeks. She hasn't mentioned anything about it, and I don't want to beg anyone to do anything.

I don't even want to get out of bed, I lay in bed all day just wondering what the hell am I going to do with my life now if I don't do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering if I'm cut out for this or not. The only thing keeping me going is just what my family would think of me if I don't do it. That is probably adding to the depressive state I'm in right now. I just feel I wasted time, put things on hold, have no direction (if I don't do the academy), 27, no job, no wife, no kids, barely any friends too. I'm just in a very bad place right now and the stress of knowing I should be going into this academy isn't helping.",21Dec2019,1
38,"I wish there was a way to tell people ""hey sorry I aggressively try to push you away, I really don't want to exist and if I push the people I care about most away then I can hopefully prevent hurting you with my loss in the future but also it's nothing against any one and no one but myself makes me feel this way please don't take it personally"" without needing to be checked into a mental hospital",21Dec2019,1
39,I feel so low cause my last couple bdays have been the same. I'm 19 today. And my last 2 bdays I spent wishing to hang out with someone. But I always got hung up with work. And today is no different. But instead of work I'm caught up doing chores in the house. And I recently went through a hard breakup in October. I miss feeling loved. But now I just feel forgotten.,21Dec2019,1

I’ve (34/m) lived with my girlfriend (35/F) for the past 6 years.  

She suffers from chronic depression (or some kind of Borderline Personality Disorder or Mood Swings). She had therapy in the past to deal with her depression but now believes she suffers from BPD or MS. I would say I’m a cheerful and sometimes ignorant guy but I must admit whenever depression hits I also get affected.  

This time must the worst for her. She said she needs to go to therapy but is afraid of what she might hear while there. She doesn’t want to take medication and she’s afraid she might be diagnosed as suffering from MS which is in the bipolar spectrum. She’s obviously much more educated in these matters than I am.

I love her more than anything else in my life. We’ve been through our ups and downs and I’ve told myself and her, multiple times, that I will be there for her always. A couple of days ago she started crying and asked me whether I’d like to break up with her to which I replied no, straight away.  

We hadn’t really talked about her mental state in the past as much as I would have liked, due to our life and also maybe because, like I said, I’m cheerful and ignorant.

As I’m typing this, I feel I’m getting lost in the details and I’m not looking at the bigger picture.  

It’s taking a toll on me mentally lately and I’ve began doubting whether I can be there for her. There is a voice in my head that asks whether I’d be better off if we broke up. A thought which makes me full of guilt because I feel like she doesn’t have anyone else in her life. I want to be there for her but I don’t know what to do.",21Dec2019,1

46,"I started taking sertraline in just under a year ago (mainly taken for anxiety but also low mood), I came off them about 2 months ago and I was doing well (or so I thought...). Recently I have found that I have been getting really low a lot more than I used to and also getting anxious about almost everything, primarily work.

I am wondering if I am better off taking the medication... I don't like filling my body with chemicals but I also hate how I am feeling at the minute.

What if your opinion of taking medications? Is this a normal feeling to have?

Thank you for your time and I hope you kick butt today!",21Dec2019,1
47,"I'm honestly asking because I seriously dont know how to feel happy anymore, nor have I for the past 6 years. The closest Ive really ever felt to true happiness I've been in the past few years is just solem contemptment with something not making me extremly pissed of or upset in some way. I dont know what happiness really is anymore. I dont want to live life like this anymore. Please someone tell me what happiness is.",21Dec2019,1
48,"The answer to this title might sound trivial but let me break it down for you:

For the past 9 months I've been texting with some cute girl from tinder. What at first was only the usual chatting then turned more and more into a friendship over the time until at one point I considered it a relationship. I mean of course it wasnt the usual type of relationship because we never saw each other exept for one time but I still felt something exactly for love for her and had the feeling she did aswell. Well now after 9 months she never felt anything for me but didn't really clearly tell me so I've been basically chasing someone for the entire time that never felt anything for me. Well due to it being an online relationship I can't really blame someone else than me. But now that she told me it feels like the whole world collapsed above me and it just hurts so fucking much. Just every day I imagined what I felt for her and when I then think about her it just makes me cry.

Okay so here is the even worse thing: I still feel alot for her and well have to get over it that I will never be together with her. OK, I can do that. We don't even hate each other or anything (at least i hope she doesnt hate me) so we are still chatting with each other. But sometimes after we chat Im just getting remembered how saw this whole thing is. But then again I feel like if I'm gonna leave her completly it will just destroy me fully and I won't be able to get up from it again. So I don't know if I should just try to be friends with her and probably get a only a little sad then after some time or if i should just leave it be completly. Some friends already told me that I should leave her and carry on but I'm so scared that she might say something that would hurt me or just the act would drive me crazy.",21Dec2019,1
