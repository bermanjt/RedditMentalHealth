It was one of the worst I have had in a very long time, it caused me to emotionally hurt my boyfriend and I highly don't like that....I am trying to find a good place to get some decent therapy done via online because I have tried a face to face therapist before and it did not help me.....if anyone can help me find a good place to go for a online therapist please let me know...I want to better myself so I don't hurt the people I love.",05Apr2019,1
1,"Recently started a new job that I am really struggling with to do successfully, the learning curve is really steep. 4 weeks in and I did apply for another position around the same time that I applied for the current job, had the interview and it went well... Thinking it might be a better fit but I feel so guilty for thinking about leaving the other job because of the clients I have started working with (PTSD, concussion to name a few) and also the close bonds with staff. The company is pretty supportive but I just feel like I can't manage this type of job vs one with more structure (like the one I interviewed for). To make matter worse, I got a puppy 2 months ago after months of applying for jobs and no luck, my family dog who slept in my bed every night growing up was put down last summer at the age of 16 and it left a little hole in my heart. I was depressed about not finding a job, sad about my old dog and could not be talked out of wanting a dog.... fiance was against it at first but after me pleading, she said she was on board. I regret getting the puppy, I feel like a bad owner even tho im getting up at 530 everyday to walk/play with him, have a dog walker 2x per day and take him for a good walk in the evening. Since getting him im not exercising or doing cooking. I am not doing anything well and now im thinking I should try to find someone to take the puppy but I do love him and also cant stop thinking about the shame of giving him up. Currently drinking some beers to help take the edge off. So many decisions go wrong, would really appreciate some support, maybe some suggestions of what to do. Have seen psycholigists, psychiatrists, etc... in the past and currently on some meds. Also just passive thoughts in case anyone is worried but I'm so overwhelmed. Thank you",05Apr2019,2
2,"Shorter post than I probably should for details, but I'm pretty tired and should go to bed

I was recently diagnosed with Depression (actually, it was slightly indirect since my doctor increased the dose of a medication I already take for something else that happens to also be an anti-depressant). I've had trouble on &amp; off with everyday motivation and ability to function in society since 8th grade (in 11th now), and right now it's *particularly* bad. I have a bunch of shit to do, both personal and work/school related. I'm currently having issues with motivation to do basic things such as laundry, showering, mailing out an application form, homework, studying, brushing my teeth. I'm especially having trouble waking up for school in the morning. I normally drive my brother and his friend, but this week alone I've been tardy three times (I drop the guys off at the door so they're not technically late, the time it takes me to find a spot, walk to the building, and get to class is the main reason I'm constantly tardy). I haven't had any willingness to read lately, at all! I've had the same book in my backpack for three weeks, and it's *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, which I'm only reading for the first time, and it's such a great read, but I just can't get the will to pick it back up. Help. How do I get up for school on time? How to do I fix my routine? I have so much shit to do, and I know what it is, but I just can't force myself to do it for anything.

3,"I have been depressed for quite some time. Often times, I couldn't care less about the state of my bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

My bedroom is becoming to look like a hoarders room. Garbage, unnecessary stuff, and things that just have no place to be put.

I want to clean. I want to become better with my habits. Problem is, I have no idea where to start, and every time I approach the issue, it just feels like too much and I get even more depressed. The longer I leave it, the worse it gets. Wash, rinse, repeat. (My family and I are also trying to move sometime in the near future, so it's important that I clean up while I can before it gets too late to.)

Does anyone happen to have any advice? Has anyone been through a similar issue and bounced back from it? This is the worst my room has been in years and I feel horrible over it. Going to try to do some cleaning tonight, I have a feeling it's going to result in an all-nighter.",05Apr2019,4
4,"I am so sick of the facade I have created. At school, I act like I am fine when I am really not. My home life consists of fighting with my parents. I have friends but no one ever wants to go out with me. I'll ask to go out and people will just not respond or our plans will fall through. I want this part of my life to be over but I don't want to grow up. I wish I could go back and not force myself to be so mature.  I have no one I can confide in and feel like I have no safe space. :(

6,"I'm reposting this from another sub for more suggestions.

For background I am 3 years into a science degree, currently working part time for the past month at a local grocery store. I was experiencing pretty bad depression with my grades suffering so I decided to take a break from school and just work in the meantime.

Fortunately a lot of my depression has subsided and I'm doing much better now, I look to return to complete my degree in the beginning of 2020 after I save some money. Today I was contacted by a company for a contract job in my field that I applied to 2 months ago. So it would be my first ever real job in the field that I studied for.

The actual job posting only requires high school education, but I get the feeling the interviewers will ask why I haven't completed my degree. How do I answer this question tactfully without making myself look like bad?

i know exactly what i want to do, and how i’m going to get there. i know everything perfectly, it’s just that it’s getting so dark and lonely, i’m becoming scared of my own self and i cant trust nearly anyone anymore.

11,"I’ve been having dreams that feel like they last multiple days, despite me being asleep for only a few hours at a time.  It’s extremely disorienting to wake up from these. Sometimes it’s relatively normal stuff happening in the dream, but others it’s not. It’s rare for me to sleep without having a dream that feels like at least two days pass, even if it was just a short nap in real time. 

The worst of these, which has repeated itself several times, involves me being trapped in a makeshift prison camp and used as a slave for manual labor. This particular dream spanned a little more than two weeks the first time I experienced it. I remember some of my fellow prisoners and trying to make friends with them, before being beaten and told not to speak to anyone. About I week in, I often start planning an escape attempt. It’s worked twice, but when it fails, the prison guards kill me, and anyone else who tried to escape with me. On the two occasions where I did escape I was the only one to do so. I run home, to find the furniture rearranged and the walls in different places. I beg my roommate for help and he’s confused, saying I’ve been gone less than an hour. I’m pursued by the prison guards, who for whatever reason are Russian and are experts at tracking people down without raising suspicion. I’ve resorted to killing one of them in one of these dreams, and then it turned out he was just a normal person and not actually there to kidnap me. The “normal” police then arrested me and I went through an interrogation where the police concluded I was insane, then dropped me in an asylum.

It legitimately feels like I’m experiencing multiple days or weeks of time in these dreams.  I don’t know what’s going on. My own mind is holding me hostage. I’ve been dealing with depression for about three years now, and it’s gradually gotten worse over time, but the dreams are a relatively new addition to my daily torments and I don’t know how to deal with them.",05Apr2019,50
12,"Hi, this is my first post. I am not sure if I have a depression or not, because I don't have any physical symptoms. I eat, I sleep, I wake up, I go to classes, just as others do. It's just my heart that hurts all the time.

I feel so lonely everyday. I can't stop thinking that why I can't be loved, and why I can't love. I think the reason that no one loves me is probably I can't love myself. I feel disgusted of me. I know that it's not helpful at all, but I keep thinking that my soul is despicable, an unlovable one.  When the loneliness take over me, I can't help but cry. I cry a lot, at night, alone. With no reason. Sometimes tears burst out during the class and I had to go to bathroom to cry secretly. When I cry, I doubt if my friends really love me. Do they love me? Is it true? Is it not a fake? I can't trust their love, and I feel terrible about that. I know my family don't love me anymore, so I don't even care about them. Fuck them.

I think about dying everyday. I'm sure that no one will cry for me in my funeral. Why would they? Ok, some may cry some tears out in the funeral but then they will forget about me, and the world will go on. And the fact that no one will be sad for me drives me crazy, wanting to die even more. Why am I living at all? I have no value, don't I? If I can't be loved, then why should I live any further? 

I also feel disgusted of life. I mean, eating, having sex, kissing, making a family, having a child, anything that reminds me of life makes me feel sick. I can't bare it. I can't bare life. It's too much, and feels like I'm not part of it. I feel isolated from the world, like I am just watching a movie. I sometimes feel that someone else is living my life, and I'm stuck in my body, just enduring whatever is happening to me. I hope the show end soon. I'm sure the end would be peaceful. 

I'm failing, slowly. I know that my communication and comprehension skills regressed. I feel that I can't think fast anymore. My grades are not improving. I keep failing at getting even a part time job. I'm getting dumber and dumber everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should visit therapist or something like that? I can't remember how being normal feels, so I'm not sure I am still in the range of normal. Do you think I need help? Or is this just how other people feel too? If I visit therapist, then what should I tell them? ",05Apr2019,6
13,"My family in law are so dysfunctional. Crazy sister has haunted my life. Has cursed me and her brother out countless times. Has held a meeting to get him to leave us when our youngest was a newborn. Has told my parents in laws countless lies about me. Meanwhile she is unstable in every way and has screwed up someone else marriage. But they blame me. I have not seen her nor spoken to her since all this started. He has tried but she just cursed him out. She’s trashed our lawn. 

But this is why i want to leave. My husband has a hard time standing up to them. He likes to remain silent rather than speak the truth. He may comment like “yes that wasn’t right”. But he will not say  anything directly to defend me. I’ve been shunned because of them and i hate being connected to them. I have suffered depression and out patient treatment because they all make me feel like crap. The only way to get along with his parents is to pretend nothing ever happens. They have family secrets and pretend they don’t exist. It’s a really fucked up situation.

14,"I have been suffering for a long time. And today, as a 43 year old man, I sat on the bus, pulled my hood of my jacket over my head, put my head down, my hand over my face, and cried hard for about 15 minutes of my ride. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all over a woman I have been talking to who doesn't know how I feel about her. But I think I'm in love with the idea of being in her heart and her in mine more than anything. She's beautiful and I get along with her very, very well. But she's dating, and I am almost certain that any explanation of how I feel would be a disastrous thing to do. I am certain she wouldn't expect it, and obviously isn't looking for that sort of thing from me, and I know quite solidly from conversations with her I am not her type. You guessed it, I'm overweight and have a terrible diet. And I am trying yet again to do something about that but I have little faith. I could be wrong about her, but that's a gamble I cannot take, at least not now and probably not ever. I'd much rather have what I have than lose it trying to get more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

A thought process that is, like me, a big fat trigger for depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I cried, I was dead silent. I was horrified that I was even doing it. When it subsided, I look up, and no one noticed a thing. Not. One.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel invisible. The person I am is meaningless to most. And I have no clue how to connect with anyone. A lot of this has to do with long-term depression. I was always the kid sitting off by himself on one corner of the playground. Social avoidance almost constant. I pushed myself hard to break out of it when I was younger, and it worked for a while, but eventually my feet landed right back where I am right now, repeatedly. In complete misery. Agony, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no intention of doing anything but continuing to exist, but I don't know how to do it without the suffering. I've had a battery of therapists. I've tried medication. That didn't work in any way, shape or form - and people largely blame you when it doesn't. They are so steadfast in thinking that the solution has to work, and it must be that you're too stubborn to let it. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know what it really is? I hate myself. My self image is so far removed from my real image that I feel like garbage, like a bad part, a reject. And working on my self image has always felt futile, after all, why would I want to have a relationship or friendship with anyone that doesn't see the real me? The real me sucks, that's why. At least I suck to them, because they don't get it. They don't get what it feels like. They can't take a walk inside my head and feel the immense pain. Why would I want to be with someone who doesn't accept me for me? And me is fat. But I guess if I don't like it as much as others don't, I have to do something to change it. But I sense the judgment in people when I talk to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once when I lost a lot of weight, I had friends that told me how relieved they were that I lost it. As if now I was acceptable to be in their club. I got the impression that I had risen to a level that was acceptable to them now. That was very revealing, and only confirmed that in life, people are superficial, shallow, and unrefined. And they can't be trusted when they tell you they approve of you. Because it's conditional. Unconditional love is a myth.

&amp;#x200B;

If I could describe my lifelong depression to someone, I would put it like this - picture the pain of someone or something you love (pet, etc.). You love them more than anything. And they die. And you're at their funeral, being hit with that reality, and feeling all that pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, imagine having that pain, for either logical or illogical reasons every waking moment of every day. It's like having a second degree burn emotionally in some ways too. Every movement is pain, and you can be brave, and you can move despite the pain, but that pain is still there. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been almost ten years since I've had any sort of meaningful relationship with a woman. And my last relationship was so bad at the end that I can honestly say I was almost begging for death. I am scared of myself when I say that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want help. I want to not feel like this every second of every day. I want more light than dark. I could probably manage if I could have that. Hell, I might even see beyond it and correct some of the things that bother me, and maybe things would feel more okay than they do. I want to feel like I mean something to someone. I wish I could be in love with someone like the woman I mentioned earlier, and have it reciprocated. I want the warmth of being included, needed, cared about, valued. But I don't have it, and it's caused me to turn my analytical brain on myself. And in return, my mind judges me as unfit. And condemns me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a broken hearted prisoner, jailed in my own mind, with a wall around my heart. Walking around amongst the masses, acting brave, charming, and happy, but I am a train-wreck inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't trust therapists, I don't trust people, and I don't trust myself. I am begging God, Spaghetti Monster, Slender Man, Randy of The Redwoods, anyone for a sign. Something that will help this pain. It's simply unbearable sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

16,"Note: I am not suicidal, but I do have those moments if you know what I mean. Throwaway because my older brother uses reddit. I posted this to r/depression as well.

I am a 15 year old boy, and for the past few years I feel my parents have been somewhat overbearing. I love them and they are good people with good intentions, but I feel they overwhelm me sometimes.

Whenever I have to do chores like sweeping or mopping the floor, if I miss a small part of the floor, my parents (dad especially) will get on me and say things like ""90% is not good enough in the real world"", and say that because I missed a spot it doesn't count until I get everything properly. They call me lazy, and sometimes underhandedly insult my intelligence, even though they keep telling me I'm not stupid. To be fair, sometimes I am lazy and just do it half-ass but sometimes I genuinely missed it and I still get berated. Another thing is my grades (I am enrolled in an online school), they aren't super strict with it, but even if I get 90% they don't even really acknowledge it beyond ""good, but it could be better"". I am a good student overall with mostly A+, just lazy sometimes and If I make a mistake on a quiz and get something like 83% when they receive the email (they get email notifications when I submit an assignment and when an assignment is graded) they kinda question me about it. They told me that will kick me out at 18 if I'm not ""doing something"" meaning learned a skill and getting a job (I can't get a job in the country I live in because I'm not a citizen at least until I get a work visa, and most of companies don't hire many foreigners unless the company is owned by foreigners so I would have to get a higher-skill job) I kinda get it but I feel the burden is quite heavy to put on me at my age (they've been telling me this since I was 13) especially with the other things they are pushing me to do. Over the past few years I've lost interest in almost everything I had interest in (coding, soccer, music production and others) and the only thing that gives me some degree of pleasure is video games and internet surfing. I have a small interest in US politics (I'm half-American), even though I don't want to pursue a career in that field, it's just an interest. My dad basically told me it was a waste of time to be reading and learning about politics if I wasn't going to pursue it further, and as a result I am slowly but not completely losing interest in that as well. I am lazy sometimes, which may or may not be from my depression. I don't know what to think because it's like the chicken and the egg question, is it the laziness that made me depressed, which is making me more lazy and more depressed, or is it the other way around? Maybe I am just a lazy teenager who's using depression as an excuse, or maybe I am depressed. I don't know. Some occasions after getting yelled at I just go into the bathroom and cry for several minutes and think to myself ""maybe I am useless idiot who will get nowhere in life"". My dad has told me that maybe I am depressed, but it's not an excuse and on one occasion said everyone has depression, he also said that if I am depressed that nothing he says will matter as I will only ending up killing myself; my mom seems to agree with him. Needless to say, telling him I have depression is not going to do much. They've started doing these things when I was around 12, even more once I became a teen. Their intent isn't malicious and I know that they are trying to prepare me for the ""real world"" but it's really weighing on me. Even worse is because I'm home schooled in a foreign country I can speak the language but there aren't many kids that I can connect with like someone who's more like me, so I don't have any friends except one person who comes and goes every year or so. I know this is quite long and there's more I want to say, but I don't want make it too long. I just want some people to talk to and to cheer me up a little, so I will try to reply to comments as much as I can.",05Apr2019,1
17," 

I don't know what to start to honestly. 

I'm a dropout and I'm turning 19 this year and I got severe depression + anxiety and I can’t stop thinking about killing myself. 

My family is tearing me apart and they don’t realise it or they won’t accept that they’re the cause of me feeling this way.  

My family is one of those families where they think they are never wrong and always target me for everything that goes wrong when I completely had nothing to do with it. The same family that told me when I was 16 with suicidal thoughts, that I shouldn’t complain because other people had it worse than me. I’m constantly being picked on for the way I look and how I act and they’re constantly yelling at each other each day which fucks with my anxiety. I can’t even make eye contact with them before they think I’m giving them the dirty look and will start an argument. Just last week, my mom bluntly said that my cousins are doing so well in school and asked what happened to me to become a dropout and stay in my room all day. And I told my mom so many fucking times I want to die and this family is horrible but she won’t listen to me or she thinks it’s just a silly phase. 

I haven’t showered in months because my family convinced me I was too fat (which was true, I gained like 30 kgs from all the stress eating) but it had such a negative impact on me, I couldn’t stand to see my myself naked and I’ve lost about 10 kgs from starving myself. I pull out my own hair and chew on my fingers and take joy from the pain, I keep having nightmares each night that fucks me up like that one nightmare where my family roasted my cat in the oven and it felt so fucking real that I stayed up for days after that. 

My whole family knows I want to kill myself. But they don’t care or they keep triggering it and they laugh at my face for being weak. 

I’m struggling to get a job because my anxiety fucks me up in the interviews, I got no money, I can't move out, I can’t escape from my family. I’m trapped.  ",05Apr2019,1

      Telling myself I'm fine because I go to work and and do household chores meanwhile the other 50 percent of the time I'm sleeping or playing games because I can't. I don't leave the house except to go grocery shopping or do laundry.
     I used to draw everyday and now the thing that kept me going for 14+ makes me fucking sad. I hate that. I want to enjoy creating things again and keeping up with my friends and having a life. 

      I'm honestly not sure where to start. I have insurance that I pay monthly but I haven't made an appointment. I haven't been to a doctor in over 5 years. Starting over with a whole new one freaks me out too. I get lost mentally preparing a script of what to say and then my mind will just make it seem more daunting than it is so i put it off. Even though I'm personally fed up with myself, part of me is worried my PCP will just brush this off as not being bad enough to warrant treatment.

24,"I don't even know where to begin I have never kinda wrote on a board like this before but am feeling completely lost with where im at right now and just want to let this out and not bottle it in anymore. I  am  27 and have had anxiety since I was probably 12 and the evolved into depression around 14. In the past year ive made a big decision to go back to college after being out of school for 8 years and enjoyed it so much first semester but once second semester I became overwhelmed and got intense anxiety about everything and because of that I started getting physically sick all the time and ended up having to take time off school because I just couldn't go. I wanted to be there but I have this underlying feeling that I can't and that I am going to fail and it overcomes me. I have recently been subscribed medication but before that I would end up just self medicating with alcohol and that would end up making me worse, Hangovers, Shame-overs.. It was becoming a problem. I would end up spending money recklessly and now am behind in my bills and almost facing eviction and failing school. I honestly feel so worthless and even at some points feel like just giving up entirely but that's why I am here to ask for some advice and help or even just some words of encouragment. I am ready to make a change and have made a vow to take time and figure myself out. No more self medicating and avoiding responsibilities ",05Apr2019,1
25,"It was a rough morning. My husband (M30) and I (F26) had a meeting this morning to get my 3 year old enrolled in an all day pre-k program for the fall, which is pretty hard to get into in my area, and it just seemed like everything that could have went wrong did. I brought our two kids to the car and my hubby forgot to grab the birth certificate we needed that I’d laid out for him to grab. We thought where we needed to go was much closer than it was so we ended up being late. And it just seemed like a lot of small irritations kept coming up as we tried to get there.

But then we did get there. And honestly? Everything went really well.  Like, we were in and out within 15 minutes and are all set to have him attend in the fall. Yet.. I’m just frustrated. My husband is wonderful, and spent the little bit of time he had before leaving for work trying really hard to help but I just can’t shake this mood even though this all happened like two hours ago. I just feel.. depressed. It’s like my mind starts feeling upset and even when the issue is resolved I can’t shake the feeling and I just don’t feel like doing anything at this point at all. I’m a stay at home mom, so I’m home with my two young kiddos, but just don’t know how to flip how I’m feeling. I guess I’m just looking for some motivation.. this isn’t the first time this has happened and generally my day ends up being pretty terrible when this does happen and I really don’t want that. I just feel stuck. Any advice? ",05Apr2019,45
26,"Been making myself feel real awful thinking about what I do not have,  what I have lost, and what I want. These thoughts bring me no closer to  what I desire, so I must take action. Money, love, friendship, fame,  what are you doing to get it? As is quoted from the Buddha, ""Craving and desire are the cause of all unhappiness.""  


The three people in my life who are fairly consistent emotional supports were busy or just disappeared basically for 2 weeks. Even as two of them return into my life, I was left feeling distant from them, like I had to safeguard myself. I realize that this will simply take some time to regain that trust and consistency, but I also think to myself, okay, I need more emotional supports and a real relationship - how am I gonna do it? Go to more events? Make a dating profile? Trying to be proactive to get out of this insecure feeling.

27,"I have always been a person who was smiling, but lately I just cant stop myself from crying.
I can be out all day and talk to people and smile but as soon as Im alone tears just roll down my face. And its getting worse. Im having harder time getting out of bed.

I have a bf and he is a very supportive person but I still cant get myself to open up completely. I am afraid that he will not understand and will break up with me. I used to have very high sex drive and so does he, but for a while now I feel like my drive is below zero. I keep having sex with him because I dont want him to think I stopped loving him or that Im not attracted to him. But every time we have sex now I just feel numb, and after I just want to cry.

I dont know where Im going with this. I dont want to cry and I dont want to lose my bf. ",05Apr2019,10
28,"Hello. I have been struggling with depression for years now. I recently went through a horrible time and was very close to killing myself. I made it through but I honestly feel like something died in me during that time.

As of right now, I am indifferent towards killing myself and staying alive with a lean towards killing myself. I am just so unsatisfied, so alone, and so exhausted with dealing with my mental health.

I have a decent life, not great, but decent. Things are going okay for me right now but I just feel so drained and empty. In may, I'm going to be switching antidepressants because effexor just isn't cutting it for me it seems. 

I know that drugs won't solve my depression completely, that I need to also take actions such as going to the gym, postive mindset when possible, talking, etc. Etc. But I'm sure so burnt out of it.

I know I am strong enough to get through this, or at least that's what I tell myself. The thing is, is that I don't want to anymore. I'm so exhausted that I simply don't want to put the effort in anymore. After streaks of happiness, I usually end up miserable again and it feels like I'm just waiting for the enviable.  

I just don't want to live anymore. ",05Apr2019,3
