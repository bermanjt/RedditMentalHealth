1,I feel like everything is passing by me and that it’s all a dream. Nothing feels real and I just don’t feel like I am my body. Idk how to describe it. Anyone know what it is?,23May2019,3
3,"epitomize the basic failure of the Good American Life myth. It is not good in America if the poor are wasted and blamed for their own problems and the rich are cut off and apathetic and superior and most people don't know enough to form a decent analysis of anything. Our needs are chronically being unmet. Then we are supposed to think that personal breakdown is our personal shame and if we are naive enough to call a crisis line believing their blatant empty lies about being available to ""help"", we will see that everything I said here is true.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not call those places. There is only ONE reason they exist and that is to LIGHTEN THE BURDEN OF THE POLICE DEPT.  because the police dept has to PUNISH you for these feelings as much as for any other ""crime"".  Its true. Look up the law.  They will lock you up for saying you are suicidal. But they would rather not have to do it. Then on the phone you notice that  the worker can't talk about her own experiences which were helpful to her, can't say one damn thing to show she can help, but you are supposed to respond positively anyway. The built in cynicism is paralyzing but the workers never notice. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that is to make the LIE look like the truth. That anyone cares about anyone when its only a JOB to do it. They won't care. They like their paycheck and/or tight privileged place with their church.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you call, you MUST say ""I was suicidal and now thanks to you I'm ok.""

&amp;#x200B;

They KNOW you have to say this. They know it in ADVANCE. The reason is that contemplating suicide is a crime as much as doing it...is.  So they got you. And they really DON'T have to give a bleep about YOU. Its a JOB to them, or more accurately a bragging point for their false friends who in their minds rely on credentials and position instead of truth.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you're in trouble that way, be SURE you have a list of real friends you can rely on. You will HAVE to have this prepared because NO ONE on the phone who works for these phony do- gooding agencies...will help you. They don't care because they don't have to. Don't find out the hard way. There are right and wrong ways to talk to people in crisis and these folks don't know how. Three guess how I figured this all out.",23May2019,1
4,"I just lost my virginity a week ago and the guy I lost it to gave me herpes a few months ago from oral and I’m just now knowing for sure now and honestly I just don’t think I can live anymore not even that I have herpes but just that I’m so young and the first time I trusted anyone enough with my body they scarred me for life and I will never be the same ever again, I don’t think I can ever trust anyone ever again, I feel like I will never love anyone or allow anyone to love me and I just feel like a life like that is just pointless. I struggled with depression for so long and I was just getting back on path and this happened it’s almost like I’m not meant to be happy or content and I just feel like I can’t take it anymore. I can’t even go back to college because I can’t afford it, I can’t find a job, I’m so unhappy and it gets worse everyday. I haven’t left my house in days I haven’t even brushed my teeth I just want to die tbh and I have nobody to talk to about it and I just wanted to feel like I could say it... I’ve been trying so hard to be positive but it’s eating away at my spirit I just don’t want to live like this",23May2019,3
6,"After 5 years I’ve managed to relieve other symptoms by reading up on it or them just going away naturally. But I still have anhedonia. I can’t feel reward or joy after achieving things, so I’m close to just giving up on doing stuff",23May2019,2
7,"So not exactly the title... But the last two years, depression has really knocked me out. Time goes through these off and on period where months fly by as though nothing has happened. I'll be working and realize I'm off by a month or realize what day it is and just break down in tears. It's like waking up from an ice capsole and teleporting months ahead and falling back asleep. I try to mix up my routine a bit, but I am very young and already I feel as though life has slipped me by and by tomorrow I might be old and dead. I feel the same day by day, and everything changes around me except my mind. It's like mental imprisonment in a false speed up world. The reverse will often also happen, but very rarely. Does this happen to anyone else? If so, do you have any recommendations on how to stop this? It is really taking a mental toll on me as I am someone who values time.",23May2019,11
8,"Hey, just here to vent and talk about what I'm thinking. Like im having a rough time. I was in a relationship with this girl I would have done anything for her, loved her more than my mom, more than the military that I've dedicated my life too. But I am an emotional broken person and I just couldn't articulate how I felt but I was adamant about not getting help so I could join the army and bu the end the relationship she didnt feel loved the way I did love her, I did a lot for her or at least I thought I did not enough I suppose so we broke up and for about 7 months I was just emotional destroyed, still a broken person, PTSD, emotional abuse, I used to get beat whenever I cried so I can't really cry at all now but I still feel pain and sadness just dont know how to Express it well. But I started talking to this girl not for any reason just it was nice to talk and open up, and of course eventually I fell for her, but I was still very broken and she was in a relationship so I stayed away from that type of thing and we just stayed friends then they broke up and I was helping her through that, for a short while I thought I could swoop in or something but I made sure I didnt and stayed away so I didnt ruin someone else life or at the very least my friendship. But I love her, I won't tell her though she's in a new relationship and I'm really happy for her, her and my ex I'm glad they're both happy they both are new relationships and happy. But it hurts to see or think about too much because I can't have that ever. I just wish I could find that happiness i had again, or at least like just relief from this unrelenting sadness. Just for a like a full day, I dont want to think about my own shortcomings I just want a moment of release from my demons, but I dont take breaks from my goal and all I do now is try to be the best or at least get better at whatever I'm doing.",23May2019,4
9,"So my family doctor referred me to a psychiatrist to see about my depression and sucidial thoughts because the meds I’m on aren’t really helping. I hadn’t heard anything in a while so I called to see what the progress on it was. They immediately connected me to the psychiatrist office. The nurse told me they did not have any appointments for new patients for a while. She and I talked for a while and she took down my information. She said I was high fish so I should go to their crisis center to get my meds adjusted immediately. She made a note in my chart so the intake people would know what to do. I’m thinking about going in the morning but I looked up the place and the review are really bad. It could just be people ranting because they didn’t get their way but it’s still scary. Here’s the place ( Carolina healthcare system behavioral health on 501 billingsley rd., Charlotte nc). Should I go tomorrow? I’m really nervous and I don’t know what to do.",23May2019,3

16,"My mom died of cancer when I was in high school and for every other example of this scenario playing out in my school district the student in that situation was treated better than normal and given an easy path through the year. Not me, I was treated like garbage and that wore away at a lot of my confidence. Now I miss my mom because it’s been years and even though a couple months ago I was able to buy a house at 24 it feels so empty, I live with my best friend and yet it doesn’t feel the same. It’s not waking up in the middle of the night with your significant other resting on your shoulder. It’s not the late night talks about the future and all the dumb thoughts that come to mind when no one else matters but each other. I miss the fighting, I miss feeling alive with someone else. I’m never an option to anyone, I just get looked past like I’m no one and it stings. I just want to feel needed. If you have  heard Love Falls by Hellyeah, the lyrics speak to me on a level that’s rare. I’m miserable and I hate that I have to keep walking because I’m ready to throw in the towel.",23May2019,69
17,"Hi, everyone. New here, so hopefully this is not gonna go too badly. I'm kinda stuck atm and I figured that maybe shouting into the internet's oblivion that is Reddit might eventually bring me more than echos.

I guess I should start with some set up ...

So, I've been depressed for probably a pretty long time (24yo female). Ever since I entered collage 5 years ago, things have been progressively getting worse and worse, even tho I've tried my hardest for them to get better, or at least I think I did. I did try to have a regular work out schedule and better diet, but a lot of the times I end up feeling so down that I can't keep it up or I just need that energy to get my school work done. I tried therapy for a year, felt better, then crashed hard. I tried medicine too but it also didn't seem to help much and I stopped since people around me, while not saying I shouldn't take them, told me that it's not good for me and I'm better off without them. I completely broke myself when it was time to graduate two years ago because I refused to take a gap year or delay graduation for anything, so I ended up writing my thesis, passing final exams and passing a scholarship exam for a Japanese uni in one semester, even tho i drove me suicidal. I was a little happy then, but now I can't help but feel worthless and over my head. I feel like slowly I can't feel joy at all. It's just not that joy that'd lift your heart anymore. It's kind of a faint acknowledgment of an achievement within myself no matter how big. 

I've been doing therapy for a year now, trying to go to school on the regular and getting ready for my entrance exams, but things just don't seem to be getting better. My issues are just mounting. I lack more and more energy, my head hurts most of the time even tho I'd say I go outside fairly regularly.  I can't stand that I seem to have completely lost my path at 24 and that makes me really anxious about getting older and older and feeling my options slowly closing down, but not really knowing what my true passion is anymore. Honestly, I don't know who I am anymore at times because of how I force myself to be cheerful with people even when I feel bad. Yet I still feel like people are telling me I don't try hard enough to be happy.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Am I just not trying hard enough to get better? Did I decide on this and my depression is really just a habit? Any advice is welcomed.

Sorry for the long post. Hope everyone has a nice, safe day.",23May2019,4

19,"About 2 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and was out on medication for it i cant remember at what point or even why i stopped taking it but I did. Last sunday I overdosed I don’t think I actually wanted to die i just wanted to stop. I went to the doctor and was prescribed new meds but now I can’t stop thinking if i’m really depressed.
I feel happiness, or at least i think I do, and I feel anger and irritation and sadness but a lot of the time I don’t know what i feel.. Do I feel nothing? I don’t look forward to anything in the future. I have no goals, no aspirations nothing. I just do what I do to keep the days going.

Some days I wake up feeling what I think to be happy but then within a few hours my mood is drastically different sometimes for no reason and sometimes for the smallest most insignificant reason.. That’s another thing I get upset extremely easy and it’s very hard to control. I cry very often but sometimes i don’t even know why.. am i crying out of anger?? sadness?? stress?? sometimes i wonder if i really feel emotions or if i’ve just pretended long enough that i’ve convinced myself i do.

I find it extremely hard to make friends, I’m not too sure why. I do have difficulty building up courage to talk to people, and keeping a conversation going.. what do i talk about?? When I do make friends i seem to cling to them in an almost obsessive way getting jealous if they get close with others and if someone i was once close with somewhat drifts away I assume it was because of something i have done.

I go between sleeping 12+ hours and still being exhausted to sleeping less than 6 and feeling super energetic. I go between eating maybe once a day to eating multiple times. I go between wanting to leave the house and go out and wanting to sit in bed all day. Sometimes I sleep because i can’t find anything that excites me enough to make me feel not bored. I try to play games i once enjoyed but I can’t find enjoyment. Even the thought of playing bores me. I get waves of nausea and headaches I almost always have back pain.

I feel like there is something wrong with me but i don’t know what it is. Is it really depression it is just my personality?? i feel like i don’t deserve therapy for my depression i feel like i’m wasting everyone’s time because i’m not sad all the time i feel other emotions but I also feel nothing. no emotions.",23May2019,1

23,"I was hospitalized against my will late last year after a suicide attempt. The hospitalization did nothing but make my day to day anxiety worse, as it tacked on a giant hospital bill on top of everything else that had already driven me to that point. I know I need to see a psychiatrist, but I'm terrified I'll be committed again. Do I just not mention that I have multiple plans/options to end my life? I do not think I'm an immediate threat to myself, but I worry I might come off that way to a doctor.",23May2019,1
24,"It hurts like hell, for so long I've lost, happniess lost, love lost, joy lost. My world became empty, colours became gray. Life joyless.
And the hate would and still eats me up. I can't bring myself to trust because I thought of myself as trash not only that but... bad.

I would get the your ugly, and rejected by society.

I've sat near the edge so many times that I no longer could  fear death.

I lost myself, only living for the sake of living.

But not a while ago, it dawned on me. ""Ahh fuck it""
Because, I will no longer feel this sadness. This pain, this anger, sadness.

I will live, love, be happy, enjoy and.  . . Hope.

If my soul is lost, then I'll tear the heavens to get it back.
I will not let myself suffer, I will get up. I will live. I will grow and have a girl, I'll enjoy life even if I'm meant to suffer. I marry my soulmate and have a wonderfull life.

27,"So I have been with my partner for 3 years and while I love him, he makes no effort or time to help or be supportive of my recovery. I have bipolar disorder and struggle to take my meds and today I havent moved out of bed at all. I feel like I'm pinned to the mattress and I'm exhausted even though I slept for 12 hours last night. I know I'm having a bad time but I just moved out of my parents house a couple of weeks ago to a new city and am staying by myself for the first time ever. My boyfriend currently is my only support system and hes not even willing to drive over to see me this afternoon and I know I won't move until I have to go to work tomorrow if he doesnt. 

Is this me putting too much pressure on him? I try so hard not to push anything on him, and normally I can at least get up and shower but  today I feel so stuck. I'm scared tbh, and outside of him telling me I should take my meds when I'm grumpy he doesnt view any of this as serious. He kinda treats me like I have a cold. ""Rest up, hope you feel better"" and holds me at arms distance. I just wish he would be present and supportive uk, ask about what I'm feeling or what I need.
