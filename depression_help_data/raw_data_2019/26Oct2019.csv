0,I am tired of taking anti depressants and Im also tire of taking sleeping and relaxation pills. I just want to be free. I want to feel nothing and just be gone. I don't want to feel anything anymore I am so tired,26Oct2019,2
1,I (21M) keep running in the same circles. Every single time I think I can get out of it I fucking fall back in. I'm sick of  mentally tearing myself apart just to attempt to rebuild it. I don't feel close to anyone or anything and I'm sick of existing. I can't even focus on my school work and my grades are showing it which tears me down further. I don't know what to do next and Im sick of frequent and  graphic suicidal thoughts and idealizations. My meds aren't helping anymore and it's a bitch to get ahold of my Dr. but I'm trying. I don't know what to do next.... I just want to be done.,26Oct2019,1
2,"Hey, so I have been going to a new school for about a month now because my old private school kicked me out. I have no motivation at this point. I loved my old school and now I have no other option than to go to one of the worst schools in my city. I don't really want to go here at all, but I don't really have any other options and I have to get through it for the rest of this year and senior year. I don't want it to be a shitty experience. So far it is. At my old school I was somewhat popular. I always had close friends and now that I don't have that in school its boring. I put my earbuds in and put my head down most classes. I want friends at school again. I made friends with a few kids. One new kid and some kids that have been going there the whole time. I don't really like these people. But I just can't seem to build up the energy to talk to people. I barely have enough energy just to sit in class and listen to music. How do I get past this? Any tips on going to a new school and having 0 friends and the whole time being depressed so you can't even put in any effort to make friends.",26Oct2019,1
3,"Could honestly use some help right now, I'm 21 and have been fighting suicidal depression every day since I was 6 years old. My parents both told me that they would be happier if I killed myself when I was younger. The only people I have are my grandparents. Every single relationship I've had have all made me realize how unlovable and how unwanted I am. It's not for lack of trying either I work out I try to socialize with other people but are there people who should commit suicide because I feel that I am one of them.",26Oct2019,0
4,Just had my first counseling session on BetterHelp and I think I enjoyed it.  Anyone else here use a service like that?  Sometimes it’s a whole chore to get out of the house and I really like the idea of talking to someone from home.,26Oct2019,1
5,"I don't know what I'm doing I dont know who I am I don't know what I am, and I just want to scream. I feel like I'm dying, I can't breath, my heart feels like it pounding. I just want to break down and cry all the time. I don't know how to ask for help, I don't know how to open up, I'm sorry if it seems like I'm trying to just get attention, but I don't know where to turn.
I have always known I fit in better with the girls, I understood them and they were interested in the same things. I didn't know that if I had brought these thoughts out to open I could do something about them, I was ashamed of them, they weren't what everybody else was feeling. I would pray every night to the point of tears to wake up as a girl the next morning, no such luck. I stopped believing in Santa Clause because I wrote a secret note asking for a doll, and I didn't get it. I his everything about myself because I feared so much that people would find out. It seems irrational saying, but I'm still scared. As I've gotten older I've stopped praying and expecting to just wake up in a new body that is the true me, I've become numb, when I'm grouped as a guy (even just typing that sent shivers down my spine) I have like chest pain and can't breath.

I don't know what I'm saying, I think I just needed to type some stuff out sorry if you felt like I wasted your time.",26Oct2019,1
6,I a (22M) was talking to a (22F) for 2 months and things were going great but the only issue was she didn’t know what she wanted relationship-wise... so long story short tonight she randomly just tells me she didn’t know she was seeing somebody since whenever the fuck and i’m just done trying with people. Fucking ridiculous.,26Oct2019,3
7,"Life has been changing. The question of suicide is back but I remind myself of the hurt it will cause others - the cost of giving up. I feel alienated from my family. We’ve always been dysfunctional but at least together in some sick way. I don’t have friends. I’m not good at making them. Never have been. My boyfriend is it, and my therapist wants me to think about if I’m repeating a dysfunctional family cycle with him - alcohol related. Then what? What will I have without him? I’m 31. I feel lost. I tried supporting my family when I could. And I feel like no one was there when I needed it. There’s some anger there but mostly everyone was too busy with their own lives. I’m tired of being everyone else’s therapist. Life is miserable. What am I doing and why? I have no support system. I don’t have faith anymore. Life goals seem unattainable. Life is misery. And no one wants to listen... I tried talking to my boyfriend. He tries. But also, it hurts. It’s hard to be vulnerable and to voice what I’m really thinking and feeling. People don’t want to hear stuff like that. And the response can be hurtful. Even when they are trying, they are usually trying to change the subject.",26Oct2019,3
8,"Hello. I've been struggling with what feels to me like depression for some time now. I don't have an official diagnosis, but I have a large amount of the symptoms. Anyway, I want to talk to my doctor about seeing somebody about my mental health, a therapist or something. But I'm too scared to bring up the topic. Like I can't accept the fact that I need help. Im seeing a new doctor for the first time in early December for a standard check up, but I'm worried that I won't be able to say anything about it. My question is to the people who've been in my situation. The people who had difficulties accepting the fact that they needed help. How did you do it? Is there anything that made it easier for you? How did you get past this barrier?
Thank you for reading this, and if you have done so, thank you for replying too.",26Oct2019,1
9,"I don't know if this is the place to put this, but does anyone know how to make me stop liking people romantically? I'm only attracted to girls, but relationships make my depression worse when they get bad or end and my stress gets worse as the relationship goes on. I can't help being so attracted to their appearance though. I really don't want to be anymore though, but I don't know how to stop. I just want to stop being attracted to people in a romantic way. Anyone got any ideas?",26Oct2019,3
10,"google says i am, everyone i’ve talked to says i’m not 

i (teenF) have been feeling like this since a traumatic event when i was 9-10. basically my entire world changed and everything following got worse - i was getting picked on, parents pressured me about school, and my self esteem was pretty non existent. i was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed junior therapy, still got my panic attacks to this day. it was just a feeling of being lost for a year or two, and it developed into a constant feeling of a weight on my shoulders, like a lack of motivation for literally everything. i dropped out of my extracurricular activities and spent all the time i could in bed. it’s still like this. 

i was one of those ‘gifted’ kids - i joined the grade 6’s for classes when i was 8, and at the beginning of high school i did extension classes with the seniors. that’s gone now i guess. i’m barely holding on to average level, and i don’t retain information like i used to. 

i began self-harming around 12. at first i would burn myself, but it developed to cutting when i got older. my first suicide attempt was at 14, and second was maybe 7 months ago. i told my mother, i see a councillor every two weeks, and medication is locked away. 

i am only starting to make real friends these past few months. the feelings are still there though. 

it feels like the entire world is watching me constantly. like a judging feeling every second of the day. i shower in the dark and don’t like to look at my body, 1 because of self esteem and 2 i don’t want the people behind my eyes to see my disgusting body. i sleep and stay in bed and cry basically most of my spare time. everything i do is pretty pointless. suicidal thoughts are like a routine. 

i’ve tried to talk to people about it. the councillor doesn’t really talk about it, only talking about dealing with anxiety and ignores the low mood stuff. everyone else tells me i’m just another teenage girl who’s looking for attention. i’ve had comments like “what, you gonna cut your wrists where everyone can see now? you’ll get all the attention you want that way”. i get guilted by others saying “your parents are still together though” or “you’re smart though aren’t you?” or “you live in a nice house and you eat. stop complaining” 

it’s not nice. i just want that extra confidence boost that i’m not in over my head to go see a doctor or whatever. i don’t want to feel like this anymore.",26Oct2019,6

14,"Basically I’ve never spoke about this to anyone, I’m always putting on a front that everything is fine when it’s soooo far from it. I can’t develop any meaningful connections with anyone, I feel like once you understand that there is nobody on this planet who is 100% there for you, it’s a horribly sad reality and what is the point? I’m not saying I’m suicidal, I’m terrified of dying but at the same time I just don’t want to be here yknow? I can honestly say with every bone in my body that I could not tell you one thing I like about myself? They tell you the first step to feeling better about yourself is noticing small things you like about yourself and I honestly couldn’t tell you a single thing?

I’m at a stage where I’m not even depressed, I feel absolutely nothing. I can’t see any point in going out with friends because none of them really give two fucks about you? I don’t know if it’s just my experience but I have yet to meet (after 23 years on the planet) someone who GENUINELY gives a shit about me. Like I will go out and try have a good time with people and it masks it sometimes for a few minutes but I constantly feel like I don’t fit in anywhere? I’m overweight, but I don’t care enough about myself to do anything about it? My whole life bases on the question what is the actual point? I can’t look at myself in the mirror anymore because sometimes it makes me physically sick. I try so hard to better myself as a person and I can truly say I don’t feel sorry for myself in the slightest. I’m not wollowing, I just feel nothing.

What makes it all 100x worse is that I did mental health nursing at university and I dropped out because I felt like a total hypocrite. Telling people to talk when I won’t talk to a single person? If I felt like talking would help me I honestly would, I don’t feel any shame and nobody should about their mental health. I just know it will do nothing to help me, I’ve tried every form of approach from meditation to exercise and there is nothing that makes any difference.

My friends are all lovely, great people yet I can’t develop any connections towards them at all. I also get walked over constantly by people and my family. I would give my last penny and do anything for people I care about, yet nobody has ever nor I imagine WILL ever do this for me. What’s wrong with me? I don’t know what I’m getting out posting this, guess Just needed to vent which sometimes helps if I write everything I feel down and I’m sorry that the way this is written is more confusing than fucking Brexit but yeah. Or if there is anyone out there I can comfort in knowing that if they’re going through the same thing then they’re not alone.

I think between being in an insanely abusive relationship and having friend after friend walk over me without a thought has just fucked me up, only so much hurt you can take from people you care about. Honestly I’ve not been myself in years and nobody has even noticed? I am in absolutely dyer need of a connection with someone but can't make myself do so cause i've had my heart broken over and over again thinking I meant something to people",26Oct2019,1
15,"I've struggled with depression for like 6 years  now, but never told any of my friends. It's been really bad the last three years and I can feel it impacting my relationships. I'm not as close with my friends any more and I'm always late for stuff, I get sick ""randomly"" (aka really bad depressive episodes) and I don't answer texts etc. My best friend really has no idea that I'm struggling like this but thinks I have a secret... I feel like I need to tell her before we drift apart even more, but I'm scared she'll react badly or view me differently, or worse, think I'm begging for attention or that I'm ""crazy"" because of the stigma around stuff like this. How should I do it, and what should I say? Don't want to overshare but if I underexplain, people won't take it seriously. And should I just tell my best friend or some of my other friends as well?  Any advice would be amazing ♥️",26Oct2019,1
16,"Hello,

Are you worried about struggles you are going through?

Why you always going through a lot, when people around you are happy?

Feeling hatred about everything in your life?

If so.

Have you ever thought these?

When happiness, have you ever thought why it's choose you?

When you got a great partner, have you ever thought why so much of joy?

When your life is going as per your wish, have you ever thought why it's like so?

We have been bound to these hide seek game of joy and sorrow.

You know, why some people are happy always? It's just because they perceive both joy and sorrow in same way. 

When things are going crazy and against you.!

Keep this always in mind.

There is always a light after dark, that's the reason there is dawn and dusk.! Nature has so much related to our life.

When you are going through a lot, try to hang on. Just hanging in there and try to go through it. 


When you feel lonely instead of catching negative thoughts try to remember your best days and those people who were with you.

Try to be in peace, but how?

Meditation is the answer.

It's help you to enjoy being yourself.

You can always PM me or comment.

Being Human is more than being anything here.

Servicing people is serving GOD.

A smile a day keeps your sorrow's away.!

Just smile.!.

Thank you",26Oct2019,0
17,"Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like ""crackhead"" or ""you look like an old man"", ""you look like a hobo"", ""Looks like Albert Einstein"", ""Do you wash your hair?"" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is ""illegal"" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. There's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful it'd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life.",26Oct2019,79

20,"I'm sick of my life. I can't feel happy anymore. All I feel is anger everyday. Sometimes boredom but I'm mostly angry about everything in my life. 

I have no job, and nobody give me a chance at an interview after filling out so many applications and making so many jobs for the past 2 years.

I got no friends or support system from my family because they're all either scared of me because I'm not happy about how things are or they either don't want to listen to me because they don't like what I have to say. Just because I'm not happy go-lucky with a job that pays and rewards me, I get avoided by everyone, including my family.

I have no friends because of this and no one who wants me for any reason.

The only thing I'm ever needed for is house work and to babysit to live here. Nothing else.

I can't even earn money because no one wants to pay me.
Again, it's Been Two years of This and I Just can't take it anymore. And people wonder why I'm not happy.

I'm 21 and I go to the library to fill out job applications everyday.

Then I come home to an annoying asf brother who always raps out loud and does what he wants. I can't tell him anything because he always hurts me in some type of way, wether it's name calling or get physical with me.  I also come home to a baby brother that doesn't listen and messes up everything around the place, leaving me to clean it up. And worse of all, I come home to a mother who complains about how stressful she is and multiple other things but when I insist to help, she always tells me not to and continues to complain and attack me saying that I'm one thing and another. At that point I just leave her presence, because I don't know how to help her if she doesn't want it.

I just can't live like this any longer. I wish I had advice or friends to help me out of this situation because idek how to get out of this on my own. Any advice would help me rn. Im 21, and i really need it to live my life. 

I really don't want to be this loser who can't treat himself for his efforts anymore.
And I really don't want to stay around these people I live with any longer.

I just want the freedom to live on my own and in peace from my family's critical behaviors. I would love it if I could get help.seriously, Any help is much appreciated. Thanks for reading my issues",26Oct2019,1

With all of this pressure and the seasons changing, I completely burnt myself out and fell into a full blown depressive episode. I lost all motivation for almost three weeks straight, I've been over sleeping, not taking care of myself, let my room become a total disaster, and completely fell behind in school. Yesterday was a really bad day for me. I starting thinking about how bad my grades will be, how behind I am in my classes, how awful I feel and this all gave me so much anxiety. I slept ALL day from waking up at 2 pm, falling back asleep at 5 pm and not waking up until this morning. This morning I decided enough is enough. I cleaned my room which is a huge step and that helped me feel a little bit more in control. I now am starting to do my school work. I know I need to reach out to my professors.... but I don't even know what to say. How do I explain to them my situation? I truly do care about my classes and hate myself for putting myself in this self destructive cycle. I don't want to fail, I have too much on the line. My scholarships pay for my schooling and if I lose those I'm doomed. How do i start to dig myself out of this hole?",26Oct2019,2

I wasn't popular in school, I didnt have a group of friends to hangout with and gossip with. I was an outcast. I was sexually abused as a preteen and to this day haven't told anyone about it. It wasn't just once, it was over and over again by more than one person. I didnt think I'd ever find love but I was ""lucky"" to find someone who ""loves me"" but am I lucky? I have 2 beautiful children out of this but I've never been truly happy. Sure we have had good times but good times always turn to dark times. Times of verbal abuse. Making me feel worthless, a failure, a problem. The only way I feel better is to inflict some kind of pain to myself. Whether its punching a wall, digging my nails into my arms, biting myself as I scream, ripping my hair out, etc. Its the only thing that makes the emotional pain go away. I dont want to die. I dont want to leave my children, I just want happiness! When will the pain stop?",26Oct2019,1
33,"I am 23 male, recently graduated highschool and I am studying now. Right now Im in a dark place and considering suicide as a nice option out of this misery. What fuels my depression greatly is that I am not able to finish things and spend huge amounts of effort into one thing just to abandon it some time later because I lost interest or some other dumb reason. Another problem is that I can't kill myself now because I have a girlfriend and mother who I love a lot and I don't want to cause them any problems otherwise it would be a great option. I also feel trapped since I know there are potential solutions to my situation and current mental state but I know I'll never follow through because I will continue to sabotage myself along the way. As an example is my college ""career"" : I also signed up last year and didn't last longer than 3 weeks because I just stopped going there despite huge efforts to go and waking up in time, it (self sabotage) just happens naturally, same thing happens now. But I can't see a way out because there isn't one, when I try to work I just self sabotage myself again. People always tell me that I should find out what I really like doing and start pursuing this and I do this and always end up loving it but not continuing it. I had moments where I realized that I will never be able to pursue something seriously enough to live independently but thought to myself: now I'll try again, but now I'm here again and I know it doesn't matter what I try, I'll fall back. It is just impossible to live and support oneself like that. 

I really hope someone has some suggestions what I should consider doing or thoughts on my situation would be great too.

(sorry for my English)",26Oct2019,2
