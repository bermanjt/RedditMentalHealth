I'm 18, and being on this Earth for 18 years is more than enough for me to realize I absolutely fucking hate it, Everytime I open up my eyes in the morning Im disappointed that I'm still here....it means I have to go out and try and act like a normal human but I can't, I can't just be a normal teenager, my social anxiety is through the roof, my self esteem couldn't be lower, the few relationships I have aren't doing well...I just have no idea what to do with this life that was forced upon me, it doesn't get better, i can't be fixed, do people honestly think going to a therapist and having them tell you everything you already know will help? Idk I'm just beyond frustrated right now, idk what to do, I don't know where to turn, I'm just genuinely angry that I'm alive and this I've Never felt before, I'm literally afraid to live...this is no way to live,",20Jun2019,2
1,"Last year i tried mdma twice (once in October and once in November) i know this is unsafe but at the time I had no idea what the repercussions were. I fell into a deep depression pretty much right after my second dose. Over the winter I went on and off Prozac but eventually stayed on lexapro in February for a full 8 weeks, but still to little effect. It is not mid June and I am seeing little progress despite trying to stay active regularly and focusing only on positives in my life. It’s been rough and now it’s getting old. I’ve decided on going to my doctor to see what medication I could get on soon, but it feels like 7 months is just too long especially with little improvement. 

I guess I’m posting this because I want to see if there is anyone else who has been in this situation before and has any advice. 

 The worst part of all this is that I used to be an incredibly social and weirdly happy person. I still want so badly to be social so I push myself to see my friends, but I simply cannot enjoy myself, nor can i when I’m alone. There is nothing in specific I am anxious or depressed about. I work out regularly. My family loves me and my friends still make an effort to see me, but it’s like I always hit a ceiling when I start to enjoy myself. I have just been consistently depressed for the last 7 months. I just want this to be over so I can get back to my  life.",20Jun2019,1

3,I don't know what to do anymore. Years of hell and years more to come. I can't even anymore. Everything feels like it's crashing. I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to deal with this anymore I just want to feel nothing. Or feel something real maybe something that doesn't hurt physically or mentally or emotionally. about a year-and-a-half ago CPS took my kids because of my depression. I'm supposed to be getting them back but there's a minor road block and my depression is worse than it's ever been and I don't even know what to do anymore. My medication doesn't work like it should. All I do is cry and break stuff. I have manic episodes. I was sexually abused as a child and have never been the same. I can't seem to find happiness anywhere. Even though I'm supposed to be getting my kids back I still don't feel. I feel that I'm not mentally stable enough or capable of taking care of my kids like I want to. I don't want them to have my grandma or my mother as a mother. I want them to have better and I don't think I can offer that. I just don't know what to do anymore. Do I keep fighting and be selfish because I want to see them grow up? Or do I just admit that I'm not mentally stable enough to take care of them and let it be?,20Jun2019,18
4,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and ""old""-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just ""too"" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

I just had started college with in this year, it was really challenging and not going the way I wanted. I failed some courses at the fact of dealing with Depression. I had done everything with in my power, such as applying for the disability form and communicating with my teachers about it. I lost interest in many things, along those my will to live, This is making things harder for me to move forward. My mind is blurry and I cant really concentrate on what I want major in.

Currently, I'm working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Community/subreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself (though I experienced it second-hand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back). So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression.

**I have 2 questions**

1. What would be the single most important thing the 'public' gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it don't get?
2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video (anonymously without username if desired) I would be honored.

This is an amazing subreddit and I appreciate all your comments and feedback. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

All the best to all of you!

12,"Me and my friends have been through thick and thin. There are 6 of us (myself included out of a group of 12 or so) who are really close.  Or so I thought.

I met these guys at a new school when I was 17. I'm 24 now and the past 7 years have been great up until this point. The 1st 2 years after our initial meeting were really great, we were doing all sorts of crazy fun things: movies, video games, skateboarding, partying etc. 

 The years following were not nearly as eventful but that's because most of us were back in school studying or working for the most part. But we still stayed in contact and saw each other on a regular basis.

About 3 months ago 2 of these friends (they are brothers) were kicked out of their house and I offered them a place to stay at my digs for roughly 2 weeks so they could try and find an apartment or something of the sort.  Between the 3 of us we talked about moving in together as well (currently I am living with my cousin but we're planning on doing other things and I don't want to leave until our lease is up) and agreed it was a good idea. 

 They ended up finding a pretty good place that fit 4 people at max. I help them move in and told them I would probably be moving in with them in about a month or so. What ended up happening instead was 2 of my other friends in our little circle moved in in stead. Initially this upset me quite a bit but after discussing it with them I realized that they needed it more than I did. No biggy.

 However as time went by I began to notice that they contacted me less and less and whenever I happened to get ahold of them they usually told me that they were too busy or tired to hang out I believe this is bullship though because whenever I checked social media (Facebook, Instagram, snapchat etc.) I saw that they were partying or just chilling with the rest of our group and what not.  Also around this time of year we plan a trip to the beach for about a week. This year they went without me.

I'm honestly not sure if I said something that upset them or did something wrong because usually if we do something like that we talk about it until it straightened out.  At this point I feel like they're avoiding me but if I'm just overreacting and over thinking all of this then I'm going to feel really stupid however it has been months and like I said earlier we do normally keep in contact on a daily basis for the most part.  I want to talk about it with them but I'm afraid of finding out that what I think is true (which would suck ass) or if I AM overreacting (I would be extremely embarrassed and feel awful for even thinking any of this) it's driving me fucking insane.

 In the meantime I have never felt more alone and discarded in my life.

I got insulted, yelled at, threatened with physical force by my older brother because of the fact i was disrespecting him by not answering accordingly to his liking. Earlier today I called you to let you know that I’m currently not happy where I’m at and we talked on the phone about shipping out sooner. About 25 minutes ago, my brother showed up from work, barged into the room i was in asking me why the dog was choking on his collar, before that i had walked him and everything was fine. I didn’t put put the shock collar the dog was choking on, on him. So after that he walked out of my room, slammed the door in my face, and left to the living room, he had asked me if i was hungry, because he brought me a bowl of food. I had asked him if he was upset and he loudly displayed that he kind of was, so therefore in my mind I thought it was best if I backoff and not eat. He then proceeds to ask me if im hungry or not. I say yeah sure kinda. So he then continues to push me around, i say im good, i want to go back into my room and let it be, but he approaches me aggresively, and tells me” answer me yes or no” “you sound like a fucking moron” because of the simple fact i had said kinda and then said no thanks. He made a big scene in front of my little sister, yelling at me because I’m in his eyes “Disrespecting him” or his authority over me. I just say its all good and back off. I couldn’t be any less aggresive because i know he would kick my ass. He then mentions the Marines and how they yell at you and how i should respond like if i were in bootcamp. I tell him in not at bootcamp yet so there is no reason for any of this. He also mentions you, saying i wanna go talk to your fucking recruiter and some other BS. I felt like he was aggresive as hell and hostile wen he mentioned you. So i said what do you need to talk to him about. I don’t know what this whole thing is about, im upset about this because i feel like i can’t speak in a respectful matter or do anything here without getting shit for it. For no reason at all.

17,"I live in one of the most beautiful ski towns in the Americas, and am in the top 1% skill-wise of people in my field of work (in the winter - a ski-related profession). Every day I wake up so deeply unhappy. I have a (semi-long-distance, 4 hours away) boyfriend who adores me, I do ok (or well, depending on volume) at my summer jobs (bartending), and I am on track to be the most successful I've ever been this upcoming northern hemisphere winter. I hate the town I live in, although it's been rated a top ski town for years. I hate the people who live here. All they care about is partying, and making money so they can continue to party. I just want to work, stay fit, enjoy nature, and progress myself as a great human. My roommates come home at 3am from the bars and stay up until 5 or 6am, being excessively loud, and not allowing me to sleep, even when I ask them to quiet down. Everyday, I wake up and can't stand the thought of having to get through another day around my roommates and this town. My financial situation is not helping the situation. I have loans that seem like they are drowning me. Another factor: when my anxiety and depression are skyrocketing, my body dysmorphia also skyrockets. I am in an unhealthy obsessive weight loss ""fix"" because of this. 

I have isolated myself from friends and roommates because of this, and at least one thing that happens every day transforms into how I could have died and avoided all of this. I have the opportunity to house-sit for my mum this summer starting in July and think I am going to take it. I am hoping that a change of scenery will help with everything, and I will not have any bills aside from my loans for a few months. I have a new lease starting where my boyfriend lives in September, so that's not worrisome at all. 

My anxiety has  been building about giving notice to my jobs. I should leave in about a month to house-sit, and I am feeling so guilty about leaving that I am avoiding giving notice. They are service industry jobs, and I know they are easily replaceable, but the feeling that I am letting somebody down has me astronomically anxious about everything, which in turn is making my depression and anxiety worse. I guess I'm just struggling and would love any supportive feedback anybody has.",20Jun2019,1
18,"Hi All, 

I am coming here as a safe space to share something I have been stewing on for far too long (years). I am now in a place that I can fully embrace complete vulnerability on moving this concept forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I would like to hear your thoughts and insightfulness on this.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the idea:** I want to create a fully interactive art gallery experience that embodies depression from my own artistic point of view. Patrons will fully immerse their selves in a exhibit that they will feel, hear, and see.  

Patrons strap weights around their ankles and wear a mask, crossing the line of their comfort zone as they enter a type of Alice through the looking glass space. They will spiral down into an interactive space of layered thoughts, vices, and numbness. Each room brings to life day to day struggles I have faced including the climb out of depression.  This exhibit will lead patrons to the end  ceremony of removing the mask and the weights to un-anchor any feelings from the space.  Afterwards, there will be a place of resources for accessing help with depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Purpose:** My hope is to create talking points. Bring more visibility to depression. Help bring people into a space that have no idea what depression is like, so they can have a better understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Where the idea came from:** In my darkest moment I built an exhibit in my head. I felt out of touch with others around me and had no idea how to explain what I was going through. I also didn't know where to get help.

I never shared this idea for years out of fear, shame, and pure vulnerability. 

&amp;#x200B;

The feelings I wanted to share were situations such as: 

People would treat me like I could just \*snap\* out of depression.  Or they assume that I \*want\* to be depressed.  It was never something I just woke up with. My slip into depression was a gradual slip over a month or two where I missed the warning signs. I would eventually find myself awakening into a space of monochrome and furious that it happened yet again. I have always had a hard time discussing my depression with others and have carried so much shame around it. 

* I just never knew how do you respond to ""how are you doing today?"" 
* What everyone wants to hear is ""I am fine"". **What I want to say is.** ""No, I am so not ok. I really have no clue what I want or need to change that. I can tell you that I am just thrilled I got out of bed today. Go me!

&amp;#x200B;

**Where I am right now on this:** Right now I am embracing the vulnerability piece. I am drawing out each room. I am chunking this into smaller pieces so I see the big picture and not be too overwhelmed. I am starting to look into the grant writing process, which I have no idea on how to do.  Wrapping my brain around the fundraising portion of this. How big of a space do I need? And how the heck do I build a 10 foot tall elephant? :) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Where will this exhibit be:** I would prefer it to start in the DC area but would be open to Portland or even Seattle. My vision is that this exhibit does come to multiple cities. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I need from you?** Ideas. Thoughts. Point me in the directions of resources. If any of this resonates with you let me know.

29,"I've had undiagnosed depression for the last several years. And it was absolute hell. It really messed up my social life and my GPA (which absolutely tanked my sophomore year). 

But, about a year ago, I got so sick of being in that situation that I decided to do something about it. It took me months to actually start doing it, but I started blogging about my experiences. *I've always had difficulty 'putting myself out there' and honestly I'm still terrified of it but oh well.*  Something has got to change. It might as well be me.

I skimmed through most of the posts on this Reddit and I'm relieved that you guys have had the same problems I do (I hope that doesn't sound bad - I mean that It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who is struggling in life). 

&amp;#x200B;

**But, from my own experiences, some things that I've started doing that help with keeping myself motivated (and thus feeling better about myself by being more productive) are:**

&amp;#x200B;

1)  **Setting Your Standards Low**: You can't expect yourself to clean your whole house in one day when you can barely get out of bed. What I suggest is to set your standards low - so low that you think that they're too easy. Then the odds of you doing it will increase dramatically since you've already decided the task is so easy.

&amp;#x200B;

2) **Do Your Most Important Tasks First:** You only have so much energy in a day - sometimes none at all. Use that precious energy to do what absolutely has to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

3) **Split Up Bigger Tasks Into Smaller Goals:** One thing that helps keep procrastination down and motivation up is breaking up bigger goals into smaller ones. Like tip #1 mentioned, you can't build Rome in a day when you can't build a house (sorry for the terrible analogy but I hope it made sense lol). In other words, take baby steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) **Don't Be Too Hard On Yourself:** You're depressed. You're not at 100%. Beating yourself up over something that went wrong or you couldn't do isn't going to help anyone, especially not you. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) **Reward Yourself And Take Breaks:** You're not a superhero - you needn't act like one. Take breaks whenever you need to. Even if you haven't done anything at all, if you need to take a break then take one. If you start doing too much and get stressed, you'll get a burnout. When you do something productive, reward yourself. Watch some Netflix or get a Starbucks coffee or something. Do something that makes your day better.

&amp;#x200B;

6) **Multitask:** This tip doesn't work for everyone, but if you're one of those people that gets bored of a task easily and zones out and don't want to do it anymore, then alternated between 2 tasks. Switch to the other task when you get bored of one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

7) **Think About Why You Don't Like Doing Something:** If you absolutely hate vacuuming - think about why. Does the noise bother you? Is it an unpleasant experience? If it's possible try and make sure you 'block' out the trigger. For example, if the vacuum's loud noise bothers you, wear headphones or earplugs. This also applies to anything in your life. If you're not happy with something in your life, then change it. You're the CEO of your life.

&amp;#x200B;

8) **Beat Your Perfectionism:** I struggled with perfectionism for a very long time and it hurt me in school. I couldn't turn in any homework unless it was absolutely perfect. Of course, as a result, I ended up not turning in homework. This lowered my grade significantly and I also didn't know the test content because I didn't do the homework. Double whammy. You need to change this mindset because a) nothing will ever be perfect and b) anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.

&amp;#x200B;

9) **Recharge and Reenergize:** You can't work all day (and you shouldn't). Make sure to get 8-10 hours of sleep. Refer to tip #5.

&amp;#x200B;

10) **Positive Outlook:** Before you roll your eyes, hear me out. If you think you're going to fail, that's what your actions will do. You cannot expect failure and be victorious. 

&amp;#x200B;

11) **Get Help:**  If you’re really struggling with your procrastination (and/or depression), then you should make an appointment with a professional (such as a licensed therapist). While your friends and your significant other may be able to help you to a level, you can’t always rely on them for advice and their time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to check it out, share it, comment, and all that stuff.)

If not, that's perfectly fine. I really hope that this post helped in some way. I started writing because it was something I enjoyed and I also want to help people who struggle from depression and anxiety (both of which I have).

I’m 30. I’ve been depressed and dealing with anxiety for a pretty long time, but I had enough going on in my 20’s that it wasn’t as obvious or debilitating as it is now. I was dating someone, my friends and I partied, I was working, I was smoking a lot of weed. But I was unhappy with the shitty jobs I was working, I was unhappy in my relationship. I wasn’t doing much of anything to set myself up for a fulfilling life. I started to feel really down on myself.

This is when I started making art. I was always a pretty creative kid. Drawing, making movies, writing, it all came pretty natural to me but I never really thought it would do me any good as an adult. But I started painting and it was a great way for me to deal with the breakup and deal with the shitty job I was working. The job didn’t seem so bad as long as I could go home and smoke weed and paint. Well, I lost that job because the company went under (it was a retail store). I got some money paid out to me from unused vacation time and I was able to collect unemployment. I was also having a little bit of success selling some of my artwork. Granted it wasn’t a lot but it was something and it was encouraging that people were buying my art and reaching out to me telling me how much they like it.

Over this period of not working, which is around 9 months now, I started smoking way more, I started making less and less art, the unemployment money stopped, and I’ve become increasingly isolated from my friends and people in general. I started having suicidal thoughts. This is something I’ve experienced in the past but it was more of a passing thought that would sort of remind me that I needed to go outside, or call my friends, or do something to perk me up. Well, lately, the thoughts dont really pass. They stick and I dwell on them even though I don’t want to kill myself.

The thing that makes all of this even harder for me to deal with is I’m living with my parents. In the same city I grew up in. I’m feeling more and more depressed each day, with increasing anxiety about my situation. I feel like i wasted a lot of time, I feel like I’ll never get out of my parents house. I’m finally starting to realize how much I’ve neglected my mental health. I feel like I’ll never get a job. I feel like I’ll never live in a new city.

I really don’t need much in life. I just want my own little apartment with a little space to work on my art. Maybe in a new city where I don’t need my car anymore. I’d even settle for a job that’s not so great, I feel like I took those shitty jobs for granted. But I feel so hopeless about my situation that I feel like I’ll never achieve those very achievable things. I just feel stuck and unable to get started and build momentum.

Sorry for being so long winded but I’m just looking for someone to maybe shed some light on my situation. Maybe one of you have been in the same spot before? How did you finally motivate yourself to get up and go? I appreciate any advice.",20Jun2019,1
31,"My best friend has been very depressed for about three months but he's really affected by it.

I myself am depressed but what is happening to him is beyond compare, I won't talk about how it affected our relationship but it's been my biggest source of sorrow and misery throughout those month. I can't help but cry at the thought of what happened to us.

However what's the most insufferable is just how bad it is with him and how I can't help at all, he does, classically, sleep all day, not eat etc, doesn't attend any kind of school, has no job but because his household is very abusive and hostile it makes it even worse. He refuses to seek professional help, can't afford it anyway.  
I live too far away to just visit him and try to get him to go out, I know however that when he was in this state before, he somehow got better after meeting a girl he had sort of a crush on, though now says that he doesn't really think that he did. 

I want to help him as much as I can, I try to encourage him to do things, call regularly and so on, although I am aware that my own mental instability makes it so much more difficult. 

Has anyone had a similar experience where someone really helped your mental health? I want to know how I can make things at least a little bit better",20Jun2019,8
32,"I don't usually do this - post what I'm feeling etc so bare with me.
I feel so lost, unworthy of anyone or anything and completely useless recently. I honestly can't pin down exactly why, but I think I'm done with with everything and don't want to continue on like this.
I just want to feel included and that I matter to someone.",20Jun2019,1
33,"So, I'm visiting a psychologist about my mental health, and whenever I leave I always feel bad. Just bad. My head hurts a lot, and I don't feel like doing anything. It's like life itself was sucked out of me. 
Is that supposed to happen? It's just feels kinda weird and both me and my mom is worried about that a lot :(",20Jun2019,5
34,"The lady who was in the room looked at my answer at the end and ask for me to elaborate on ""do you feel like you need to hurt yourself or someone else."" Told her yesterday on my drive home, I debated driving my car off in a ditch. 

She then said if I need to I can go to a hospital... What would they even do? I have servere anxiety, so I already hate being a burden on anyone...",20Jun2019,1
35,no one will miss me or even care so what’s the point of living. i’m only 14 and i’ve already lost everything. this is my only option. i’m done.,20Jun2019,1
36,"as I‘ve said in the Headline I‘ve managed to get 21 years old despite often thinking about suicide since I was probably 15. However thats only when the thoughts of suicide started. I have felt useless all my life. I got bullied in school. My parents always just said: „just a couple more years of school.“
I never had any real friends. My parents are not bad, if I wasn’t myself I bet they would be great parents, but they always try to „help“ and they have this „just pull through it“ mentality. And they made everything worse with that. I am at the point where I think that my parents are just viewing me as a failed useless person. And they try to „fix“ me by saying how much they are hurt that they have to see me just lying in bed all day. As cliché as it sounds I have nothing to live for. I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
I am in therapy but I don‘t think that it works. The only reason why I am still alive is because of Youtube and Onlinegames. I just have no one to talk to. And therapy doesn‘t work as it schould because I had psychology in School and I always know what the Therapist is trying to do. I am at the Ponit where I question myself why I should even bother to continue living. Im probably going to die alone, so why not just end it now. And I know people always tell you: „Just go out and find friends, go out and find a Girlfriend, just show interest in something, somewhere someone likes you.“ It doesn‘t help I have no motivation to do anything. I don‘t know what to do anymore. That aside IF I manage to talk to someone I always get labled as „weirdo“ and then this person doesn‘t want to have anything to do with me. On the Dating side of things (if there even is one, since I have given up a long time ago) I always get shot down. I guess I‘m just ugly or my personality is shit. Propably both.
And worst of all If I manage to talk about this I get told: „you aren‘t depressed, you don‘t look like your depressed“. I have like a „happy mask“ that I wear to get through the day at work or school. A way to distract myself. But as soon as I have a quiet minute or a confrontation the mask drops and I get these dark thoughts again. So my question is why should I not end it? I have nothing to live for.",20Jun2019,2
37,"Hi. I’ve been depressed for about 19 of my 22 years. In the last decade, most of my free time has been spent trying to overcome the illness. For the most part, I’ve consistently gotten exercise, sunshine, healthy food, good sleep hygiene, socialization, avoided excessiveness in any part of life, etc. I’ve done all the things they say you need to do to recover, yet I have not recovered. 

I have tried 11 different medications and will continue trying more. I have spent 6k on neurofeedback after getting amazing initial results which then disappeared never to return. 
The depression I have is clearly a much bigger, badder beast than one that could be conquered by lifestyle. 

People who have had a similar experience, where no amount of effort towards their lifestyle fixed their brain, but have conquered depression using medical methods, please share your stories with me! I am trying to bolster my hope meter.",20Jun2019,7
38,"So I've been taking Lexapro for about 2.5 months? Recently for the past two weeks I stopped altogether because I'll need a refill soon, and I don't want to go back to my doctor yet. My reasoning is that my doctor recommended I see 3 specialists for other medical issues. However I did not make appointments at these other doctors, due to the fact that my two current employers are not too keen on my taking time off or leaving work early. I thought since it's only for anxiety I should be ok stopping the meds, but now I've been feeling really sick. I don't hear my alarm in the morning to wake up, it could literally ring for hours and I will not hear it. If it weren't for my family waking me up I'd miss work everyday. I've also been having intense migraines and experience extreme exhaustion to the point that I go to bed as soon as I'm home not even eating dinner some nights. Now over the past few days I've been constantly light-headed and feel as if I might pass out. 

Could these be symptoms of withdrawal? I don't feel like I've taken the med long enough to get dependant on it. Any advice helps!",20Jun2019,1
39,"Hi Reddit –

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker, first time poster. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2. I found out when I was high school that Body Dysmorphia was to blame for my absolute disgust with my appearance. I’ve been stuck in a feedback loop of self-loathing and feelings of dread for as long as I can remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put it bluntly, I’m losing my will to live. I'm running out of hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once, when I was in college, I came home to find my father drunk. He’s battled depression and alcoholism his entire adult life. He asked that we promise each other that neither of us would ever take our own lives. Obviously, I agreed, and am well aware of how totally fucked up the situation was.

&amp;#x200B;

Nearly a decade later, I am anything but the person I dreamed of becoming. I go to therapy weekly, which has been invaluable. Still, I’m tired and feel as if I could collapse under the weight of my own life. I have a loving girlfriend and a loving family, and the thought of their despair has kept me from making any rash decisions. Still, I’m often consumed by the thought of ceasing to exist. No more weekly meetings at the office about volume and quotas. No more debt. No more news of mass shootings or migrant children in cages.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always heard it gets better, so I’m hanging on. Not just for me, but for those I love.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure exactly what compelled me to share this. Maybe this is a cry for help. Maybe I need good vibes. Anyway, thank you for reading, and I wish you all well.",20Jun2019,1
40,"I have been extremely depressed lately! My step dad passed away in April and my mom, who is an alcoholic, hasn’t been taking it well... so I never had a chance to really grieve because I was taking care of her, being strong for her. 

So the past week it’s starting to hit me. I feel super heavy and stiff. I don’t want to get out of bed (but I have to because I have to take care of my children). I haven’t even wanted my husband to touch me, no even the slightest touch and I get super upset. I don’t mean to take it out on him but I do know that it’s my anxiety and depression talking. I’m also having a hard time getting myself to eat. 

I’m trying not to let it take over my life but this is extremely hard. I’ve always been able to over come it without meds but this time I’m unsure.",20Jun2019,1
41,"I remember like it was yesterday the first time I was put on meds almost 2 decades ago back when I was in high school. I was hopping from medication to medication. not sure if any of them were working but I do know that a lot of them were causing me side effects from left to right. if I didn't gain a massive amount of weight I would feel like a zombie all the way till still feeling sleep deprived even after sleeping 10-12 hours in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I started feeling a deep contempt for medications. of course me being a conspiracy theorist has not helped me  out. for quite a while I've heard/seen stuff such as...

&amp;#x200B;

\- Meds containing lots of toxins and other man-made chemicals that the human body cant metabolize

&amp;#x200B;

\- Them not treating your medical disorders but rather they suppress your symptoms

&amp;#x200B;

\- They correcting a few of your symptoms but creating others in the long run

&amp;#x200B;

\- Them turning people into psychos and murders (word in the street is that the Columbine High School shooters being a prime example)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Them causing extreme dependency and serious withdrawal symptoms 

&amp;#x200B;

all this has let me to not want to take a recent prescription that my psychiatrist prescribed me, the drug's name is Duloxetine. Though according to the research I've done this medication is so far harmless but still, my ego will not let me take it. on the other hand, I feel like it might help me get out of this temporary hellhole I'm in that I'm having a tough time crawling out of and I'm pretty sure my depression is the common denominator on this department.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I think my situation is a double razor blade. If I take my meds I might have to face a battle against side effects but maybe they will give me enough will to get out of this hellhole. Of course, if I don't take them then I'll never find out and probably be the shackled loser I am now for a long time. till then which road should I choose?",20Jun2019,1
42,"Hey everyone,

I know the internet can be an unpredictable place, I know I've done some light trolling in the past, especially with my quirky and sarcastic sense of humor but I've been going through a ton in these past years.  I suffer from bi-polar depression which causes me to go to into uncontrollable mood swings, paranoid personality disorder, ADHD, Impulse Control Disorder and Insomnia.  I am going to make that decision to better myself each and every way imaginable, getting rid of habits that only bring harm to well-being.  It's going to take a lot of commitment in order for me to transitioned into the person I want to be,  I am still going to fall every now and then, but with that, I am going to learn from my consequences and hold them to my heart as life lessons.  If you want a backdrop of my story,  I'll give you a snippet'', I was neglected by my father when I was a baby, and suffered from a disability,  I felt like such an odd ball,  I would classify myself as a weird kid, I wasn't a psychopath/sociopath, but also thought it would be possible that I was on the autistic spectrum.  I have a big interest in sports, music, films, and I am a Christian.  I want to get help before anything drastic happens, I know from experience, that people are suicidal, whatever degree it is, are usually at a moment of hopelessness and lack of completeness.  We don't always show our pain, because we don't want it too reflect it on other human beings and create a negative impact that is pressed upon them.  I know, I shouldn't be ranting and should be thankful of what I have, and I consider myself blessed and fortunate, but depression can happen to anyone, regardless of wealth, appearance, and status.

&amp;#x200B;

So I would appreciate any helpful tips and exercises that can guide me into the right direction.  Thank you all for your understanding and I hope to hear from you all soon.",20Jun2019,1
43,I listen to this video when I feel bad. Might not be for everyone but if it helps one person I'll take it. Cause even in the rain and in the dark cloudy days you can stay strong because you'll never be a lone wolf forever. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dXUkml2r0nU,20Jun2019,0
