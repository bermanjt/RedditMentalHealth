0,"I've always struggled with mental illness, but lately it has gotten worse. Up until 10th grade all my friends used me and I felt there's no good in this world. Maybe there was something deeply wrong with me and I didn't deserve friends. I completely gave up and spent 2 years locked up in my room. After all this time I was ready to start anew, finished high-school, got a boyfriend, and currently in university. He is the best thing in the world and always wants the best for me. Despite all that, the stress of going from 2 years of stallnes to the fast pace of this world had really taken a toll on me and I got really negative and frustrated and feel like i can't keep going anymore. I need 2 more years in my room. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want him to be miserable but it's just my annoying complaining and negative attitude towards everything , I just want him to be happy. I'm scared to visit a psychiatrist, in spite of my therapist highly encouraging it. Thanks for reading. Any opinion or advice would be great. Should i just give up? ",25Jan2019,1
1,"Okay.. so I'm suffering from depression and anxiety. Lately I've been plagued by sudden realizations that everyone I know and love, or ever will know and love, will die. And there's nothing I can do about it.

I feel so crippled when these thoughts take over, and all I can think about is how afraid I am that the people I love will disappear forever.

You could probably call it an existential crisis or something, since these last couple of years people have died around me. This has made me hyper aware that anyone can die at any time. I've been especially haunted by the fact that my father will die one day, and since I've not spoken to my s.c. mother in 5 years, he's the only parent I got. I love him so much and I'm not sure I could make it without him, I'm an adult but I need someone more adult than me. And the thought of that him or anyone else I love will die and simply fade into nothingness... It's just... No.

These thoughts and feelings are so invasive, that when I feel them I break down and become unable to function.

My question is basically;
Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these emotions and thoughts? I've yet to find a way to cope with these thoughts and would really appreciate some help on the matter.

Stay safe peeps.",25Jan2019,1
2,"I have been Vlogging for 25 days now after preparing to end my life on NYE - 31 Dec, 2019.

  
Today I was blogging about a topic, that has caused me a lot of grief in the past.  


# Shall I share something deeply humiliating? (grateful for discretion)

  
A foundation principle for Gratitude Bridge is for me to honest and authentic, about the daily ups and downs of my depression, and how I am using gratitude as a means to counter the endless spirals into suicidal despair.

&amp;#x200B;

Two separate, but humiliating challenges are in my life this week, and one happened yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell you about yesterday's experience, but I won't.

&amp;#x200B;

What are you grateful for?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm grateful for the gift of discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two considerable challenges going on in my life right now, and they both contribute to daily hopelessness, and that leads to suicidal ideation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this might sound a little hypocritical not to disclose these issues on Gratitude Bridge, but the primary purpose of this pilgrimage is not to be brutally honest about my anxiety and my depression, but as a vehicle in which I might heal and get life back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was to disclose right at this moment, the two challenges going on in my life, it could affect me quite negatively in the coming weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I think people with depression and anxiety often share thoughts with people without a good sense of containment; I guess they often lack appropriate boundaries when sharing their internal state.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, I certainly do at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I find the situation that happened yesterday a little embarrassing, but mostly it is humbling.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I will share it in the next couple of weeks, but for now, it's best to be prudent.

&amp;#x200B;

today, I am grateful for discretion and prudence.

4,"I am putting aside every homework I have to write this. And just before you think anything else while reading this, I HAVE NEVER AND HOPEFULLY NEVER WILL THINK ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE, I FEAR DEATH. I also don't pretend anyone to completely read this, I just want to get this weight off somewhere and that this remains as a testimony for anyone who can identify with it and if you do read it you have my gratitude, it's not much but it's the most I can give right now.

I am a 20 year old male currently in University studying what I like. Physically, I consider myself to be average, but sometimes I hate what I see in the mirror and sometimes I like what I see in it. Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my home's mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I don't feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I don't like what I see.

I don't know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me (I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction). I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks there's something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person (who isn't from my family) who I talked with was last September and I still can't consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends. I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become.

I have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of self-improvement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. 

I was in a very decent social circle when I was in school  (I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain), I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call ""good connections"" and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 17-18 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I can't return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. 

My mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you don't like (although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, it's just there isn't anybody I can do that with) and even if I didn't like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP??? I feel like I don't have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am. I want to start giving a fuck but I can't. I fear sharing my musical and literary tastes even to my parents and my brothers.

My parents are constantly pressing me to create ""contacts"" that will help me in the future and I feel bad for not doing this because it's like I am missing half of the university experience. 

I have reached the point where I prefer Mondays over Fridays and Saturdays because I don't have the pressure from anyone to hang out with someone, in fact I now dread Fridays and Saturdays. 

I feel that if I continue in this state I will get ill (like as in an actual disease), I am the living proof that humans NEED social interactions and are a SOCIAL species, I am getting desperate, I want someone with whom I can share my musical tastes, my fascination for books, football (soccer), history, to have deep conversations, someone who has my trust just as once my old friends had mine and I had theirs, someone to go on adventures AND TO LIVE LIFE.

I am now so embarrassed of myself that I CAN'T LOOK AT MY DAD INTO HIS EYES, my dad is a very compassionate and good person, but I can't look at him to his eyes when we talk, I simply can't. I have problems showing affection even to my parents (who I deeply love but I can't externalize that feeling) and I don't want to be like this, I want to have the courage to say ""I love you"" directly from my mouth and to be able to feel it truly, I want to have the courage to hug someone without getting uncomfortable, to say nice things when I feel them, to stop being a pessimist piece of shit and finally be happy at least for one entire day.  

I perfectly know my my mom and dad and I know they think to themselves: ""When will this guy bring a girl or organize a party""? I know they think this and I am sorry I don't have the bravery to speak to them about my problems. My brothers are also very nice to me but they also have their shit together and I know they also ask to themselves ""Why is he like this""? 

I want the power to love, I am a Roman Catholic and every night and morning I pray, read the Bible and ask to God to give me the power to be happy and give me the gift of love and hope, to remove my extreme anxiety, I want to receive true love but I also want to give true love, I have been assisting to some masses in the Church near my university and I have cried when the priest meditates some passages I can identify with or gives us the command to offer each other the sign of peace because it's the only thing that I feel that loves me. 

The only thing that keeps me going is that I know I am in my most critical moment and when things start to get better or I am at my peak in life I want to be able to look back to these moments and say ""wow, that was really my lowest point"" to never repeat it again.

Thank you, dear stranger, if you took part of your busy day to read this and I will be attentive to any advice you can give to me.

6,"So I’ve had depression for like 4/5 years so like I’m kind of okay with dealing with it. And I know it gets better and worse with time but wow this time around it’s bad. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried counselling before and it wasn’t for me. Like nothing inherently bad has happened to me, so there wasn’t anything I could pinpoint as the cause of being this sad &amp; work on to fix the depression, it’s just part of me I guess? And I’ve had meds before too, but those literally killed all emotions down - yikes. Right now I just feel like a shell of a person and keep thinking about how no one cares about me as much as I care about them. But also I don’t feel like talking to anyone or making an effort. Then I end up thinking oh if I end it all that would be nice but like I’m not going to do anything because don’t want my family &amp; friends to be sad because of me (I know my brain makes me think no one cares but like they do). Also lastly does anyone ever feel like your depression isn’t even real and you’re pretending? Wow sorry for this post but just going a bit crazy with all this right now and thank you in advance ",25Jan2019,1
7,"Suicide is a common thought of mine and it’s been eating at me more recently. I’m in a happy relationship, I’ve finally started T’s 4 months ago and I’ve got my life planned out with my girlfriend but even if I feel happy and I know all is good my brain thinks it’s not enough and tells me I should just kill myself and that no one would miss me and as the days pass I feel like it’s true. I’m not a very interesting person and every time I try to make friends they just disappear or aren’t interested. I’m in need of a friend who’s willing to listen to me and spend time with me. None of my friends do that and although my girl does, she deserves to have fun with her friends as well.  

I don’t want to kill myself, I don’t want to think about it anymore. Therapy just isn’t enough anymore. I want/need friends and I don’t know how to make or keep them.  Please, does anyone have any advice or is anyone willing to give me a shot? ",25Jan2019,1
8,"When my best friend (F/18) and I (F/18) started hanging out, I saw her as the new badass kid at school. I knew she came from a bad home. I knew she’d dealt with some tough situations. But that wasn’t exactly something we talked about. So when she called me today sobbing, I was a bit surprised to find out she might have cancer, she has known it was a possibility since she was 13, and she might not want to do treatments.

I have had a pretty rough draw when it comes to the mental health department and she’s one of my rocks. Whenever I am sitting alone in my bed in the middle of the night wondering why I should still be here, I try to remind myself I can’t let down my best friend or my service dog. They need me. I’m always there for everyone whenever they need me. She had to have an emergency surgery for something completely unrelated a few months back and I was by her side every step of the way. I’d sleep at the hospital and run home in the morning to change before heading to school. Then straight back to the hospital. I kept going until she was good enough to go home and then I visited daily until she was better. But what if there’s nothing I can do this time. What if she chooses to not help herself. What if she chooses not to fight. I don’t know what I’d do if I lost her.

If anyone has any thoughts on the situation, I’m just trying to gain some perspective. I don’t even know how to react to the situation.",25Jan2019,1
9,"For background: The past several months I have been unemployed and actively seeking a new job, but I've had no luck since job prospects are bleak this time of year. I've recently started dipping into my savings to get by so needless to say I have been under a lot of stress (and bored out of my mind on top of it). I have been seeing a therapist for a previous depressive episode and was doing ok for a while, but since my unemployment the symptoms have been creeping back in and hitting me hard since the holidays. 

I have a very hard time opening up or asking for help in general (even with my therapist), but the one person who I will turn to is my boyfriend of 1 year. He is very loving and has some mental health struggles of his own so I know he isn't one to judge. However, as my frustrations about unemployment mount, I am feeling increasingly needy and constantly fighting the urge to seek validation from my boyfriend. I am extremely paranoid that he is getting bored of me since I am always hanging out at the local coffee shop every day to meet him there on his lunch break. He says he loves seeing me every day, yet he always seems to want to talk to other people when he is with me, and somehow I feel like I never get to spend time with him despite seeing him all the time. Our routine just feels very stale and although I know he cares about me I wonder if he feels more obligation than desire to be with me.

Anyway, we had a minor fight the other day which kicked my paranoia into overdrive. He voiced some annoyances he has with me which lead to me convincing myself that I'm a terrible girlfriend. He claims that I have been nitpicking and telling him how to act, which I didn't even realize. Sometimes I act on my fears and anxiety without thinking and I don't want to put my boyfriend through that, I feel absolutely awful and like he must hate me. 

The mental strain I feel lately is immense, and now I am so worried about burdening my boyfriend that I am taking myself into breaking up with him. Maybe I shouldn't even be in a relationship if I can't get my shit together. Then again my boyfriend is the only real friend that I have and if we split up I will be utterly alone, and I'm afraid to think about the dark place that isolation will send me to. I just know that things feel off between us lately, I can't tell if it's real or all in my head, but my instinct is to quarantine myself in case I am toxic. Honestly I can't think clearly. Am I just thinking this way because of the depression or would this be the right thing to do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I feel like I am burdening my boyfriend with my depression and wondering whether I should end our relationship because of it. ",25Jan2019,1
10,"To start things off I'm not suicidal, so don't worry about that. But I'm so tired of fighting my depression. Even though I've had worse depression episodes in my life, this is the longest bout of clinical depression that I've ever had. And I know that has to do with the fact that I avoided seeking help for quite a while. I became depressed at the end of May last year. I told myself that I would talk to my psychiatrist about changing meds and that I would find a therapist. But I put that off until November for reasons that I honestly can't explain. But for many months I fought tooth and nail against my depression. And now my depression is being to get better but I'm still mentally exhausted. I fought so hard for so long and even though my depression is getting better I just don't feel like I have the energy to fight it like I used to. I've made a lot of progress... It's nice to not absolutely hate myself and want to die all the time. But therapy has also brought up a lot of issues that I wasn't aware of and I realize that I'm going to put in a lot of work to get over them. I'm on the mend but it's going to take a lot of work to be healthy again. But I feel like I've used up all my energy to get where I am now. I'm just so fucking tired and I wish I could just take a month long nap. I know that I'll some way find the energy to keep fighting because that's the only way I'll survive, but I'm just so tired.",25Jan2019,1
11,"So I know it might seem cliché, and I’m not going to stop taking my meds, but I forgot to take my nightly dose last night which then I would usually just take in the morning when I woke up.

Is this what happens when you take a dose late or miss one? I’m on 75 mg of the knock off brand of Effexor...",25Jan2019,1
12,"Currently dealing with relationship stress and work stress. I feel like I never have a moment of peace. I don’t know what to do, I feel awful. I feel so anxious all day and it’s at the point where my body just feels so tired and I hurt all over. I feel so empty inside. I don’t know what to do to feel better. I feel like giving up",25Jan2019,1
13,"I've suffered from some form of anxiety/depression since middle school. No amount of medication, therapy, exercise, or meditation has helped. I've been lucky enough to have people who cared about me enough to be a support system. People that I could go talk to about my feelings of helplessness and get reassurance that I can get through it. Until lately.

Lately I've been feeling like a burden to everyone and that all I do is drag down those I care about. I've had that confirmed by someone I considered my best friend. I've been in a months long depressive episode and was texting my best friend yet again to look for support. He hasn't been there much lately and wasn't replying so I went on an ""I feel like a burden, do you even still care, I was there for you!"" rant. I didn't receive a reply and went on an ""well man, I can see how it is."" rant.

Later that night I got the reply:

""I didn't owe you a response to yesterday's rant. You made it pretty clear that I'm a toxic person in your life so we'll just go our own ways. I don't have time for this and I don't need to feel like I'm walking on eggshells around someone to avoid hurting their feelings at this age. (I'm 30) We're just on a different wavelength these days and that's okay. We'll move on. See you around""

This bodied me. My best friend of 9 years is tired of my whining and neediness. Worst part about it is that I don't blame him. He's got a busy job and is trying to manage a long distance relationship. He has his own issues to worry about. 

Right now though, hearing something like that was really dangerous for me. I've been begging my wife to leave me with our 2 kids so they don't have to go through my cycles for the rest of their life. I've been thinking about how everyone would be better off without me. I sent my friend an email apologizing for being so pathetic and being so needy, explaining my depression, and told him that I plan on going no contact. I don't know how he's going to reply and at this time I can't risk hearing more negative things from my best friend so I hope he understands that I'm going no contact. Then I blocked his numbers and all social media.

I look at it this way. I don't want to know how he reacts/recovers from the apology. If he replied with more of ""get out of your feelings"" types of message, that would sink me into a further depression. I know I'm pathetic. I don't need that confirmed anymore. I can't help it and those without depression don't understand that. If he replied with ""I'm sorry man, I didn't realize and I didn't mean it"" then he'd just welcome me back into his life and I'd continue to be a burden to him. I think it's just best that I explained myself, wished him luck in his life, and followed through with no contact. It's clear he's tired of being my support and I don't trust myself to go back and not fallback to my default. Not only that, but he's right about being on different wavelengths. I'm married with 2 kids and he lives by himself. He's got ""cool"" friends and does ""cool"" things and values his work over his personal life. I stopped caring about ""cool"" a long time ago and I value my personal life over work.

I've been actively trying to fix my depression. Always following up and trying new medications. Nothing has worked. I just don't know if this will ever end and I feel sorry for anyone who loves me stubbornly enough to stick with me. Hearing from my friend that I am a burden sent me over an edge. I was having constant thoughts of suicide and thanks to the stubbornness of my wife, I'm checking myself in to get evaluated and will go from there. I'm still fighting. Maybe one day something will work and I won't constantly be in pain.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just looking for support from anyone who's been through this type of situation especially those who have ""fixed"" the issue of oversharing and driving those close to you away because of your depression. Any ideas besides checking myself in to be evaluated and following up with my doctor to switch medications would be appreciated. Thanks for listening.

17,"I really haven't felt anything but alone for the vast majority of several years. I still live at home and my family constantly nitpicks me and talks about me in other rooms (as if I can't hear them). My sister is also a jerk and hurts me a lot, but if I dare try and call her out like she deserves for doing this and not apologizing, suddenly I'm the bad guy and everyone criticizes me, even going so far as to call me too sensitive for being hurt in the first place. My sister is even so bad that when I've told her I felt like I was on the titanic, in the desperate hopes that she would stop being such a jerk and maybe help for once, she had the gall to call me out for supposedly being offensive to those that died on the titanic, and did not change her behavior in the slightest

MY ""friends"", and I use that term VERY loosely, are little better, that vast majority of them make ZERO effort, some to such an extent that they blatantly ignore my messages to them, and never initiate themselves. And the ones who do reply don't seem to take my situation seriously when I tell them about it, let alone actually going out of their way to help improve it like I really need, (you know, like friends frigging SHOULD do). But again, I can't say anything about that, because everyone just criticizes me when I do, as if I'M somehow responsible for THEIR failure come through and downplaying just how much this is affecting me. And any new friends I attempt to make always pull away and stop replying, and never initiate or invite me to anything, making it clear they're one sided clowns too. This has happened so often i just don't have any desire to keep trying. The only thing I didn't feel that way about in the past several years was my cat princess, and since she died last year it's just gotten worse.

I have no one to talk to, and i can't vent about it anywhere because the last time I tried to vent about my frustrations on facebook, my sister ratted on me and my parents put pressure on me to take it down, threatening me to never help unless I did so (part of why they are all blocked on there now, but no one replies on there anyways so I still never post)

19,"I'm  speaking about a quick amount of time , which is especially the case  for me. Before November of 2018 my life was amazing , I had a great  friend group at work , friends and family loved me , I was finally doing  well at university , and I thought I met the girl of my dreams. That  last point was the downfall of me , let me tell you this to I cannot  even relate to the manosphere , MGTOW , TRP , or even stupid incels.  What I have done , Oh , is unforgivable . After she didn't text me back I  felt a strong urge to place objects in my mouth. This is what it known  as OCD.Obsession Compulsion Disorder. It started with my inhaler , and  then slowly it progressed to putting my laptop charger in , towards my  mouth. Ha you think that's terrible , wait for it. Instead of getting  help , I thought I could tough it like a man.  That weekend I started  more obsessions some were as stupid but funny as mistaking a dead cable  as live and more extreme ones such as touching a kitchen  vacuum with my  hand moist. I thought that stuff devastated me , oh I wish! It sucks  when your nostalgic about your life but when the negative events become  nostalgic you have reason to beg for those negative events even though  in the moment they sucked.

The dead  cable ruined my life for a month ( I'm laughing writing this) until I  touched it all wet and in my mouth. I thought my life was complete now  and I was coming out as a stronger person because of it. You see my OCD  at least recently desires for me to desensitize myself to the areas or  objects that caused pain as a form of relief. Now I had to make sure the  cable was dead with a fork and while wet. ( Worst OCD mistake but  nostalgic)  . The next couple of weeks granted it was Christmas time and  I couldn't be more of a scrooge. I thought I finally beaten my OCD by  doing re- exposure therapy but then my parents caught me one time and  decided to remove the cable. We removed it and my anxiety sky rocketed ,  the only hope was touching the end of it that was stuck in the wall (  you see the cable man removed the tip and left the rest in the wall).  Still not the worse.

After testing the  cable each day for 2 weeks , I got over it and on Saturday of  January  19th , a day that will forever live in infamy , I tested the other  portion to that computer cable before that big adapter by placing it in  my mouth( FUCK). After I did it I felt the adrenaline coarse through my  body. I had to return to homeostasis. I was on a 19 day NOFAP streak so I  decided to break it. I did and I had the urge again so I placed the  cord in mouth for 2 seconds . But then I had something "" sticky"" on my  lower compartments. Electricity and liquids don't mixing remember  thinking , I then yelled at the top of my lungs "" WHYYYYYY""! My parents  rushed in to see what had happened . They couldn't control me I started  running and throwing things. "" FUCK MY LIFE "" I screamed. Both of them  were scared straight. My father grabbed the cord and placed it in this  mouth only to have my mother rip it from the socket. I screamed louder,  my screams of agony , growing . Was that the end of the shit show? NO. I  ended up placing another laptop cord in my mouth which I assumed had  similar electrons. I woke up and read the label . 7 AMPS. "" HOLY FUCKING  SHIT!"" I screamed. I kept doing a couple more times the compulsion even  one time with my pants a little wet from the bathroom. I have been  going insane these last couple of days.

When I was a child, I had anger issues and was prone to hurting others. My parents often told me to stop it, and I understand--I feel guilty enough for doing it--but they never saw that I was being teased, and I hate them for it.

During 9th grade, my mom and I got in an argument about my bad grades.

My mom asked me, ""What is wrong with you?""

I told her that I can't take it anymore. That I can't do it.

Except she only replied, ""That's all you've got to say?""

That's when I truly felt disappointed with my parents. They will never understand me. Ever.

From then on, it was a downward spiral, but then, it has always been a downward spiral.

I am now 18, and have nice friends and decent grades, but all of it is nothing. What's the point of having dwcent grades if I can't do good enough in any work I'll do?

Whenever I read a story about someone with depression and beating it, I don't believe it. How could they do that?

I've played Celeste. Watched Your Lie in April. Read the Wheel of Time. I came away from them stumped, as if I

My negative self-talk is so deeply ingrained in my mind that anything that contradicts it sounds like a hollow lie.

Why would I rather take my self-talk for truth? Because it has proven itself time and time again. That I couldn't do shit about myself. That nothing went better, nor will anything ever.

Now, I look at depression articles, and they all feel like horsecrap, for none of them could ever convince me that I can get better.",25Jan2019,1

24,"ok so, long story short;  through out my years of having depression,  the only thing that has helped is someone to hold me, to lean on, and to be there for me while i break down.  its been rare, only really happening twice in my life so far; and both times life happened to remove them from my life. 
like i know most ppl claim its not healthy to find/ use other people as medicine, but ive tried so many things,   drinking, weed, heroin,  4 SSRI, an sari, brabs, benzos, alpha and beta blockers, downing in work, in school, meditation, working out, hell i even joined the marines thinking that something there could at least distract me, but nothing has helped, infact most of those drugs harmed me deeply,  that warning about suicidal thoughts given with antidepressants isnt a joke.   
well i sit here more alone then i have ever been in my life, only craving someone to lean on; someone broken like me who wont doctor or mother me, but sit with me in this eve, contemplating our place in the universe.  ",25Jan2019,1

26,"As in the title. 

I'm looking for some of the self help books for depression that teach cognitive behavioral therapy or other strategies. 

My friend has struggled for years and doesn't feel comfortable taking to a stranger or believe that it will help, so they aren't willing to give it a shot. However they are willing to read. I saw a smattering of choices on Amazon, but want the best. 

Any recommendations?",25Jan2019,1

We’re both really unhappy and our relationship is in some serious turmoil, yet we both love each other a ton. I’ve offered to help pay for therapy which she declined. How much is a therapist? How do you go about getting a therapist? Is there a way to get therapy for cheap? How do you convince the one you love that she needs help? I have no idea what to do here. ",25Jan2019,1

Little back story. After my parents got divorced, me, as an 8 yo boy served as a terapist to my mother. I faced a lot of emotional abuse - there were things which existed but I wasn't allowed to talk about it, actually denial was a way to go, as my mother wanted. There is a thing which is connected with this post - sex. Mother acted like sex didn't exist, and if it exist, it's a very wrong evil thing and non of 8 yo boy business.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I had a dream, which reconnected me with an old-forgotten memory - I was 8 or 9 at that time, woke up in the morning, went to living room, surprised my mother was still sleeping. I knocked on door to her bedroom, nobody responded, I got scared she did something to herself, cause she made a suicide threats whenever I acted like an ""unloving son"". To my surprise, she was still sleeping in bed, naked, with two much older, naked men, also sleeping. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable, but really extremely. Later, when I asked her what that was, she just told me they were good friends and they lived like 5km&lt;!&gt; out of town, so she let them sleep over. I thought, why didn't she let them use the couch, which was very large for even two adult men to have comfortable sleep. But I accepted her explanation and moved on.

Now I'm 32, I don't talk to my mother for like 13 years for many reasons. As above, I had a dream last night which relived this memory, in a second I realized my mother was having sex with them. I feel like our home was very desecrated on that night. I puked three times today already. I am shaking in anxiety. I took some rivotril,  but doesn't help. I cannot stop thinking about my mother &lt;who I sincerely loved at that time to the point I would give her both of my kidneys&gt;, sucking two penises while me and my little sister sleeping in another room. I only resented my mother one day ago, now I completely hate her and all the good memories about her are only bitter - to the point I finally don't regret the possibilty I will never see her again in my life. Many times, she pointed her dirty finger on me and my sister, accusing us that we were the reasons she wasn't able to find a man to live with her, while in reality, no decent man wanted a slut who sucks two dicks with her children in another room. All I can see now is my mother face covered by two men. I hate her so much, I actually went to puke one more time during writing this rant.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so full of hatred right now, I cut my leg few times with my spyderco just to relieve the stress and anxiety. I am sorry if my text doesn't make sense in some way, I'm shaking terribly possibly I came here just to rant, and I am sorry for that. I will visit my therapist on wednesday, she's out of town now.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is one thing for sure, which is good. I never wanted my own children, cause I was scared that would have similar childhood like me, after I would be dead by accident or something. But still, there was ""what if, maybe in few year I will think different""... From now on, I am completely sure I am never having children.

But what I would like to know, does anyone of you also experienced the same phenomena, normal dream triggering an forgotten memories?

30,"I am 34 and never had thoughts about killing myself before. I still don't have a plan to kill myself, but all of a sudden these weird thoughts pop into my head out of nowhere. Like, I was in the bath and starting thinking about putting the blowdryer in the tub with me.  Or I live in fucking miserable Wisconsin and when I was driving, I realized how easy it would be to drive off the side of the road. 

I am not on any meds, or receiving therapy - pretty inexperienced with depression (thank God).  Do these weird thoughts warrant a call to the doctor?  ",25Jan2019,1
