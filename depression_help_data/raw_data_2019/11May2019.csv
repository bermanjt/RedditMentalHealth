1,"One year and a half ago I broke up with the girl I used to live with (I'm a lady too) and since then I could never get my life back on track again. It was my happiest and most stable period. She was/is the love of my life. I was living like my dream life, or at least I used to think so. Things were amazing at my job, money was not a problem at all, my girlfriend was everything I'd always asked for. She moved to Australia and three months later I was supposed to join her but she cheated me halfway. It was all very complicated cause her new girlfriend would make things up and blame me. The girl was also married and her ex-husband used to do mean things and she used to blame me to make sure I would never get close to my ex again.

&amp;#x200B;

When she cheated, my whole world fell apart because I gave everything I had to build what we had. I used to think: ""if I gave her everything and it wasn't enough, what's the point of it all?"" And I realized I needed to look inside and find myself again, but things just keep going wrong and wrong again. During the first six months, all I used to do was feel lonely, smoke weed and cry the whole day. My friends supported me for some time, but then they just didn't understand anymore why I was still so sad. For them and also for my mom it was just drama.

&amp;#x200B;

In March, last year, I lost my job. I wasn't really sad when it happened cause I saw there an opportunity for me to stay at home and take care of myself, focus on my projects and everything. But I take 2 steps ahead and 10 steps back. I've tried studying to be approved to work for my country's government, I've tried setting up my own business twice, I've tried working from home, but it all gets to a point where I'm stuck. I think about her all the time and sometimes it fuels me and other times it just makes me feel more stuck than I already am. When I'm not thinking about her (I try not to, but she just comes to my mind sometimes) or feeling her, I'm just so sad I can't do anything. Sometimes I can. Some days are not so bad, but most of them are. Currently I don't really have any friends cause I found out they were all jerks surrounding me to suck something (money, my greens, my time), except for one girl who's always there for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a teacher and I started developing a project of my own, and now I'm stuck and discouraged again. I'm short on money and nobody calls me for job interviews, even though I have a great curriculum and I've always been kind of ""lucky"" in my professional life. My parents are not really supportive. Speaking of money, they are, but I can't ask my mom for advice or a hug cause she's not the most emotionally available person. Some time ago I just realized I'm not important for anybody, or at least I don't feel important. I don't have any friends, I don't date because people just suck, I have no pleasure going out cause I usually have an anxiety crisis when I'm out, I don't have a job... I've tried everything I could to be happy and fulfilled again, but my time never comes and I'm so tired of waiting. This whole inside just feels deeper and bigger each day. Some time ago I didn't use to feel it, but now I do and it just hurts so much. I feel like there's nothing on my inside, just sadness. I can't stand it anymore. I came to my mom's place this week so I wouldn't be alone, but she's just so critical and talks to me all the time like everything I do is wrong. She's not like that with other people, not even with my sister, but when it comes to me she just says it's all drama and that I'm being shitty to her, even though I try very hard to please her. 

  

I just feel like ending everything. I'm not brave enough to do it yet, though. I love my dog very much (she keeps me busy and distracted most days) and I wouldn't like to cause my parents any pain. I've given myself this month to try and sort everything out, like get my life back on track, and if it doesn't happen I'm thinking of ending everything before my bday in June. I'm just so tired of trying and never getting it. I've never been so low, I've never felt so low and each day it gets harder and harder, specially when I ask for help and nobody seems to care. I don't want to do it cause I don't think it's the best way out, but again, I can't take any of this anymore.",11May2019,1
2,"I just need someone to know what I went through so I know I am here. I am alone always have been because being beaten daily (til I was 18)from my first memory by a Step-dad that first liked to hit my mom but moved on to me after I punched him in the nuts on thier wedding night as he held my mom by here neck in the kitchen. That was the first day I was knocked out by him. Countless times growing up I would be beaten in public... In front of my friends. We moved every 6 months growing up because my stepdad would burn his welcome and needed more work. And no one had time to figure out what was happening to me... With hospital visits for stiches and staples, broken arm.... I once told my mom in middle school that I was going to talk to a counselor and get us help.... 

Well she told him when he got home and he beat me soo bad and broke my tail bone and couldn't sit...so they pulled me from school for about a month... I found that they were going to put my older brother and I up for adoption... Looking back I wished that they had. My step-dad was arrested many times for abuse but I was always hidden away so I could not say a word and found out later that mother was always dropping the charges... We went into witness protection when it got really bad near high school. Its not lile the movies... We went to church houses group homes etc... He found us at one house... He drove his truck into the house only missing the room we were all in because he hit the concrete steps and the truck bounced into the living room and into the home owners garage. The home owner almost shot him but didn't. 

It still got worse... He got out of jail again and a again... We never got the call fast enough near the end before he was breaking into the house at 3 am trying to kill us or busting out all the windows of our van with his fist... Or when I was driving our family Transport Van after he cut the breaks and my mom didn't believe me that breaks were not working until I had to swerve into a ditch to miss cars stopped at a light and break fluid sprayed up both sides of the Van and when we stopped to all be crying knowing what had happened again.... Finally police were getting more aggressive since we hadnt moved in two years with just my mom trying to raise us... I was always a loner and could not relate to anyone... Always trained to be quite... Never cry... And being told I wouldn't live past 18 because he would kill me before then.. I finally one day after graduating barely and trying college full time at a community college while working 3rd shift at a grocery store to pay for gas and books. I was only home to sleep work then college and studying... 

I came downstairs and my mom was at the table and it was only us in the house... Which was very rare with that many kids... My step-dad never laid a hand on them only me... I broke down in tears and finally asked why didn't you leave him! Why did you let him hit me everyday... Why!? She sat and wept not even looking at me... I left for my 3rd shift work before a full day of classes the next day to come home to a not on my bedroom door..."" It said why are you still here""



I was 100% alone from that point on... No family support no relatives no long term friends because we moved so much growing up... So I am typing this never having a memory of my real father and found out he passed in a text while at work from my mom.... I have no photos to look back at since they were never kept... 

I have really battled with anxiety and depression for 3 years with no medical help ..no sleep.. Only putting a smile on my face because of my son who has never had a bad day since being born and is sooo smart for how little he is... I have been a stay at home dad partially because it was the only way my girlfriend at the time could afford it. Daycare was outrageous and we wanted to make sure we raised him... Well I tried to finally get help anxiety and depression and they had me on meds that one doctor gave me then swapped to a new one for night time about a month in. It was rough and I didnt feel right at all... I would get a rush of adrenaline like my sons life was in danger for even small things and had outbursts verbally at my gilrfriend that broke our relationship. I never would hurt anyone that is the last thing I want to do to anyone. Her family is as bradey bunch as you can get and it really really sends my anxiety flying. I can only related to her because of our son... He is the only reason I get up and keep going. Well my girlfriend and I are splitting up but I have nothing... No friends no family nothing and will be homeless soon. I am sooo tired of this fight tired of seeing everything in other family's that if i had only exepeinced a 100th of would have helped put me in a better place. I will be signing custody over to her and her family because they really are great people and can give him everything that he needs. There is no help for my situation no way to bounce back at least not one that I have the fight for anymore.",11May2019,3

4,"I’ve been wanting to talk about this with someone for a while, but I have quite literally no one to talk to. I’m don’t make enough money to go to therapy sessions so this is the next best thing I guess. To start out, I have been rather tall and thin my entire life, it was never a problem, until high school started. As a girl it’s even harder to have the type of body I have. I’m 5’8 and 112 lbs.. Anyways, the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad moved my family to an extremely rural area on the other side of the county, so naturally I had to start at a new high school where I knew absolutely no one. The school I started was full of racist rednecks and I had never been exposed to those type of people. This is pretty funny (and I can’t wait until the day where I’m not so depressed about it that I can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that “she heard the new girl bleaches her asshole” lmao I know completely random. Well I have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if I did I would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and I said yes. So for the rest of the year I was called “butthole bleacher” and I haven’t shared this info with anyone bc I’m so embarrassed. This group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how I was shaped like a boy. I went home everyday crying because I had no idea people I didn’t even know could be so cruel. This one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. He was not joking at all which made it worse. I had no friends (still don’t), was told how ugly I was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it’s ok to laugh at it, I know it’s funny for people who aren’t me) I remember one day in particular I was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes “there’s the flatass who fucks everyone” . I was shocked and went into class crying. I was confused, I have still never even kissed anyone so I couldn’t understand where people were getting this information from. You may be thinking I’m over exaggerating but I’m not kidding when I say that everyday I was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. The day I hit rock bottom was in dance class. I had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. I had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. I waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as I began to approach them said “no, no, no we don’t want you” and the ENTIRE gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. He noticed I was sad and told me I should probably just kill myself. Everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as I could up a tree in my yard. I was crying and playing my favorite song “American Pie”. Then I saw my dad pull into the drive way, and I couldn’t do it. Then, things began to turn around. I was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, I’ve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. I love physics so I decided to major in engineering, But, i got a D in calculus II last semester so I was kicked out of the program and since  I had all my credits for high school, I just began working full time at my job. I still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. I’m so lonely and feel so ugly. Although now I’ve accepted the fact that I’m just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. Anyways, I found out I actually had enough credit hours to get my AA before even graduating high school, so I got that last week. I’m just so depressed and I literally have no friends. Like I’m not exaggerating at all. None. I feel so lonely and embarrassed. Next week is high school graduation and today I had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. As soon as I walked in all of the horrible memories came back and I got the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had. I pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. And then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so I looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. Then, the group forced a gap in line right where I was standing and said loudly “excuse me”, while the rest of the group laughed. I felt so humiliated. I have to actually walk with these assholes next Saturday and I’ve never wanted to not do anything more. I just want some friends that I can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned I have absolutely none. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. I got into University of Florida so I’ll be starting in the fall. I’m pretty excited for a fresh start even though it’s just an hour a way from where I live. But to be honest, I’m so sad right now and I’m back in a rut. I can’t eat, my mom has  to force me to shower or even brush my teeth. I don’t know what to do anymore. Thanks if you got this far. Advise to keep going?",11May2019,42
5,I fit the diagnostic criteria for depression (although the lines blur between my eating disorder and depression). I am seeing therapist for eating behaviors and husband knows I’m depressed or at least struggling. He doesn’t seem to care that I am really going through a hard time and I don’t know how to get help I need. I am a sahm with almost zero social support. My husband is gone 5/7 days every week. I am alone most of the time. I have been hospitalized before for suicidal behavior and attempts and I do not want to be hospitalized again. But I’m struggling. Bad. How do I get help without getting everything taken away again like it’s a crime to be sick?,11May2019,1
6,"With in the past few days, I feel like my life has fallen apart. I don’t want to go into the details but it’s gotten bad. My boyfriend was amazing on the first day but since it’s been more than one day, he’s gotten “fed up” with it. I was talking about finally ending it and he told me to go do a flip as I did it, to remember to go down the street and not across the road. I am feeling so lost and lonely. I don’t want to exist anymore. My one rock in this storm basically told me to fuck off. I’m sorry about the format and the fact that this is more of a rant but I’m at rock bottom.",11May2019,5
7,"Earlier today I went to the alumni concert for my highschool against my best wishes but my old section had no alumni so I decided I would go, and also all of my old friends. It really truly brought out some ounce of life in me. I want to make the right steps, but I don't wanna scare myself off either. Often times whenever I feel motivated I push myself significantly too far or expect too much and fall extremely short and end up in a further depression then I may have been before. I can't another one of those cycles. I think I have to start small but, I also need to have something(or perhaps someone?) to hold me accountable. The only real things I can come up with at the moment perhaps could be maybe exercising with friends every other day or so but with that understanding of like ""hey, I may not be my best everyday. I still want you to push me but just understand that some days I may fall short because I don't like myself, or maybe my cat died, or maybe 100 other things."" I don't know why I added all that hypothetical dialogue, I'm not gonna lie I'm very well baked right now so perhaps my mind is continuing to go on for too long now.",11May2019,2
8,Today has been so bad. I leave work in about an hour and I can’t stop thinking about driving off a bridge. I’ve had an hours long break down. I feel like I’m loosing my job and the only friend I could talk to is now avoiding me.,11May2019,1
9,"My dad is an alcoholic, and being Eastern Asian (Korean), he is extremely sexist and prejudiced, as ideal and immature as a child. He is fighting this very moment, he is fighting with my mother drunk, because he feels challenged as the patriarch of this family, although he is as useful as a man's nipple. My mom was simply discussing about a topic, and because she disagreed with his desicion, he accused her of challenging him, not living to his ""bonafide"" methods.

It's routine. It happens every 2, 3 weeks.",11May2019,7
10,"I was going out to eat with some people last night we actually were leaving from the same event. The restaurant was literally across the street. I don't know how much later I got there than the rest of them but they know that I had to go back into the building because I had forgotten something. I got held up a little bit longer because there wasn't much parking when I got there but that couldn't have been more than a few minutes.

I go inside the restaurant and they had ordered everything. Not just drinks and apps I mean all the courses. I didn't think they had been waiting that long but nobody texted me to say hey are you almost here. Nobody said anything about sorry we got really hungry they all just said hi kind of awkwardly when I got there. 

Lots of weird moments where when my food came there wasn't any chopsticks to the person next to me said oh sorry I guess I took yours.

I guess I'm venting and also wondering if it's weird that this hurt my feelings I had an awfully bad day yesterday.",11May2019,3
11,"That feeling that everything anyone does is just escapism, That the only thing we live for is distraction form the thought we will all die. Makeing anything you can do in life ultimately pointless since it will just end anyway. I cant think of any reason to be here friends family they do not matter they will just die too someday. Job? Why because I want ... Things? It is better to have ""things"" food,shelter, and entertainment make existance more tolerable but why bother it is just more distraction and struggleing against the fact that no one matters we only prolong our lives through material goods because starvation and exposure is a pain full way to go, Love? no seaking validation in someone eles seems disgusting like you have to have someone next to you at all times telling you how wonderful you are but thats still just more distraction. Helping others make the world a better place for who it who it will be void of people some day. Self gratifaction then? Drugs sex,food, alcohol maybe fun.... But it would run anyone into the ground faster than anything eles and its still just even more escapism and distraction. I can not think of any reason why anyone should be alive.

Every morning when I get woke up I think about killing myself because getting out of bed is jus so hard for me now &amp; the thought of having a productive day &amp; socialising just kills me. I have no motivation to do anything I just cba anymore. I can’t talk to anyone because no one gives a shit and I don’t want to burden my family by telling them I want to die.. if anything, people say I’m faking depression cus I’m always posting suicidal memes (on my priv Sc story) but that’s just a cry for help cus I can’t just start a conversation with someone like ‘hey Im fucked up &amp; wanna die’ So I can only really talk about it when people ask but they never do and when they do i just push them away and say I’m fine.  I go to sleep every night fantasising about how I’m gonna kill myself  but I can’t do it yet cus of my family.  This post probably makes no sense I’m just rambling.

13,"I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for 9 years now, I find that sometimes I can control it then other times I get a massive urge to self harm and leave.
How can I stop this? I feel like I'm just a big ball of negative energy that no one wants to be around, not even myself.",11May2019,3
14,"I've had childhood abuse (beaten to bruises and welts many times, threatened with knife, mother saying she wishes she could kill me several times, mother tried hard to give me things and win my attention but suddenly turned around saying I'm a thief for taking her money, father complicit...I can go on for pages) though I was completely trouble free and pretty much a straight A student into a public ivy university. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had workplace abuse. The company had financial reporting violations (they corrected errors before they went public), big and small plagiarism (including direct violation of patents and got sued for millions), and constant violations in labor laws. These all happened before I was there and many problems persisted for a long time. Due to circumstances I worked very hard and it was easily 60+ hours per week for no overtime pay. I worked at home and on weekends without anyone telling me to do it. This was not in the US so I told myself I must be humble to accept a low wage to gain experience in international marketing. By the time I quit I had 70 projects on my shoulder and I burnt out badly. CEO offered me not only to stay but also he was willing to transfer me to the US branch so I can be on US salary. I declined. This was a company with 120 million revenue per year, most of which is earned from the US market.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am married in another foreign country. It is a very long story behind why I ended up in another country again. Here I am not easily employable due to language limitations. I am working on it and working in a near minimum wage job to get by. My life went from good university, to seemingly good job, to seedy job, and now to minimum wage job. I told myself to be humble at all times and to persist in the circumstances I chose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I married my husband because of the usual reasons: we love each other, we get along, and all that. There are two more somewhat unique reasons; one is I am looking for a specific cultural upbringing that's similar to mine (half in the US, half elsewhere) and the other is that we are pretty much asexual. Society dictates that if you can't please your partner sexually the relationship is automatically a failure. Asexual partners are hard to come by. I have good reasons to stay. I wanted a prenup anyway so a prenup took care of our biggest difference - financial values. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now I determined this marriage is dishonest. I found out my husband is hiding debt and is unwilling to disclose spending nor earnings. He gave me a rough number in earnings. He admits he has never saved in his entire life despite having a high executive salary in the early 2000s. Now he has chronic medical issues and I have been covering us with emergency savings.  

&amp;#x200B;

I met my husband from the abusive company I talked about. My husband still works there. He caught his supervisor moving company money in and out of private accounts many times. Most people know what whistle blowers will experience serious repercussions. So like most people my husband tried to keep his mouth shut. This company then started creative accounting. They fudged numbers on both taxes and financial statements for investors. This is a small non-US foreign subsidiary. The HQ had not find out and the IRS never audited them yet. My husband told his supervisors that they need to correct these numbers. They retaliated by reducing his salary in half. Shortly after this incident a couple of accomplishes bailed. My husband contacted several lawyers in this non US country and they confirmed all evidence pointed towards the company's wrongdoing. But even if legal evidence are in my husband's favor, he ideally needs to get out of the company first before he can sue and start reporting to the IRS. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is dealing with age discrimination and could not find another job. So I am completely in dark about our livelihood. No matter how I start my conversation, he won't say much about finances. So I know I need to start the conversation from elsewhere. I wanted to know what he truly thinks and feels regardless of my needs but he says my plans are fine and he will go with them. In reality he's not doing much about his own circumstances, let alone mine. I posted my husband's story in another subreddit. He had been through a lot in life too. Many people say he's depressed. I offered help countless of times, and he says he is fine. We have no money for any type of counseling.

&amp;#x200B;

The obvious is that I should get a better job and start saving us both from all the financial and emotional burdens we accumulated from our past relationship. I study as much as I can. Almost everything is difficult because just around every corner there is punishment and there is trauma in both of us (work, family, relationship.) I have no friends and he has no close friends nor relative. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the catch. I never share these life stories except with my husband. Playing the victim is never my thing. I just don't complain in real life period. But there is a point where I really break down. Several points in life in fact, and this is one of the rough times. There is no justice and no good deeds go unpunished. I wish there is a genuinely constructive way to talk through being wronged by others. Again I don't blame my husband for his circumstance but I do harbor strong hate from that company. These stories are just the tip of the iceberg. I need help here.",11May2019,28

21,"In the middle of a pretty bad depression spiral right now and just can't eat. after two days of not eating, I started a food log to make sure that I am at least getting enough for basic survival, and installed an app on my phone to remind me to drink water, but it is just getting harder to ingest anything. I saw these weird emergency ration bars that seem to have all the calories nutrients you need for a day in a few small bites and ordered those. I don't know if they will help or anything, but it's becoming harder every day. I feel like a failure for not being able to do basic human things, which only pushes the depression spiral further. I find myself playing this sick game where I see how long I can put off eating or drinking, which is really just a facade to make me feel like I have some control over the matter.

23,"I've been depressed since 2013 and I feel like I'm ungrateful because of it. I feel like I'm hurting my mom. I'm almost 20 and I lost all my youth on it. My dad left when I was 5 and I started to get really sad but depression just came out when I became a teenager. I'm doing therapy and it makes me feel better sometimes, I'm taking pills too, but I still hate myself, I hate everything I do, everything I am and it kills me to think I'm hurting my mom and my grandmas. Every month my psychiatrist tells me I'll have to take more antidepressants because I'm not getting better. A few weeks ago she told me I have a bordeline historic besides depression and anxiety, and I hate that my mom is paying for all my pills and my treatment while I'm planning to kill myself. I know she wouldn't be happy if I was dead, but I'm struggling, I'm too tired now, after almost seven years. I tried to kill myself once last month with sleeping pills, but my family took me to emergency. I saw my mother crying and I couldn't do much more than hating myself violently. I'm thinking a lot about trying again. I don't know what to do, I feel like my mind is trying to drag me to hell. Well, I don't have no one to talk about it anymore, so I'm sorry for this sad shit.",11May2019,1
24,"Im trying to get fit. I wanted to do twenty minutes a day exercise at home. I started monday. Im very unfit so was sore the next day so had a rest. And last few days i could only manage five or ten. Im thinking i may have overestimated how much i could manage, so im debating if i should keep it at ten along with calorie counting until i get fitter. But i feel like i failed already. I dont wanna give up, just disheartend. I tried to post this to lose it but they never seem to let me post any content. I dont know just feel a bit sad",11May2019,1
25,"I have this friend who is mean he says bad things to me

He puts me down and tells me I’m worthless

He tells me I will amount to nothing and be this way until the end 

I ask myself the question why do I still call him my friend

He follows me all through out the day and says I will always be this way

Well who is he this nasty friend ?

It’s me ! It’s me! It’s me I’m in your head

So give yourself a chance 

Give this guy the boot and don’t look back not even for a glance 

You will hear his voice sometimes but remember that he is not your friend 

And soon you will realise he’s not there until the end",11May2019,0
26,I feel so sad and I want to cry but I've been burying my emotions behind walls for so long that I can't let them out. I just want to feel it all and let it out. Anyone else had this problem? Any solutions?,11May2019,2
27,"I don't really have a reason to be depressed, I have a loving family (divorced parents but that seems like a norm these days) I have 2 close friends, which is better than none, I have a job, but nothing makes me happy and I'm honestly quite sad 24/7 I don't know how to talk to people, I feel so trapped and I have nobody to turn too, if I wasn't such a pussy Id off myself, but like everything else in my life I'm scared, I'm scared to do things, and dress different, and be me because I'm scared of what others will think, I don't see any meaning in my life, idk where I'll be in 5 years, I have no college degree, no girlfriend, and I'm stuck in shitty western New York, I just wish I had somebody close I could journey thru life with but I have nobody like that, no body to relate to and connect with on that level, maybe this is ""just another depression post"" but I needed to get this off my chest, I guess I'm just looking for someone to go through this with, someone who I can talk too, and someone who will truly understand and not just tell me ""things get better with time""",11May2019,2
