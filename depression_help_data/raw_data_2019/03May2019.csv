Hey there! Here for some advice. So I’ve always had anxiety since I was a child. Moving into my high school years, due to a certain illness I would not like to disclose, it causes me to distance myself from people, it’s a socially frustrating illness and to add to that I was always socially anxious. Couple years (2-3) I’ve still been bearing with the pain and I just feel numb. Like currently I’m void of emotions and such. I smoked weed once to see if it would help and it made me aware of everything. I talked out of being numb and my brain was in a loop of oh my god look what you’ve done, you’ve let people down, can’t believe you did this to yourself, nothing I can do... I couldn’t snap out of that mindset, and while still high I went back to being numb... I’ve had more weed experiences but that’s the only one which kinda woke me up for like 30 min, I felt unbearable sadness and guilt like I’ve let people down. I’ve stopped the intake of weed because it was just that one time where it helped me and other thank that it made me even lazier and I didn’t do much however it made me snap out of numbness a bit. So because of how I feel the guilt and such cane down after I got my illness and dropped out of high school and let all my dreams and expectations from others down it’s made me this numb almost as if I’m like depersonalized or disassociated... would that be ptsd from the illness? The illness was kinda like a thing that hit after puberty and as days went by it made me more and more socially isolated and very stressed? Also, I’ve seen lots of research regarding mdma therapy, do you think I would benefit from that? I should mention before the weed, I was not really numb, I was kinda like ok I’ll have to deal with this, although I was under constant stress.Thanks for replies",03May2019,1

3,"I thought I had everything.

I was the best.

Who wouldn't like a smart person kind enough to listen to all your ****. Always open to new information. Always wanting adventure and to learn something new. Patient enough to underatand your point of view. 

That was years ago.

This is today. I haven't slept in two days. I haven't had a good night of sleep in four years. My eyes are flooded with tears. I can't get out of bed to do anything. People scare me. I can't tell good from bad. 

I might delete this but I need to clear my head. You might ask yourself if i mistaken reddit for notepad. probabily. I don't know what I'm doing here.


I'm just a shell of what I was. What was once curiosity is now just static, ignoring everything that's outside of my body. I try to follow your words. I try to understand. I am tired. No one sees it. Nobody cares. I can't pull myself out. The advice I used to give turned to passive agresiveness and criticism. It's not my fault please understand. My love was meant to get the best flowers out of two seeds growing together. I became selfish. I still want the best for you but there's nothing good left in me. I want you to enjoy life. Can you even do it with me? Does wanting you closer make me selfish? I treated you so badly lately and I'm so painfuly sorry. I can't stop it. I'm scared to take meds. What if they kill me. I'm really paranoid. I need help. Who would help someone as evil as me. someone please force me into treatment if you love me so much. How do I know if the treatment will work. I'm going crazy. 


This is not who I am... or is it who I am now? 

I'm scared.",03May2019,44
4,"My ex-girlfriend and I broke up almost a year ago, and after some time apart she began to develop feelings and tried to fix the relationship. At this point I already had different feelings. Don't get me wrong, I love her and care about her will all my heart but for some reason I was unable to move past the feelings of resentment that I had towards her. She had tried so hard to fix everything and tried so hard to make up for everything but all I did was push her away. I feel fucking terrible for it. I feel horrible. It broke her heart and I feel extremely guilty for it. She said that she didn't understand why I just gave up on us and quite frankly, I don't understand either. I'm hurting and I don't know who else to run to and talk to. I don't have close friends to speak to in this regard, my insurance will not be available until July so I can't speak to a therapist and I feel like my mental health is slowly deteriorating more and more after I worked so hard to get better. I don't know what to do.",03May2019,1
5,I’ve hid my depression from everyone including my family for about 2 years now and I can function perfectly fine (I can get up and get ready for school) I have all A but my friends have told me that I seem like a person to never cry.Once in a while I don’t feel any emotions. None of my friends have seen me sad or cry. They ask me when the last time I cried was but I don’t tell them. Btw I’ve never thought about harming my self in any way. The reason I haven’t told any one is because I am afraid of how they’ll react.,03May2019,1
6,"this is also kind of requesting support.  But this girl that likes me asked me if i like her and idk what to say because i never thought of her like that. Also she is one of my friends.  she is nice and kinda cute but if i say yes then when we break up i have to lose her and i don’t want to lose her and the other fear i have is that people will find out im bi.  Her friends are pushing me to say yes.  The last fear is that i have another crush on this girl but we kinda cant get together cuz we are like best best friends and she is really nice, so im saying that if i say yes i cant say my feelings about the other girl and i cant go anywhere with her so basically im afraid of commitment. help idk what to do and it’s overwhelming 😫",03May2019,1
7,"I want to preface this with I’ve never had to work a full 40+ hour work week before. I mean I have, but the job could hardly be considered a real job compared to many others. I have worked hard part time jobs though. 

I just started a new job. It’s 44 hours and it’s killing me. I am chronically tired and when I come home from this job it just seems like all I do is lie in bed till I gotta go back. I have a wife and a child and I haven’t been suicidal since my child’s birth (he’s a year old). It I find myself wishing for death and being upset that I have a wife and child and can’t kill myself because of them. 

I feel like I don’t have any time. I feel like my life isn’t my own. I just feel like I exist to work and I hate that feeling. Does it get easier?",03May2019,1

11,"So today, I’ve been having this constant thought of, ‘I’m overreacting about how I feel. It’s not that bad, get over it. You haven’t actually hurt your self, so it can’t be THAT bad.’ Along with , ‘ why does everyone like being around me, I’m not funny, smart, or good at anything. I’m asocial and can barely hold a conversation, why do they like being around me’. And I feel guilty for how I feel, and what caused me to feel like this today.  Most of the day, i was fine, and happy, any hanging out with my girlfriend, then some stuff happened, about my friend asking our ‘mom’ friend if one of her scars were bleeding, and then the first chain of thought was triggered. And now I just have this overarching feeling of overreacting about my self diagnosed depression.",03May2019,1

15,"This is my first post. Sorry, this is so long.

Nights have become increasingly dangerous for me for the past few years. I break down and have thoughts of ending my life. I always stop myself because I don’t want the people around me to suffer due to my selfishness. Then there is also the thought, “How dare you think you are important enough to affect people around you.” I’m worthless. There is nothing to miss. There is nothing to mourn. Their lives can and will continue without me. Heck, it may even be better. My afternoons consist of me feeling so disgustingly numb. I have a hard time standing up straight. I zone out in all my classes no matter how hard I try to concentrate. I can’t feel my feet with each step I take. I do not want to admit that I am possibly depressed because I think I’m blaming my weaknesses on a serious mental issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Academics:

I’m a college student with no job. I can't find the time, or am I being too lazy? I hate my major. I’ve missed the first couple of assignments because I get anxious before I code and end up getting a panic attack. I hate coding with a passion. It consumes my life. I can’t get out of my classes without a ‘good’ reason. I’m already on academic probation from my last quarter. I picked computer science so I'm guaranteed a job, but I really want to pursue the more artistic side of the industry (possibly concept design/story development). I’m too scared to change majors into something more ‘artistic’. I’ve been told it’s better to secure a lucrative job and then pursue your passion on the side. However, I’ve done terribly in all my CS classes, and aced every humanities/writing/art/art history class I took. But what if it gets hard again and I run into the same problem? I’m weak. I sound so pathetic. I honestly need someone to help me through this, but I don’t want to bother anyone with my problems. I’ve only reached out to one person. I plan to talk to her tomorrow, but I'm afraid I'm bothering her as she hinted that she is struggling with her own problems but is more than willing to hear me out whenever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personal Life:

I heal when I am with my family. However, the environment has become toxic. My mom’s husband is childish and controlling. My younger brother and I must stroke his ego and do his bidding for my mother’s sake. My dad’s wife is a leech that treats him like a slave. He must work hard to support her, her father, and their toddler. She relies on my dad and I to help her with the smallest things as she is also going to college and is an immigrant. I stay at his house every weekend so I can spend more time with him, but I cannot stand it there. My brother has even refused to go over a few times because he does not care for the wife and child. This breaks my heart because I want him to spend time with our dad. Even if we go over, all my brother does is play games on his computer. I feel as if my brother has lost his respect for me, and I do not blame him. 

Not too long ago, my great-grandmother passed away. She was the one who raised me, so I can’t help but feel that my childhood has gone with her. Her funeral was on the week of finals last quarter, so I could not focus on my exams. (Not to use her death as an excuse for my indeptitude). I was emotionally destroyed as this was the first close death I experienced. There was a language barrier, so I never got to tell her how much I loved her even though she told me how proud she was of me and how much she loved me every time I visited her. I would brush off her words as she said it so often, but I never knew how much I needed those words until now. I would love to meet her and finally tell her how much she means to me, but I still have family here. They are the reason why I am still here, but it’s getting harder to stay.

16,"I'm in a really dark place right now. I'm isolated in my big home at nighttime and it feels like I'm already dead - it's dark and lonely and meaningless and nobody is close enough to me to know if I did die. I'm so upset because I was getting to know someone amazing, and because of me being dysfunctional with hardly any relationship skills, I couldn't cope and lost him. I hate myself for being such an arse to someone so freaking kind and beautiful. I don't know if I'll ever hear from him again. Also, I went to my friends house and she was telling me how nearly everyone from our high school is in a committed relationship or married or having babies. I don't think I want babies, but the fact that love and happiness for a lot of people comes so easily... I'm devastated. I'm twenty five, and I still feel like an unlovable freak. I was bullied from kindergarten through to adulthood by peers, teachers and family. It feels like I've done something horrible in a past life, that I'm being punished for something, I just don't know what it is. I also had some random psychopath message me on reddit, and in one message he was already calling me ""fucking stupid"" and a ""fucking disappointment"" and saying ""don't say that when your parents are around or I'll spank you"" and when I finally told him off and said goodbye, he said ""no wonder you're depressed"". It's tough enough without having to deal with these arseholes. I could really use the best cuddle of my life from a caring stranger. I'll probably delete this post incase someone I know reads this. But I'm just so unhappy and it's soul-destroying seeing everyone else getting to live meaningful lives with people who love them while I settle for accepting that things always feel shit. I don't even feel I have the will anymore to keep going. It's like trying to make yourself walk with a broken leg. Except in this case what is broken is my heart and mind. I hate having to rely on pills just to be in control.",03May2019,1
17,"I am currently in Japan with a friend. The trip was planned for 2 weeks, with us spending a week in Tokyo, then moving on to Osaka and Kyoto. We’ve been planning this trip for a while and were both very excited.

3 months ago I met a guy on tinder. The relationship was immediate and intense.  Cut a long story short, I broke up with him because he kept shutting off and not speaking to me, would blow very hot and cold. I’ve been single for 5 years and for some reason, fell very quickly and deeply for this person. After a week or begging him to see me and him refusing, I broke up with him and had a total breakdown. I begged him to take me back, he wouldn’t. 

A week later, I saw a chat log of his with an older female friend from work, where he’s telling her he can’t wait to see her, begging her to speak to him, on a day that he was almost totally ignoring me. I flipped, messaged his ex (who doesn’t know me) very politely, just to ask if he and this older female has been friends during their very long relationship, and apologised for contacting her. She called him,  crying about how quickly he’d moved on. I also messaged the older woman who assured me there was nothing going on, which I do believe now. 

After a week of ignoring me, he called and begged to see me, to which I finally caved and agreed. He was mad at me for contacting people in his life, but I wanted answers and he was ignoring me. In fact, just a few days before he’d told me to leave him alone or he’d block me, so to respect his wishes, I blocked him. Only to have a message come through somewhere else from him asking why I’d blocked him. 

Anyway, I told him I wanted all of him or none of him, being friends is too painful, but he said he could not forgive what I had done ( he has done things to me of equal shortness). 

This happened 2 days before my departure. I suffer with clinical depression, have cried every single day for the past 2 weeks (including the week leading up to the break up) and am planning on booking a flight home, if my travel friend can stay with a friend of hers here in Tokyo. I feel so guilty but I just can’t do it. I feel like I’m having a mental break and I’m so far from home. I’ve read travel  is the best remedy for a breakup, but this isn’t just a break up, is it? I shouldn’t be reacting to badly to this situation, especially in a place I’ve wanted to visit for over a decade. I’ve realised while here, that no one has ever had such a negative effect on my mental health, in my entire 29 years of life. 

I’m planning to go home a week early and try to check myself into a hospital, though they’ve told me family they will only take me if I’m suicidal, which I’m not, but I’m the worst I have ever been and I absolutely cannot cope. 

I have just started a new job, which I’ve had to take time off from already because of this, though they are being kind about it. Right now, I’m in Tokyo and finding places to run off and cry wherever and whenever  I can. 

I am so bad that I haven’t been eating, which hasn’t happened before. My sister and dad have not been able to eat or focus on work themselves as they are so worried about me, which also hasn’t happened before. 

I just don’t want to hear “stay, you’ll feel better!” Like everyone is saying. I’m just broken, confused and hopeless. All I want to do is cry.",03May2019,1
19,"So I made my first post last week and I was so surprised but the level of respect of mental illness and helpful responses. I’m still feeling sad atm with severe anxiety and depression but my big girl job is finally getting busy so I am actually very happy at work helping people with therapy. It’s when I go back to where I’m crashing that I go into the black hole of my mind and just ruminate on everything, having terrors nightly and screaming in a strangers home. 

Anyway my therapist is getting her doctorate this week so it was really a great appointment yesterday. I like that I’m getting to know myself again by talking to someone and also feel good that I’m helping her learn through my sickness. I was given a body focused repetitive behavior chart because my obsession with perfection is still very evident. Still covered in bruises from moving and have only lipstick as a motivation. My eyes are so dark people ask if I’m okay. It’s annoying but I’m just fighting to still not jump off anything.

I’m still homeless too since getting evicted last week and this is what makes me very sad. I feel stressed and anxious with my new car full of my crap and living out of trash bags sleeping on a friends couch. I didn’t plan on crashing but when I tried to move in with family last week I discovered the condition of the place was very disappointing with no ac and rats. Regardless I moved in only to get into a screaming match with everyone and moved out that night. Tbh I was looking forward to living with family. I’m 27 and I haven’t done that since 18. My cousin is a criminal and thief and it was really hard for me to not yell at him because I care. The family has let his sickness go way to far. I suppose yelling at him wasn’t smart but I felt I needed to bring in the aggression so he didn’t steal my stuff. I’m really disappointed that I did that even though I know I did just because I care. It’s complicated. My uncles girlfriend who is younger than me and has a child freaked her shit when I moved in because they guy helping me is ex military and carry’s. I got kicked out the day I moved in all because of the fact that there was protection with me plus the dude helping. I don’t think that’s grounds but I like to think things happen for a reason. 

My efforts are so bare minimum I at least shower and brush my hair and teeth. Going from a full face weeks ago at interviews and now I’m just done faking it. Makeup attracts people and I guess I don’t want that. Lipstick makes me happy though. I’m really trying to be happy with myself and this stupid situation. The behavior sheet from my therapist will probably show data of my depression and how it’s so much worse at night. What do people do to avoid this? I’ve heard of lights or special glow treatments and idk how I feel about that. I sit and stand repetitively in front of a double monitor and desk so I really don’t feel like watching tv or anything when I’m off work. What can I do to avoid the downs?

30,"So basically my life has been ups and downs since I can remember. I never thought of it till recently, while I was trying to find a reason for my sadness.

My dad was always a great parent to me, he always played with me, worked hard so I always had what I needed and I always trusted him. He already had other families, 2 to be exact. He had 3 other kids with 3 different moms. I always knew about my 2 older siblings but my mom told me about the other one during a discussion, saying that my dad didn't even care about that baby and that I'm lucky that he hasn't left. I don't really know what to feel about my 3 siblings... I would love to have someone that close in my life but we don't talk so it's like they don't even exist. My dad is such a nice guy to everyone and it's hard to believe that and I'm actually lucky. 

In another hand, my mom isn't that happy at all. My childhood memories are filled with school breaks, my pets and fights between my parents. They both have strong personalities so none gets quiet...until the violance is too much. Yeah I remember screams, crying, me running to be in front of my mom so my dad wouldn't beat her anymore and the saddest memory I have is me and my mom running away through trees in our garden. I don't remember what came next, maybe they made me lock myself in my bedroom. 

I always defended my mom and seen what my dad did to her, but I was still more afraid of her than my dad. She would get mad over everything, things I did wrong or she did... it didn't matter. She would beat me too. Now that I'm in tears thinking about it, I don't remember being a bad kid. I had good grades, I was nice to everyone around and I only cared about music and my pets. I didn't have much friends, I had my cousins and my neighbor and that was it. I remember noticing that my dad left her in a bad mood, probably cus of money and I knew what was coming. I cried to my father and told him not to leave me alone and he thought I was kidding or something and went to work. 

I never had that trust with my mother till today. Everytime I tried to show her my paitings, she would say they look weird and that I should paint roses instead. Since my pre teen years that I've shown her music that I really enjoy in order to get her to know me better , but she would always say that she doesn't have time to listen to my ""crazy songs"" even tho I would carefuly select indie or something soft as well. I really tried to have a better relation with little steps like these and was never possible. Lots of dramas went by during my 12-15 years old, but they were never that big of a deal. I still was in the top 3 with best grades in the class, I didn't care about dating, drinking or any other thing, I was quite at home, would help her and I only asked for regular stuff and she would deny everything saying that there's no money, that dad doesn't know how to manage money and the rest of the talk would be just talking trash about my dad. 

During this time, I started talking to my neighbor and she thought it was heartbreaking that my mom made me bruises when I asked for a sandwich instead of a soup ( I was like 13 years old and healthy). I once ran to her house crying because my mom had cut my nails in such a violent way that I was bleeding from 3 nails. She said so many things, so many threats and I always ended up crying so when my dad was coming back from work I would have to go to the bathroom clean my tears, as she told me to. But one day, while my parents were mad and my mom was mad at me, I tried to hold the tears and went to say hi to my dad and started crying out of nowhere. He got mad and push me out of his room, while he was on the PC. He never really asked if I was feeling good. Him or her.

Since then, I started taking longer showers or just go multiple times to the shower so they wouldn't see me crying ever again. It's been 3 years since the last time.

I was a lucky girl cus I had friends at school during this time and in other activities. They were and still are those of kind of friends that we could stop talking for months and when we get back together everything is the same and that is one of the best feelings for me. I had one that was really special to me and I actually loved that person. Everyone in class would say that we would be the best couple, but nothing ever happened.  So basically, it was thinking about this person that I decided that something isn't that normal, but it has been happening for a while. We used to be close and then, with no reason, I would stop talking to him and others. I changed to another school during high school, made new friends and still did the same with them. I'm in university and it's happening again. I've been diagnosed with depression and the doctor told me to see psychiatrist with my mom, but my mom never cared. She said it was me being stupid and son't thinking clearly. She never even told my dad cus she said he could get mad at me. Till today, when she is angry she uses that to hit me like ""oh, I'm sorry you have depression .. that's just you being sad"" and then comparing me to her and saying that she has been through more and she never had it. This happened when I was 15/16 and since then I never went to the psychologist. Since the psychologist told my mom I had cut myself, I used other methods to punish myself.

This is a loop that doesn't stop. I am dating and from time to time I get either get emotionless or a cry baby. 

I'm in university, I don't have my parents, my love or my close friends, but I still have cousins and some friends I still talk to. I started the year good, I talked to everyone, I made friends, I'm going to the gym and still talk to my love everyday. Then why do I keep quiting everything when everything is just great? I had weeks that I wanted to be really sweet and ask how everyone was doing, but I was like dead inside and now some of them don't even say hi to me. I didn't mean to be rude, I'm not shy.. I'm just ruining the chances of enjoying like again. People kept inviting me to things and I would say I couldn't, instead of having lunch with my group, I came home (it's a 35 minutes trip long) and said I had to do something. Had breaks were I cried in the bathroom cus I hate myself so much for what I'm doing, but I can't control myself during it. Last parties were about me crying and going for a walk alone. 

I just want them to see the real me again but it's too late. Now I'm the quite and sad girl that no one talks to cus she doesn't do too. 

I have one moth before going back home.",03May2019,1
32,"So a little backstory. My mother was born into household with abusive father and noncaring mother as middle child. Her two brothers always got better treatment from all the stories i was told it is pretty obvious that it's true. She was bullied in school but pushed through it. She met an awesome guy (at the time) and married him. They had 4 children. Last one was me. When i was around 2 years old they divorced, he became an abusive alcoholic and she obviously didn't want us to have same childhood as her. He then proceeded to not pay child support, didn't give a fuck about us and cut all ties. She worked like a madwoman for over 20 years. Through fall of communism in our country. Through financial crisis of 2008. She always pulled through, until she fell of a ladder at work and injured her back. One of her vertebra moved, by a lot. She had to get surgery and from there on her health went to shit. All sorts of problems started to appear. Fast forward to 2017 and after many tries she found a guy she wanted to marry. And she did. Its been 2 years and half of that he spent in prison. Now he is back and they argue a lot. Tonight she got drunk and told me that looking back, her life was shit. And if it doesn't improve till end of the summer she will kill herself. I know this will sound horrible from me, but i was there in the pit called depression. I have two suicide attempts behind me and it got better. But she is in a lot of pain, getting old, my siblings basically visit/call only when they need something. And her mother calls her every day telling her she failed as a mother, but not as insult... just like you would tell someone they have red shoes, for her its a fact. I am at loss because i understand why she wants to do it, she never had power over her life. She always did things for others without doing anything for herself. And this is her last scream into the dark. I see it as a plea of help, but i dont know what to do, what to say. I am at a complete loss. Help.",03May2019,1
