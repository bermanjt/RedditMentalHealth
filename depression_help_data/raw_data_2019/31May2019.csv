0,"I was discharged from the military a little over a month ago and this past month has been a struggle for me. I find myself unable to do day to day things. My personal hygiene is lacking, im not eating enough, i rarely leave my house, and overall I just feel so lost.

The main reason I'm here seeking advice is because I recently started a new job and its much different from the military. I find it really hard to interact with people and learning the basics for me to do my job properly isn't any easier. I find myself depriving myself of sleep every night because all I can think about anymore is how I'm nothing but a failure and I'll never have the ability to do anything right again (being discharged was a huge blow to my ego). Work is especially hard at the moment because I'm still in training and I'm frequently making mistakes which only seems to be making things worse. I understand that mistakes are bound to happen when learning something new, but it feels like with each new mistake I make, the less I have to offer.

Im losing sleep dwelling on everything that went wrong that day for much longer than I should be and it's really taking a toll on my ability to function im even the most simple ways. Ive tried therapy before but that never really helped me in anyway. What can I do to get my confidence back? What can I do to stop overthinking so much? Its making my life so much worse. I feel like such a failure.",31May2019,1

3,"Hi so I'm at a point in my therapy that I am doing well on the day to day. But something I've never gotten the hang of is keeping myself clean. It was pulling teeth for my parents to get me to shower and brush my teeth. But as an adult now I still struggle to make myself do it. I feel like I just dont want to bother or it seems like a chore to go through and do these things. Is anybody else familiar with this feeling?

Over the years I managed to accrue a decent list of people I considered close friends but after a series of bad decisions on my end and bad things done to me ( people doing things to me and then me ultimately talking shit about them to all our mutual friends) has landed me in a place where I don’t have anyone left, either alienated by myself or people I cut out of my life due to their toxicity long story short I find myself in strange city with no friends near or far and it really hurts that I have no one to call a friend in this life it feels like I am the problem.

6," In most of the cases, people are not even ready to accept that they are suffering from a mental illness. It is not like a fever, cold cough or muscle pain that will calm down after taking pills. The mind is something more complex that requires utmost care while dealing with it. Currently, depression has become the most common mental illness that you can notice in all ages of people.

8,"First post here, sorry if I'm rambling but I need to get this out. I tried to keep this as short as I could. 

I know I'm depressed. I check all the ""are you depressed"" boxes, and it's been this way for years. I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it (thanks USA!) and I know I can't afford to pay for therapy because I've searched to no avail. There aren't any resources for me to turn to or at least none that I've found. 

I can go on forever on the reasons why I feel like I do but I don't know if any of it matters at this point. I just want help. I've lost interest in almost everything, things I loved, things that made happy and feel accomplished. The only thing keeping me here is my son who I love more than anything  and it hurts me to know I have these thoughts of giving up. Not for me but for him. I don't think I would ever end it but the thoughts are there, and it scares me. I wasn't always like this and I just wanna be the person I used to be or just not be this person I am now. 

Where can I turn for help??? Please...",31May2019,1
9,"So, it started about 7-8 months ago. I met this girl in my college class, we started dating and thing progressed at a reasonable pace, but she made it clear that I wasn't first on her list. I completely understood this and agreed, because the #1 was her dream.

As we continued to date, things got more intimate and, I had already began falling and she had aswell, but I could tell that the relationship was getting to her (she has a stressful life and this was here first relationship). She began to ""push"" me away little and little without realizing and I later learned why. She was try to get me to be mad/annoyed so that breaking up would easier, but she could never do that, she didn't have the heart too. Part of her dream meant that she had to travel alot and I noticed that as she traveled, everytime she came back, it's like we took 3 steps back in our relationship, but I pushed through.

Long story short, we we're falling in love with each other but her dreams came first (which I wanted), so I broke up with her so she could go after them. Being in a relationship stressed her out, and she felt bad that she couldn't put me first, and I felt bad that she felt bad and so on. I made the choice I knew she couldn't, for her sake.

But it's now been a few months and I can't stop feeling aweful. When im by myself I have to put the music all the way up to not hear my own thoughts. At night, I've begin to cry with thoughts of her, hell I'm crying as I type this. I want to talk to her but I don't want her to feel bad about/for me. I'm never the talking type, but l literally don't know what else to do. I can't even sleep without thinking about her. 

Please all advice is appreciated.
Thank you.",31May2019,2
10,"Sorry for the read, this isn't even all of it. Help and advice is much appreciated.

Emotionally abusive, manipulative, and so much more. I was 14 (turning 15), she was 17 (turning 18) and I was blinded by infatuation. She would like me to do sexual things then say I was a pervert and disgusting and she'd be so passive aggressive and withheld affection as a punishment. She said we couldn't date due to her knowing she was driving me crazy, but she kept going anyway even though she KNEW she was in a powerful position as a senior girl with bit tits verses a freshmen guy. She'd lead on multiple guys with me at the same time, and she'd tell me she will choose when she's ready, but she'd still flirt with me. She made fake rape accusations against my friend to cover up her having sex. She'd twist my words and say stuff never happened even when it did. She'd say we couldn't be together, then kiss me after. I was so stupid. She'd tease me sexually and when I'd respond (in the same degree) suddenly I became a dirty pervert. She was so hypocritical. The fucking worst part is she ruined any chances with another relationship. I liked the other girl but it was only a small crush, the abusive one knew and told her that I was a pervert, and said the same things to every girl and lied constantly. The crush then completely unfriended me on everything and blamed me for tearing her down after years of building herself up. The abusive girl, she made me choose between her and my crush. She said, ""choose your crush Blake."" Then get upset when I did. So I stupidly chose the abusive one, who then broke then off IMMEDIATELY afterwards after gaining my commitment and told my crush everything. I was ruined, I cut myself, I cried till I puked (has anyone ever felt that feeling?), I would walk to the bathroom in school and have a panic attack, and I've sense gone numb and not cried in a long time and I feel I won't again for a very long time.. She would still be in all my classes, and I'd have to see her everyday. And I'd have to keep my mouth shut. It hurt. So much. She gets praised by my theatre director at my HS for being so ""kind, gentle, and caring for others."" It made my blood boil knowing the truth. This girl lied about rape multiple times, took advantage of me, and almost caused her parents to divorce. I'm in therapy now and have been for 7 months. The scar is still bleeding. I can't describe the pain and how so very close I was and tried to kill myself. She teased me for being a ""soft boy"" and would constantly berate me over little things. She'd go cold when she got upset and wouldn't try to resolve the issue, then she'd cry and tell her friends (some of which were mine), that I was being unreasonable. She ruined a lot of friendships and occasionally the ripples of her actions still rock the boat of my life. I was stupid and infatuated and idolizing her due to my own family issues. I have learned. Never again will I give people in relationships a second chance. Olivia, if you're out there, I hope you realize you single handedly fucked up this 14 (now 15 year olds head) head so much sometimes I can't tell if I'm the abusive one or not. I fucking hate you. Everytime she sees me in public she snickers, she knows. I made quite a few mistakes, but nothing compared to what she did to me. I should've gotten out, but I feel the power difference between a senior and a freshmen is very large, and while I should've been more vigilant, she should have realized I'd bend over backwards for her. She changed me, or maybe I changed myself, and it's quite a massive change for the worse. My personality has gone all over the place and that doesn't help I'm on Zoloft and Lamictal (or maybe it does.)

I'm sorry, this is an outlet, I hope to not be banned. I'm 15 and it's been 7 months but it's still hard. She shows up in my nightmares occasionally, I just want to move on. I know continuing to discuss this isnt moving on, but I need to get it out. I was already in an extremely low point in life due to me dealing with childhood trauma from my alcoholic father (since recovered), and I was so vulnerable going into HS.   I'm in an extremely healthy relationship (we play Minecraft and cuddle a lot) with a girl (after a while had passed) in my grade right now, and I don't want to dwell on the past and don't plan on telling my new girlfriend this. How can I reverse the pain? This experience affected me so much, I'm now constantly paranoid of cheating, extremely jealous, insecure, constantly saying sorry, overall just so so much more insecure. It's also made me attracted to cheating porn, which I find absolutely disgusting. (To each their own though) I want to change that. I'm sorry for all of this. Thank you for reading. I hope I'm not breaking any rules.",31May2019,1

Now it isn't because I hadn't tried other things to get well, therapy, different programs of recovery. But for me, this one daily action of talking about Gratitude and investigating and talking about the challenges I have around anger, betrayal, depression, suicide, all that sort of stuff has helped me more than anything I've ever tried in the past.

I'm thankful for the people that helped me on the journey.

I'm 16, I have decent grades, I'm going to a great new school in September. I was bullied for 2 years in the school I just finished, my grandpa died in February, I dont have friends at school, and I have trouble trusting any of the people I talk to in school, I havent been to any of their houses in the last 4 years. Both parents and my sister are alive and well. We have a cat and a dog. My cousin and 2 of his friends are my only friends and the only people I talk to outside of school. My hobbies are skiing, video games, walking my dog rarely (and feel bad about not doing it enough), and watching netflix. Nothing too tragic has happened to me. No traumatic experiences besides some bullying and people making up stories about me. 

So, why am I still having suicidal thoughts and feeling like shit every week? I'm 100% confident I would end myself if my cousin died, he's the only important person in my life (obviously I care about my parents and grandparents, you get it).

I'm going to live in my own apartment in about 2 months, and I'm afraid its gonna get worse and I'm gonna start slacking in school. Hopefully there are some people with similar interests to mine, because I dont go out and I truly dont have any real hobbies, or a reason to keep going.

15," i havent been diagnosed of any mental illness before but i am aware that sometimes what i experience is no longer normal. I am also a biology student which helped me a bit on understanding what i may be going through but i have never seeked professional help before since i either dont have the money for it (since i cant ask my family to give me money for this cause) or im scared of what may happen. So here i am, asking for advice or maybe an explanation of what i am experiencing and whether its actually normal even if it doesnt feel like it.

Anyway, i should start somewhere so here goes. I am a student who can perform her duties well and  also have a scholarship. I have a lot of friends around me and i also have a small circle of people whom i am really close with. I have a nice family who is a bit well off as compared to other families. We dont experience financial struggles and we do have a close bond but they are strong people. What i mean by that is, when they first learned i wound myself sometimes(this is way back senior high school) they asked me what i am lacking in life. When i said i lack motivation and a purpose, they asked me to find one. They thought it was funny. My family loves me and i know that. They love me but they dont want to understand me. They love me but the only love they were willing to offer was tough love. They said everyone goes through sadness and a depression stage in their lives and they never brought me to a psychologist even if the topic had been opened a few times. They think i just lack courage and a drive and that i am weak so they tried to be tough on me so that i may rise stronger. It didnt help much, all it did was put a greater amount of pressure on me. Just to clear things up, when i said my family, i meant my brothers and sisters. My father rarely talks to me and my mother left us permanently. My siblings however were successfull people who excels in their different workfields(my siblings occupation;eldest to youngest; Chemist, mechanical engineer, teacher, software engineer). Their success is something i should look up to but instead, i feel weak and worthless in their presence.


As i said earlier i have friends, i talk to them about what i go through sometimes but all they offer me is advices and that i should start looking on the bright side and that i should be thankful that i have a lot of things others dont have.(i, of course, do that but it just doesnt help.) I stopped telling them about these thing a year ago, since it started to feel like i am just a burden to everyone around me. I hang out with people a lot but it doesnt help much either, for a while the fun i have with them will make me forget and then this emptiness just suddenly washes over me and i am sad again. Some days, i just stay in my room. I read but these days i had stopped because i dont have the will to do it. I used to write stories too but that also stopped because i can no longer be as good as i used to be. I enjoy painting as also but that also sometimes comes to a halt when staying in bed suddenly seems like the best way to spend the day.

Last school semester, i almost lost my scholarship after having failed a major and i kept on blaming my teacher for it but i know to myself that i failed that subject's exams because there are days i just couldnt bring myself to study. 

And one last thing. I have a boyfriend. I also have constant thoughts of just breaking up with him even if i love him so much. Its just that there are days when i am super fucked up, numb and emotionally drained and he kept on feeling like its his fault. I am getting tired of making him understand that not because he loves me and is showering me love, i'd just miraculously be fine again. I hate it when he blames himself, and now i just decided to stop talking to him about this things too so that i may not burden him anymore..I dont know how to explain my situation to him if i cant even understand it myself. 

Its too heavy for me now and i dont know what to do anymore. There are times when i suddenly just cry because i just feel so tired and messed up. Its funny when i say tired because these days i dont do much but stay at home and lay in bed but i am still so exhausted. Need advice please.

In conclusion, my family thinks this is normal, i am losing interest in things, i failed a major because im lazy? Im tired of life and is seemingly ungrateful of it. Bf thinks i am not happy with him  and that this is his fault. I am confused and desperately needs someone to help me.

19,"My parents are a bit off.

If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, it’s rarely done.

I’ve tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and I’ve asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since.

However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, I’ve had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just haven’t felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. 

That was a few months ago and I haven’t been able to convince my parents that I should go back.

It’s not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything

And it’s not a time issue, neither of my parents are working.

My parents are the “There ain’t nothing you can’t fix yourself” type, and don’t understand much about mental help.

It’s getting so bad that my mother won’t hardly talk to anyone because she’s either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything.

Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad.

Don’t get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really don’t do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything can’t be solved within a minute or two, they won’t hardly even look in its direction.

I’m near graduating, so it’s not like I’m just some middle schooler looking for attention. I’m actually a bit concerned about my mental help, and some of the people I’ve talked to as well, but at this point, I just don’t know how to get that help.

She forwarded the messages to my school counselor and I was put in a mental hospital. There I found out that I didn't even know why I was depressed. I thought about it more after my discharge and realised it was something to do with an absence of friends. I'd like to know if it's selfish to want people to take initiative to care, just a quick ""are you OK"" once in a while, and how I can get better",31May2019,1
22,"To those who are contemplating suicide as a solution to their struggles:
On March 28th I committed suicide. I say ""commited suicide"" vs. ""attempted suicide"" because I didn't attempt anything. I made the active decision to end my life and followed through with it. 
Personally I am bi-polar with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. To say that I have struggled throughout my life is an understatement. Before this I have no history of physical self-harm. I quantify my reference to self-harm as ""physical"" because a lot of my behaviors and actions in other areas could be viewed as a different form of self-harm.
That day I was at work and had a terrible headache. I decided to go home for the day and tend to it. I have a history of missing work due to my instability and have even lost jobs over it. My very patient and loving husband was understandably frustrated with my leaving early again. We got into a bit of a spat and in a split second random decision I was going to kill myself. I enacted a plan, partially researched and partially from years of working in the pharmaceutical industry. I put together a cocktail of medications that would suppress my respiratory system until I finally stopped breathing. Before taking this medications I took phenergan to make sure that i didn't throw up my cocktail. 
Through text messages, calls, and facetime my husband realized that something was wrong. When he got home to me I was already aspirating and violently coughing. I had taken the medications 2 hours prior. He immediately called 911 and was told to secure the animals so that EMS could quickly get to me. He heard the sirens outside but due to our apartment complex being very confusing he knew that they were struggling to find us. In what I'm sure was the most terrifying decision of his life he left me in bed and ran downstairs to lead the paramedics to our apartment. 
By the time I made it to the hospital, all of the medications has been processed in my body and there was no point in trying to pump my stomach. I was in the ICU for 3 days, intubated and on the verge of death. 
Luckily I pulled through and made a full recovery. Had my husband been 5 or 10 minutes later getting home, I wouldn't be writing this post. I immediately went from the hospital to a treatment facility in Tennessee called the Ranch. I was there for 4 weeks and it was an incredibly life-changing experience. I highly recommend it to anyone with mental health or addiction issues. The Ranch is widely considered to be one of the best treatment centers in the country.
My point in sharing all of this is that I have seen first hand the effects that suicide has on your family and friends. It is a terrible decision that is selfish and uncaring. I will never forget the state that my family was in when I regained consciousness. It was devastating. 
To anyone who is considering suicide, please find another option. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is not worth it.",31May2019,28
23,"Mid 30's, male, depressed. I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since I was 10 years old. On and off medicines of all types, self medicated myself for most of my 20's.

Had a nervous breakdown years ago. I couldn't live life anymore. I couldn't drive, I couldn't bear the thought of going to work, slaving, being treated like shit, making someone else rich, making shit wages, destroying my body. I quit my job and slowly became a shut in. The thought of going outside, dealing with people, having to be shackled down to a schedule sends me into a panic.

I'm a huge burden on everyone around me. My family, my girlfriend, without them I'd be homeless, maybe worse. Still I'm depressed even with some great people in my life who keep me fed, clothed and sheltered. Sometimes I just want to leave them because I feel they would be better off. I want to help them but I'm so damn tired all the time. I can barely find the energy to keep myself clean. I don't bathe often, or take care of myself like I should. 

My diet is complete shit and I can't stop eating. I'm totally hooked on fast food and its comforting because I barely have the energy to cook, then clean my own mess. I know I'm poisoning myself, I know I'll probably die of heart disease at this rate. I'll go into a panic thinking about it, swear I'll change and well never do.

""Well get medicated!"" I am. It barely helps. It helps me to stay stable enough to not be irrationally angry. I'm tired of trying new cocktails of drugs, second guessing my emotions because ""Is it the pills or is it me?""

I finally found shut in friendly work!!!! Good pay, set my hours, I could finally contribute to the house and help to pay the bills. Well...I lost it in a week. Not because of a lack of trying, I just wasn't doing good enough. I keep failing to re-qualify and I'm pretty sure I'll lose it. After years of scraping the bottom of finances and begging for help I thought I could finally be able to give back. Imagine telling everyone about your job only to go back a whole week later and being like ""Welp, lost my job"" I feel fucking stupid, and once again add onto the stress and burden of those around me.

I'm just tired, depressed, I want to give up and just go to bed and stay in it forever. I'm not suicidal, just sad, I feel like some kind of useless creature who just exists who has no purpose or function. I'm almost 40 for and I still feel like a lost teenager.

I'm sad.

By definitive, I guess I'm looking for proven plans or processes (as opposed to just lists of foods and eating tips).

26,"I'm a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I don't have a right to. Other people don't have a lot of the things I have. I'm objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy. So why is life so hard?

I've started drinking almost every day. I'll go to the bar alone and drink. I'll drink until I get sleepy. Then I go home, and sleep. The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone.

I'm just so lonely. Why don't people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I don't think I'm an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard.

I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasn't the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is ""supposed to"" peak?

But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I don't have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply.

I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going (feeling like I was fixed) the problems began again. I've been medicated for depression consistently for years now. I've even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like I've done everything.

What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass can't take advantage of it. Someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin.

I think of killing myself every day. I won't do it. But the thought, that's not normal right?

This turned into a rant and I apologize for that.",31May2019,72

32,"cn: depression, OCD, obsessive thinking, medication, venting

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm faking everything. I had to take a leave from absence from college a few months ago because of depression and OCD.  It's been a hard few months to top off years of these issues but there have been some ok times. It's in the ok times that I feel ridden with guilt and my mind races with doubts. I question whether someone ""truly depressed"" would be able to feel happiness at times, or look forward to some things. I convince myself I've been faking it all along after I've had a good day. It just ruins it altogether. I worry that my inability to keep up with basic home management and my tendency to spend most of my day in bed indicates that I'm just being lazy, nothing more. Especially when I don't feel as bad as some other days. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend invited me on a trip a year ago and we've come to planning it now. I don't particularly feel like going because things have been bad recently but I don't want to let her down and maybe it'd be good for me to experience things. But the fact I'm planning a trip makes me stress and fear I'm faking my illness because if I was *really* depressed I wouldn't be able to go on a trip. I fear I've faked my way to getting out of college and working, that it's all just a subconscious excuse to be lazy.  

&amp;#x200B;

My doctor has diagnosed me with severe depression and I've been referred for treatment. I've been taking medication for a few years now. I feel someone faking it wouldn't want help. I genuinely hate the way my life is. I miss the hard-working student I used to be, but my obsessive thoughts made me work to excess and burnout, and my depressive thoughts made it hard to even get to the desk without feeling sick to my stomach. I want to go back to college, achieve great things, get a job that I love. But everything feels so incredibly daunting. I plan on going to college again in September but fear relapsing. I just feel like I've lost everything and I need to get it together but I can't. I'm really hopeless. I was seeing a therapist over the past few months but she seemed to think mental illness didn't exist and my issues were just a reflection of some daddy issues of some sort. I can't really imagine a future when I'm well in myself and able to cope with life's simple pressures. And able to enjoy stuff without guilt. And able to accept that I might have something wrong with me beyond laziness.   


Sorry for the rant.",31May2019,3

34,"So quick backstory. I'm 19F. I have had winter depressions for the last 4 years now. I've had help and this winter I didn't spiral down as much as previous years. 
However, I feel myself slipping away again, and this time I can't blame the winter time since it's almost summer. I'm not completely depressed yet and feel pretty good, but I see the signs and behavioral changes that I link with my previous depressions.  The problem is that I don't know how to stop it right now because I don't know the reason. (My life is pretty good at the moment. And I know it sounds stupid, but I just don't wanna go through all of it again). 

Does anyone have the same problems? How did you deal with it? 
Or maybe just someone who has some advice or ideas on how to stop it?",31May2019,2
35,"I wish I didn’t exist.

I’m a 24 year old woman. On the outside I have the perfect life. I have a great big family, a boyfriend, I’m told I’m attractive all the time, I’m fit, smart and people seem to like being around me and they laugh at my jokes. But on the inside I feel sad all the time. I have a few good friends, but the past few years they have all moved far away so I only get to see them a few times a year. We try to stay in touch while they are away but they have their new life, new school, new job, new friends... and while they are gone I feel so incredible lonely, all day long. I’m don’t know how to make new friends, real friends, the kind that you can call for no reason and ask them to go for coffee or go on a hike or just whatever you can think of. I do have acquaintances, but I feel if I wouldn’t initiate contact they would forget I exist. My collage reunion was a few weeks ago and nobody asked if I was going and no one asked why I didn’t come, because nobody noticed I wasn’t there even though I had talked to a few people a month prior about going with them. Sometimes I think nobody would notice if I disappeared for a month, not even my family because they, like everyone else, have their own life. The only one who would notice I was gone is my boyfriend, but I know he would get over it fast because he has more friends than he can count and his family calls him every day so they are very close. Loosing me wouldn’t be a big loss.
I don’t think I could ever commit suicide and risk hurting my family and my few real friends that live far away. Even though they would probably get over it fast, I just can’t risk it. I wish I just didn’t care. I wish I was never born
Just felt like I had to get this off my chest and tell someone finally even though you don’t know who I am.",31May2019,4
36,"i literally dont know what to do
every single night for the past two weeks i break down
im in a ldr with my boyfriend and every time he goes out with a friend or doesnt call me after i get out of school or some small stupid shit like that i freak out and break down
for literally no logical reason
i feel like we never talk even though we ALWAYS do
i know im becoming toxic to him but i cant figure out how to fix it
ive been trying so so so hard
giving it everyrhing i have and nothing seems to help
i continue to stress and freak out and break down
i get completely numb and stare at my wall for hours or browse reddit
hes there for me; he always has been
but i cant seem to fix myself no matter how hard i try
he says itll get better when im with him in a few months but i honestly cant see myself making it that long
that being said, i dont plan on killing myself. i just feel like that wait is going to push me harder down into this pit that im curled up in
all that i want is to be good for him.and i CANT and its slowly killing me

I've been dealing with depression for 7 years. I'm just now getting help. I have just been informed I have major depressive disorder. 
My mom thinks I'm faking. My therapist have told my parents I should be on medcation from how high my depression scores are....
We scheduled a new appointment but I'm afraid I won't be able to survive the next week without hurting myself or my family. Only my dad seems to care at this point. He doesn't even know what happens most of the time...

i used to be that deep in my depression that i felt completely lost, abandoned, and that nothing was worth anything
right now, though, things are fine. yeah, im 1200 miles away from the one person who knows how to make me.feel better and yeah, i feel like im being emotionally abused by my family, but i dont feel as bad as i used to. 
oN THE OTHER HAND,,,, i can barely find motivation to leave my bed, to shower, or even walk the 5 feet to my closet where i work on my art. i stare at the wall for hours  cry every single night, and feel this obsessive clinginess to my boyfriend. 
but fighting the depression is getting too hard
i think itll be easier to just...succumb to it? not for very long, i suppose, but just for a few days? maybe even just tonight..
its just gotten exhausting trying to make myself be happy and push myself to do things other than lay around and browse my phone endlessly.
is it easier/better to just succumb to the overwhelming sadness for a while or to fight it hard for every single day of your existence?",31May2019,2
39,"I don't come here for help often mainly because I've been having some good days. but the past couple of days have been off.      those scary thoughts are coming more and more often, I have plenty of reasons to be happy I just can't seem to find a reason to smile anymore. even tried going on a hike and getting some air, still nothing.  I really don't know what to do anymore but I had a thought that if I did end up following through with the evil thoughts all of my belongings would be taken by the state and my family would have nothing left from me. it was simple, basically giving all my collectibles to my nephews and nieces, all my real assets, properties, and any money go to my closest living family member. I know it's not official but if that day ever comes it will have to be enough.  I don't have any definite plans so don't worry, I love my family even when it may not feel like it, but I'm trying. I just feel like a disappointment and that ill never really do anything with my life so what's the point, I haven't felt the drive to do anything in a very long time. and I doubt I will ever again.",31May2019,3
