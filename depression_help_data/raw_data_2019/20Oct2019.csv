3,"I’ve been depressed since about age ten. The initial symptoms were nothing concerning considering I was starting to become a pubescent teenager; tired all the time, isolating, I started loosing friends, no suicidal thoughts yet but it was in the making. My family moved to Colorado and I had no real friends for two years. I made one good friend in seventh grade who later tried to bully me. My dad got more violent and angry as time went on. I dropped off the cliff around eighth grade. I remember crying late at night because I couldn’t fall asleep or didn’t want to and have to face the next day so soon. My parents, or rather my mom I should say, noticed and tried to help the way she knew how. I told her I was depressed, and she thought I’d meant a little melancholy. It wasn’t until a year and a half later that she figured out what’d been going on with me. I made it halfway through my freshman year of high school. I missed school frequently, I still didn’t sleep much at all, and I began cutting. My grades dropped and I got my first B since elementary once grades came in. My parents were concerned but they couldn’t understand why everything was falling apart all of a sudden. I was naturally the villain since they didn’t know what else to blame it on. I still panic a little when I think about standing behind my mom and listening to my dad scream vulgarities and insults over the phone about how it’d be easier to give up on me. He apologized but it’s hard to look him in the eyes after everything he’s done over the years. I was mentally dead by then. My plan was to climb into the mountains behind my house and freeze to death before anyone could find me. The morning before I was going to do the deed I skipped class and begged my mom to let me leave. When she didn’t I started thinking of how to accelerate my plan. There was a bridge across town tall enough to end it, about twenty minutes walk away. I walked past the counselor’s office before I was going to leave and paused for a moment. I was desperate, but not for death just for relief from my suffering. Thank god I made the right choice. I don’t remember how I got there but I talked to one of them, he specializes in mental health issues. It didn’t take long for him to call the police and my parents. Of course, I was escorted out of the school and sent to a mental hospital the next day. It took a while, half a year maybe, but I was prescribed antidepressants and I’m on my way to recovery. There’ve been a few rough patches since, one more mental hospital visit and carbon monoxide poisoning, but I’m alive and well. Maybe even happy I guess. I’ve taken up guitar, I’m learning how to sing, I started playing soccer again, and school, for the most part, is going well. During my lowest point I was more willing to die than give life another chance, but I’m glad I’m alive now. I’m not depression free yet, but it’s only a matter of time. Good luck to you all, it really does get better.",20Oct2019,82
4,"I’ve spent my whole life wanting one thing and that’s simple kindness, I never get it and I thought fine I can deal with that but I can’t anymore. I’ve always heard act like your self and people will like you, but that’s not true because no one likes me either way. Fine I thought maybe if I be what they want I’ll get some kindness outa them. Nope. Nothing I’ve ever done said or given has ever earned the slightest bit of kindness out of anyone, only pitty and meaningless gestures. And the worst part is the only advice or “comfort” I ever get telling anyone how I feel is a “well it gets a lot worse so deal with it” or “it could be a lot worse”. Was I born destined to be hated? Is this just my condition my curse to always live like this? Why. What can I do to be better to feel better like I’m not just here to be slightly more worthful than a rat. I don’t want popularity I don’t want anything but simple kindness or appreciation for my effort. But the world has decided I don’t deserve it. I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore. I can barely think straight. I’ve run out of tears to cry and I’ve run out of hate to feel. I can’t appear upset either because everyone around me just thinks I’m gonna hurt someone. Why does this have to happen to me. I feel like I’m going insane because everyone I talk to try’s to convince me I’m overeacting. what do I even do at this point, I’ve lost all faith I’m my religion, myself and people to do any better. I just feel so lost. I’m sorry this was so long and to be truthful I might delete it later but I’m running out of places to turn",20Oct2019,2
5,"I don’t actively feel sad. I can sort of manage sad.

What’s bothering me is there’s things I *want* to do, but I’m just so unmotivated to do anything.

It sucks.

I want to draw, I tried but it isn’t working. 

I want to work on my programming project that I’m really excited about, but I can’t manage working on it for more than 10 minutes.

Same thing with this edit I’m making.

Normally video games are my go-to when anything like this happens, but I can’t get into any of them.

I hate this.",20Oct2019,44
6,"so for a while now i haven’t been happy. most times i feel nothing at all, even though i should be excited or happy or whatever. i’ve dealt with depression really bad twice before, and it doesn’t feel like this. i don’t even cry anymore, i physically can’t cry. i want to talk to my mom (i’m underage and live at home) but i feel like a disappointment to her already. i don’t have hobbies because they don’t make me happy; my friends are the only thing that makes me happy, and i don’t hang out with them after school often for assorted reasons. what’s the best way to say i want to go back to therapy without going into much detail? also if anyone knows what might be wrong and what to do, lmk please, i’m really feeling stuck.",20Oct2019,4
7,"In the beginning of last summer (2019) i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, however my mom believes i’ve been depressed for the past 4 years. I started seeing a therapist whom i actually felt comfortable with, however i ghosted her (called out of appointments and missed some) as well as all my friends. For the past year my sleep has declined to only getting a few hours at night and napping throughout the day, as well as only having one meal or snack a day. My sexual desire is non existent, literally. I get horny sometimes but never enough to do anything (which is not like me). I’ve started trying meditation and going to the gym but even after a few tries i gave up. last week i had a breakdown in the gym and had to leave after only being there for 15 minutes. I felt so stupid and worthless at the gym but now i feel even more stupid and worthless for not even trying to help myself. I know it’s getting worse but i never have the energy or motivation to fix my depression. 

Long story short, i’m very depressed and want to get better but once i get to trying to help myself (like working out or seeing someone) i just give up which makes me feel even worse. I’m not sure what i’m asking, but if anyone has any idea what i could do to help myself??",20Oct2019,1

9,"Hi I'm 19f currently studying and working. In a nutshell I have lots of different issues. Lately thoughts have gotten really intense and it's all stopping me from basic things like doing work/cleaning my room/eating/showering and everything like that. Been through a messy breakup 6/mo ago but starting to date this really lovely guy who's making me feel a bit better, although whenever he's complimenting me/showing affection I feel really guilty and horrible and honestly before I see him I feel sick even though i really like him? I can't sleep at all and I just want to curl up in a ball and do nothing forever. I'm really frustrated with myself for not getting things done at uni and skipping classes I feel so lazy but I have absolutely no motivation. Parents get frustrated with my laziness. Past abusive relationship is getting in the way of new ones and affecting me on a day-to-day basis. Don't know what to do anymore. Tried professional help but I don't want to go on medication and I end up skipping sessions and cancelling. I think I just needed to get this stuff off my chest. Just really disgusted with myself right now.",20Oct2019,1
10,"So awhile ago I made a couple of post asking what I should do about a girl that sexually assaulted me in the middle of class. Well something else related to that came up (or so I think). The first person I told and cried to about that whole ordeal is now an exfriend, who gets his friends to basically bully me at school. So the other day one of his friends grabs me the SAME EXACT WAY as that girl grabbed me, he pinned me and whispered into my ear the same way that girl did to me (minus the kissing). Ever since then I can’t help but think that my exfriend put him up to it. I went to a teacher but nothing was done, the kid who did it to me is the superintendent’s son. So ever since I’ve felt so disgusting, I find myself crying when I see them I feel so unsafe at school. But most importantly I feel disgusted in myself, I feel dirty, like I let this happen, is it my fault? I feel like if I just ended it all I would feel as dirty. What do I do, I’m scared?",20Oct2019,12
11,"As of now I’m a 17 year old who is homeschooled because I’ve been bullied in the past and looked down on due to how my face looks. I keep on being told to get out more but it’s not that easy because now I believe that I’m too ugly to meet friends or approach a girl. I’ve been called attractive by various friends of my mom and some family members. Since I’ve been called ugly,been laughed at my strangers, and more I believe that there’s no point of me being here. I’m never going to have good friends nor am I going to come across a girl that is interested in me.",20Oct2019,1
12,"So I have always had a lack of ambition and a drive to do things. I am failing in collage, my dream to be a YouTuber- (not famous just want to make a living playing video games because that's what I love) -seems less and less feasible by the day, I am fat and ugly, my stress over life gives me panic attacks daily (borderline hourly), I wish I was gay so that the only person who has ever expressed any desire to be with me romantially is my best friend who is gay, I have a high iq but am not a smart person (I don't think my actions through even given the time and opportunity), I am a flake with no impulse control and more stubborn than most people I know.

Today is my birthday and at 12pm my first thought was ""God it would be great if I either didn't exist or won the lottery""

Life is relatively pretty great aside from what I do that makes it worse and finances are the only thing holding me back from enjoying life I have two great friends and a supportive family and apart from a monitizable skill or trait that is everything you need for a good life.

Long story short I have a bleak future in terms of quality of life, but only have the future to worry about (5-10 years down the line or so).",20Oct2019,1
13,"This past week I (F16) have been feeling really down. It's been on and off for the past 7 months after I broke up with my girlfriend, but the lows only lasted two, three days tops. I'm not trying to self diagnose but Im worried I might be developing something. I'm not proud of it but I've been drinking as well, everyday for a little over a week. I have support, my friends know all of this and offer to help and talk to me but it just makes me uncomfortable and like I'm a nuisance. We make 'packs' to stop drinking but I always end up breaking them. Ive been missing school too, I can't find myself to get up and socialize with people. Is there a way to find out, rather than just 'talking to a therapist'? I don't want to get worked up about nothing but I seriously feel awful. Thanks in advance.",20Oct2019,3
14,"# 

I’m a 22y/o male and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didn’t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family.

I’m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. I’m in my 4th year of uni and I’ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, I’ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and I’m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so I’m going to talk about my year and how’s it’s been the worst and best year I’ve had in a very long time.

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldn’t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who I’ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and I’ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live.

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our “flat” (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldn’t, that it wouldn’t work out and that the people I’m moving in with aren’t who I think they are and it won’t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly.

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me.

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress.

(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus)

I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space.

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them.

I lost my two best friends, and my brother.

It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore.

Sorry for such a scattered story, there’s so much that’s happened that I tried to fill all the important parts and I’m writing this while crying and have realised it might not make sense or it be all jumbled.",20Oct2019,1
15,"So I’m not sure why should I even being complaining or finding myself in this situation again. Its just being a roller coaster of emotions. I being in depression for i would say 10 years if not more. Was fully diagnosed a few years ago after my first attempt, which landed me in a hospital during for sometime. After that i had 2 more attempts, and lately the depression has gone so bad that i am reconsidering again, its just idk what to so, i try to get myself busy, and such, therapy unfortunately is off the list, as i dont feel like going, or bothering making sure im okay (my last therapist quit on me without warning). So yeah, I havent look for help or anything, and i started to notice im living careless again. Im not sure what to do, im not sure if i should just move on, or give up completely. Since lately the person i trusted and made me feel less alone just stab me in the back. I guess i just may need a place to hide sometime. (If this was the wrong place, sorry)",20Oct2019,2

19,"I was doing better, going to the gym almost daily, eating clean, yoga,meditating, A student and basically just in a good routine and super goal oriented. Really felt like I was handling the life curveballs and was even socializing a bit more. 
Over the past year I’ve gained 30+ pounds, constantly stressed, irritable and tired. No appetite all day and binge eating at night sometimes, extremely poor time management, confusion, brain fog, always late and always just sad. So sad that it’s become hard to hide. 
It takes me over an hour to drag myself out of bed most days and then I’m rushing to be on time. I’m always behind the clock now. Laundry is not done, emails and dishes piling up. I completely failed an exam last week. I barely passed another and am currently behind on all my coursework. I sit down to study and can’t get into the material. My memory is horrible now, everything I review is like for the first time. I am so lost in class. 
Yesterday was supposed to be the get back on track/caught up day and it didn’t happen. Going for a walk/taking a shower and running 3 local errands took up the entire day?! Got home late and exhausted, didn’t study at all. Felt like I couldn’t think, my brain was like under water. 
I am watching now as all my hard work over the past few years is slipping away, falling apart and I am just letting this depression drown me. Am struggling to come up with the energy to fight it away.
I am a college senior and am not only supposed to be doing coursework, but am feeling the pressure to network and get a job lined up after graduation. 

I feel so disconnected. I am so disappointed in myself that I’m not fighting harder to get back on track. I lay in bed at night terrified of everything I have to do to just catch up. Everyday I feel like a deer in the headlights and it’s exhausting. Can’t  seem to shake this overwhelming need to hide away under the blanket. I really thought I had turned a corner and found ways to manage my depression and now I feel like I am at square one again and actively sabotaging myself.

21,"Sorry not really a confession but I just feel so sad and needed to get this off my chest.

I’m only fifteen but since I was eleven I have had depression and anxiety for months at a time then I would feel better and positive for ages, but then it comes back and I feel like shit everyday, I cry so much over anything for hours. I cut my thighs to try and feel better, now I have urges to cut every time I feel super anxious.

I feel extremely anxious when we go to peoples houses just because of the thought of having to talk to them, I never talk to our family friends because I’m scared of being ridiculed and I just don’t know what to say, mum thinks I’m just being shy, and every time we get home from outings I cry in the car and then cry myself to sleep when I get home. I just cry and hug myself in the fetal position while my breathing is really fast and I pull at my hair, I think it’s anxiety attacks. Now I just isolate myself from any social situation possible, including school, I’m barely passing because my attendance is so bad, I fake sickness to my mum when I’m anxious to get off school.

I have only like four friends at school and I would never want to tell any of them about this and none of my teachers either. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone I feel so alone and worthless. On my birthday a couple days ago I cried all day and slumped around the house because I felt like I wasn’t worth celebrating and wasting all the money my parents spend on me.

I feel like an asshole and I like I just let everyone down. I don’t know what to do but I don’t want to tell anyone because I’m so embarrassed.",20Oct2019,59
22,"Sorry, if no one cares but I really just need something or somebody to vent to because I don't have anybody that will listen.

I love my job a lot. I'm severely unmotivated to do anything, but I enjoy working. When I do go to work, it's the best part of my day. Today is Sunday. I hate working on Sundays, because imo Sunday is the best day to relax, even if I have school tomorrow. I'm just doing 3 hours of overtime to help my mom out a little more.

So I work in a call center. You don't have to work in a call center to know how hell-ish it is. Yes, I've served my time working here. Just got a customer who I was on the phone with for an hour. He said his issue was that his account was compromised. I confirmed multiple times that it was the issue and it was. I took a look at it, saw nothing wrong and wanted to ensure he is the account owner. When I did, he spent 30 minutes, hearing me talk but not listening to what I was saying.

He misinterpreted everything I said and spent 30 minutes trying to argue with me and insult me under his breath about our company's process which is beyond my control but go off ig. Then, he went on to suddenly say that his account isn't compromised and assumed our system was faulty or I wasn't doing something correctly or listening to him even though you said it was your issue but go off ig.

Then when I finally got him to understand and resolve his issue, he told me 'No offense, but I hope I never speak to you again.' And hung up in my face. Well cool, fuck you too. That was a nightmare for me, I hope I never get to speak to you as well. Cool.

I love my job, but sometimes I really hate the customers. They're a pain in my backside, and all it does is makes me more freaking depressed. I need this job, but I can't wait until I start college so I can leave.",20Oct2019,5
23,"**tl;dr: how to talk to spouse about current depressive episode when he resorts to talking down at me?**

So, to clarify the double-depressive adjective in the title, I have dysthymia. Recently, I was let go from a job in August (was there almost two years, temp to permanent, firm downsizing due to project leaving) and while I was able to get another job very quickly (with my former firm’s help) and proactively looking for another job so I wouldn’t be unemployed for longer than I would have to be, I think being let go from my previous job hit me a lot harder than I thought. Throw in the season change, and I’m struggling to stay productive above and beyond what has to be done—go to job, work hard so I’ll get hired on permanent again, do chores around house. 

My spouse has been working himself hard because he has night classes related to his apprenticeship. He works outside as a contractor, but twice a week he has night classes. He spends almost all of his time at home in the living room studying with the TV going in the background. 

While he’s studying, if I so much as sit down at the computer or go into another room, he invariably follows me to ask what I’m doing. He has this grand idea that while I’m just working now (finished my 2nd associate’s this past December and taking a break before resuming school to finish my bachelor’s and maybe go on to law school), I have to pick up doing the chores. Fine, I still expect a tiny bit of help but I agree. 

It’s been hard to stay motivated working, and I’ve been hit with just bone-deep exhaustion when I come home. I do what I can, like keeping the dishes clean and making dinner, and on weekends I try to get the laundry done and put away and try to fo some maintenance cleaning like vacuuming carpets, cleaning the litterboxes completely, and trying to keep every available surface from being taken over with clutter. 

Sometimes I nap, hoping that will reset my mood. Sometimes it works. Sometimes I wake up and feel worse than I did before, so I go back to sleep hoping I’ll reset. 

He confronts me by yelling at me to wake up and telling me stuff needs to be done, but when I ask about anything else he wants done, he doesn’t give clear feedback at all. On days where I’ve stayed napping because I feel absolutely wretched, he calls me lazy and tells me I’m doing nothing out of spite. I’ve tried explaining before about the dysthymia, ADHD (diagnosed late at 34), and anxiety (surprise! also diagnosed at 34), but he tells me I have to just do things and not make excuses, even though I’m at a place now where I’m managing the conditions better, they still really take it out of me. I can’t explain it without him immediately dismissing me and telling me “life is hard” (which I get).

How do I communicate to him that following me around and telling me what to do is not helpful, and that my conditions, while managed better now, can still throw in curveballs? I’d like to tell him, but he gets down to “I do this and you do nothing” before I can fully explain? (Which means I often shut down)",20Oct2019,6
24,"I don't really know why I'm even on here but I guess I just wanna talk a little. I've been feeling so down. im not concerned though because this has been going on for a couple years now. Ill get super down for a month or two and then ill get randomly inspired to go around and get my life together. The inspiration never sticks around for more than a week though. Recently ive been having these days where I get really anxious and antsy. I remember last week I went for a midnight sprint around the neighbourhood because I needed to go somewhere or do something. but now im just going through my thing where I don't wanna do anything. idk everything is just so cold and meaningless, it feels slow if that makes sense. recently, me and my man broke up, but to be honest im not so sad about the fact its over, more because I just feel crappy because I always fuck shit up. seriously,, I haven't been able to hold down anything ever because im just that pathetic. I just feel so stuck in this mindset. I feel as if my feelings aren't valid enough because i'm only 16. I push everything off me because apparently im going through a phase. I honestly cant side with that though because I started feeling off in the 5th or 6th grade. im so childish for this but I remember feeling down when I turned 16 because I just couldn't believe I still feel like this. I just wanna feel good about everything. Ive been doing drugs to make everything seem irrelavent and it does help. I just also know its not good for me and I should stop because its not healthy and addictive. I don't know,,, a bigger part of me doesn't care because I don't really care what happens to me. I don't wanna sound stupid and dark, but a lot of the time I feel like things would be easier to just check out of all this. I kinda wish I had it worse so I could give a valid reason to why id wanna end this. I mean, my school life is fine, I have friends, people would consider me ""pretty"", and I have a roof over my head. I feel so ungrateful for everthing because I have a lot. I just still feel alone and a waste of time. Nothing ever sticks around because im a toxic person to be with. I push everyone out because im scared to lose them. I don't want them to leave me so ill leave first I guess. or ill get super insecure and do some dumb shit like call my boyfriend at midnight, high, bitching about how he cheated. im just so stupid, I know whats right for me but instead I numb myself and do whatever. I wish I could talk to my therapist or maybe my mom. whenever I try to talk to her she explains how her problems are actually relevant and im just being dramatic. maybe i am just being dramatic and selfish though. lowkey itd be nice to just leave everything because everything is so exhausting. ive considered leaving but I usually feel like its the right decision when im going through my anxious or antsy phase. I don't like all this at this,, and at this point I already know what to expect. right now I feel really down so im gonna feel it out for a little and cut everything off, then im gonna go through my thing where im getting high for days. eventually ill have my stupid self destructive breakdown and get careless to the point where im truly considering killing myself. after that i'll just go through one of my other things. I hate saying all this because I don't wanna seem edgy. I feel like im too serious sometimes and I just think way too deeply. I would never fake or exaggerate my feelings because I feel gross just thinking about being attention seeking. its selfish and not valid. anyways sorry for all this. I just wanted to let a few things off my chest.",20Oct2019,1

29,"Hey

I'm a 15 year old girl from Switzerland. I'm in high school and I've been having intense depression phases for 2 and a half years now. It all started because of our strange family, my dad is never home and always frustrated, my mom is pressuring me even though I'm already pressuring myself. But I don't wanna go in to deep so my grandpa commitet suicide so depression could be passed on eventually. And yeah I had a pretty bad time because I had a 16yo boyfriend with 13 who kinda made me feel bad it was one of those internet relation ships since I was a quiet kid and never got any compliments from anyone so I was searching for love like that but he used my emotionally dependend character and told me to dress different, don't see my friends and stuff. My mom found out about it and reacted in some kinda wrong way she just took my phone and everything and left me feel ashamed and humiliated in front of my family and her friends. I was in my room alone for days actually summer holidays. After that the schoolstress got worse and my depressed phase got worse too. It was a hard time and I had only one person who kinda supported me but she had her own struggles. So now this just went on and on I started cutting myself and having suicidal thoughts I can't cope with stress and I take medication to calm down. But those are episodes of like 3 days where I'm really bad then like 2 days where I'm good then it starts again. So why I'm here is because I've been starting to think that this is all in my head, just imagination and craving for attention like an attention whore. I really don't know what to think I'm so confused with my feeling and don't wanna seek help because my family would go crazy and I would be ashamed if they told me I'm just imagining that because of some kinda attention missing. I'm sorry for my bad English but it's late and I'm tired.

Is this really just imagination, am I doing it again now with writing this post?

Also those people making depression to a trend make me feel insecure since I don't like people making things to a trend who are so goddamn serious.",20Oct2019,1
30,"Hi, i'm a 20 years boy. I'm going to be as specific as I can so here is my story (english is my second or third language). I don't expect a lot of people to read this because it will be a long story which I will write anyway at least as a journal which I heard helps as well. I'll add timestamps to help my incoherency.

I recently figured out I have a depression that lasted for about 2 years (around sept 2017 - present time) and still going and it doesn't matter how much I try, I can't get myself out of it. I guess there are multiple causes of my depression because at that time it hit me from every aspect of life, I lost everything I thought I had and was left ""naked"". I don't know if these are things that typically happen to teenagers, but they happened to me, and I took them very personally. At this point I don't even know if I'm bitching about stupid things or I really got hit by something. Anyway, It changed me completely or... **I would say it somehow created me or slowly uncovered the real me**. I really don't remember when was the last time I felt some happiness, except the event I have written below at the end of the story. I'm specifically interested about the uncovering **the** **real self** i wrote below. If someone knows anything related to that, I would like to read more.

**Short self-description:** I can tell with no arrogance that I was always smarter then average. I was the genius kid in primary school and middle school. Introvert. I never had real social skills, and was pretty isolated. But I was a rich kid and the smartest in the room so extroverts adopted me really fast (yes, they were usually using me for self-gain). I was aware of my lack of social skills and in the 8-th grade it was my first time I tried and managed to have conversation with a girl from class for about an hour, while walking on our way to school. I mean I used to speak with my classmates, but only about something specifically. Never had long meaningful conversations, except boys. I had some good friends. But I was terrible with girls. There was one girl I liked and I never could make the first move, she liked me aswell btw. I was super anxious about this, so I only talked to her on social-media. It didn't get any further. After a about 2 years of only messaging I asked her out several times, but in an awful way and it didn't work out. It was all before 10 grade. I addressed a lot my lack of social skills and I managed to make a lot of friends there, which is how I got a girlfriend later on. After the 9 grade I changed my school and moved to one of the best high-schools in my country. There was where my genius collapsed. Everyone was smart and scared at the same time because of the high school requirements. I never had good grades after that. It took me 1 year and something to make some friends and to get social involved. In my 12 grade I got the girlfriend i'm writing right below.

**Depression story:** Here is what happened 2 years ago:

\-**I had a 2 year relationship** (aug 2016 - aug 2018) which started to become extremely toxic which ended 1 year later in rage;

\-**I finished one of the best high-schools** in my small country (2017) and decided not to go to university for 1 year in order to better decide what I want to do with my future, so I started a job at my family's small company as a helper manager or smth like that. Long story short, I was helping my father at what whatever was he doing.

\-At the time **I started working with my father**(sept 2017 - July 2018), he got in some serious financial problems, and my way of taking things for granted, everyone being nice to me because I was rich vanished. I had to contemplate my self being.

**How did the trouble begin?**

**The stupid me in a relationship part.** I had a pretty nice relationship with that girl the first year and I was into the old fashioned way of serious relationships. I loved her the way a teenager does and I didnt recognize the moment when I had to breakup, and instead of 1 year of a nice relationship with a breakup, i had a second year of nightmare. She became distant, I felt unwanted. But as I didn't have social skills and I was backed up by money, I was delusional, and didn't breakup. I didn't breakup mainly because i wanted to have sex with her and I waited 1.5 years for that. We finally had it and the relationship didn't get any much better, contrary to my expectations. The second year of realtionship was very confusing. I knew something doesn't feel right, but it was that time I started to work with my family and didn't have enough time to figure it out. Also I had no evidence of her doing something wrong and i left things how they were. After a while, I just couldnt bear it anymore and broke up.

**Here is the drama (betrayed by everyone) :** Shortly after the break up (aug 2018) 2 of her girl friends got in contact with me and told me all the shit she did behind my back. It wouldnt have been a big deal if the shit she did behind my back wasn't with people that I considered friends and best friends. Turn out she was a cheater, lier and didn't care about me at all, used to lie me even while crying to prove she doesn't lie, even though I was getting some suspicious half-evidence. I learned that she was seeing and at least once kissed a guy who I was considering to be my best friend for like 2 years (I had a lot of common interests with him, we were very alike and worked together on a project). It was like a double betrayal. She cheated on me with several guys, was desvirginated at some party after I went home (after one year of relationship). There is another guy who I considered to be my best friend for most of my life, I knew him since kindergarten, were in the same class for 9 years, sitted at the same desk in middle-school (i went to another high-school after). Turns out he became her emotional support after the fight I had with her after breakup and now they are still dating (She still cheats though, the guy doesn't know). I was betrayed by everyone, and by everyone I mean the fact that a lot of people knew what's going on and no one tried to light me up. After that, I realised that actually I have no one to talk to. And they really were people I considered closest to me and they were the only people I was really trusting. Probably here is where I completely stopped trusting people. The only close friends I have right know are 2 guys I met in high-school. I'm still in close touch with them, even though they are studying in different cities/countries. I have to mention that they are high-standards people. Both of them are extremely disciplined, hard-working, rational, and i'm sure they are going to be super successful, and usually they help me to get over my dark moments).

**Meanwhile working with my father (insane amount of stress)**(sep 2017 - July 2018)... I was working with my father, who turned out to be an extremely toxic boss. I figured out I never knew him. He never talked to me or supported me like a normal father would. In fact, i was educated by my extremely soft mother. I'm not delusional. All my relatives have the same opinion about him and her. He was only telling me his bussiness stories and how successful he is. In fact, he never was. At the same time he got in some serious financial trouble with his business, the money ended and I went from rich kid to ""question my existence"" kid. It hit me by making me question myself what is my personality based on, because I was used to taking things for granted just because I had money and everyone would like to befriend me. This is when I started teaching myself creating websites in order to do some freelancing work. My father was is an extremely impulsive person, I am extremely calm and rational. We were 2 opposites. Because of his way of impulsively managing things, I was getting more and more stressed with the work. In a pretty short period of time **I started sleeping 12-13 hours per night** and didn't feel rested (it was at the same time my girlfriend started being distant and at the same time I started having depression symptoms). After almost an year working with him I had a **stress crisis**, it was something like an **epileptic seizure**, but I was conscious and half an hour later I ended up in hospital, had to take opioids. My father still didn't do anything to address that. By his way of thinking, ""My nerves are as weak as my mother's"". I have to mention that my mother consistently takes opioids in order to cope with the stress my father creates. He is not physically violent, he never was, but he is extremely loud, and almost always raging (exactly my opposite). Luckily, after that, I moved abroad to study, were, unluckily, **my biggest and most cronic depression episode started**. (October 2018, right after breakup, after cheating and betrayal from almost everyone I knew, after toxic father) And it was right after all the relationship drama, betraying friends, and toxic father. I was barely sleeping at night, no way of getting asleep before 3 am for half an year, absolute chaos, couldn't talk to anyone(there was only one friend that used to call me from time to time for what I will always be grateful), I have no idea how I got past these months. I couldn't get over anything. I didn't know I need help. The only thing that kept me from having serious suicidal thoughts was the voice in my head that was telling me that I still have potential and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That voice i think is the critical side of my personality that would keep me afloat in the darkest moments of my life by reminding me that there will be better days, or maybe I was too much of a coward to end it all. I was desperate.

**Here is more about my current self**. I'm a smarter than average person except the social thing. I am student right know in my second year learning economic informatics, studying abroad and I'm the best at programming lessons in my group while doing considerably less effort than my colleagues, I mean I barely study at all because of my depression. I never had social skills and still have no idea how to get along with poeple from my class, but don't get me wrong, I worked as a freelancer after I taught myself developing websites and still have very good relations with my clients. **I can't get along with people** that I have no common interests with, i won't ever speak to them if I don't have a specific reason to and I'm talking about my current colleagues. There is no one I can get along with. I was like this all my life, since I was a kid. I tried to contemplate why I am like this numerous times, but no result. I simply think I'm better than they are and I think they aren't the same level I am. And by that I mean that there is a voice in my head arrogantly telling me I'm better than others and there is the other voice criticizing it and reminind me that I won't live up to those expectations of myself any time soon because of my depression. I'm not arrogant by saying this, it's just what I think, I keep my humility while i'm around others and i play the nice guy, I'm just aware that I can do thing others can not.

Also I still don't know what I mean by ""same level as me"". The only explanation I have for myself is that there are very few people with whom I can get along and who can understand things with a greater perspective than usual.

It's my second year at this university and there is only one girl I met with whom I could really get along and speak ""at the same level"". **She is a super balanced person**, lives up to standards that look impossible for me to have because of depression and last year she had one of the highest average grades.

**I was trying to discipline myself** in order to get better and get myself out of dark. I worked as a freelancer because my family **hardly could support me anymore** and I didn't even want to request money from them, but I did from time to time as I was literally starving. I developed some wordpress websites, had some good clients. My dream job was and still is to be a programmer. The rational and logical way of thinking that this job requires is completely suitable for me, but I had to learn a lot in order to get such a job. Therefore, at that time I was mainly doing design, which turned out to be something I hated so much it would make me burn out in a couple of hours, but I had no choice. I didn't expect that doing design work would make me more vulnerable to episodes of depression.

(**October 2018 - Jan 2019**) **After 4 months of severe depression** I started to force myself to work on something. I was programming my day for productivity. It lasted 2 weeks and those were some of the most productive periods of time I ever had. By that time I had a complete understanding of business plans, how to make one, and actually made one. I did that by studying one specialisez book and a lot of internet resources. Right after these 2 weeks I collapsed. Lately, and by that I mean about 1 month ago I discovered I was self-sabotaging myself. After every try of getting better I finish up by punishing myself, procastinating, not carrying, and making myself to turn things in such a way so I would feel desperate.

**(March, 2019)** Meanwhile I descovered **Jordan Peterson**, and started reading some books like ""**No more Mr. Nice guy**"" which was exactly my description, ""**Iron John**"", ""**4 archetypes of men**"" etc. I got insights about the **masculine psychology** which explained to me why all of these things happened to me, I understood why i got betrayed, why my father was like that and everythhing. But it didn't motivate me trust people anymore, there were no arguments to sustain it. **Apparently, I started to get better**. I started dating that girl I was talking about. I started taking care of myself, doing more things to myself, exercising, eating much healthier, cooking for myself, made friends at the hostel I lived (which by the way didn't make me any happier. I was feeling like i'm stagnating, pausing my self discovery while losing a lot of time with people I don't really have a lot to learn from). I was desperate to get better. Back in March I applied to a marketing training at my university, where we made teams and worked on a project. I had previous experience in marketing since I was developing websites and I had more knowledge in the field than the average and some of them I barely talked to referred to me as being a genius. It was then when I realised that marketing is burning me out just like designing websites does as it requires the same way of thinking. There were a lot of people, but I couldn't get close to anyone, not even with the people from my team I worked with. I don't know what's the catch with that because I was being myself there, i was pretty happy, not really depressed, but it wasn't fulfilling. I felt like these people could never understand. Also at the same time I had to work on a big website, which completely burned me out. And another episode of depression kicked in. I couldn't provide enough of myself to the relationship and broke up after 1 month (still friends btw, I still appreciate her more than any girl I have ever met), couldn't get myself together, failed 1 exam\*\*. I was punishing myself again, self-sabotaging, making me feel desperate.\*\* Even though I collapsed, I was able to keep disciplining myself for more than a month, which was a record, I forced it as hard as I could, and I really have to mention that in this period of time I was able to solve an insane amount of personal problems, made an amount of money that allowed me to buy a new powerful laptop, a phone, and still had money to party all summer. All that in one month and half.

I have to mention about my decision to work as a freelancer. I didn't want to lose time by working on some job that only required my time. I decided that my time is somewhat more important and used it to learn creating websites.

**After that specific collapse (Half April - July)**, I was still partly trying to take care of myself, trying to figure out ways of being more of myself, to embrace my wild instincts and the masculine self which I never did and to get easier with myself. By that I mean I was always rational, I was never impulsive and i was repressing my feelings with cowardness which I thought was rationality, I used to let people walk me over.

**(July - September 2019)** So here the summer begins with me still depressed. I went home, had tons of free time to complete some programming tutorials i planned earlier and to get better. Of course i didn't look at them even once. But the good part is that a lot of my **friends from high-school I still trusted** were home as well and we partied a lot. It didn't improve my situation, but... **There was one party** with 5 of my high-school friends and 2 girls that were friends with one of them. I tried to be as much of myself as I could and I tried to express my masculine self as much as I could. So I got drunk, and I mean really drunk. It felt like the best thing that happened to me in the last 2 years. I felt some sort of happiness I don't rememeber feeling for a very long time. Even if i was drunk as fuck after drinking more than 15 shots **I never felt more in control of myself** in my enitre life. **I could perfectly embrace my masculine self** and my rational self it was the moment **I really felt alive**. Currently, I'm pretty good at controlling myself while being drunk, and there is no chance to make the wild man from inside to take control so perhaps this is why I could feel the perfect balance. Even if my friends tried to make it out with those girls, I had both of them interested in me while not even trying. One of the girls just kissed me out of nowhere while dancing. And I really didn't even try to make it out with any of them because I was not interested. I still can't explain that episode of pure happiness, it felt like heaven, I was feeling that I have all power I need to to anything I want with my life, i felt the alpha male from inside, I felt that I could get along with anybody, while of course keeping my filter of ""not being at the same level"", but just cassually making friends, I was feeling like the perfect man I was always to be or better to say **to be the self i'm trying to uncover from inside,** because I know that the person I was in touch with when being drunk was the real me, the broken and reborn self. Sadly, I couldn't reproduce it while not being drunk. There were some other parties but I didn't get that drunk, therefore I didn't feel the hidden self just as intense. I can't get along with girls because I'm never living the present moment, I'm ambiguous.

**(October - 2019) Here I am**. University started again, finally started to learing more of programming. I'm getting better at it, and i'm getting better really fast. Fast enough to get a job in about on month. After about 3 months of depression I did pretty good at university for those 3 weeks, managed my time well enough. Started to have a high protein breakfast in order to deal with anxiety, which by the way worked better then I have expected. Besides uni, my current program consists of doing about 3 - 4 hours per day of learning programming. I have time for more, but for some reason I can not bear more than that. I don't hate it, **i enjoy what I do, but it's exhausing, it burnes me out slowly**. I have some assigments to do, but the thought of doing them is killing me. It's hard for me to do what I like to do(programming, but programming in real life applications. The way of programming we learn at university is far from giving me a chance to get employed) but taking time to do smth not exactly related to what I want to do right know(getting a job, learning programming) is stressing me out too hard to bear. And I sarted to collapse again. I feel how I'm slowly punishing myself, procastinating and getting less and less care of myself. After 3 weeks of doing pretty good at uni, I completely missed the last 2 days of lectures because I couldn't get myself in a mood to go there. **Everything gets too painful again.**

**Some of the reasons I can't accomplish basic daily goals are:**

\- **Sleep problems**. It's my biggest problem. It doesn't matter how early I go to sleep or how tired I am, I still fall asleep after 00.00. It can get me hours to get asleep if I go to bed earlier. It doesn't matter how much I sleep. I tried sleeping from 6 to 10 hours. Still yawning all day and getting tired way too fast. Even if I get tired, I can't get afternoon naps because I just can't fall asleep;

\- **Mood changing**. My moods can change really fast. I'm pretty sure I didn't become bipolar, but my moods vary a lot.

\- **Lack of focus**. It's basic.

\- **Social activities, talking to people.** During my dark times when I was freelancing, it would take me days to call that client for most basic things. It was triggering such an anxiety and such pain that **I was trembling for hours**. I even lost a customer because I could make myself make a call for 2 or 3 weeks. And the calls where just to inform some basic things, I was actually doing pretty great as a web designer.

\- **Can't stop thinking about the past**, everywhere, always.

I also have all the other **depression symptoms**, but those are the most significant.

Right know I'm waiting for to get a job. I am going to apply in about 1 month. I hope that that evnironment would help my mental health, but at the same time **I fear that I would not be able to bear a 8 hours** a day job and doing uni at the same time. I desperately need a job because a lot of anxiety and depression comes from the fact that I'm not fully independent, and I hate to request money from my family. I want to rent a flat, and live alone. Deep inside I feel I need time being alone. If getting a job would not make my mental health get any better, I will go to a psychologist/psychoterapist. I didn't go yet because I can't aford one (I'm not a hypocrite, I had money a while ago when I was partying that summer. But I really thought it was the end of my depression). Also, I'm kinda getting pleasure from my isolation, I don't won't any people ""who do not understand"" in my life. And I do not know what I mean by that, I just know there are such high quality people. I find them from time to time, people with limitless minds.

As I said earlier, **the only thing keeping me away from suicidal thoughts** or away from something darker than what currently is, is the critical side of my personality that judges me and finally tells me I still got potential, that there is a fix, that there are books about that and that someday it will get better, but until then, I'm self-destructive. Sometimes I see a light at the end of the tunnel by thinking of the big family I will build and I will be able to trust, but it's too damn away from the present time...

I identified my critical self as being a really strong Magician archetype, which allows me to survive in the darkness.

31,"For the last year or so I have been so depressed and in horror of my future. There is literally nothing coming my way, and I’m fully aware of this and I’m only 15. People tell me that because I’m too young I don’t know what I’m talking about. The same people tell me that me being white makes me evil and that I live to hate others. I can’t take anymore constant abuse and harassment from people in school or online telling me how I’m racist, homophobic or sexist. I would never do these things. What am I supposed to tell them?  One girl killed her sold because she was told by the blm group in our school that she was the reason segregation was a thing and because people would always call her a new-nazi, for her blonde hair and blue eyes. She was 18. I just want to give these people that hate me a hug and convince them that I’m not who they think I am. But every time I try and do something to fix my problems, people either criticize me as usual or claim I am just showing them my “white tears” and that my privilege is going to kill them. 

At the same time, I know that the people who hate me (ONLY BECAUSE OF MY SKIN COLOR) would rejoice in my death. I don’t want them to win. I don’t want anyone to win because there nothing to fight over. Why does this world have to be filled with hatred for so many different people. 

I try not to drag people down with me when I come to terms with the real society i live in because they’ll think I’m just an incel, a crazy person, or a classic white supremacist. 

Please be considerate to everyone and know that you should never be racist or discriminatory to any race (ANY RACE). 

Side note: I am aware of most subs that make fun of deep or sad posts like this for laughs. Please don’t post this there it’s very very dehumanizing when you are put on a platform so people will laugh at you.

32,"I created this account because I wanted to post and havent shared any of this with anyone...not sure if anyone can relate...

I haven't been diagnosed with depression but more frequently now I've been thinking about suicide. What it would entail, who it would hurt, when would be the right time...I've had many period of 'overhanging dark cloud' days and recently they're becoming longer. 

For background, I have a non-life threatening bone disease that until recently had been manageable but it is degenerative and expected to get worse. But over the last few months the pain has increased and continuously interferes with living - the pain requires me to stay at home and rest. I just don't want to live with this pain. I can't withstand more surgery (I've had 7)...I am in my late 20s and I am starting to realize the days of my pain being dormant will be few and far between. I don't want to continue living a life where my illness defines everything around me. I can't stop thinking about planning for the moment when this is all too much.

I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't want to...I just haven't been able to get past how much I'd hurt my family if I ever went through with it...",20Oct2019,1
34,"Sorry about the weird title, the word mule was the first thing that popped into my mind, mule isn't related to anything with everything really, I just like the word. And sorry for not taking the title seriously. And for everything bad this post will cause I apologise in advanced please be kind to me, I'm sensitive hehe.  Now for the real tea. 

I think about killing myself all the time without the intention of hurting myself. 

This feeling of I think what's ""depressed"" is still so new to me, In the last year, I felt this feeling of despair/darkness that I had no knowledge of before, I didn't know what it was, I was so confused about why am I thinking about some dark thoughts that I would never know that I'll have and would realise that there so much more of the world that I wouldn't expect I would discover later in my life. Google and several mental health surveys from the Internet tells me that I am likely suffering from ""depression"". I know these things on the internet are not accurate and I should talk to a therapist; I would love to, but there are so many things that stop me from doing so / reaching out for help even thought I KNOW it's what I should do but I can't. Back to the sentence at the top, I hate how I want to kill myself and just wished I should die. This sound weird but let me explain. I hate the thought of me having suicide thoughts mainly because of  me thinking about other people; about other people having a much more terrible life than I am, who are suffering a much greater obstacle than I am and to those who deserve to live and here I am wanting to end my life. This thought has been reminding me everytime I think about wanting to kill myself; I don't do cutting or hurting; well maybe sometimes when my emotions get all riled up, but I would never go to the point of seeing blood seeping out of my skin. I always wished I get hit by a truck or just jump infront of a fast train while it's moving, while praying to God to protect me from all harm and evil. 

There are many factors as to why I feel all shitty. Some are petty to someone but this isn't about them this is about me. Why can't people understand how things about me can't be just explained to them and if you explained it to them they just think it's worthless or silly. Funny thing is. I have friends actually even good friends I can reach out to and would help me. But i don't know why it feels like I don't have the right to seek help, which is silly for me to say when I clearly have the right to seek help and I'm here writing this instead of sleeping but fuck it. I had the courage to post this on reddit when I've been dying to get attention from someone out there because A) I'm an attention whore, B) while writing this section makes me sound like a dumbass but whatever and C) pleasetalktomeeventhoughIhavefriendsIstillfeellonely.

Sorry if some sentences were oddly connected or words were misused.  English ain't my O.G language so yeah. See yall when I wake up, and I will not doubt myaelf if it was a good idea to post thisor not. Thanks for the time reading this post. And have a good day/afternoon/midday/night/midnight. Sending my my love from wherever the fuxk you are. 😗",20Oct2019,2
35,"I'm honestly fed up with my mom and my life today, to the point where I can't even walk in my room and sit down without me thinking about hurting myself, destroying my belongings or throwing myself out of my room window and hope I die when I hit the ground. 

If I run away from home, would police search for me? I'm 19, but I'm not sure if someone would go looking for me. I don't know what to do with myself right now. What I want to do is lay down in bed and hope if I go to sleep I won't wake back up but I'm not tired. 

I honestly don't want to be found. 

Everybody in my life has royally and utterly failed me and I don't care about anyone right now

I'd love to be anywhere else than where I currently am

But I dont have any money to go anywhere because I work from home so I leave Im losing my job

And Im a big fucking bimbo because I put 90% of my check to go towards my credit card and they wont release the hold until a week from now- I dont even know where Im going to be in a week from now

And I lost my ID and my fucking debit card so I cant take out money or buy a hotel room I dont think

Im just lost right now and I need guidance but I dont have any fucking friends or trusting family members that I can trust my problems to

I dont know if I should go and try to make it on my own, I reallly dont know anymore 

Can somebody please tell me what to do",20Oct2019,2
36,"I’ve always wanted to just die. Since about 14 years of age, I’m currently 28 but never actually wanted to do it myself. I’ve been on a million different types of ssri’s but nothing has changed my mind and the therapists just send me to a new one when a medication won’t work and then I have to start over. The last month of my life has been really hard and I’m just so over trying to make it better, I want to wallow in my sadness except I have a marriage and 3 kids to keep. My mom has cancer, my dads in surgery right now for his gallbladder, I have thought about leaving my husband of ten years because he’s an alcoholic, I’m trying to homeschool my 6 year old but I’m too stupid to figure out common core math and we’re way behind, my mother in law threatened to take my children away because of my husbands drinking, I freaked out and lost the relationship with her, my fil, and my sister in law, I’ve gained 30 pounds, my son has fluid in his brain, there’s something wrong with my nose because it’s been almost completely plugged for 3 months, and my 2 year old just got pink eye. I’m going to therapy but my therapist ha been on vacation for the last two weeks so i haven’t seen him and my doctors don’t know what meds to give me so they have just kind of been ignoring me. I’m drowning in housework (which my mil pointed out)and I’m so overwhelmed. I don’t even know why I’m writing this on reddit. I don’t think there is anything anyone can do...",20Oct2019,28
37,"I would like some advice on how people keep up their relationships with other people. I always get so tired when I’m around people and it makes it hard to make actual friends. Even keeping up the relationship with the few friends i have is hard I’m in college btw

Any advice is appreciated",20Oct2019,7
38,"Background info about who I am and why I'm now feeling depressed. I am a 19-year-old male who has just started college. My depression started about a month ago or so. I feel sad and like I have nowhere to go in life, that I have missed out on opportunities in the past, and thus, I will miss out on opportunities in the future. This feeling of missing all of my opportunities mainly stems from how throughout High School, I never had a girlfriend. I wasn't shy around girls and I did talk to them and such but was never able to go on a date, and looking back, there are multiple girls I easily could have asked out, and they definitely would have said yes. At this point, I think all of the years of being single have just caught up to me. I plan on visiting my college's counseling center soon to talk with a therapist, but until then, any advice from this subreddit would be greatly appreciated.",20Oct2019,6
