1,"Sometimes the past hurts so much, it erases a part of you.

I suffer from disassociation. Traumatic events have wiped out pieces of my memory that were painful but important to me.

My father was physically abusive to me; how often is unknown to me, because my brain has hidden away many of the instances away from me. Sometimes it comes back and I relive it and feel every second, see each piece moving, hear every word and breath.

In elementary and middle school, I was sexually abused. A girl smaller than me would come up to me and threaten to tell her big brother that I hurt her if I didn't let her touch me. Kids would touch me from behind in the lunch line and spread rumors about me. They would whisper things to me.

Most the time, these things are vague memories of words I recollected from before, but specific instances come back to haunt me, triggered by a feeling or a word.

During times of high stress, I disconnect from reality and black out, but it's recorded in my mind. I have a hard time dealing with it and understanding it.

Yeah. That's my story.

It doesn't really get better, but I've found a girl who's good to me and understands what I struggle with to some extent. That makes it all worth it: finding somebody who loves you- all of you- no matter how messed up you think you are or how many times you messed up before.",07Nov2019,5
2,"I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, but I know something is seriously wrong with me, suddenly self deprecating humour makes me hurt so much it’s unbearable. I don’t want my family to think of me differently, or call me ungrateful, I just want help. My cries for help just sound like me complaining or joking... I need to see someone about this. It hurts so much and I don’t know how to say it clearly that I’m not alright at all",07Nov2019,1
5,"If you are reading this, I am so sorry you are feeling so low right now. But I know you will make it through this. Just tell yourself this is only temporary and a blip in the course of a LONG life! 

I struggled (struggle?) with depression and a lot of it stemmed from relationships or my own poor decisions. After several suicide attempts, I realized I MUST be here for a reason! 

After the last one, I started praying asking for my purpose and all of a sudden I found one. I took back my life and focused on ME, and what I want instead of making others happy or living for other people. 

From the time I was about 13 to 25, I was doing hanging with the wrong crowd, doing drugs, drinking, dating horrible people, and then living to regret all of the poor decisions I made. Everyday I hated myself and regretted the arguments and fights with family and loved ones, the hangovers and withdrawals, falling in love with the wrong people/person. One person in particular who would do me wrong in so many ways, breaking my heart and breaking my soul all the while making me want to die, literally.

Five years ago I decided to take back my life and recreated myself - no drugs, partying, or hanging out with the wrong people. Occasionally I would have a good time with friends, but mainly I focused on my career and could buy everything I could ever want with the life that I built!  I even started a nice retirement nest egg, and because of my accomplishments I got an even better job closer to family. I never wanted to get married or have a child. I figured I was too fucked up to love someone let alone a precious child. 

I think that was my old depression covering up a potential life full of happiness and light instead of just pure darkness and shit. You start to believe that you don’t deserve anything good and don’t deserve happiness and you believe it.

...But then something changed and a few months ago I am in a wonderful relationship with someone who loves the shit out of me (despite my craziness) who won’t let me sabotage our relationship or push him away. Last month we just had a beautiful baby boy and he is my everything, my world. 

I’m not rambling on to brag about my life, I just want to show a timeline that life DOES get better. Out of darkness you can create an amazing life for yourself. The best thing to do is TAKE IT BACK! Take your life back for yourself and find a passion, create your dream life. 

Just know that YOU are worth it! You deserve all the happiness in the world!!  Over a lifespan, the darkness is temporary. Whether your depression comes from family, a relationship, evil people, or some other hurtful experience, you can fight this. Just remember life is full of highs and lows, but if you can make it through the lows... the highs are so worth it.

Everyone was put on this earth for a reason and a purpose, part of the journey is finding out what that is!! Spend some time thinking about yours, it will help to bring you out of the dark.",07Nov2019,1
7,"Hello everyone, i’m 21 years old who has a relatively fair life. I have a full time job, a family, and a girlfriend. Although people on the outside may say my life is well, its a total mess from my point of view. I hope posting on here will help me find some courage to keep on waking up for future days, quite honestly, its getting harder and harder to do so...

Lately (as in literally everyday for the past 3 months) my depression has gotten worse i feel. I’m taking antidepressants along with a sleep aid for my insomnia. I also struggle with adhd (inattentive) so during the day i take Adderall.  In the mornings when i wake up, i feel as though i have nothing to do. There’s and Xbox, my dogs, TV, so many things to actually be doing though, I literally just don’t have any interest in anything. Ive actually tried many hobbies (buying a drone, hiking, etc) but nothing seems to catch on. I don’t even listen to music in my car because i have no idea what to listen to, whatever i choose just ends up being skipped or disliked and becomes noise.

I just feel like mentally, im just not all there. It almost feels like im going crazy in the sense that i dont know what to do with myself. There’s this feeling that my brain is constantly searching for something that will eventually be called home but it seems like ill never get there. My brain is aimlessly on auto pilot and has been for so long, i really cant recall the last time i havent felt like this. It feels like im not grounded to reality almost...

Feeling this way, my girlfriend is well aware, though she says I’ve become codependent. With all honesty, i feel like being codependent helps me with what im feeling. I can actually get a sense of what being me feels like. I know i cant be codependent on her, but if its helping me, is it a bad thing? I know if she leaves, all will go to shit for me. With all honesty, im sick and tired of being helpless when the depression takes me with a wave of sadness and i just want it to end. I feel better being with her and around her, though im scared that my depression with get the best of me before anything even happens. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my first post on reddit. I know it was lengthy but i just feel beyond trapped..",07Nov2019,2

I started staying in my room more, my music is sort of depressing, I lose one of my really good friend groups in school, and I don't think i'm depressed, but I don't think i'm happy. A lot of things that I should cry about I almost never cry about. My dad revealed to me really ""shocking"" info to me about his childhood, and thinking back now, I could care less.

11,"I'm 20 and in my junior year of college. I was re-diagnosed this year with dysthymia (used to be major depression) and started Prozac, which basically just gave me mild side effects and didn't help at all. I switched to Wellbutrin and didn't even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didn't help at all. I start Effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but I'm literally ruining my life right now.

In past semesters, I was able to scrape through with a B average and go to most of my classes. That's not the case anymore. I'm not getting out of bed until the sun goes down, I'm skipping days of classes at a time, I have no idea what any of my grades are - and the worst part is that I can't even bring myself to care. Somewhere in the back of my mind I KNOW that if I fail this semester I'm going to majorly fuck up my financial aid and won't graduate on time, but it just doesn't matter to me. I'm too tired to care.

I barely wake up in time for work most days, and I'm having to make excuses for being late all the time. I don't cook, so I don't eat. I don't clean, so my room and kitchen are disgusting. I don't even know what homework assignments I need to catch up on. I'm exhausted all the time. I'm too tired to even read over this before posting, so sorry in advance if none of it makes sense.

Basically I'm halfway through this semester and I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all of my classes, ruin my financial aid, get fired from my job, get written up by housing (I live on campus), and I'm worried about what I might do to myself if this all happens. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know how to make myself care. I don't know how to get motivated to get out of bed in the morning. I will accept literally any advice from anyone. Please help.",07Nov2019,21
12,"I'm just gunna word vomit and hopefully something good will come out of it..


I've been depressed since I was 13/14, I guess at least that's when I really noticed it. I self harmed, and now that I'm typing this out and thinking about it I guess that's right around when I developed a horrible relationship with food. 

I got myself out of my situation at around 17/18 and moved in with my boyfriend. I was starting to feel much better until shit really hit the fan with his mom. I got stuck in the middle of (long story short) her kids trying to get their mom to realize she's a piece of shit. I tried to take no sides, but his mom would talk to me in certain ways to get me to say things in certain ways. Basically it ended up with her thinking I was trying to pin her kids against her because I personally stopped talking to my mom (abusive alcoholic and why I moved out) and she thought I was trying to convince her kids to do the same. The 5 years I lived there I chose to cope with the fact that it was her house and she felt uncomfortable around me by isolating myself to my boyfriends room for whole days. There were times when I would legit just sleep and do nothing else, sometimes I would stare at the walls for hours... nothing I tried to do like watching tv made me feel like I was doing anything. It was throwing energy into a void to get suked up so I could sleep and hopefully time would just go faster. I ended up going all the way down to 95lbs at my worst, because I wouldn't leave the room to even eat. I had too much anxiety that she was gunna be in the kitchen. During all of this time I was also discovering that I have what I refer to as a period from hell. I would be locked in the bathroom for hours doubled over in pain, vomiting, shitting my brains out, having hot flashes... basically its hell for 2 days. I lost my job over the fact that I would have to call out in the beginning of every month because I physically could not go unless they wanted me vomiting everywhere. I tried finding another one, but I just kept running into the same problem time and time again even with jobs where I told them about the issue before getting hired. 

Fast forward to now, I'm out of my boyfriends(now husbands) house and we have an apartment together. He works so so so much, and I want to be able to help provide for both of us. I have been out of work for 5 years and I dont even have references to put down anymore. I tried applying to some halloween stores for the season but not a single one called me back. Not only did I struggle with Jobs before this, I now have a 5 year gap in which I did nothing but fucking waste away. I dont know where to start.. I dont know who would even want to hire someone like me.. some pathetic 26 year old who has done nothing with her life. I really really want to provide for my husband, but I feel like I could never amount to anything.",07Nov2019,1
13,"I think pets are an outstanding way to deal with depression, and there’s a lot of science to back this up. Dogs have been shown to help with PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc.

One reason is the chemical oxytocin in your brain. You need to feel human touch to have the chemical release. But you can mimic the sensation of human touch by petting your dog. Depressed people are more likely to be alone and to go without human touch. For many depressed people, going out and seeking human touch is not that easy. However, anyone can buy a pet. 

Another reason is they give you a sense of purpose, which is key or happiness and energy. You are reminded every day that something depends on you to survive. And when you start taking care of an animal you will find it more natural to care for yourself.

Lastly, they can teach us about optimism. Dogs are nothing but smiles. They can be euphorically happy just by running around or eating a treat. They remind us that life is to be enjoyed, not just tolerated.",07Nov2019,1
14,"So please let me say this first I really just want to get this out there, if you have an opinion feel free to give me some advice. I’m sorry this won’t be very well written. 

Let me start this off by saying I’m a 16 year old male who has been diagnosed with depression by three separate doctors. No matter what they say or prescribe my family refuses to help, as an example my mom won’t let me take the meds I am prescribed and instead gives me a bunch of weird vitamin things. Whenever I tell her I am supposed to go to a therapist she takes me once and then never takes me back. Everyone else in my family either doesn’t believe me or just doesn’t care my siblings say I’m faking it for attention, my step dad just ignores it and the rest of my family is mostly out of the picture.

I mostly just don’t know what to do right now because I don’t know how I can get help. From what I have gathered from my one trip to the therapist the main source that might have put me in a depression is the psychological abuse from my parents during the divorce and I agree with them there. 

I hope that I can turn here for the support that I’m missing everywhere else, I’m honestly just so tired of being bored of everything and I’m tired of waking up every morning knowing that I won’t achieve anything because I can’t be bothered to muster up the motivation to do anything but the bare minimum to live. I’m tired of constantly being ignored by everyone in my family for my younger siblings I’m tired of being punished for being in the same room as my siblings when they do something wrong I’m tired of just living knowing and being told that I will never be as good as my siblings. 

I’m tired of being compared to friends that weren’t constantly told they won’t ever amount to anything I’m so done with being told that I should be like them. And all I can think is I’m sorry that I am not the confident, 11/10 person that can get any girl and is good at anything he does I’m sorry that he got encouraged and helped whenever he asked for it and I’m sorry I’m a waste of space that they always say I am. 

Why am I not good enough for help and support why won’t anyone help me why does my family hate me.",07Nov2019,1

17,"So I've always struggled with depression and anxiety. The last couple years my anxiety has gotten a lot better, but at the expense of my depression getting worse. I currently live about 40 minutes away from my parents home for university. I have decided to move home for the time being as I feel a lot more comfortable there and can sort myself out. However I'm still paying for rent for university accommodation, that doesn't bother me at all. My friends I live with have to decide soon if they are going to continue living there or find a new place, so I have to decide within this week if I want to live with them again next year. My base reaction now is no incase my depression gets worse. When I live there I feel very isolated and lonely and I cut people off from my life. I don't do anything apart from go to uni then go back to the house and sit in my room. When I'm at home with my parents I actually do things in the day, exercise, work, see family etc. So my question is what I should do about this? Am I being weak and I should continue living away and just try and get on with it and then decide to live away for another year and chance it. Or do I move back home with my family for this and next year.

Thank you",07Nov2019,1
18,"So yeah, the title says it all really. I deal with severe clinical anxiety and depression. I've been taking meds regularly for a couple years now, and I'll say it's upgraded to mild anxiety and manageable, sporadic depression, lol. But a couple weeks ago I just sort of stopped. No reason. Not because I thought I was ""better"" and didn't need them. Not because I didn't want to take them for any reason. I dont have negative side effects, my insurance didn't lapse... I have no idea why. I just kept thinking ""you should take your meds"", and then just *not* taking my meds. 

So of course after a couple weeks things got super bad again. Trouble sleeping, and then trouble waking up. Screaming at my family. Not showering. Poor diet. Lethargy. You name it. My sleep paralysis even came back after not having an episode in years.

So anyway, I was just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else? There's a ton of excuses you could make to stop medicating, but to have no excuse in the world and just kind of blow it off day after day... what is that? Self sabotage maybe? 

I dunno. I'm trying to get back on track now, but I just thought if I could understand it, it would help keep it from happening again.",07Nov2019,1
19,My friend is really struggling right now and is trying not to eat. I found out from a mutual friend (a guy she's talking to romantically) and she admitted it to me very willingly herself. She showed me their texts and she was talking about doing it because she wants to kill herself so she won't listen to anyone who tells her to get help. I'm thinking about going to the guidance counselor because she already expressed that her parents won't schedule her an appointment even though she's asked. She's diagnosed with depression because she's had one appointment but never got another. I don't want her to be upset with me and she's telling me herself to force her to eat. So I don't know if I should wait it out or go to the counselor.,07Nov2019,1
21,"I ran out of refills and I’m trying to get my doctor to authorize one more refill so I can make it to an appointment I have scheduled this month. I’ve been trying to get it refilled for almost two weeks, although luckily I only ran out of the meds three days ago. My doctor won’t be able to refill my meds until tomorrow at the earliest, and that’s only if he decides to refill it at all.

I need some advice on how to cope without meds until I can get some. I haven’t been without antidepressants for six or seven years, so I have no idea how to cope without out them.

I’m trying to fight inside myself just to get through the day and go to work and be there for my family but underneath it all I have this deep seething depression that nothing I do matters and that humans are just slowly fostering more and more hate.

24,"Hi everyone, Alt account since friends know my main. I don't know if this is the best place to post this or if a relationship sub would be better so I'm sorry if this isn't right. 

Some background, me and my boyfriend started dating fairly recently after years of a platonic friendship. He is the best person I have ever been with, insanely kind and supportive and funny with a ton of common interests and a super compatible personality. This is after years of toxic relationships with horrible people to try because I'd rather that then be alone. We're both in college right now though so we're long (serval hour car drive but nothing extreme) distance during school. 

As I've said we've been friends for years and have always been there to help each other through our respective mental health problems. When we first started dating though I happened to be in a very good place and was doing very well with my mental health for a few months and I think a decent part of that was definitely due to having him around. He cheers me up and calms me down when I'm anxious, we both also have pretty bad generalized anxiety as well. During this time there were definitely bad days/weeks for him but he was able to get through it and I'd like to think I was able to help as much as one can.

Since going back to school through my depression has come back with a fucking vengeance. I'm pretty high functioning usually even in the worst of it and can usually get myself to class/work and this past month is the worst I've been in a long time. BF recently went back to therapy and encouraged me to do the same which is helping a lot but god it's so fucking hard.

**I don't want this to ruin the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.** I feel so helpless when he's having bad days and I can be there to comfort him. I feel so lonely when he's not here to do it for me. I don't know what I can do. I feel like when I try to talk about what I'm going through it triggers him and makes me feel worse which then makes me feel worse and so on. He has been so good for me before this and still when he's doing okay and I'm not he's so supportive and amazing and is one of the only things that can make me smile. But when we're both down it feels like gripping onto another drowning person and we're both just bringing each other further down.

I don't want to end things with him. I love him so so much but I don't want to make things worse for him or myself. But then I think okay if I were to end things that will definitely make us both much worse in the imidate aftermath at the very least and I don't think either of us could handle it right now. I feel trapped.

I watched my parents' marriage dissolve as a kid as my mother grew compassion fatigue for my dad's severe and crippling depression. My biggest fear is to have that happen to me, either side of it.

But since then my depression has worsen and I have seen a change in the regularity of my lucid dreams, as well as classic dreams. I barely remember anything anymore and it's been months since I've had a lucid dream.

I miss it, it was amazing, the freedom, the lightness.

Now that I have DPDR too, I often during the day question myself if I'm in a lucid dream or not, do a realty check and I see myself struggle believing the reality checks.

I'm becoming sceptic about anything, and I can't tell anymore if it's a dream, reality, a hallucination, or something else.",07Nov2019,1
34,"I've been with this girl for 4 years and we've been engaged to be married for 2 of those years. Having recently moved to a new city she has thrived in her new life whereas I have struggled. Her job is perfect, she's made new friends and her social life is great. I think she's falling out of love with me and (feels anyway) has outgrown me. I won't go into detail, but something has really put a strain on our relationship.
As we have just signed up to a year in a rental I feel she is just waiting until it is convenient to break up with me :( 
All of this, along with the fact that I am not as content as I should be in my new job has lead to an all consuming wave of depression. I have been down before but this is like nothing I have ever experienced and I don't know what to do. Any advice would be truly appreciated.",07Nov2019,1
35,"I think I have depression. I don't want to self-diagnose or say I definitely don't have it when I might. I've thought this for a bit now. My family has a history of mental illness, and I believe that may be contributing to my thoughts. I want to be wrong. Every time I ask my parents about seeing someone about it they laugh it off and think I'm asking because my friend is depressed. I'm not trying to be 'cool' by pretending I'm depressed. I don't want to be depressed, but I think I might be. I don't know what to do. Please help?",07Nov2019,1
