0,"I don’t know what to do anymore and nothing helps me, I want nothing more but to be dead.. 

I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety/bipolar disorder since I was 12 years old, I’m 19 years old now and I thought things would brighten up over time but I was so wrong. Since October of 2017 I’ve had it the worst I’ve ever had, I’ve completely forgotten what it feels like to want to live and what it feels like to be happy and what it feels like to want to wake up. I lost my job, I can’t get a license, I’m losing everything close to me, I dropped out of school, and I can’t eat anymore, I’ve completely quit caring for myself. I feel such an empty space in my chest and I feel like such a burden, I’ve attempted suicide more times than I can count since the age of 12. I sadly didn’t end up the way I wanted to. Nothing works.. I have every intention to end my life, I don’t want to be a part of this earth anymore. Even the thought of my loved ones being devastated doesn’t push me away from it. It’s a feeling I can’t even describe.. I can’t do it anymore, I’ve lost all hope for things changing. I’m giving up, I’m tired, and I’m weak. I can’t stand to wake up feeling the same way I feel when I go to sleep. Please help me.. I can’t stop it anymore, I’m going to kill myself..",08Jun2019,1

2,"This is a throwaway account.

So, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I am very very concerned that I may be beginning to show sociopathic tendencies. 

I have a friend, who, for anonymities sake, shall remain nameless. He is my best friend, and has been for a long time. But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. 
I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. 
After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasn't. 

I'm also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. 

So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies?

Thanks in advance.

5,I am not sure it belongs here but I dont know what other group to ask. When I was going through a very bad time. I hurt someone and said some really bad things. I feel wrong for how I acted. I know I will never have them back as a friend or anything close to that. I am not even sure I should message them but we do have a friend in common which means that I do have a chance to run into them again. Should I say I am sorry or not? If I do how should I?,08Jun2019,2
6," I wish I was prettier so I wouldn't feel so self concious about how I feel when I am outside trying to exist in public. Especially when talking to other ""attractive"" people.  ESPECIALLY when trying to interact with other ""attractive"" women. Or women who ""KNOW"" they are ""the shit"". I hear people like this make gagging noises  after looking at me all the time when I go out in public, like they are disgusted with me or my overall appearance. It makes me want to cry. It happened today at bath &amp; body works. It actually made me want to just kill myself because I can't keep up with everybody else. I don't own gold or fancy rich clothes or any name brands and people out in public seem to keep treating me differently because of that. Especially some of the so called ""attractive"" people here. I swear, there are just some women who ""know"" that they are super attractive, but they just sit there and have an ugly personality by being randomly mean and judgemental to other people. Some of the most ""beautiful"" people I have interacted with, are actually some of the most heartless, mean, ruthless, unempathetic, and down right evil people I have ever met. I hate how our society glamorizes and idolizes this type of behavior. It's narcissitic and self centered as fuck. It's beyond detached from our reality... and yet it is becoming more apart of pur reality because people acting this way has become way more mainstream. Empathy seems to be on an ultimate decline (even science has confirmed that.) I SWEAR social media allows some people to build a following to the point where they feel like a god. These people put themselves first and act like the philosophy of  ""do as thou wilt"" &amp; ""I, myself, am god"" Is all that matters! It honestly sickens me and makes me worry for the future of our humanity. A lot of young people seem to be extremely judgmental, selfish, rude as fuck, and lack empathy. I have noticed even adults are acting this way too. It's actually so common that I think customer service is legit dying off now because human beings are such pieces of shit that we think the next step in human evolution is to become sociopathic un-empathetic human cyborgs that merge with a.i. to become superior humans and our own ""gods"". I think it's all hypocritcal, selfish, evil bullshit &amp; I don't think losing our sense of empathy is a step in the rigjt direction. I don't think it is something human evolution wanted us to purposely try to fuck with or breed out. But without even realizing it, we are breeding it out compassion and empathy from humanity more and more and because of technology, people are not able to feel compassion and empathy the way they used to because they are getting numbed out to it all. I think it was washington post that did an article on the decline of human empathy over the years and it is legit staggering. Scientists say that it's not for the better. We have empathy for a reason to help us survive, without it, we are legit fucked. We will destroy this planet and not even think twice about it because we will lack the ability to do so. I do not think we should lose that aspect of ourselves. It helps drive us to be passionate about things that matter, like global warmimg. Without compassion for the earth, we won't want to save it. Anyways, the reason I am rambling on is because I went outside today with my friend and people that worked inside the store of bath &amp; body works were extremely rude and just judgemental as fuck. It made me feel bad about going outside as an ""ugly person"". I know I am one. I know I am not as bad as other people but to myself, I think I look horrible and not even make up or plastic surgery can fix it. Everyone looks at me like I am too. Random people on the street have looked at me and made gagging noises and laughed.  I guess when you are considered ""ugly"" people aren't afraid to publically mock you. Did you know there used to be things such as ""ugly laws?"" Google them. I feel like even though those laws no longer exist in America. People are still judgemental as fuck and will not let you into a club or store or resturuant if you look or dress a certain way &amp; I believe it is wrong. People these days even seem to act this way towards the elderly and it makes me fucking angry. I believe in respecting our elders. Not making fun of their appearance or treating them like shit just because they walk slow. I really need to rant right now.  I am just so upset. I hate humanity. I really do. People are just so fucking mean and heartless for no fucking reason and don't ever seem to cut anyone any fucking slack. I could be crying, ready to kill myself and people in our society are so fucked up that they are willing to laugh at me and encourage me to kill myself if I'm gonna be so sensitive. Since when did being sensitive become a thing that people encourage others to kill themselves over?!! Like seriously?!! The fucking fuck?! I read Leo Buscgalia's book called ""Love"" &amp; I learned through him that gentleness and kindness and empathy is a strength, NOT a weakness. But our society acts so fucking backwards! I'm honestly beyond upset right now because I went into bath &amp; body works with my friend to go get something for my dad for father's day &amp; the employees were really judgmental and rude. They also wouldn't stop nonstop watching me and acting like I was sketchy just for being in their store. Maybe I don't look the part. I didn't wear make up. My hair is thinning out because I don't have the best genetics. I have ultra thin, fine, hair. It fucking sucks. Nothing I do can make me look attractive. I wash my face twice daily with high end skin care products but I still have acne. I am thin. I'm 130 lbs. I am 5""5. Boobs are like a B. My nose is very british looking. It kinda droops slightly and has a hump if you look at it from the side. I am pale as fuck and have massive bags under my eyes. My teeth have a slight over bite &amp; are honestly embarrasing to me because they don't look like hollywood perfect teeth. My hair is a shitty looking brown color and I have freckles. I have gauged ears, some people might find it disgusting but I think it's alternative and cool as fuck, vut maybe it contributes to people perceiving me as ""ugly"".  It hurts my feelings a lot. Like why am I ao ugly? Why do people who work at places like the grpcery store or mall think whenever I go out shopping that I'm gonna steal? Like do I look scruffy or something? Like it's because I'm not gorgeous enough to be taken seriously or treated with respect people hover over me and watch me like a hawk? Is that it? Why is it when I go to even buy food or when I go out at all, even when I'm paying with my own money, they act so skeptical over how someone like me would or could ever purchase from them or use their services ! They look and treat me like I'm some drug addict just trying to ""loiter"" around ! Is that what I look like or something? It hurts my feelings and makes me want to just kill myself because I can't take it anymore. Even when I ""passed"" as a beautiful person people in high school still made fun of me and I still percived myselr as ugly when I looked in the mirror. God someone please help me. I miss the respect that comes with looking ""beautiful"" but I am 22 now and I don't know how to look ""beautiful"" anymore. I don't have the personality of a ""beautiful"" or ""hot"" girl. I'm akward. I'm nerdy. I'm into anime. I'm into alternative and punk stuff. I had an emo myspace scene girl phase okay? So the ""I'm not like other girls"" stereotype fits me pretty well because I have always felt like nothing I ever did was good enough or cool enough to fit into any niche. The only niche I ever thought I deserved was the one that resulted in me committing suicide for the better of humanity. I really really really never ever felt like I fit in anywhere (except a medical marijuana dispensary haha) and it hurts my feelings. It makes me wanna kill myself a lot. I have my reasons. I have WAYYYYY more reasons than what I listed here, this was just barely the tip of the ice burg. lmfao😂 it's just being treated like shit for being ugly in public today made me feel suicidal and depressed as fuck because I am a mentally ill sensitive as fuck baby over here. I know I should ""toughen up"" but I just can't which is a major reason why I want to end my life.  As much as I wish I could be beautiful, I could never have their shitty personality if that's what it takes to be considered ""cool"" or ""normal"" or ""attractive"". I would much rather just stay home and watch anime and smoke weed than interact with people because people are so mean and judgmental to me. It makes me feel like existing while ugly in general is still a crime and it's not. I want people to just fuck off and stop being judgmental assholes. :/ I want to be able to go out in public and not worry about what other people think of me. I wish people didn't treat me like shit because of what I look like. Even if I was pretty people would still possibly be mean to me and it's not okay with me. I JUST can't take this world anymore and the people and how mean everyone is... I want to end me so bad. :/ but I am hanging in there. Venting online has helped a lot. Thank you guys for listening to my long rant. I needed to let out my pain. I'll try to work on my self esteem and maintaining a dgaf attitude but it's hard. I am a senstive person and it's hard for me to just get over things. I feel depressed rn and it's gonna take a while before I feel happy again. I wish I was good enough and pretty enough and felt confident enough to go outside &amp; not take things personally. Anyways, if anyone else feels this way or has ever expereinced shit like this, please feel  free to comment. I think the world isn't fair to us ""ugly people"" . Sometimes I feel like they act like us existing while ugly or existing while mentally or physically disabled is a nuisance to them! I would love to not feel as alone in this pain. It was hard for me to even share this story because I feel like I am complaining but I needed to get this pain off my chest. I'm tired of being ugly and I am tired of people perceiving me as ugly no matter what I do.",08Jun2019,11

Now I'm staying up playing video games until 2 every night, barely doing homework, and I am eating like shit. Every day I wake up at 11.

Of course I can see what I am doing wrong but I just can not stop. The temptations are just too strong. It feels like I can't even fight it. My mind is saying take action and do something but my body is not listening to it. I can't stop, it feels impossible.",08Jun2019,5

14," Not sure if this is the right place to post or if double posting it allowed because I also asked for help on mental illness moments ago. I don't know if what causes my ""depression"" is ""anxiety."" I'd like to try to better understand these feelings to cope better with them. I feel like the depression I experience is very weird. The earliest I can recall feeling it is being a small child, maybe around 7 years old. I saw a scary movie sleeping over at a cousins house (the grudge), and for a week or so I felt like I wouldn't be able to enjoy anything because I was always worrying or ""anxious"". I put it in quotes because I am not sure if it was anxiety.

My next bout of depression was during a summer in high school. Now this one looking back I think is very strange, but I honestly felt something which I think was depression. One of my classmates spoiled Naruto for me because he overheard me talking about it, every time I asked him to stop he said another character death and I ended up just trying to cover my ears till the class was over, but trying to not look like a weirdo that was actually being super bothered my deaths of characters in an anime. That whole summer I was so crushed, I was like wow Naruto is my childhood. I had just discovered of streaming websites for anime and finally got to begin watching it in consecutive order, when I was young I just watched the sporadic episodes that I could sneak in at late nights on toonami. I loved the show and I felt this sick feeling because I would never get to enjoy this show it was meant to be enjoyed by me. I still remember the day he told me, my stomach felt queezy or something and looking back it is a bit strange it hit me so hard. The entire summer from waking up to falling asleep it seemed this thought of naruto being ruined kept popping up into my head. Mid-summer me, my family and all of my dad's side of the family living in the U.S. goes camping and I remember I did not enjoy a single day of this camping trip because this thought of never getting to enjoy my childhood show that I loved so much. I remember I constantly kept trying to sneak in statements with my cousins to make me feel better, like asking them if spoilers bothered them, or asking them hypothetical questions like how they would feel if some amazing show was bothered by them hoping that they would say they wouldn't care or something.

And then at the end of high school triggered my longest bout of depression, probably around 2 years and I am not sure if it ever really ended. I didn't get into any of my top schools that I thought I could get into, and I kept having thoughts like I should have worked harder or I shouldn't have applied for engineering and maybe I would have gotten in. These thoughts would constantly be in my mind from waking up till going to sleep for a while.

Another weird example: The first summer during college after freshman year I visited family in Mexico. While visiting some local waterhole I had to go to the bathroom really bad and ran into the first bathroom I could find. It was disgusting but I was like I have no choice, and the whole trip I was paranoid that I had caught some horrible disease from using it. It's like I kind of knew the thought was ridiculous, but it still latched into my brain and would constantly be going in and out of my head for the whole trip.

Also, some weird psycho stole something from my room 2nd semester of freshman year. They sent me a pic of it and some horrible message. I didn't want to report it, I don't really know why I didn't. They constantly messaged me throughout the year, I'd block their number and they'd make a new one, and this repeated. I was still bummed out by college admissions, so this felt like a side thing that was very annoying. Even during summers and Christmas, they would not forget to send a horrible message. I think because of my depression and just being in a bad place I would respond to these messages with hateful comments, which I bet they enjoyed and was just handled wrong by me. They'd send me a text, I'd reply and block them, they'd make a new number, repeat. But this would just trigger slight emotions at the moment.

I developed tinnitus during sophomore year, not sure if I had it for a long time before this or if it just got to the point that I finally noticed it, but I blamed it on joining the school marching band for a year (which I originally joined which I thought would help me keep busy during school and keep my mind away from the depression). I also remember a night waking up because my headphones were blaring music, I usually tried to fall asleep with low music, but I had the lgg2 which has the volumes buttons protruding on the back of the phone and it doesn't ask you if you give permission to raise it beyond a certain volume, so I must have rolled over onto to it and raised it in my sleep. That 2nd year of college I really regretted joining the band and listening to music in my sleep, thinking it caused my tinnitus. Literally every day from morning till night I thought I would not be able to enjoy anything because of this stupid ringing. That year was probably my lowest point. From the end of sophomore year to junior year I feel like the depression has ""numbed"", but I feel like I truely don't enjoy my life, like there is some lingering feeling that bothers me from morning till night. Also the person texting me got annoying so I finally changed my number and redistributed my number to friends I trust and my family.

During Junior year at one point I felt ecstatic because I went like a couple of days feeling happier than usual. I don't party much, probably go to 2 a semester, but I felt hopeful about the future so after this string of good days I went to a party. Coming home that night I was messaged like at 3am by the same psycho, that they had seen me at the party and that I should watch my back. My heart sunk, not because I was afraid of this person, but at the thought of it being one of my close friends, possibly one of the friends that I had roomed with for a year. This triggered thoughts like worrying if I had lived with this psycho, or if they had poisoned me, or if somehow their poison also added to my tinnitus, or if the poison somehow ruined my vision, because I was also convincing myself I had visual snow. This first night was the worst, probably because I came back drinking from the party and feeling happy, but once I got this text the level of my intrusive thoughts reached a point where I actually wanted to kill myself. I stood on the balcony of my apartment thinking how it would be easy to jump and not feel this anymore, but I think I also am too scared to ever actually kill myself.

As a child I was also used sexually by an older cousin, but at the moment I was not scared or fearful because it felt good. I still don't think it affected me too much, but I feel ashamed by it and I get some bad feelings triggered by it from time to time. There are probably things I did not mention that caused me intrusive thoughts, but these are the ones I can remember.

Now that I am interning in Texas for a software internship far form home, I got my feelings of doom and worry triggered by the weirdest thing and it has been bothering me since yesterday which made me finally want to post and ask online about depression. I payed the girl who owns the room I am staying in temporarily, I counted the money, counted it again to make sure, then handed it to her. And when she left I was super worried that I counted it wrong, that I somehow payed her vastly more than what I was supposed to, and that I lost hard-earned money that my father gave me to help me pay for the apartment before I got payed for the internship. I kind of know this is ridiculous, but at the moment it feels like this is the worst thing and I'll never get it out of my thoughts. One thing I like to cling on to is that I eventually got over the ringing I still have in my ears as it doesn't bother me as much anymore and that that is probably worse than whatever I am worrying about in the moment.

I still feel like I am not enjoying my life, when I walk around and try to explore the new city I am living in I feel no happiness, not a lot of things give me happiness. I like doing things that give me adrenaline because I feel for those short moments I forget about whatever is not letting my enjoy life. But the thing is when I am not being bothered by some specific thought, like now it being losing a lot of money, that there exists some ""thought"" or some ""feeling"" that doesn't let me enjoy my life. Thank you to whoever read my probably very hard to read ramblings. It is late here and I felt like just writing and asking for some help.

Does all this sound like anxiety or depression? What do you tell yourself to help with this? Any help is appreciated.",08Jun2019,1
15,"So i was a pretty smart kid and I was at a pretty smart university, but some struggles came up and anxiety, ptsd and depression got bad, I’m back living with my parents. It’s been a few weeks and I’m more functional than I was, but I still feel like I’m just slogging through and don’t want to be alive. I have a boyfriend, but he’s on a different continent doing humanitarian work and I can only contact him once a week. We had pretty grand plans for the future, and I was excited for a life with him, but it’ll be about a year and a half before I see him again.

All this to say, I have no plan anymore. I don’t know if my major will be a good career, I want to work but am struggling with finding a job that will be okay with this utter mess of a human being, and the fear of letting them down means I haven’t even applied to jobs. Before all this i was a very driven and plan-oriented person, and now it just feels like I’m trying to survive the day. So as I’m trying to do the clean room/feed self/shower/take care of self/support family shuffle with much less energy than usual, I also kinda feel like I’m mourning the loss of the person who I was and everything she was going to do with her life, as opposed to the person I am who is doing nothing and excited for nothing and interested in nothing. My relationships with my family are strained, I don’t want my friends to know I’m home from university so I don’t talk to most of them, and I have no goal to work for, no plans for the future.

16,"I've dropped out of college this year due to severe depression as well as family and financial issues currently going on. My friends are graduating this weekend and I would have been graduating with them as well. 

I'm so proud of them, and I feel so selfish feeling this way, but at the same time seeing how ecstatic and joyful their family is and seeing them get their degrees just reminds me I was never good enough to make it to the end like them. Even if I did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. My own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. If anything they only reminded me of my failures.

The majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. I went to a private University and none of my friends or anyone I knew even remotely experienced anything like that. 

Sometimes I get frustrated that a big reason why I couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. But I guess that's just life, it's not fair.

18,"I'm off-balance. So no life-threatening emergencies going on atm, but. I'm wrong inside right now, and it's eating me alive. 

My therapist -- the first one that isn't an overworked, underpaid uni therapist -- told me at the end of our first meeting that she wanted to talk about diagnosis. Specifically mentioned bipolar II which is a whole bit of anxiety I don't know how to deal with. And the thing is that the only therapist who's officially diagnosed me with anything asked me what I thought I should be diagnosed with, fucked me up beyond compare by opening up daddy issue boxes I didn't want to open when I couldn't leave my room and function in society, and made me want to die or drink myself to oblivion every time I left the sessions. So like. It's maybe a good thing? Except I don't fucking know, and I'm terrified of bipolar and schizophrenia and the former might run in my family but it's a grey area because older generations and lots of anxiety/depression issues the women in my family just muscle through, and my cousins have been diagnosed in their 30s. 

But if I have something that's not depression, maybe I could have a shot at getting better. Because I'm not getting better, not really, I have up months and low months, and they both just keep getting lower and lower and lower. 

And if I don't have anything else, then I just have to keep doing what I'm doing. Keep doing what hasn't been working for the past three years. Keep seeing therapists that don't listen to me and doctors that don't prescribe me enough meds and keep faking my whole fucking life because everyone keeps telling me it will get better. But it doesn't. And I'm tired. 

I'm just. I'm tired of being like I am, and I don't trust the mental healthcare system at all, but it's like I don't have a choice. And it feels so fucking shitty, and most of the time I wish something would just kill me so I don't have to deal with it anymore.",08Jun2019,1
19,"5 weeks ago my fiancé broke up with me. He’d been acting distant for a couple of weeks prior and when I asked him about it he told me he didn’t love me anymore and didn’t want to be with me. I had to move out, get a new place on my own, completely change my life. A couple of days after he went to the doctors, he was signed off work for a while and prescribed some anti-depressants. I have been in contact with him almost every day since then. He says he doesn’t feel anything, he said it’s just nothingness and he wouldn’t mind if he never spoke to anyone again. My love for him is still as it was when he first met, he only asked me to marry him 3 months ago. He is going back to work in a couple of days and he seems to be having more good days than bad. I don’t want him to never think about me or the relationship again, I want to support him and help him get back to where he was and the life that he had, i’m just worried he will continue to dismiss any feelings that he has/had for me. He talks about his work all the time, like that’s the only thing he needs in his life and knowing him truly, I know that’s never been something that he’s wanted. I don’t know what to do.

22,"I've been treating depression for a year and half. I first was diagnosed with a moderate to aggravating case of depression and I was put under medicine therapy. After some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I was given some credit by my  psychologist, who have told that didn't really need ""his"" therapy, he gave me the only condition to keep checking psychiatrist every now and then. Since then, I've learned to cope with my ""problematic ordeal"" of finding meaning in anything in life, and I learned that there are some bad days that shouldn't count as the entirety of life. So, up to the preamble:   


I've been taking medicines since march, 2018. No serious suicide idealization came since them (actually one episode that evolved cannabis, but this shouldn't count, because cannabis is paranoia material for me) since them i went through escitalopram, some low dosage of  atypical antipsychotic (that didn't work and I quit under the evaluation of a psychiatrist), some benzo for acute paralyzing anxiety, quetiapine to sleep (which later I learn it is falling under new evaluation by the scientific community) and buproprion. I sustained this triad (escitalopram 20 mg, quetiapine 25mg and bup 150mg) for over a year with rare appeals to benzos (I got one prescription and it went out only recently almost a year and a half alway, as I always choose to take 0.5 mg in rare cases only). Recently I went through some doubts about the medicines I was on, this came after I perceived myself unease and incapable of focusing on normal task (even sitting for an entire hour of my former favorite hobby, the video-games). I went to check a new psychiatrist, Dr. Fabiano. He appointed me that I could have (or not, this must be importantly underlined) have suffered the extra-pyramidal effects of the Dopaminergic (bup) or the anti-psychotic (quet), but he couldn't be sure because he although he knew it was possible for someone to present the extra-pyramidal effect under low dosage, as he judge I was on, he could never confirm a ""case like mine"". So, we decided to dump all of three medicines (esc, bup, quet) and switch to a mono-therapeutic usage of Revoc (flavoxamine), which I've been using for a month and some days. NOW COME THE THING: I'm appealing to benzos far more than I ever did. And some times, after the benzo kicks in, I question myself If any other medicine has ever worked for me, because the distinction is quite clear during the effect. I can: 

  
\* Make clear idea of conflicts

* Have to practice breath and mini doses of meditation
* Have some good decisions that might impact my later well-fare
* Study for more than an hour (my limit is way lower, without).
* Play some video-game and relax
* Actually listen to music
* Dance alone, in a dark room with feeling self-pity (maybe the opposite)

I know benzo have high potential to become harmful if abused, but since I have developed a wellness relation with it I'm in doubt if any other medicine I took granted me all of these well-fare.",08Jun2019,3
23,I am trying to get my brain back up to speed after a major depressive episode. I have a lot of time on my hands so I was wondering if there were any games/exercises that could be useful in helping my brain recover. Thanks,08Jun2019,9
24,"Hello! So I took the big step and visited the doc. After a pretty long session she prescribed me with SSRIs (escitalopram). Now, I smoke pot regurarly; usually every night. Would that be a problem? Also should I watch out for anything else while I use that medication?",08Jun2019,1
25,"Hi

To anyone reading I hope you're well... I don't know you, but just know I hope life smiles upon you.

I want to keep this brief..
When I was a young teenager my mum left our family... literally she stared seeing someone else, even caring for this other persons daughter. Shortly after my parents had an official divorce.

I haven't spoken to my mum since, it's been about 13 years.

Shortly after I found out about my mum cheating I confronted her about it and one thing lead to another and I started telling and shouting, threatening to phone my dad (wasn't a good guy tbh). Eventually my mum called her then boyfriend and he came over, all I remember after that was being dragged out if my bedroom by him and being put in a headlock.

I shortly afterwards ran away.
Since then I was homeless, filled with anger, then sadness combined with heavy bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts.
I had taken my little sister with me as she was unfortunately being physically abused. 
So I was also feeling incredible guilt.

I guess I pushed through, enrolled into a free college and managed to get in/finish university.
I landed a good job afterwards, enough for me to change my life around significantly.

But 3 years on and I'm feeling major depression again... But I haven't let people close to me know, I kind of just told people I am taking time off from work. Ive moved 300 miles away and I havent been working for the last 6 months.

The only thing that breaks the depression is my boys of crying... I just keep crying and more recently I've been asking to my self why my mum betrayed me, like I loved her so much.

I hadn't even let these kinds of thoughts cross my mind since I ran away... But now it's caught up and I'm really struggling to accept myself and my thougts over this person who has never tried to reach out to me",08Jun2019,6

27,"Every once in a while I get like hyper sexual. Like I can never get off enough, but in the weeks that follow it there seems to always be a major depressive episode. 

Does anyone get like this? I know it's not guilt or anything, because I have a steady, enjoyable, healthy sex life. 

It almost feels like my body is warning me, and that I should try and build up dopamine or something.",08Jun2019,2

30,"I’ve never felt more isolated and alone and worthless than I do now.

It all started late last year when I had to leave my long time gf because of severe verbal and mental abuse. Ever since then I feel like my life has gone down hill. I never feel like I’m good enough for anything or at anything. Even activities that I used to be the best in my group at I seem to just fail at all the time.

At work I am, at least on paper, the most experienced, qualified, and over best there is at my position but My supervision treats me like I’m the worst one there. I don’t think it’s about my personality, I do well with people, I’m pretty well liked by a majority of my peers and subordinates, and no one suspects that I feel this way.

My closest friends have become barely more than acquaintances. To the point that after I got blown off to hangout I said it was alright because I was at the ER (not a lie) and never heard another word from them. I’m in the military and live over 1000 miles from home so these friends were the closest thing I had to family, and they want notations do with me. I’ve never been the type to have a lot of friends, even now if I counted using one hand I’d have extra fingers, but this realization hurts. 

I’m a 29 year old guy from Texas. Everyone always expects me to be the tough guy that can handle everything that come my way with a grin but I can’t do this. This feeling of being alone is the worst. I try going to dinner or movies by myself just so I don’t sit at home all the time, but somehow that just makes me feel worse. I can’t listen to the radio because every song is about friends hanging out or people being in love.

I just don’t know what to do",08Jun2019,13

32,"I know this sounds weird, but my depression tends to get triggered whenever I sleep relatively ""early"" (10pm). Maybe it's because I'm sleeping in the dark by myself. Very often I'll get ""nightmares"" and wake up at 1am with a sense of loneliness and foreboding death. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""nightmares"" are actually very mundane. A few hours ago I woke from a ""nightmare"" where my brother visited us from overseas, we all moved back to our family house, and I didn't want him to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my 30s and know that mortality is around the corner for many people I've grown up with. Many of my old school teachers are now dead, all my grandparents have passed away, many of the celebrities I looked up to are dead or dying, my own parents are aging rapidly etc. It's when I wake up alone by myself at 1am, I feel like I'm in a tomb or graveyard. All I feel is death.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just wondering if other people experience the same thing? And what they've done about it? These days I prefer sleeping very late, and getting up after mid-day, when the sun is out and the day has already warmed up.",08Jun2019,2
33,So my depression in the past was always constant but not very intense. But the past few months it’s been happening in “bursts” of you know what I mean. I can be fine for hours at a time then it will come back for a few hours. I’ve noticed that these “bursts” are usually way worse (like self harm instead of just isolation) than when it was constant. Is anyone else experiencing this? If so what actions should I take?,08Jun2019,3

36,"I've been with my boyfriend for about 2 and half years and he's great. I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year ago and he was so supportive in the process. About 6 months ago I was also diagnosed with depression which has been really tricky recently with my dissertation and final exams at uni. During this time my boyfriend was diagnosed with an illness (long term but not life threatening) and understandably it's had an impact on his mental health and I've been trying to be supportive for him.

Due to this I've been avoiding telling him things about how I've been feeling because I don't want to stress him out, but a counselor and my friends said to tell him because he'll want to know and help. So I told him how hard it was etc.

Today he told me he had something to tell me but he didn't want to upset me. And it was that he's been feeling down recently and when he's with me he still feels bad. So I asked what I could do and he said ""be happier"". I told him I'm trying and I want to be but he said that's not quite the same.

I feel awful and so hurt. I love him but my depression isn't something that will just go away and in an ideal world it will but I can't rely on that. I just don't know what to do from here",08Jun2019,2
37,"I feel so horrible rn, my family and friends make me feel useless and unwanted, it hurts so much and its like no one them even care, they don't even ask when there is something clearly wrong, my parents are the reason I hate myself and everything about myself, I try so hard and it doesn't even matter.",08Jun2019,5
38,"Dug myself into some pretty bad financial holes, been applying to every job that fits my career goals while working 3+ jobs (construction, 2 gig economy roles, as an unsuccessful real estate agent). I've been working extremely hard, feel guilty if I take even a night off, but things are barely improving and what was holding me together, my relationship with my girlfriend just ended abruptly and without any closure... full ghost, for someone I've been extremely close with for 4+ years. Said she only loved me when we were drinking, which in retrospect makes sense. I was using alcohol to mask the depression, depression I wasn't even aware I had at the time. Guess it makes sense that I was only fun then. Anyways, I have to feel the pain to get over it, no more numbing it. But it hurts.

Rant over, thanks for reading.",08Jun2019,4
