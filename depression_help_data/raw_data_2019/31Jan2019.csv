After a long way I gathered some audience,  and was pretty proud of myself... But recently I dont feel so anymore. I unfortunately take every bad/troll/mean comment seriously.  People tend to make shitstorms over stuff.  And the more popular you get the more hate you get as well... I am mot feeling they joy anymore... I don't like my art also anymore. But at the same time I grieve that something I worked very hard on suddenly is turning into dust... ",31Jan2019,1

2,"Honestly I have no idea where to begin with this. My life has been so filled with a nonstop series of unfortunate events. Except my story‚Äôs only I know. From growing up in a abusive home as a child to being left at a fire station by my mother. To growing up confused why I‚Äôm different, why I‚Äôm not like others. Not knowing I had a high functioning form of Aspergers.

Feeling like a freak unwanted by my family I always just wanted to belong. To something, anything I just wanted to be needed. Just a family or a friend or a lover. Just to be accepted. 

(Mistake 1 The Cheater)
At 19 I met a girl who accepted me, after a few months she told me I was going to be a father. I finally felt like I belonged to a family. Until my son was born, I held him for every second of his life until a congenital heart defect made him take his last breath in my hands. Within a week I lost my job and my home burned to ash from a wire short in the kitchen. To keep it short our marriage fell apart we distanced ourself until she cheated, so in a fit of immature rage I cheated. Meeting the biggest mistake I‚Äôve ever met. 

(Mistake 2 The Beater)
We continued to date eventually until the birth of my son. The relationship was the most toxic scarring and most awful thing I‚Äôve ever lived through. I went through chemo from non small cell lung cancer while trapped in the relationship, with a woman who got pleasure of being cruel. Promising if I left she would take my little boy. I stayed through busted lips I took every hit I could just so I could keep my little boy. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I left. She followed through on her promise, it took me over 2 years to get back on my feet to fight for custody. What does the state give me? Two Sunday‚Äôs a month...

Let‚Äôs fast forward to two years in the future 


(Mistake 3 The liar)
I meet this girl üôÑ honestly she was perfect. We got along we were so close it‚Äôs almost unbelievable, we dated for quite a while and both being happy I proposed and she said yes. Elated, not even a week later she gives me some news. We‚Äôre going to have a baby. Yeah I know super fertile I know...

Fast forward 9 months. My daughter is born. Now let‚Äôs throw in This tidbit so you can understand completely. I‚Äôm a white man from the south. This girl I‚Äôm engaged to is an African American from California. Her parents both high ranking officials in the Air Force did not like me and openly said to my face. ‚Äú maybe we like you if you had some discipline we could tolerate you, but our kind shouldn‚Äôt mix with people like you‚Äù as in your not military or black so eat a dick.

I‚Äôm not a bum, I make 100k a year from car sales. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt  take care of both of them in every aspect. 

!!!!Now that we have that tidbit.!!!!!

HER PARENTS CONVINCED HER TO LEAVE AND MOVE TO CALIFORNIA WITH MY 1 MONTH OLD BABY! 
I can‚Äôt make this shit up. Mind I‚Äôm summarizing but this is the bare true facts. 

Devastated. We maintained this long distance relationship while she went back to school.  Yes they broke up a family so she could finish her masters. After a year of being told she‚Äôs coming back I genuinely gave up on the relationship. Unknown the cancer I thought I escaped slowly planting roots in my left lobe of my lung. Feeling more sick day by day thinking it‚Äôs a flu. Until I black out in my bathroom after a coughing fit to wake up in blood that had been pooling inside me. I knew immediately what was happening.  

Even after being diagnosed and told that we could do targeted radiation treatments but the success rate for my progression state was 8% 
I was going to die. And nothing I could do could stop it.

she still wouldn‚Äôt come back. She backed off becoming more ‚Äúbusy‚Äù until it was a phone call every few days. I could sense she felt guilty for leaving but would never admit it truly. She didn‚Äôt care about me anymore. 

I came to terms I would never see my little girl again. All I could think was I don‚Äôt want to die alone. We broke up. I said goodbye to someone I considered my best friend. 

(The one)
Seeking someone to just be around, someone to talk to. Seeking a friend for the end of the world kind of deal. I met who I genuinely know is my soul mate. I‚Äôve never been so in love. Someone who has been their for me through every low or high. She cured me! Just being with her gave me the boost I needed to fight until they cut out half my lung. But I was gonna live, I had someone to live for. 
I fucking finally found my home, my belonging! One issue. She belonged to someone else, we met in a relationship counseling group you could say. Long story short she leaves him and we get together after a series of annoying hiccups. 

But now the problem that keeps happening is that she is so tender hearted and sensitive that in the heat of a argument I said that I hated her out of anger. Believe me when I say I do not mean that. I was pissed and just lashed out. And now she months later still believes I don‚Äôt truly love her and I still want my daughters mother back. 

This causes a huge rift in her emotional security to the point she left me. I know I made mistakes and took things out on her that weren‚Äôt her fault. I will always admit my own faults, but when I say I worshiped the ground she walked on 99% time. I spend all my time with her I‚Äôm loyal and open. But because during little fights saying something like ‚Äúwhy are you bitching‚Äù my big fucking mouth put this image on her mind where she thinks, I think she‚Äôs a bitch and I hate her. I seriously hate my fucking self all the time, I feel like a massive pile of shit 99.99. To pile on durning our time apart we had for a month we found out we were going to have a baby. I swear to god you guys the pill and rubbers don‚Äôt do shit! Don‚Äôt get me wrong not like I was upset or mad I felt like life was giving me another chance. To finally have a family. But it was giving me another chance to feel pain. At 6 months we miscarried and we lost our little boy. I honestly still haven‚Äôt been able to accept it. I still have his ultrasound as my background and my phone screen littered with baby apps. I can‚Äôt even force myself to delete, it‚Äôll be like he never existed. I don‚Äôt want to try and forget him. 



I tried to make it better but I have gotten on this run the last few months where I have the Midas touch except I turn everything to shit. I lost my job, I lost my home. I can‚Äôt even see my son because I have no income for child support. 

To summarize everything. 
I just want to fucking die, I hate who I am,I hate the choices I made I hate everything I‚Äôve had to go through. I‚Äôm tired of people telling me that I go through so much because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm strong‚Äù
I don‚Äôt want to be strong anymore!!!! I just want peace. I want to go one day where I don‚Äôt mourn my baby‚Äôs a day where I don‚Äôt wonder why didn‚Äôt my parents love me? Why was I the only child they got rid of? A day where I can just smile. A day I want to forget. I want to forget me, but I don‚Äôt want to forget the ones I love. I‚Äôm where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. All I can think of is dying. I‚Äôm so tired. I can‚Äôt take these scars anymore. Why the fuck is my life like this?

3,"I‚Äôm 28 (m), and I work the morning shifts at my job.  Usually I‚Äôm 4am-12:30pm but for the last month I‚Äôve been leaving around 10 when we open.  I work alone in my area and I stock, with very little interaction with coworkers or managers.  

I‚Äôll go to the gym afterwords to try and better myself, but I‚Äôm there for 30 minutes or less and I‚Äôm out.  When I come home I just get into bed and stay here.  

I was seeing a girl this last October and we dated a couple of months, but she hit me with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready to date anyone like I thought I was‚Äù and now she never talks to me.  Same goes for friends.  I‚Äôll text a few but no replies.  

My phone never goes off and I feel so alone and unwanted.  I‚Äôm on antidepressants and will start seeing a therapist soon again, but this girl just messed me up.  I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong but it hurts knowing I‚Äôm not good enough.  ",31Jan2019,1
4,"To preface, I'm a male that has majority female friends. It's just always been what I more related to, I guess. For a long time now, I've felt that nobody actually cares about my life. I try very hard to invest myself in my friend's lives, and help them through their struggles. I very often feel like I just should stop, because maybe it's not worth it. I had a long time relationship that ended somewhat mutually, as she didn't want to be with me anymore and I could feel that. 

Now, i feel like I'm somewhat stuck because I love the people in my life and trying to let go of them would destroy me as a person. It's very likely that my view is just skewed, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm alone. And, being a guy, I find it hard to make friends with other guys that are emotionally building. I'm the friend that you won't stop to talk to if someone else isn't there. It's made me feel like I'm just a nuisance in everyone's life and I should just disconnect  to improve the quality of life of those around me

I'm interested in advice, similar stories, etc.

6,"I‚Äôve been suffering, as far as I can tell, for all my life. When I was 10 and under I had suicidal thoughts, going through puberty I stopped being depressed and started being happy/doing well in my daily life and then BAM I got mono in highschool at 14yrs and I haven‚Äôt been able to get back out of this funk since. I‚Äôm 22 damn years old. All my classmates have graduated, are graduating or getting married. I should be peaking, I should be finishing college. But I haven‚Äôt been to college except for all of two months. I‚Äôm tired all the time, I have no motivation to do anything, I‚Äôm angered easily by insignificant things. My boyfriend and I argued so much about nothing because of me he went so far to say that I was ruining the relationship. And it‚Äôs fucking true and I can‚Äôt stop myself no matter how much I know it‚Äôs wrong. I live in a funk. I can‚Äôt remember anything. Any conversation I have during the day no matter how significant or not I forget about. Important tasks are left in the dust. I even can‚Äôt find the motivation to play video games, which I fucking love video games and all you have to do is sit there and move your fingers. Is this depression? Or what? Because sometimes I feel okay, some days are great. Some days I can do the things I need to do. But those days are few and far between and even then I have to work up the motivation on those days too. I just don‚Äôt get it, I have no want to kill myself but I have no want to live either. I just fucking exist and I don‚Äôt get it man. ",31Jan2019,1
7,"March 5th, 2017, I fell in love with this guy I met on a post-hardcore band page on Facebook. He lived four hours away, and after 4 months, we decided we had to live together. Worst mistake of my life. Manipulative, compulsive liars are so beautiful when you first meet. They talk sweet, smile pretty, call you like you‚Äôre the only thing on their mind, touch you just right, and then they slowly let the abusive dark horrible shit out little by little until you don‚Äôt even know what happened to your happy relationship with the perfect soul you could have married.

So fast forward to November 12th 2018, I feel worthless because this relationship has destroyed me. I pray, and think, and decide that this isn‚Äôt what I need anymore, even though I loved this boy more than anything in the world. So I had to leave. And when I did, the only thing he could tell me was how much he wanted to kill himself. I was still in love with him, but it was all just a lie. There was nothing there to love. I was in love with the cute post emo boy who listened to Christian metal to worship, loved his family, treated me like a princess, and called me his lioness. But he was never fucking real.

I‚Äôm just going to post this long message I wrote for him. Maybe it‚Äôll make me feel better..


You lied to me. You lied by saying I was the only thing you wanted. You lied by saying you couldn‚Äôt even look at another girl you were so in love with me like TWO weeks ago. You lied to my best friend when you said, ‚ÄúTell Sarah I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm done.‚Äù as in you were about to commit suicide. And then got pissed when we contacted your mother because I was actually scared you‚Äôd take your life. You‚Äôre out here at LEAST kissing a girl who has a kid and a husband/boyfriend like you‚Äôre in love or at least fucking the chick, and then sending pictures of it to me? Or letting her send it to me?? Did you even see what she texted me with that? No, It won‚Äôt matter. Because you don‚Äôt care. And the fact that you say I can ‚Äúplay the panic attack card‚Äù fuck you. You‚Äôre absolute fucking trash for saying that because you literally know how that was, is, and always will be for me more than anyone alive. You‚Äôre absolute fucking dirt. I‚Äôm so beyond torn down and beat down and fucking done with trying to be okay because of you.
Because you can‚Äôt stay out of my social media posts, because you can‚Äôt get the fuck over me, you can‚Äôt keep my fucking name out of your disgusting mouth when I‚Äôve blocked you in literally every way possible. You have to fuck some other chick you just met, or post about her to feel better. Even worse, me and this girl share the same name. All the while, I‚Äôm making POSITIVE posts about myself trying to get better and get over the abuse you gave me. NOTHING I SAID IN MY POST WAS A LIE. It was how I felt and how you treated me. And I don‚Äôt give a fuck who sees that. NO ONE you know is my friend on insta because I blocked literally every single one of them, and if they are somehow on there and you‚Äôre worried about how it‚Äôll ‚Äúmake you look‚Äù if they believe it, then why are you their friend?
My intentions are to feel better. To fucking TRY to get you out of my head. And the ‚Äútrash‚Äù I see are all the hoes surrounding me In this terrible town. This has nothing to do with your little fuck toy you kiss all over and wish was me. I‚Äôm done holding back, you wanted me to ‚ÄúBe a big girl?‚Äù Here you go. Me telling you off.

You said you‚Äôd ‚ÄúGladly kill yourself in front of me‚Äù and then searched for the gun under the bed.
When I tried to get away from you because I was scared, you grabbed my arms and pushed me onto the bed, and then lowered me to the ground so I couldn‚Äôt leave because, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not leaving until we work this out.‚Äù
You didn‚Äôt get your license the whole year and 8 months we were dating when you ‚Äúplanned‚Äù to the week we met.
You let your sister ACTUALLY harass me so bad that my family had to press charges because of her texting me off of random phone numbers telling me how worthless I am, how I‚Äôm a skank and a bitch, and how no one wants me here anymore. AND you didn‚Äôt say shit to her to stand up for me, even when I was throwing up shaking in the bath tub, until I begging you crying over and over to make her stop.
You called me a cunt and meant it way too many times.
You accused me of cheating on you with your best friend .
You lied about your 21st birthday celebration when I was completely fine with you going clubbing and drinking 2 hours away without me on your birthday with 3 girls who were your friends, while I sat at home and wished you had ate lunch with me the day you left like you had promised, AS LONG as you had your own room and bed, but somehow your lesbian friend ended up sleeping in the bed with you.
You lied about not messaging your Ex who cheated on you for four years, ‚ÄúKarrie.‚Äù (not real name)
You sent porn links to your friends when you knew it made me hate myself more than I already do. As well as I would always want to make love with you anytime you asked.
You would send pictures of girls you knew to your friends and play ‚Äúsmash or pass‚Äù and answer.
You talked about fucking a chick that walked into your job while you were working, while we were dating, and how you‚Äôd ‚Äúgladly knock that up and pay child support.‚Äù
You stood up, ran at me, and pushed me back into the bathroom when I was trying to explain the things you did to hurt me and then called me Karrie.
You called me Karrie about 5 other times in the relationship.
You told me to fuck off when I wanted to go on a date with you when I was about to be gone for a week on vacation with my family.
You didn‚Äôt have a job and let me support you fully. Food, cigarettes, and the two monsters you drank a day for 3 whole awful months. And you didn‚Äôt clean or cook or do shit but sit on your ass during all of that.
You let ME APPLY for both of the jobs you ever had besides your first job at Jason‚Äôs deli that you had already quit months before we started dating.
You let your friends talk about killing my little brother because he‚Äôs so ‚Äúannoying and stupid‚Äù and you didn‚Äôt stand up for him. Not even that, you called him a ‚Äúfucking try hard‚Äù when all he wanted was to look cool to you.
When I cooked a beautiful dinner with candles and music and put on the red dress you liked on our last month anniversary because we were too broke for our one year and six months, your friend asked why I did it all because it was on my Snapchat, and you said, ‚Äúwe missed our year and a half so she wanted to do some gay shit.‚Äù And he replied, ohhh. Then you said, ‚Äúyeah, but I got to bust a nut so it‚Äôs cool.‚Äù All after you spent an hour and a half eating dinner quickly, smoking a cigarette, having sex with me, then played call of duty until 5 in the morning after promising you‚Äôd be in bed in two hours.

You were absolutely terrible. And I gave you another chance because you begged me for weeks after I left you. After I had already painfully packed all my things, and left my coworkers in that town, and left my best friend, and changed my whole life by moving back in with my parents.
I came back for a week. I tried so hard. Because I was in love with you. But crying 1/3 out of the day, having panic attacks, and having night terrors while I was around you because I was actually terrified of you and could not get the awful things you did to me out of my head, made me realize that it wasn‚Äôt love..
When I knew it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted and needed, I left for good. But I stayed your friend. Then you tell me you‚Äôre suicidal every single night from 11pm-4am for a week or longer because you fucked up and treated me like shit and made me leave you. I didn‚Äôt know how to help other than to say I was praying for you. It hurt me because you made me feel like it was MY fault you were suicidal.
Then you post about me on Facebook telling me ‚Äúfuck yourself.‚Äù So I blocked you because it was toxic for me. Because all you talked about was either how you wanted to die because you couldn‚Äôt have me, or how I made you feel bad because I shared basic ‚Äúhow a man should treat a girl‚Äù cute positive posts on Facebook. And I wanted no part in that. So I blocked you.

I‚Äôve fallen off the deep end because my nightmares are fueled by you.
By how you talked to me, how you treated me, how you treated me recently with sending pictures and harassing texts with the ‚Äúother Sarah.‚Äù how you‚Äôll never change.. 
you fucked me up. And you know it. You won‚Äôt admit to me again, or to anyone. But I have proof. It‚Äôs in my head of you bawling in my arms telling me what a terrible person you were, and apparently still are. And I also have screenshots of it. I have screenshots of the nasty things you said to me as well.

So there you go. I changed my number yesterday so you‚Äôd have absolutely no way to text me harassment off of a 7th different number I‚Äôd have to block. I already deleted every social media outlet possible as well, I just made a reddit account to SOMEHOW distract myself while hiding from you. I‚Äôm terrified when I get a text message from my best friend or my mom now. I start therapy next week. I‚Äôve researched on over the counter pills most commonly used for overdosing.

Have fun with the girl who is happy to send horrible horrible things attacking your EX‚Äôs. Wow that‚Äôs low. She‚Äôs lower than I thought you‚Äôd try to get after me. But that‚Äôs okay dude. Do what you can to feel okay, do what you can to attempt to get me out of your head, because no one will ever be good enough. I was the best you could ever get, and I know that..

And I think you know it too.

Good luck finding anyone at all who could put up with even 10% of the absolute shit you gave me.

Goodbye.",31Jan2019,1

But at the same time I'm not doing what I want and I feel like I'm wasting my time here. I really just want to die. I don't want to deal with this anymore.",31Jan2019,1
11,"The bit of information I'll give has me troubled... I can't exactly decide whether to post this here, or on the SuicideWatch sub as I, and I'm sure many others know, when someone starts to give many of their things away, that it could be an indication that person is thinking of suicide. In any case, I'll just post here.

For a very long time, I'd say a bit less than 3 years, I've begun to sink into the deepest depression I've ever felt in my life. Within these years, I've been committed to psych wards multiple times, have had my medication drastically changed, and have been offered ECT at one point as well. I've zero friends, my immediate family lives nowhere close to me and the only kind of attention I do get, are from drunkards, junkies and prostitutes, even though I don't drink, do street drugs or have ever even thought of paying for sex. For some reason, whenever I take any kind of public transportation, or if I'm just out for a walk, I'm often their target.

During these years though, this has never stopped me from trying to go out, meet new people, find things to do in my city / next city over. Of course, me having zero friends still holds true. Also, going out has been a lot less about me having fun, but a means to escape my apartment, meaning that, slowly, over time, I've found less and less interest in things that I do.

This apathy in me, you could say, has now taken over my life. I used to play games, listen to music, watch TV, etc.. It's been years since I've done any of those things, and if I do, I feel incredibly disgusted with myself and if I force myself to do it further, I begin to wail and cry, as if I'm being punished.

Because of those feelings, I've started to think that, well, I clearly get nothing out of these things anymore, I should probably go and donate them to a church or something, which I have been doing for several days now. I don't really feel any regret or remorse for donating my things, nor do I feel happy about it, ""doing it for a good cause"" or whatever. Though, at the very least, someone out there will hopefully find more enjoyment from my things than I have.

I'm unsure how much I want to give away. I tell myself that I want everything in my apartment gone. What I do with myself afterwards, well, I don't know. Suicide is incredibly scary and incredibly painful. I'm too much of a coward to do it myself. Everyday I wish for something else to kill me instead... because at least then it would be unexpected or something. Does that make me suicidal? I'm not sure.

Everyday I live, fear and anxieties kick me out of my apartment into a world that hates me. I've grown so bitter, but mostly apathetic. Junkies and prostitutes keep approaching me and the more they do, the more tempted I get. I wish for death, but never by my own hands. I observe everyone in the world. Then I come back to my apartment, take my medication, which might as well all be placebos at this point, then sleep.",31Jan2019,1

13,"I have this friend who I've known for about 7 years now. One day she just suddenly closed herself off from everybody. It's been just over half a year now. I haven't seen her or heard her speak at all. School might have had a lot of pressure on her, so she decided to skip school the day when we had a test that had a large weighting on our grades. Our friends skipped school every now and then, so I hadn't noticed something was wrong until she was absent for a week. 

She ignored all my texts and calls, so I decided to visit her house after school one day to check up on her. Both her parents work, so she was the only home. No matter how much I rang the bell or called out to her she wouldn't respond. I knew she was home, but stayed absolutely silent. I stayed around for some time until sunset until her parents came back and explained the situation to them. They didn't know that she had been skipping out on school until the school called in. They didn't know what was going on with her until she was properly diagnosed with depression some time after.

I visited her home a few times with some other close friends over the past few months. She lives far away, so it wasn't easy to plan visits. Her family would let us in, but every time she would lock herself in her room. We tried various ways of talking to her, but she wouldn't open her door or interact with us at all.

I think that her studies put a lot of pressure on herself. Her grades began slipping quite a bit for about a year. She did a lot of coaching outside of school, but was also known to be a heavy procrastinator. She has high expectations of herself, wanting to get into a good college, but her grades weren't a very good indication of it. 

I don't know what to do. I haven't contacted her in quite some time. I don't know how to go about talking to her, or if she will even read my messages. Her parents have told me to let her calm down a bit to sort things out, but time is passing, and I'm afraid of what she's going to do. Her friends and I are all graduating this year, and she has to repeat a year. She's very shy, and I rarely see her interact with people outside our friend group, repeating her senior year would be hard on her.

 I have been reading around the depression subreddits, and have found people who were depressed for decades, and those who have very pessimistic views on life. I personally have had several mini depressive episodes in the past, and I have been able to sort out some things myself, but I can't exactly relate to others. I have pretty much lost contact with my friend. It's already been over half a year, and it's hard to imagine how she's coping with everything and how far down the path she is. I don't even know how she feels about me anymore. Does she think of me as a nuisance? Does she get annoyed by me trying the 'generic words of comfort' to make me feel better about myself? It's hard to deal and think about this situation when the only person who knows what's going on is my friend herself, and I'm just there trying random things to try to help her out, with close to no idea of her feelings. It's going to be harder later on, when I have to move onto college soon while she is stuck in high school indefinitely. She lives with her parents, so it's sort of a safe zone for her and something really hard to break out of.

Has anyone gone through something similar before? What was it like having a friend shutting themselves completely? If you are/were depressed, how do you feel about people from the outside actively trying to help you out?

14,"Hello Redditors,

This seems a bit weird, I‚Äôve never posted on reddit before, better yet I‚Äôve never left myself open for the whole world to see but I might have hit my lowest point and I don‚Äôt know where to turn to for help.

Anyone ever felt like they‚Äôre a shadow of what they could be? I thought realising what you‚Äôve been doing wrong and knowing what to fix is half the battle but now it seems like such a monstrous task to tackle, that I‚Äôm stuck and don‚Äôt even know where to start.

I have no ambition, no motivation, no sense of adventure, I‚Äôm not happy, I don‚Äôt make enough money, really the only thing I have going for me is that I‚Äôm physically gifted and even though I don‚Äôt have the energy to go to the gym anymore and give up after 5 minutes of lifting weights Im still in good shape. doubts creep into my head and consume me so easily, I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough. Is there something you can do? Somewhere to start? Someone to turn to? 

Just to give a bit of background I apologise if I‚Äôve jumbled this whole thing up. I‚Äôm 25, living in Sydney. I grew up mostly in a single mom household, my teenage years were spent hanging with the boys, boxing, smoking weed, doing drugs, getting into fights and wasting my time. Ended up getting expelled from school for selling weed, somehow still made it into uni. Fast forward a few years, I‚Äôm 21 uni was a waste of time and money, I work part time as a bouncer, make some extra cash by turning a blind eye towards a few people selling drugs in the club who‚Äôd pay me a protection fee at the door and spend my free time partying or doing nothing. Years of boxing left me with permanent injuries that stopped me from being able to train properly and this was the start of my physical deterioration.

23 meet the most amazing girl, decide its time to get my life together. Scammed myself into a job as a construction foreman even though I only worked a year as an apprentice carpenter the pay was shit $60k per annum but at least it was full time, after a year and a half of busting my balls learning on the job but pretending I knew all along I stepped up to $85k, after 6 months, this wasn‚Äôt good enough for me I needed money and I needed it fast, I played hardball with my employers to get 110k out of them, they refused, I got pissed and it showed as my work ethic dropped tremendously, enough to get me sacked. I hate this shit, running a construction site, being the go to man when things go wrong, have grown men lining up to ask me questions, phones blowing up every 30 seconds, arrogant millionaire clients always talking shit, bosses talking shit, stress, headaches, worrying. I wish I could do something else, but at 25 with financial commitments I don‚Äôt have time or the resources to start a new career or open my own company. 

Now.. Things have changed, my life revolves around hustling for the next dollar, I don‚Äôt enjoy myself, we don‚Äôt go out. Negativity looms over me like a dark shadow that never goes away, I get angry easily, I lose my temper, I‚Äôm lazy, I‚Äôm jealous of other people‚Äôs success.. I see people driving nice cars or living in nice houses and I hate them. This is a toxic mind state I know it‚Äôs wrong to feel this but why do I feel it? 

Every time I promise I‚Äôm going to make a change and I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôve lost count how many times I sat there and thought I‚Äôd had an epiphany and I was going to wake up a changed man but it never happened. I‚Äôm still the same and I need help. 

My fianc√© has a 5 year old son, just like me, the kids dad is out of the picture and I took him as my own even though I was a kid myself and was not equipped to handle the responsibility, but I was there the whole time, I watched him grow, I watched him
go from being a reclusive, quiet, scared kid with delayed speech to the most confident and outgoing young boy in the room. Truth is I love him with all my heart but I‚Äôm losing them slowly, I can see it and somethings gotta give. I‚Äôve never been the ‚Äúemo‚Äù type to listen to sad love songs and be depressed and heartbroken but I feel like right now I‚Äôm on the edge, and if I lose her I‚Äôll spiral down a path of self destruction that I‚Äôll never get out of. What‚Äôs going to happen to her? What‚Äôs going to happen to him? Will anyone love him like me? Will be grow up thinking his dad (me) abandoned him? Then grow up with fucked up trust issues like I did? 

Where do you even go for help? Who the fuck can help you with this? I need anger management for my temper, I need a councillor for my depression, need a financial coach, need a personal trainer, need a relationship coach, parenting adviser.. need an army of people who can help me out, or do I? 

Even one step in the right direction, I would appreciate. Just realised I‚Äôve been typing for an hour, hope I didn‚Äôt bore anyone with my long ass life story. If anyone has been through anything like this and has found a way out I‚Äôd love to hear it

18,"I got prescribed 10 mg of Prozac today and I was doing some research about Serotonin Syndrome ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)). Basically it's a very severe condition that can occur when people mix SSRIs like Prozac and other serotonergic drugs. This left me with a couple of questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Dextromorphethan is one of the drugs that can interact with SSRIs to cause the syndrome. I recently had a bad cough and took a lot of it. Also, I dropped acid in the last 3 months, which also can cause the syndrome when mixed with SSRIs. Am I at risk? I haven't had any drug of any sort for two weeks, and don't plan to while on Prozac, but I can't help but fear that any latent amount of these drugs in still my system could kill me when I start taking Prozac.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate any insight.

19,It would be useful to share any unconventional tips that help depression. For example; I have just discovered that the Wim Hoff helps me a bit. Ulterior methods are seldom talked about and I would like to have as many weapons as possible in the fight against depression.,31Jan2019,1
20,"Hi, everyone. I‚Äôve been struggling with my depression for quite sometime, but have gone through a massive decline over the past month. 

I‚Äôve been off work now for a month and feeling anxiety and stress to return and perform. I‚Äôve been there for 10 years and barely took any time off.  I never fathomed that I would be in this place, I‚Äôve always been a high performer. I‚Äôm a ‚Äòfixer‚Äô. 

Well, I learned the hard way that I‚Äôm no superhero, and the walls came crumbling down on me. I started a low dose of Sertraline 3 weeks ago. After a couple weeks of side effects, which I expected, I‚Äôve noticed it keeps me more sedentary and I don‚Äôt react as dramatically as I did before them, but the fear, anxiety and depression remain in full force, it‚Äôs just my reactions to them are dulled. 

I‚Äôm in therapy twice a week, on meds, exercise, shower, read, write, meditate, sleep, trying to help others, and nothing seems to be working and I‚Äôm losing hope. I keep searching for a fix that will snap me out of this, and the feeling of never finding it leads me to very, very dark thoughts. 

I fear I‚Äôll never have the passion or energy to return to work. It all seems so pointless. I‚Äôve been relatively successful in my career, traveled the world, got sober two years ago, have a supportive family, loving gf, and yet, I feel like disappearing forever. It like my successes in life are now mocking me. 

I always tell myself, and others, this too shall pass, but I‚Äôm losing faith. I feel broken and hopeless. ",31Jan2019,1
21,"I have a chronic illness, epilepsy. Right before my diagnosis, my entire life was derailed and, I finally realized that my mother was a narcissist.

That said, all of that in a short span of time sure as hell didn‚Äôt help y‚Äôknow depression. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more depressed. The one thing that has actually made me smile all this time with this garbage illness is my boyfriend. Never once did he even consider leaving me and, he told me several times to reassure me, he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and wouldn‚Äôt dream of it, he was here for the long haul b/c he loves me. 

The doctor gave me a medicine that has significantly helped but, it‚Äôs a whole mess and the medicine people don‚Äôt wanna give it to me b/c they wanna try and sell two other drugs that don‚Äôt work. 

My Nmom is gonna blame me for that, her mom is acting like I‚Äôm having a fine and dandy time and just telling me BS of ‚Äòletting her God handle it‚Äô when, I‚Äôm an atheist, is just irritating. I‚Äôm not gonna go off on her about it but, it‚Äôs just not helping. 

Honestly, I just want this to end...I am desperate to make it end yet, just that little sprinkle of light from my boyfriend is telling me to keep fighting much as I want to give up. ",31Jan2019,1
22,"I'm active duty military, currently age 19. E-1 rank. I join last year at the beginning of june. My rate is because that is slightly relevant I guess. I hate life and am going into constant debt.

23,"I read Tara Condell's suicide note and it really hit home for me. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years. Sometimes it seems like the little things in life aren't enough to make up for all the suffering I see in the world. I can't understand how someone can have 4 houses, take 12 cruises a year and fly around in private jets when everyone else is dying. How can we be this selfish as a species? Darwinism no longer controls us, it's survival of the wealthy, which I know I will never be.",31Jan2019,1

25,"I have been depressed since the better part of a decade now. I have panic attacks, bouts of mood swings, tried almost everything to get out of it, like meditation and travel. Nothing seems to work. It's very hard for me to talk about it, I just feel embarrassed. Recently (been a year now) I have been having severe suicidal thoughts. I have nearly attempted suicide almost 10 times now. I am scared of having even a single second with my own thoughts. Please help. Any trick to keep these thoughts at bay? Any help will be appreciated.
