2,"*I'm a spoiled child who gets whatever I want.*

I know that.

I know I'm lazy, I can't find a reason to get up in the morning and when I do it takes up half my energy just to get through an hour of school.

I'm told all the time others have it worse than me, I know that, and I'm ***starting to think I'm faking it all.***

I don't  know if I am. I don't know if I do have depression and anxiety and high-functioning autism.

I had a panic attack this morning and my dad forced me to go to the ER.

On the way there he told me I was just faking hyperventilating. The reason I had a panic attack was because;

He woke up yelling at me to clean my room, I did start cleaning my room but he kept on yelling, telling me I just stress him and my mom out. *""Do you even consider our feelings? It's always about how you feel."", ""This always happens when we tell you to do something"".*

Then they started just taking stuff out of my room. *""It looks like a hoarder lives here."", ""This room is such a fucking mess, why can't you just clean it?""*

It does happen all the time, when they tell me to do something they always yell at me, I get upset badly.

When I try to tell them how I can't find a reason to do anything anymore, they always deflect onto me saying it's because I don't listen.

I was in the ER and I could barely talk because I was actually having a lot going through my head, I didn't know what was happening. My dad kept telling the doctors it's because I was told to do something, that's why I was there.

I know there are people out there who have it worse than me, I get reminded that every time, I breakdown crying a lot because I don't even know how to feel. I decided to close off my emotions with my family since it always gets me into bad situations.

I take anti-depressants and I see a therapist.

***I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it because I don't even know if I should even be sad over it, am I actually depressed? Am I just exaggerating everything? I can't tell anymore and I feel like a huge problem. Because all I do is cause them.***

I just decided to stop talking about my feelings with friends and family, with my therapist I don't know anymore.

I plan to start talking about my feelings once I'm 18 and move out.

***I cry a lot too knowing I spent so much of my life being absolutely miserable. I wanted to be normal, I wanted to by like all the other girls who go on snap chat and have a group of friends who go out to Starbucks, because they were happy, and normal. I just want someone to support me.***

***I just want a hug.***

10,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.

To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.

One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.

In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. 

In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.

Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.

Many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.

Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.

Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.

This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. 

For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.

In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.

For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.

In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.

As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.

Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…

For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.

One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.

That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. 

As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.

What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.

One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… you've never experienced love or given love…. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on it's own is true love.

To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:

As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:

I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad… she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.

For me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.

It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.

So how the hell do we undo this?

Not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.

To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.

Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… it's not and never was a true representation of love… I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then I let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… I got angry at the injustice of life itself… I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli “Killing in the Name of” and “Give it Away” and “Sabotage.” In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.

Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.

From that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.

You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.

Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.",26Mar2019,36

13,"Hi all, first time posting here so let me know if I've done anything wrong.

My anxiety comes from dealing with day to day life in a world that causes my depression. I struggle with the fundamentals of existence, and, at the risk of sounding like a petulant child, with the unfairness of life. I struggle with HAVING to struggle when I never asked to be here. I'm not sure which comes first, the day to day struggle leading to depressed frustration with existence, or if my constant awareness of the endless struggle of the bigger picture makes dealing with the day to day more difficult.

On paper my life is decent, now. A fiance, a good job, plans for the future (saving for a house etc). But I'm burnt out from over 20 years of *coping*. Coping with being born to crap parents and no money. Coping with emotional and verbal abuse growing up. Copying with school, a job I hated, unemployment, fighting for social welfare, moving from house to house to house because landlords are selling or whatever, dealing with the stress of the job I now have. Coping with living in a world where if you don't have money, you can forget mental health care. Coping with living in a world where I would be more entitled to a house if I pumped out kids I can't provide for, than being the responsible adult I am. Coping with a world consumed by power and money and where if you don't have money there is no provision for a roof over your head or food in your belly. Coping with living in a world where most of my life is going to be spent working a pointless job just to get by until I die.

I've tried CBT. CBT is a bandaid, as far as I can see. It helps you deal with the bigger picture by breaking the smaller picture into bitesize chunks and changing some thought patterns. But I don't have thought patterns, I have a distinct awareness of the fundamental difficulty of a life I never asked for and have struggled through for as long as it has lasted. I don't know what the solution is, if any, or what the correct path is to follow for help.

Any experiences of similar depression/difficulty, and any advice on what routes were taken to dig out of this hole, would be greatly appreciated. I'm exhausted.",26Mar2019,9

I recently removed a person from my life. It seemed like they were really important but in reality they were definitely a distraction for my real problems. My social anxiety, my depression, my dissatisfaction with my professional/monetary status, my frustration with not being able to move out even though I have a full time job (33k a year is so not enough). Not to mention I havent had the desire to do anything but drag myself to work for... probably years at this point. I have random spurts of motivation but the depression always comes back and nothing brings me real joy. I used to draw and write and play games. Now I can barely do anything but scroll through reddit.
I'm planning on going back to school in the fall (which my job will pay for entirely yay.) I've joined meet up, and I have plans to get put on a med for my depression. I've already been in talk therapy for close to a year now as well.
What I'm wanting to know is how long did it take you to adjust to a huge life change? Did a med help you? I guess I'm just feeling really mixed up. I find myself randomly bursting into tears all the time looking at my life, looking at how I can't maintain hobbies or build friendships without being massively flakey because my mood is so unpredictable. 
Hopefully that wasnt TOO all over the place.

Currently I have stomach hurts, and I don't assist in more than a half of my subjects. I feel insecure about myself in take a decision: I have a good scholarship and my parents are happy with it. They remind me that is a good support for financial state of the family and I'm crying a lot because I have low school performance than I used to be in high school.
I was a good student with good grades (the third excellent student in the generation of my high school) but now I feel like it was a fake.

I see in me more bad things than good things. If I do a alternative route I will make the same. At this point I see useless my life. I don't have a goal (I enter to college only for don't work) and If I have I will fail in that. I feel like someone else would do better than me: like daughter, student or human.

24,"Hello,

   So, I have been trying to change as a person. I am trying to be more positive and trying to like myself more. However, nothing works.



I go to the Gym, I do my make up now, I dress in clothes that are cute, I shower every single day now. Nope. Doesn't matter. I think what feeds me not liking myself is how people talk to me. I get talked to like I am complete garbage and I beg for people to be nice to me and they don't stop. They will never be nice to me. They make fun of the noise I make when I am doing exercises, which I haven't done in years, so it hurts so bad. If I post a selfie on my Facebook trying to be positive, internet trolls come in and let me know they hate me. I just feel like trash to everyone. Everyone just takes out their anger and issues on me.

  
 
 I just have been crying and crying. I just cannot be happy. I feel like happiness is not an option. I always talk about how I wish to not live anymore, and it's getting worse. It's getting worse and worse. I have no self worth.



  I am just going to say I am too sick to go to the gym now and not post pictures anymore. I wanted to do cosplay modelling someday when I get my body the way I want it, but I know I will get so much backlash to where I cannot handle it.
