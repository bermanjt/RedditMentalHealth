1,"Like I don't even know how to start this. I'm 17 years old male, going to high school. Also English is not my first language but you should be able to understand. 
The thing is that I can't find a reason for my sadness. The only thing I know is that everything is going downhill. It started probably 7-8 months ago. My parents are I don't really know. I really try to just ignore them and don't spend a lot of time with them. I don't like people at all. I'm not ugly at all, I have a decent amount of money and never had problems with school. Like everything seems good. But it's not. I just want to kill myself. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I stopped doing everything. Grades are very bad right now, I can't focus on anything. I've seen that I should find something that I enjoy but no luck. I tried going out with friends, tried drawing ( I was very good at digital but stopped because I didn't enjoy it anymore ) ( both on paper and on the computer ), tried training, tried changing my daily routines, waking up earlier and nothing at all. Every day it seems worse. I don't feel anything towards people that I really loved. Like the only thing that prevents me from doing that is my dad. Mom became abusive, she keeps telling me that I'm not important anymore whenever I try to speak about anything. I pushed so many people away so they won't care when I kill myself. I have diabetes but I don't think it is important now. I got it when I was 3 years old so it's not a reason for this. The only thing I keep thinking of is ways to commit suicide. I don't want to meet new people because I don't want them to attach to someone like me. When I don't think about suicide I don't think about anything. It's just blank. One thing to mention is my ex, I met her 4 years ago and couldn't move on about that. Like I'm so happy that she just moved on, like how the fuck people even move on? Whenever some girl tries something with me I'll try to find my ex in her. But there is no way its because of her. I texted her a few days ago and I feel nothing. I was like ok it might be better when I text her but no. It's not better. Every day keeps getting worse as I said. Did I move on? Or is it the same as it is for everyone else that stopped caring? I'm fucking lost, I need to go to a therapist and I will in like week or so but I just feel I might end it before that. 
Is there some way of getting out of this?",16Oct2019,1
2,"It was Oct 8, my birthday, and I was all alone in my apt. I realized i‚Äôve never had a healthy relationship and all my friendships were pretty one sided. My whole life I never had friends to invite to birthdays, valentines day in school was a day I dreaded and i‚Äôve always been alone. I thought I had friends because I talked to them at school, work, and hung out with them a couple times but when I needed them they disappeared. Tell me how I planned a whole surprise birthday for this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and she doesn‚Äôt even send a happy birthday text for mine? I feel like in relationships I am always the one to give more and why is that?? Why have I never connected with someone on a deeper level were we call each other soulmates or take pictures together to post on social media? Is it my physical appearance? Do I stink or have something in my teeth 24/7? Am I unknowingly an asshole? It was my 22nd birthday and I was looking in the mirror asking myself these things. I‚Äôve been depressed for months. All I do is put on my mask for work, come home to watch netflix, and repeat the same thing. I moved to a new city 2 years ago and this is not the fresh start I had hoped so. I am by myself on my birthday again! People at work who I thought could be my friends pity me because I live alone, have no car and only work because no one invites me to do anything! My life is so pathetic 

It‚Äôs really hard to look on the bright side when I try everyday to start fresh and it never gets any better.

Sorry for the long rant, I can‚Äôt afford therapy.",16Oct2019,1
3,"I wish it was the other way around. People tried to fuck with me too literally... in every way... But today I said to a girl that I'd like to be friends outside of a group we both go to... and she said no, because I scare her. I asked if it's because I have heavy problems right now, or because she saw how angry at the fried who broke my trust (refused to give me back the money they borrowed after swearing that they're not the type to betray my trust)... She said both...

I feel alone...

I asked the city to help me with a problem in my apartment, and they helped at first, but now they harass me doing visits and want to force useless repairs that I don't want and would stress me out. While ignoring the issue that is a danger to my health because they do't have the tools to detect the problem, they want to make me end up getting an even bigger raise in rent for cosmetic repairs... I don't want any repairs done anymore... It went horribly bad and I want to move, not live in a damn scrap yard for another year with no end in sight.

I just want the damn peace and have fun with a fried.

Not being told to be positive when my very life is in danger and I have no opportunity to move... by someone who has a big home and a lover to help her... Not going to see my friend only to end up doing their chores, because it's too gross to have food rotting all over, or because they demand it...

I just want to have fun... a damn break after I almost died. Not being told that I'm too scary to befriend and help because I'm in pain. That's just giving me more reasons to feel hurt and angry...

When she said that... it devastated me... It took me by surprise... and I was vulnerable at that time... 

Then I find out that I can't put the disaster that almost killed me behind me, because the city won't stop trying to impose more repairs on me. I want to abandon ship! Not have a crew of strangers make it even worse! Do violence, break my things, screw up so bad that it's worse... and the chemicals they added made me sick for weeks...

I'd rather die than endure that again... I can't even describe how much violence I got...

I just want to bail... I want people to help not make it worse... but people don't have the intelligence and integrity to do so...

And no I don't need to be drugged into forced happiness, I need a safe place to live and a trustworthy friend who believe in me! Unfortunately, they don't come in pill form, and certainly not in electroshock form.

I hate society's ideal of help and kindness. It's just forceful conformism and slavery.",16Oct2019,2

7,"7 years ago I met this amazing girl on Instagram when we were both 13.  She lived in Ohio and I was from Massachusetts. We talked as friends and grew into a relationship. At the time I knew I wanted her for the rest of my life but I still fell into selfish ways. I would break up with her and talk to other girls. While she just waited cause she was head over heals for me and then we‚Äôd get back together and that happened countless times.. the final time I broke up with her I really didn‚Äôt want to. I was taking advice from my dad because some stuff went down and we were going to meet in person again for another summer and we‚Äôd already been talking for 3 years online. So I asked my dad if I should wait till next summer to finally take the chance? I was angry that we couldn‚Äôt see each other and I was upset.. we‚Äôd been planning all year to meet this time and it was ruined because of some stupid stuff she did with her friends.. my dad told me that eventually I‚Äôd find someone else and I shouldn‚Äôt waste my youth on one relationship when there‚Äôs thousands of different chances.. so I broke up with her.. it was one of the hardest parts of her life. She was alone and hurting because I left her again.. I had a itch in the back of my mind that ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt what you want don‚Äôt make the same stupid mistakes again, you‚Äôre in love with her..‚Äù a few weeks go by or maybe months and she found someone else. A physical relationship and I just broke. I said some really cruel things to her, very very cruel things.. she told me ‚ÄúI want you to hurt like you hurt me‚Äù and I went ballistic and i said ‚Äúfine you want to see me hurt?‚Äù And I proceeded to cut my self at least a hundred times on my thighs and repeatedly sending her pictures of what I was doing and she begged me to stop and she cried and she pleaded and I just wouldn‚Äôt.. years go by she‚Äôs been in a few relationships and we don‚Äôt talk.. I find a girl who abused me but I took it because I felt that‚Äôs what I deserved.. she cheated on me and left me, I was having a breakdown and the girl from Ohio would occasionally check on me. She saw that we broke up and she messaged me. Her relationship with her last boyfriend wasn‚Äôt really working out and they broke up so we decided to talk again as friends and help each other out.. she eventually went to a mental hospital because she wanted to kill herself but I called her everyday she was there.. we had amazing conversations and I could tell she was starting to feel okay now that she was taking medication and getting some therapy.. when she got out I bought her a plane ticket and she came to see me, spent a month here and everything was going amazing and we started dating again.. when she went home I really missed her, we‚Äôd talk on the phone and text and stuff but I really missed her. I was supposed to fly out in November so I can be there for her birthday but I begged she‚Äôd come back in October cause I missed her so much, because of that she missed her appointments and couldn‚Äôt get her medication and stuff and she‚Äôs been here for a bit now. But she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me.. the month before everything seemed okay. It was like we were in love again and she said that she thought she was but now that she‚Äôs off her medication she‚Äôs falling back into her old toxic behaviors she started developing after the things I did to her.. we argued a lot the first week she was here and I wish I would‚Äôve just kept my mouth shut and I wish that I would‚Äôve just went in November because we‚Äôd probably still be together right now.. she leaves October 24th and it kills me seeing her here knowing that I had her again.. knowing I was a lot better.. but she doesn‚Äôt want me anymore.. she says she doesn‚Äôt want anyone for awhile until she can love herself.. and there‚Äôs basically no chance I‚Äôll have her back.. how do I forgive myself? How do I stop hating myself? How do I love myself? How do I let her go? How do I stop these suicidal thoughts? I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice.. I know I don‚Äôt deserve sympathy.. that‚Äôs not what I want.. I want to be okay.. I want to be able to keep living.. but my thoughts are bringing me down and killing me..",16Oct2019,7

9,"I thought I had a good medication but it really started messing up everything for me and I have to get off of it. 

TBH I'm just sick of being on meds (and I know my cycles of years on and years off meds) and I don't want anything new right now.

I'm withdrawing w/ a complete plan from my psych (and actually sticking to it this time), but my mood swings are driving me up a wall. 

Looking for a little support in getting through the next days: any tips for when you have to keep going to work and school and talking to people and not being able to cry or scream all while feeling physically sick?",16Oct2019,1
10,"Most days I'm unhappy with myself. Some days I use this to motivate me and I exercise and diet and am friendly and so so happy. Other days I don't enjoy any of my hobbies, friends, dogs, or just anything I'd once enjoy, and want to just stop living so bad. It feels like it's probably 50/50 or leaning to the more unhappy spectrum. Honestly I don't really lash out at people much. I just am quiet and my friends want to know what's up but I just deal with everything alone. I'm so scared that I'll kill myself before high school ends but I'm even more scared of living a long life this way. Any thoughts? Maybe if it reminds you of a certain type of depression or if you guys have any ideas to combat it.",16Oct2019,2
11,"I am a very high functioning, unfortunately depressed human being who has been finding it more and more difficult to fight the suicidal thoughts. The thoughts of trying to swallow pills, cut my veins open, hang myself, drive my car off the road going 80+ are always running through my mind, I can't bring myself to do them and they make me extremely nauseous with myself. I don't even have it all /that/ bad so I just feel like shit even more for not wanting to live. I feel like I can't talk about it with anyone because I fear coming off as entitled for wanting to die over continuing existence. I fear opening up to my therapists because I don't want locked away for thought I won't act on, or be under some watch that will only cause me more stress and anxiety and money than it's worth. I wish I didn't feel like this on the inside.",16Oct2019,3
12,"I feel like I'm not the protagonist of my own life story. I feel like I'm a side character in my life and nothing that I say or do matters at all.

I don't enjoy anything that I used to. Heck, I don't enjoy anything at all anymore. I can't do most of the things that I used to be able to do. I'm not as smart as I used to be.

I feel like everything that makes me *me* has drained away, leaving an empty shell. I'm nobody now. I have no passions, no hobbies, no interests, no favorites.

When I'm not crippled by anxiety, I have a constant, burning mass in my chest that repeats ""I just can't."" I just can't do this anymore. I just can't take another day. I just can't.

The worst part, though, is that at the end of the day I know that nobody cares. I have literally one friend and I can never seem to get in touch with her; she's always too busy for me. I don't have any social media accounts other than Reddit, and let's be real here, if I deleted all of my account this second, nobody would care or even notice. I have no attachments.

I am currently taking anti-depressant medications. These include 80mg of fluoxetine and 300mg of buproprion daily; if you aren't already aware, those are the maximum dosages that a doctor will prescribe, which makes me feel like there isn't anything more that can be done in that regard.

My heart hurts and I feel like I have to bear the weight of the world on my shoulders alone.

I feel that nobody would even notice if I just disappeared, if I fell asleep tonight and never woke up.

I'm hopelessly lost in an ocean that's far too big for such a tiny minnow.",16Oct2019,3

15,"Hello, I don't know how to start this exactly but here it goes. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact that I know my death would hurt my mom. I could used to use this to talk myself down or rationalize with myself. I could prevent myself from hurting myself, I could chase away the suicidal thoughts even if it was for a little while. But that hasn't been nearly as effective anymore. I've been hitting myself, nearly driving my car into the tree, nearly overdosing and several other- I don't know what to call them -near attempts(?).  


I'm currently in therapy for trauma that I think is the most basic root of my depression, I see a psychiatrist who has prescribed me medication in the past, I've gone through lexapro, wellbutrin and mirtazapine so far. The wellbutrin helped the most so far but even then it just made waking up and starting the day not as daunting. I think these things will help me eventually, but I can feel myself getting worse and worse every week. Some days are much better than others, but overall I can see and feel the trend going downwards. I rarely attend my classes, I have thoughts of suicide 24/7, if I could disappear or die without affecting those I care about I would do it definitely. I just wish I could poof away.  
I feel that recent events have made me feel this way. My SO of about 6 years, one of only 2 people I have ever talked   
to about how I feel, has been severely distant from me recently and our relationship is on the verge of collapse. I confided all of this in a friend, I don't know why I started talking to him but I did and he became the second person I ever talked to about how I feel and what's going on emotionally with me. He helped me for a while, I felt like he was my brother, and I felt like things between me and my SO started to take a turn for the better. However, due to stupid mistakes made by me, circumstance and life being what life is- my SO and my best-friend have developed feelings for each other.  


This is where it gets harder to type all of this out. I don't know why I'm doing this, or what to do really, but I'm still here- trying to be there for my SO(?). I'm in a pseudo open relationship basically, my best-friend has no intention of backing down (he has 'justified' reasoning so don't judge him too harshly) and my SO(?) is conflicted on who to choose or what to do. I just wish I could disappear, I feel frozen in my tracks, waiting for life to happen to me instead of living my life. As I felt like I began to get some control, like I was starting to become the main character of my own story- it got knock right back down to how I felt at 5 right after I was molested. All the crap that I felt I made progress on is resurfacing but now I have no one to help me with it. I can only talk to my therapist, who I only see once a week, or my psychiatrist who I see once a month. I can't talk to my friends because I share all of my friends with my ""best-friend"" and ""SO"". I have an extremely hard time talking to anyone, I feel myself having absolutely zero trust in anyone in my life anymore. I've backslid on all my social anxieties, I can't even say hello to someone walking down the hall anymore, buying things from a cashier is a momentous task for me now.  


I just want someone to talk to I guess. I want an actual, genuine, human connection. I want to feel like someone actually cares about me and that I'm not just another stepping stone in their life, another support beam to hold them up. God I'm sorry I'm just rambling now. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'm running on very little sleep.

Sept 21st I got home after work to a package from someone who broke my heart , played mind games, and spiraled way down. I can't explain what happened because it felt like I had blacked out after opening it. I tried going on a walk to distract myself and dropped my phone somewhere along the way (this comes in to play) I went to bed shortly after and set my actual alarm for work the next morning. I ended up sleeping all day to wake up and have a panic attack because I fucked up missed work.  I tried to go in the next morning to apologize. While driving there I had a panic attack and just couldn't do it. Now it has been a solid 3 weeks and i never called in or did anything.

24,"I'm not really sure if this is something that would belong in a group like this, so I'm sorry if I'm posting wrongly. I've (22, F) always gone through ""phases"" of my life where I was either really happy or on the brink of suicide. I haven't been seriously sad in a long, long time, but I feel like I'm starting to slip back into those negative thoughts and I really want to get ahead of that.  

Basically, I know I have a really great life. I have a supportive boyfriend who I've been with for 6 years - we've had a lot of ups and downs as all relationships do, but currently we are on pretty good terms. I have a great group of friends who are very fun and easy to get along with. I have an okay job that pays all of my bills. I know all of these things, but I still feel overwhelmed with sadness and loss of meaning in life. I'm constantly tired and I alway push off tasks that I want to get done to later weeks. I know I should be taking better care of myself (eating healthy, consistently working out, taking makeup off before going to bed, etc.) but I just don't want to and would rather lay in bed. I didn't used to be this way.

I feel like everyday is the same as the last. There's no real meaning to what I'm doing, I don't care about the work I do or who I'm around. I've been feeling like I should make a career change, but when I get around to actually applying to places, I start to worry if I am making a mistake and start second guessing myself. I've been unhappy at my job for months and my boyfriend thinks it's the main catalyst of me being upset, but I'm scared to leave a job I've been at for awhile. I feel like if I'm going to leave my job, I should do something that gives my life more meaning, right? I just can't help but think to myself, ""Is this really all that life is? There has to be more to it."" 

Other than me being unhappy about work, I constantly feel like I am annoying to people if I talk to them about my issues. I go to my boyfriend a lot, for example. While he insists that he's here for me to talk to, I can't help but think to myself that I'm coming off annoying. It's like I overthink EVERYTHING and create unnecessary anxiety for myself. Then I start to worry about my overthinking and what people must think. 

I just remember a time where I wasn't feeling this way - when I felt confident in myself and knew what I wanted. I felt important at my job and appreciated in my relationships with people. I was so content and happy with my life and I'm unsure what changed. I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I feel like my mind is tricking me into thinking things are a certain way, when others say they're not. 

What are some ways I can better help myself? Do you think I should talk to a professional for help? Do you have any advice? Do you think I'm just in a rut with my life and need to change it up? 

Thank you in advance, I appreciate it!",16Oct2019,1

That she and the other girl that works there have families and houses to look after etc.
And that i dont have it that bad in life 
( i started not wanting to go to work anymore cuz i had a depressive episode for like a month straight) i hated working there. I wasnt this depressed i  years. I was at my lowest point. I did not want to leave my bed let alone work with people that would only drive me more insaine.
So. Am i just dumb and should suck it up and just work? Im so confused. I feel bad for quiting that job but i really didnt like it.
I just felt so bad that everything was my fault again.",16Oct2019,1
28,"Finals is up around the corner but i am really not motivated to study at all. (I dont live in the states) I socialize with people really well and seems really optimistic when I'm outside especially with other people. However when i went home i just lost motivation to do anything when i think that exam is coming. I am doing decently well and definitely getting complacent, feeling that theres no need to study. This mindset is messing up my life as i lost motivation to do other things and end up browning the internet everyday.

I feel like i need someone to keep me accountable but my family and friends just aren't able to do the job. Is there anyway or platform for me to interact with people so that they will make sure i studies and be more motivated? I just feel like maybe a stranger online can make me better, I'm literally running out of choices. I don't want my life to be a mess. Please help.",16Oct2019,97
29,"So I really wish I knew how to use Reddit better. My goal in coming here was to find a place where I could have my own little platform to vent without folks thinking I‚Äôm weak or that I just want attention. I have nothing to gain here so I feel comfortable expressing my self. I am a 32 year old male who has been extremely depressed lately. I hate using the word depressed, in real life I do not say it due to all the stigma that‚Äôs attached to the subject. I feel like if I let on to anyone how I feel
Inside I will lose my rights and be locked in a padded room or something. I could write pages on each think I touch on in this post. 

I‚Äôve turned to this because the anger and sadness I feel a lot of the time are becoming overwhelming. When I mention things that bring me down or make me feel upset inside to my spouse she always seems to take anything I say and make it an attack on her somehow and then I get really down because the one person who i put my faith and hope in ends up attacking me and saying things that only make me feel worse and more alone. I know it sounds weak but as I am typing this stuff it is making me cry. I find that when i address my inner thoughts I seem to always get even more upset in comparison to if I try and bottle it up. Bottling it has led me to extreme anger issues, again, why I am here letting some of it out. 

I don‚Äôt know what I want to hear from anyone or why I feel like letting this out... I try so much to be a better and more happy person but it seems like on the daily there is something that triggers me to be negative again. I used to use alcohol to help me relax at night until I realized that alcohol flares my temper. After making an ass of my self two times I vowed I was done with alcohol and have been.  Not being addicted is nice but it still leaves me hanging with no kind of crutch or outlet and that sucks. 

I am going to cut this post kind of short and continue to explore reddit. I am not sure where this post will end up or if anyone will even see it..

If you made it through this read, thank you for showing me the time. I really do appreciate good people. Thank you.",16Oct2019,1
30,"I‚Äôm in a really dark place right now, have been for a while. I have been struggling with depression, an eating disorder and suicide since I was 8. I am now almost 21 and I‚Äôm just so tired of trying and fighting it. I don‚Äôt even remember what it was like before this. I finally got help at the start of this year and got put on medication which seemed to help for a little while but now its not doing anything. I just don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore I‚Äôm so tired and I just don‚Äôt want to do it. I stopped going to uni months ago, I don‚Äôt have a job, I sleep for 15 hours a day, I feel nothing, I can‚Äôt do anything. I tried so hard for so many years. I worked so hard at school, I got straight As while working 20 hours a week and living alone because my dad was in jail. I thought everything would be fine after school, that everything would change when I got to uni. But I‚Äôm just so tired. I don‚Äôt have any friends and no one cares about me. I just don‚Äôt want to be like this for my entire life. I don‚Äôt want to have to try so hard just to live every single day anymore. If I died no one would even notice for at least a week. Not even the person I live with. Its been 12 years like this and I hate it and I‚Äôm tired and I just want it to go away. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",16Oct2019,3
31,"The only good thing is that I don't cry anymore, but the numb feeling in my wrist is coming back. Whenever my anxiety and depression comes in, I always feel my left wrist numb just like the first time I've tried to commit suicide, I thought I was getting better. I'm not. 

The pressure is too much. I'm so sorry for ranting here, but, I dunno, I don't know where to go. I don't want to talk to my family because they're one of the main reasons I'm like this. What do I do? The things I did to keep my own demons away didn't work at all. I'm lost.",16Oct2019,5
32,"I went to my doctor and got an anti-depressant about a week ago. I feel like they are working well; I still have my moments, but overall I feel better. Should I still go to therapy? I won't be able to meet with my doctor until the end of the month, so I can't ask them.",16Oct2019,3
34,"I pressure myself too much constantly and especially in sport. Whenever I don‚Äôt play well I get really really depressed. Even a minor mistake can push me over the edge. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have someone constantly pushing for my position in the team. Please help me, I‚Äôm not sure what I can do",16Oct2019,2
35,"My sister was recently diagnosed with depression after she lost one of her best friends a few months ago from taking his own life. Even though I‚Äôve been trying to spend more time with her, she hasn‚Äôt fully opened up and the communication just isn‚Äôt there. I know all too well about the faces and walls people put up to hide their depression. I‚Äôm seriously worried no matter what she tells me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",16Oct2019,1
36,"Gf and I broke up one month ago(semi-mutual break up) and ever since then I‚Äôve been spiraling downwards, yet again. I was severely depressed all last year, and I finally started to move forward this year. I‚Äôve lost around 30 pounds this year, went back to uni, and got a job. Life was going well, and I finally thought I met the one. Due to unfortunate life events, she became severely depressed and broke up with me a month ago. We didn‚Äôt end on bad terms, and she said at some later point she‚Äôd want to try things again with me. I remain hopeful, but knowing how things usually work out for me, I feel as if she‚Äôll move on and leave me behind. It‚Äôs been eating me up like crazy, and I have no idea what to do since I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this. 

After we broke up, I started working out like crazy in order to distract myself, and I thought I was finally getting over it; however, this week has gotten really bad. A wave of depression has hit me like a damn tidal wave, and I can barely function. Work is beyond difficult, and I think I might have to quit. I haven‚Äôt worked out this week and I‚Äôve been feeling very lethargic. Overall things are getting worst and worst everyday and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Therapy isn‚Äôt helping me either. I‚Äôve been eating like crazy this week as well. I‚Äôve also been feeling on edge(nothing I would act on but holy fuck). 

Life is so fucking difficult right now and I don‚Äôt think I can do another year of depression. I‚Äôve tried so many antidepressants in the past which haven‚Äôt helped me at all. I‚Äôm honestly terrified, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My whole body hurts, and I have zero energy too work out. I don‚Äôt want to be depressed, it‚Äôs prevented me from doing so many things.",16Oct2019,1
37,I been feeling rather depressed as of late. I often do not feel like doing anything execpt sleeping. I feel exetremely lonely too. It feel to me that everyone around me is too wrap in their problems to offer me any support me. Also my remaining family has abandon me. Thanks.,16Oct2019,1
39,"Hi everyone.

I have depression and anxiety, I'm going through a really bad time because of work pressure and relationship trouble (living with my grandmother, she doesn't allow my boyfriend to come over because she doesn't like him for non legit reasons, but i get it, it's her home in the end).

I'm so tired all the time. I try to eat right, exercise, think positive, but I feel like I can't take it anymore.

I can't afford a therapist, and I probably wouldn't manage to talk to one anyways, and the only time I was on antidepressants I nearly committed suicide.

I'm not sure what to do anymore, everything just  feels pointless and painful.",16Oct2019,2
41,"Pardon my English. It's my final year of highschool so im pushing myself to A student. My fifth week report just arrived and i got a 92 for my average. A part of me think this is a good grade but another half was like: im not good enough and i'll be worse and worse through this year. what if i fall back to 70s? 80s? It's not good enough for me. But im no longer motivated and im panicing because i dont wanna do anything. All my hobbies nolonger cheer me up. I used to play online games till 3am but rn i just wanna stay in bed and do nothing. I have to fill up my portfolio asap before the portfolio review in mid november. My tutor doesnt understand whats going on and he thought im wasting my time so he's forcing me to do extra work everyday. I really like him and i dont want to explain and being a crybaby all the time. 10 things on my todo list everyday and they stack up because im becoming less and less productive. Maybe i do need a break but i know that will ruin all my plans. Recently i've been emotional and weak. Anything can make me angry and when i see something sad, touchey or relateble, i cry. My friends do care for me but i feel like if i say too much then they wont listen. My mom is planning for the wedding with her boyfriend, although we live in the same house we only talk for like 20mins during dinner, and the topic was never me. I tried to communicate but she doesnt listen. I'm tired all day and i wish i can sleep more. Also it's kinda funny that i started to eat alot. Sometimes i wanna scream outloud or cry for 2 hours and hope all my stress can disappear. 
Help? Anyone have been through this? How long this will last?",16Oct2019,3
42,"So I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety as a teenager. Over the years going to therapy, I eventually came out of it somehow feeling better.

Now that I'm about a year away from finishing grad school and working in the field of education, I feel alone, alienated, I feel I give weird vibes to people when I don't mean to, I feel that people don't like me.

I'm not losing sleep, I'm eating okay, and I'm able to go to school and work without an anxiety attack but I obsess over these feelings and thoughts. Its draining. 

Anyone go through something like this? Anything help? I would appreciate and love to read people's stories as to what helped them.

Thank you all for reading : /",16Oct2019,1
