1,"Hey, first of all thank you all for taking your time to read this and for sharing your personal opinions.

I finished therapy about a month ago and am still taking anti depressants. I feel okay, like, I started feeling again and for the first time in a loong time I have actual hope for the future. I am curious about life.
But honestly, since my depression was there for a major part of my life, I don't really know how to live. Or what my personality is.
I'm currently living through each day but it feels so.. weird. 
I don't really know what to do and how ""normal"" people usually schedule their day.
Anyone whose been in a similar situation- how did you manage to get to a ""normal life"" / to sustain a good mental health and to live without doubting everything you do?",08Oct2019,3

4,"My wife has been cheating for years, we had been in a loveless, sexless marriage for a year at this point. so I kicked her out and filed for divorce, and sole custody. 

During this time her exbestfriend has been helping me get through everything and we slowly realized that we have a strong connection and started spending everyday with each other. 

We would talk have fun and be on each other to the point that she started to get very territorial over me. She would tell other women to stay away from her man, that's me. And I loved that because I'm like that too. 

Well something happened(idk what) and suddenly she's barely talking to me gave me back the house key and said she needs to process somethings. 

I am in the final stages of my custody and divorce, and things are a bit messy on that end which is stressful but she refuses to talk to me about whats going on, and it's this thought that whoever I get close to or have anything with that turns into pain, suffering and the sense of loss that makes me severely depressed. 

It's more than an emotional state of mind for me it's a very real physical thing that causes me to not only have a loss of appetite, but my body refuses to keep down any food I try to eat. 

The last time this happened, over the spand of 5 months I lost 100lbs, surviving off of coffee, water, cigs and whatever I managed to retain after my body would reject food. I went fro. 250lbs to 150lbs. 

RN its starting I have no appetite, and my body simply wont allow food again. Ive lost 10lbs in a week and I'm trying to do what the doctor told me to do last time which is workout to create an appetite. 

My depression doesn't stop me from taking care of my kids, it just stops me.",08Oct2019,4

6,"Hi All, 

I'm having a serious panic right now. Worked 12 hours in a job that pays but doesn't fulfill me. I have no aspiration no more, I don't have friends that call me or ask me if I'm well and I'm in a loving relationship that's only destined to die due to my constant low mood and inability to actually make a move in the direction I want due to fear. Nor that I know where I want to be, but I think making money and solitude don't really look like the future I want. 
Any suggestions, anyone who relocated, moved job, decided to stay for good?

I've already moved away from my country, when I was 21 now I'm 28 and I feel trapped. I don't want to end up feeling this way when may be too late to make a move. 

Please any of you has a word of advice? 

I'm gonna post this on all subreddits I know being that this is the only way I get to interact with anyone besides work.

Thanks for reading me.",08Oct2019,2

Thank you!!",08Oct2019,3
9,"I have officially shut down. I have had the worst 3 years of my life and if things don’t get better soon I don’t know if I will be able to make it in this existence. I am ignored at home and at school and the stress of keeping up with schoolwork and not being able to afford my hobby is destroying my inside. My uncle, who had seems perfectly healthy before, has also moved into stage 4 thyroid cancer. I don’t know how I’m going to deal with his potential passing after losing my grandma 4 months ago. I can’t stop thinking about him and it is debilitating me. I can’t focus on anything anymore and I keep zoning out in the middle of class. I don’t know what to do as my mom doesn’t understand this emotional shutdown I am having and none of my friends will answer my texts asking to talk or go out. I don’t know what to ducking do with my life from here.",08Oct2019,2
