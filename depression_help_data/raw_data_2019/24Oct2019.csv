0,"I just can't stand being me i hate evey aspect of myself and want nothing more than to disappear. I know that I'd probably make people's lives so much easier by not being around. I feel absolutely useless, stupid and just absolutely repulsive i can't even look at myself without bursting out in tears. I'm just so sad all the time and i keep everything in cause i know my problems are so stupid compared to my friends i just tell myself that I'm being selfish and i need to grow up. I've had so many past experiences that have absolutely ruined me and thrown me into a spirl of self hatred and i want it to stop but i just don't know how.",24Oct2019,3
1,"I felt like for the first time in years, I felt consistently happy/at peace for a solid week or so (minimal bad thoughts, good vibes all around). I wasn’t kept up every night thinking or doing trash habits. But suddenly i crashed and felt trapped, pessimistic, and done all over again.

Maybe it’s part of the process, but it’s still going and I can’t find my groove back from that week. 

I feel really alone since I don’t want to bother people around me and the ones I trust have a lot on their hands rn so it’s kinda bad timing all around.

Over the past few years it’s gotten bad and started to impact my health; id pass out a lot, have panic attacks, all the jazz. I just got put on antidepressants for the migraines and all. But I’m sure it isn’t that since the pills shouldn’t start working yet (it hasnt even been a week).

I’m kinda on the edge of just dropping college and just not trying anymore bc it’s so hard to keep up my grades with all this. Plus the pressure doesn’t help; from solid 4.0s and As to barely making the minimum :( 

I guess it kinda was a rant but also, 
what do you guys do to get better? Or
If you’ve gone through it, what happened for you:(

It’s kinda been a cycle but this one was the longest I’ve felt okay

Thank you for anything:’)",24Oct2019,1
2,"This is one of the problems I am facing right now. So I have clinical/severe depression and suicidal thoughts. There are many things that add and influence it, but I need help on a certain thing that has been driving me to pain and insanity.

I had a lot of drama with two certain people at school. One of them used to be my best friend, and the other, a close friend. I will refer to them as K(former close) and M(former best). Now, they hate me. K, after cutting ties, spread rumors and told lies about me, while M is now in a romantic relationship with her. While I am honestly glad that the K cut ties with me since she was extremely toxic and a bad influence, every time I see K at school I... I get certain feelings of anger, sadness, nervousness, and suicide. 

I get really scared and angry at both of them, mind you. M's romance with K... it made me realize that M's friendship with me... was fake. He wasn't being who he actually was, and never truly cared. For example, when I was cutting myself in class, he didn't even try to stop me. Sometimes he even just put it off as normal and fell asleep. This happened several times. And when I tried to talk to him about K sometimes, he always took her side instead of trying to listen. 

This is turning to a rant, but I would rather get advice. I don't know how to escape from the past. What they've done to me and my new best friend, who they are now... it just... Every time I see them at school or someone talks about them.. sometimes it even brings me to tears. I want to stop caring about them. I want this pain to end. I've got enough to deal with already. M and K's romance, they're honestly perfect for each other and I'm happy for them, but other than that, I can't bring myself to be positive about them. I can't bring myself to clean the stains upon my brain that they left, scattered. I try to distract myself, but it's just so hard when someone brings them up or I see one or both of them anywhere. 

I don't know what to do... I... I really need help... I only have one friend to talk to about this... let alone... one friend at all... I can't keep coming to my friend, for I think he might get sick of hearing the same thing, and will feel pressured that his efforts keep dragging down.

If you read all or some of this, I sincerely thank you... It means a lot to me that you would put your time into this... I just.. I'm really stressed out and held up about this... It just feels like there's no escape from this situation... except death...

I really thank you. If you can help, I will really appreciate it...",24Oct2019,5
4,"I started this off not really knowing what to say because Im not good expressing myself but I dont really have a person to talk about it or a place to put it. I feel it kinda started to turn into a rant so I apologize now for that, I just decided to type exactly what came to my head at the time.

I'm sure its a common thing on here. But fuck man, I swear every time something starts to go good in my life where I'm like this can be the turnaround that I wanted, some random bullshit happens and strips it all the way and I'm right back in the same hole. I just feel like fate decided that it always just wants to screw me over at my highest points. And like it sucks, because I don't want to be a burden to my friends to talk about it when I feel like this, or they just don't get it. Recently for me it was over a girl and my friend only said ""is this gonna be that bullshit moping thing you always do"". So I guess they are tired of dealing with it even though I never usually bring things up around them anyway. I'm kind of just ranting since I really got no one that I want to go drop these all my issues on so I apologize if anyone is just like wtf is this. I don't know if I just take things super personal or maybe some things are coincidental, and I have my insecurities and boundaries so maybe its just the fact that I don't normally ""let people in"" and then these things happen and it just literally drives a stake through me where I just don't want to talk or eat or do anything and all I can do is just sit with my thoughts, which ends up with me looking over the scenario that put me in these situations in the first place. And the thoughts start rolling through, ""not good enough"" ""not meant to be happy"" I don't know.

I don't know if it becomes like an obsessive thing or not but its just like using the same example of this girl, its just like things were going pretty perfect in my opinion (perfect connection, amazing personalities, just everything i can ask for) and then after a really nice weekend and texting all day to each other couples shit. I just get a message after a small few hour break of not messaging just getting a random text of My family is having issues and I need to be there for them, and need to focus that. And honestly that shit broke me, no idea why because we weren't talking/dating super long but it legit hurts more than my 7 year relationship. I don't know if its just from after years after of feeling insecure and not putting myself out there usually because i feel I'm not good enough for the other person. I finally take the step out and open my doors back and as I said it was good, but then literally doors slammed in my face. And the recent why I brought up the obsessive thing is I'm like really down about it, but the only way to get a little up is to look back at the conversations and shit because it legit made me happy but then I'm in the circle of back into now this shit is gone too.

And then now my only coping mechanisms to attempt at getting out of my depressive funks (for most of them not just this one) is literally just romanticizing some stupid scenarios that are more than likely 100% not going to happen just to literally build up a sense of false hope to attempt to get through it until hopefully all the feelings just dissapear.

But then I feel like at the point I just become an emotionless person, with literally just a cold heart. And it just happens that way, like I feel like its getting to a point where I'm just losing all my sense of emotion to the point where I just don't do anything or have a feeling of things until they randomly just creep up on me. Like my dad died 2 years ago, I got a phone call out of the blue saying they found him and he had taken some drug that was a bad batch and died. All that happened was I just couldn't speak, no feelings I think when it did finally hit I cried 1 tear.

Like its just I don't know what happening to the point where I feel like I am just becoming a soulless void, and as stated I've been just getting by on just creating these false reality scenarios in order to go about life. And shit just starts piling up, I've thought about ending it multiple times, like it probably comes up a few times a week. I will just feel like I am just not happy with where my life is at, and I'll legit be driving and just be like ""I could just floor it into this wall"" or things like that, my thing is that I don't think Id ever act on these things, I think my lowest was literally looking down a gun barrel but never loaded it with anything. And i don't want to end it honestly, just because I feel it would make me feel like more of a burden to my closer family and friends. I usually just spend my days trying to make others happy even at the expense of my own happiness and sanity. Maybe that's my problem I really don't know. I obviously want to be happy but I just cant seem to get it to happen, whether its a lot of fuckin coincidence or fate, I cant figure it out. Its possible that I just haven't felt happy in so long that I'm not used to it and just let that darkness back in.

Its not fun when the only things going through my head are the ""not good enough's"", ""never going to happen"" ""not going to work"" ""wont be successful's"" ""I'm just a PoS"" and the over all just over thinking of every little thing and scenario. It just essentially just builds up to a point where I will just have an emotional breakdown after a few years of dealing with these things. Usually end up having a big one every 2 years or so.

At this point i feel like I'm just rambling, and dont really know how to end this or what the purpose of it was. I just needed some how to vent and felt this was an OK place to do it. So for those who read all this thanks I guess, I'm just going to stop now.",24Oct2019,3
5,"I always loved school. My parents never had to get on top of me to get good grades and I was very involved in school activities. By my sophomore year I was President of a club and an Officer for two others. I had just starting getting into more difficult classes like AP English/Biology, Honors, etc. Then it happened. I don’t know at what point it occurred but I just started to feel gloomy. 

I got behind on work and it made me feel sick and cold when I got to class knowing I didn’t know the material. I felt paranoid that everyone knew what I was thinking. I went from outgoing and outspoken to timid and quiet. I couldn’t sleep or eat and I started to skip classes for the first time because I would feel nauseous walking into a classroom and/or I would fall asleep in class because of the lack of sleep I got. 

I started crying for no reason and would have to excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I wouldn’t go back to class. I went from missing a few classes a day to a few days of school. I remember when I returned one day a teacher moved me to the back of the class because, “only people who care about school should sit in the front.” I had my head down that entire class. I left, went home, and cried. I stepped down from all my positions in my clubs and never went back to school. I didn’t talk or tell any of my friends, my teachers, even my boyfriend what was going on with me. They just assumed I was ignoring them gave me space because I was pushing them away. My family called me lazy and ungrateful and we were constantly fighting. 

I was now out of school and in bed 24/7 crying. I use to read and play video games with long time online friends but even that didn’t interest me anymore. I started to fantasize about dying in an accident or just running away. It would be the only thing that would give me a sense of relief because I felt sad all the time. 

Finally I didn’t even feel sad anymore I just felt empty. I couldn’t enjoy the taste of food and I just needed to feel something. So I started physically hurting myself, nothing too bad but it still wasn’t healthy. 

During this time bedridden, I was officially diagnosed and given medication. Saw a therapist (didn’t take it serious) and started abusing the anti-depressants. I felt good for a little while but the medication gave me a new energy that motivated me to want to end my life. 

I took some pills but got scared and threw them back up and called a suicide hotline. I told my mom and from the ER I went to a treatment center. 

I got help. They kept me in routine, I met some other people who were experiencing the same thing as me and I was able to talk openly about my issues. I got counseling and saw things in a different perspective. After I got out I stuck to my medication and got therapy. I told my friends (some understood and some didn’t) my family got informed and learned more about depression and how to be supportive. And I learned coping methods and now whenever I feel like the depression might come back I know how to combat it even if it beats me up sometimes. 

It’s been almost 3 years since I’ve been in school full time. Now I’m gonna take my GED test, I’ve haven’t studied as much as I should have but I’m confident I’ll pass and I’ll try again if I don’t. I’m really excited to get back into school and start college soon after. Just the thought of it makes me want to cry. 

If you’re in a bad place I hope you know it can get better one day. I wish you all well!",24Oct2019,1
7,"A little background. I’ve been friends with a girl for a while now and we had instant chemistry the moment we met and started talking. We like the same things, have a similar sense  of humor etc. At this point I think I’ve developed some romantic feelings but in the past I’ve ruined friendships by making them known and I don’t want to risk it with her, she’s one of the best people I know who gets me. We’ve discussed pretty much every topic in the book, including past romances and what we like in people. From what I’ve noticed she goes after guys with a certain physique that cannot be attributed to me. But now when we talk about guys she likes or what dudes she’s been talking to it kind of makes me spiral into a self pity/hate cycle. I don’t know what to do other than ask her to stop talking about guys she likes but I feel like that will incite a conversation that could be detrimental to our friendship. Any advice?",24Oct2019,62
8,"I’m depressed. Not the kind of depression that’s like ‘oh hey I’ve been feeling down lately and need some help’... it’s more like 

‘I’m going to kill my self at the end of the summer and nothing is going to stop me.’

And I keep thinking of my boyfriend and how sad he will be. I keep thinking of my sister and her children and how she will have to explain to them that I’m not around anymore. I can hear them crying. I keep thinking of my friend that I haven’t spoken to in a while because I’m so frustrated with her and she’s in another country. I can hear her yelling at me. 
I imagine my best friend not crying but just staring blankly because that’s what he does when he’s sad.

9,"Ive been struggling for years with my living situation and my mental health. I have aspergers and major depression, finding work has been hard because of it between  not being able to leave my bed for days and just not being able to pick up on things in a social setting.

I used to be on some medication that helped a little but i got kicked off after my parents lied saying i was misusing. Theyve also done their best to make it impossible for me to work in the past. I have a car now so they cant control that aspect of my life as easy anymore. Money and resources for me are becoming scarce though. 

After i lost my medication/psychologist i began to withdraw and tried to kill myself. Depression took over i was institutionalized for some time and i lost my funding to continue to go to school thus i lost my insurance. 

I am trying to get on SSI at least until i can get better but thats the only thing i can think of to do. Ive went to countless interviews applied many places tried a couple jobs but there is limit to what i can do and i am getting to a point that i just dont have money to drive to a place 20 miles away to be told i didnt get a job.",24Oct2019,3
10,"I just started a masters degree at a new school. At my old school my friends consisted of:

 people I already knew from childhood

 and 

a couple of friends that I met entirely through my only *actual* friend I ever made at university

Now I'm at a new school with no one. 

I never joined a single club at university.

I had enough fun with those few friends that I made it through fine. 

But now I've come to the stark realization that I have been completely lacking in social ability my whole life including in college where I mistakenly thought I was making progress (I mean.. I hung out with people... people spoke well of me... and I threw 2 parties and went to a few parties too) 

I realize now that I didnt form a single extra close friendship in all those years except my very first university friend.

And my motivation is just as bad now in my masters. Clubs give me ""free time anxiety"" where I feel like I'm losing a valuable part of my free time at home by going to club meetings. 

When I talk to new people it feels like a chore to make small talk. If someone does not align interests with me then I find that, although I find them to be a pleasant person, I also find talking to them to be excruciating. For example my college friend's boyfriend. I like the guy. Hes cool. But his interests are very different than mine. And it feels like paper cutting my eyes to talk to him because of that. It's just so hard to find something to talk about. Even if I really like who he is. 

I'm getting more depressed by the day. Making friends seems impossible. I thought I liked to be alone but it just seems to make me more and more hopeless and detached from the world. 

I have a long distance girlfriend who I talk I talk to every day and perhaps she keeps my grounded. But I see her so little each year that I really have to do all of this by myself. And I just feel like I cant. 

Advice very much appreciated. I'm going to a school  psychologist as soon as I can.",24Oct2019,2
11,"Me and my fiancé took a break yesterday and right now it starting to seem like she wants to completely break up. She's been lying to me about her emotions and saying that everything is okay and that she's never going anywhere, blah blah blah. Then she finally does. I knew there was something wrong. And now I just feel awful and I honestly thought about ending it all yesterday, the only reason I'm still here is because I reached out and called a friend. It hurts so bad, yesterday I was numb to emotion for a while, now its just the pain settling itself in. Please just talk to me or something, I can't be alone right now.

12,"Hey everyone, first post here. Just want to prelude without some stuff. I’m an exmormon (it’s a manipulative and emotionally draining religion imo) and have a pretty conservative upbringing because of it. I became an atheist at 15 after feeling nonstop religious shame and learning some dark secrets about the church.

I had a lot of fights with my parents after I told them I was a non believer and was still first into faking it for a few years.

I joined the military at 18 and finally received the respect I always thought I deserved from them because of it.

Now at 20 years old I’ve realized that I’m bisexual and want to embrace that part of myself by coming out to my largely conservative family.

I’m currently on annual leave for the first time in what feels like forever and I’ve been enjoying a level of independence and freedom that I didn’t think was possible. I’m happier than I ever remember being. The only issue is that all the stages in my life that I described are plagued with self harm, thought of suicide and general hopelessness. I’m meeting my parents in person for the first time in over a year in a week or so and I really want to come out to them, just to have that weight off my back. But what if they start treating me like garbage again? And I’m terrified of going back to my job in the military, it’s so suffocating and I’ve had my worst suicidal thoughts while being there. I don’t know what to do but ignore those problems and just enjoy the freedom I do have for now. It’s still weighing on me in the back of my mind.",24Oct2019,3

15,"I hate my job so fucking much

I need the money, but if I quit then im fucking myself over

I really need my job but I dont know what else to do

I keep thinking that killing myself is better than going to work or doing anything in general

Quitting is inconveniencing myself, my family, and my phone bill and I hate all of that pressure

I cant take it. That's why I think suicide is better than dealing with those consequences

Just the constant judgement and comparison to my mom is unbearable. She'd probably say that, ""I've been working for xyz years, and you can hardly work?"" 

I cant take it

And Im almost certain Im not the first person to have these thoughts about my job, but that most certainly doesn't invalidate my feelings

I just don't know what to do

I told myself I'll quit once I graduate high school because I want to dedicate all of my time to college because I know I'll be happier but

I'm so unmotivated that I don't even want to do my schoolwork at this point.

My school failed me by calling my mom and telling her that I attempted suicide when I desperately didn't want them to tell her

Like, Im fucking 19 years old but my school is still calling home to my mom like Im 9?

Fuck them

And Im unmotivated to work so I might lose my job due to attendance

I just hate everything and this job influences my suicidal thoughts

i hate this shit and cant deal with the emotional abuse

I wish I could tell every customer to fuck right off

If I quit, it would have to be that way

like any customer that's to be rude just be like Well Fuck you too 

Because that's how I feel

Fuck this

And to top all of this off, I can't get over my stupid ex who I love to death and still love. I'm fucking sad and I wish he was here, because he would help me through this but I feel absolutely alone in this world right now

I feel like every single person and individual that has roamed this god-forsaken shitty planet has completely and royally fucked me.

16,"So, I am essentially probing for advice on finding a psychiatrist... However, I am also wondering if there are any forums, or maybe a subreddit I've overlooked, that would have/ facilitate patient reviews of providers. Something outside of the few non-specific google reviews etc. 

My specific criteria is DC Metro area, treats depression, and accepts medicare. It's a bit more than that but I wasn't expecting a recommendation, although that would be cool. 

I attempted to find one of my old docs, and was willing to pay cash, since I haven't had very good experiences with medicare...and they have unfortunately moved and changed career pursuits...so I am pretty disappointed and at a bit of a loss as that was my plan if all else fails.",24Oct2019,2
17,"For some context, we’ve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. She’s been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and it’s been especially bad in recent weeks. She’s a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she’s making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I can’t cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently she’s been saying she doesn’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to deal with her when she’s like this, and she’s worried that’s it’s having a negative impact on our relationship. I’ve never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that I’m here for her and that I love her. It’s been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting.

27,"I'm currently a sophomore at a technical college, and I'm taking 16 credit hours of math, computer science, and humanities. I haven't been doing very well all semester, but at this point my depression is making it difficult to get anything done. I keep procrastinating everything, from turning in financial aid documents to studying for my exams. I might lose all my financial aid because I was selected for FAFSA review but failed to get the documents in earlier in the semester, I keep missing deadlines and turning in barely cohesive papers, I'm unhappy with my major but can't find anything that interests me, and I can't seem to focus on anything every time I try to study for a quiz or exam. Yesterday I sat down for 6 hours to study differential equations but couldn't concentrate for a single moment, and it gets so frustrating I just give up and accept failure. I've been going to therapy but I was paying out of pocket from money I had saved over the summer, and that money is mostly gone so I can't afford therapy anymore. I would go to my school's free therapy but all our therapists quit because my school was underpaying them.

If I don't get my act together soon I'm afraid I might end up a college dropout, which I have nothing against I just don't want to have wasted so much money only to end up with a lot of debt and no degree.

Meds made me sick, balancing work and treatment was a nightmare (which led to losing my job), trying to conceal my depression from everyone else. It all just became overwhelming.  And as usual I fucking gave up again. 

I started suffering from depression around sixth grade. At that point I didnt even know what depression even meant back then. I was too young. I grew up with my alcoholic father who constantly drank and physically/verbally abused me. Got kicked out alot, he would molest me in my sleep, talked about how much of a slut my biological mom was, etc. The way I was behaving when I was younger I could kinda get an idea I didnt really have a normal life compared to other kids my age. 

Then came college. By this point I did pretty good job stuffing my depression and other traumatic events back of my head. I was doing ok. I had roommates who were all gay like me, and very supportive. They were like my second family or the family I never had.All of us grew extremely close together.  One friend in particular helped me out alot. He called me out on my bullshit, taught me not to be judge other people, and overall made me a better person .  One day he got really drunk and came to talk to me while I was trying to do laundry. He told me how he was going to kill himself the next day. At this point he had already made lot of empty threats. I was exhausted and had to go to work early in the morning the next day. I didnt take him seriously because of his past threats and his drunken state. I told him to do whatever he wants and went to bed. He killed himself the next day.

I dropped out of college and fell into depression, with the support of my roommates and other close friends, I was able to make it through. I even reapplied to go back to college. Two months after my friend killed himself my dad joined him.  This was the point where I gave up.  

I planned on killing my self 2015. Had my life insurance all set up, checked the suicide clauses, and suicide letter. Eventually my friends and family found out and they kinda got me help. but honestly not really. 

I've been kinda skating life ever since. Trying to find crappy job to keep myself busy. Drink and smoke to keep myself numb. When I should be going back to school or find a professional career. Then I started becoming bitter towards my family and friends who wanted to help me. If i had killed myself years before I wouldnt be able to go through with this kind of shit.  Eventually I saw a therapist. I was doing ok, then therapist started lecturing how I wasn't trying hard enough. Even with the meds making me sick, working 40 hours a week, barely eating, not wanting to do anything. Which just made me lot more pathetic. Eventually i just stopped going. Not cause I didnt think she wasn't helping, but I made more foolish mistakes that led me to getting sexually assaulted recently. And I could not handle any more lecturing from her. 

So here I am. I try my best to eat at least one meal a day. Get out of the house at least once a day.  I even got a job recently as a barista and now currently living with my bf.  I'm trying my best to be stable and somewhat happy. But I'm starting to realize its not something everyone could achieve. 

Obviously I'm not expecting straight up answer that will solve everything. Just typing this shit out and getting off my chest did make me bit better. IF you managed to read this far, thank you. Thanks for listening to my story.",24Oct2019,1
29,"ive (16m) been back and forth with depression over the past 3 or so years, it reached the worst point its ever been last year when i attempted suicide. ive gotten much better since then, and im taking antidepressants although i dont really like the idea of using them. the main causes were stress over getting a high GPA and social problems; i dont struggle to make friends but i never get close with people. ive gotten control over my grades and my classes are easier than last year, so i dont feel like i did then and i honestly dont think id consider suicide unless something changed drastically. 

but even after that i feel really alone all the time, ive got friends at school but i only go out like every other weekend and recently ive been getting this feeling like being sick (kind of?) more and more even though im physically healthy.  im like drained and tired all the time and have that kind of gross feeling like when you have the flu, but without any real symptoms of sickness at all. the problem rn i think is loneliness, but i dont really know how to fix that. its not like i dont talk to people at all, but im just not close with anyone really. i terrified of rejection so im hesitant to try to make plans with anyone who doesnt already mention that they want to; but even if i werent would it make much of a difference?  im just not sure how to go abt fixing that, im not immediatly upset when im alone, and im perfectly fine spending time alone. but i dont know what it is im missing, a best friend, S/O or something else. maybe its just feeling wanted or needed by someone else? 

it seems weird writing all this down, like im just complaining abt not having a bestfriend to hangout with every weekend. like why am i depressed over something that simple?",24Oct2019,2
30,"For reference I’m a 17f. Also I’m sorry if this is a kind of long read, I have a lot on my mind.

I realise that when I posted a couple months ago I was very all over the place and I ended up deleting all of my posts which was probably pretty stupid but anyway. 

I thought I was starting to get better, I joined back into college, I moved away from a toxic relationship to focus on myself and make myself feel better and try to regrow a friend group around me so I had plenty of distractions and things to do to keep me occupied so I wouldn’t start to overthink about things like I usually do. And at first everything was going well, everything was starting to improve, until last week. 

(Im from the uk just incase this confuses anyone)A boy from my college asked me to go to the jet(a petrol station) which is right next to the school so I agreed since he’s in one of my lessons and I had spoken to him a couple of times and on the way back he started asking me some inappropriate questions but I sort of just brushed it off, but then he somehow got a hold of my snapchat and was asking me to have sex with him  over and over again even though I kept saying no. Anyway I told my friend group that I made about it and they ended up telling him and he turned it around on me and basically had made everyone think I was making it all up for attention( also to mention he has a gf that doesn’t go to our college) so it just ruined the whole point of me moving college to try and have a fresh start and I feel like I can’t trust those friends anymore. Also for background the college/sixth form is part of a secondary school(if that makes sense) so they all went to secondary school before sixth form. 

As well as this the relationship I mentioned at the start, he’s been trying to get me to speak to him again and it’s really hard to even have to speak to him in the first place and it kills me to say no but I know I have to. 

I also have an illness which prevents me from being able to do work and/or go to college in general and this was the main reason for me having to leave the college I was at previously along with my awful mental health and I just feel scared because everything is starting to crumble again and my mental health has dropped back down to how it used to be. I find it really hard to have the strength to go into college and to talk to people and I’ve distanced myself entirely from the “friends” I made because I just feel like I’ll end up messing everything up again even more than I already have. I’m even more scared because the last time my mental health dropped this low I ended up in hospital and I feel like it might end up happening again and I don’t want to feel like even more of a failure to my family and the one friend I have left and I also don’t want it to end up going round the sixth form so people judge me. 

Also to make it worse I went to a doctor to try and help figure out exactly what my issues were eg. Depression, anxiety etc. But instead I was told I have a “low mood” and the doctor just told me “well I would be upset if all of that happened to me too” all of that being every single thing that has happened to me to make me feel the way I do which is a hell of a damn lot so I don’t even feel like I deserve to say I have a bad mental health and it makes me feel as if I’m using it as an excuse.

If I’m being honest I don’t exactly know what this post is for, I just feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to who won’t judge me or turn on me. I don’t know where to go from here and I feel like every time I feel like it’s going to get better it all just falls apart all over again.",24Oct2019,3
31,"For the past few months, I’ve been drifting away from many of my friends irl because I don’t know how to talk to them. I know that they’re going through their own stuff and I don’t want to bother them with my own problems. Then I started talking to this amazing guy on reddit and he’s been helping me a lot (even with an anxiety attack once!). He tells me how amazing I am and is always cheering me on. I haven’t told him how bad it’s been lately and what exactly is bringing me down and so I’m just bashing myself and saying how horrible I am cuz everyone around me irl is telling me how much of a terrible person I am and it just sucks. I guess in a way, my ranting has brought him down as well. Today he finally said bye and told me to talk to him when I’m not feeling so bad. I didn’t know what to say cuz it was such a shock so I said goodbye and wished him well. Now I’m crying in the bathroom and I just don’t know what to do and I want to die again",24Oct2019,3
32,"I’m in my second year of an associates degree, it’s a very vigorous major and 50% of students drop out first semester. I managed to get through last year but hardly passed due to a depressive episode last semester which led to 2 breakdowns in the middle of class (I have never done that before). This semester I am struggling more and feel so lost. C+ is considered just passing a C is failing for my major. I have social anxiety and doing my tests and practical exams I always freeze and forget everything I know and studied for. I should’ve dropped out when I had the chance I have been getting darker and darker thoughts as the days progress.  My motivation is draining because my efforts don’t even seem to work. It’s getting harder and harder to get out of bed every day. I’ve been either going to sleep super early or staying up all night spiraling. I wish I could just restart. I just don’t know how to get out of this state and get my life back together because I can’t keep spiraling and letting my grades slip even more.  It’s hard when my grades make me feel more depressed and when I put in the effort I don’t get anything out of it which makes me lose motivation which then continues the cycle.",24Oct2019,2
33," i'm a uk guy who is currently in high school. i have a single friend but other than that i have nothing to live for, i have felt depressed since high school started as people bullied me for my appearance and how crazy i act. i don't know why but i have mood swings which make it hard to make friends and people make fun of me for it. i act happy but haven't felt anything in a long time. i just feel numb. one time i tried telling my parents how i feel, who then proceeded to tell me to ""man up"" i told my brother but he thinks i'm faking it to get attention. i've thought of killing myself but haven't. the only real reason i haven't yet is because i always bully myself in and out of it, saying i'm too worthless to even succeed at ending it. the bullying has been going on since year 7 \[6th grade\]. i tried telling the school about the bullying and i'm still salty about what happened. they told me, that they were going to punish them later, then said they couldn't find evidence when in a journal i had fucking dates and times. please help.",24Oct2019,3
34,"I struggled with pretty severe depression a few years ago that nearly ended my life. I practiced healthy habits like eating healthy, working out regularly, and forcing myself to be social through my school to claw my way out of depression. Having just graduated college and landing a decent job working with some of my closest friends, I finally felt happy again.

 But about four months ago, I moved to Washington DC and abandoned all my friends for what seemed like my dream job. It paid double the salary as my last job and was in a field I was extremely passionate about. I even got accepted into John's Hopkins for my master's in something that I love. I know I *should* be happy, but I'm not. I'm a programmer working in space defense, and because of the secrecy surrounding my work, there isn't a lot of talking around the workplace, so making friends has been difficult. I find myself working on the computer all day long, only to go home and stare at a screen again.

I can feel the depression setting in again and nothing has ever scared me more in my life. I would honestly rather eat a million spiders than have to face depression like I did last time. I just want to be happy. Here's what I've tried to make myself happy again:

I've been working out about four times a week. It has helped to some degree, but I can still feel the ever present depression looming just behind me. 

I've still been eating healthy. Getting 8-9 hours of sleep per night (Honestly I take sleeping pills when I start to really feel sad just so I don't have to face it).

I've forced myself to try to be social. I've been on tinder and bumble and went on a few dates, but it's difficult to put effort into anything when I'm not in the right mind. I try to explore new places but it almost always tends to feel lonely and underwhelming. I've went out to board game places on a few occasions to try to make friends, but nothing has seemed to come about it.

I go on nature walks with my dog from time to time and try to listen to things that I'm interested in, but as depression does, my interest in literally everything is quickly fading. What I'm left with now is coming home from a workplace where I have maybe only had a brief conversation with one person all day, just to sit at my computer and not be able to find a single thing that interests me. 

How can I break this cycle? I feel like I've exhausted nearly all my options at this point and each day I feel more and more like I'm growing into a lifeless husk. Thanks for reading.",24Oct2019,10
