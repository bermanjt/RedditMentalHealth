0,"So, I'm new to this. I had my brother recommend this subreddit to me because I have been feeling alone for quite some time. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be here yet I am too scared to do anything. I feel as though none of my friends understand what I am going through because none of them have had depression. My friend sits here and laughs and acts like everything is okay with me yet I am slowly crippling into this monster. I guess what I need help with is coping mechanisms to keep myself from feeling so alone and having no one that understands. If someone could give me advice on it then please do! I am desperate at this point. Thank you!",18Feb2019,2
1," from the last few months, i've been losing interest in my everyday tasks that i loved to do all day before. i feel sleepy all the time. i forget things very easily. all this is very clear to me and i'm not overthinking. i cant even manage to make myself complete essential tasks that is crucial for me. all i do is procastinate and live in the guilt of not doing any thing. anything bad happens to me doesn't bothers to me at all. the main problem is if anything good at all happens to me instead of looking for the positive side, i easily forget that good and kind of want negative and sadness all the time. please help. i want to be like i was before.

2,"Do you think positive memes and quotes actually help anyone?

A few year's back when I was in less depression then I am now, I used to post them regularly on Facebook to help keep my spirits up.

3,"A lot of my depression stems from feeling isolated and being really fucking lonely. I graduated college about a year and a half ago and while I was in school I was very active and social but now I live in a completely different state and away from that community. I've struggled to make new close friends and I find myself just going to work and coming home. The year of loneliness is getting to me and I'm very suicidal. I need to get out and put myself in a position to meet new people but I don't even know where to start. What kind of places should I go to to meet mid-20 year olds and possibly make friends? And where are good places to go to just hang out, be around people and feel less isolated? ",18Feb2019,3

6,"Hey all,

I am active duty military and have been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety in the last 2-3 years and there are days that it gets really tough for me, usually through the week I do have friends and peers that I can rely on to keep me going through the day, but once it comes to the end of the day and my boots and uniform come off the positivity and happiness high that I have plummets severely I have gone to get help and the main thing they recommended was medication, but I don't want to have to take meds so I refused them. I am at a constant battle with these demons on the weekends because I have almost no one since everyone goes and does their own things and no one associates on the off time. Usually it gets bad to the point that I drink all weekend. I've almost attempted to end it all a few times....I honestly just probably need some help or advice, so if any of you can help or offer some words it would mean a lot.",18Feb2019,3
7,"So first off I probably won’t respond or read any comments until tomorrow morning because I need to get some sleep.

I used to be very badly depressed. It got really bad, but that’s a long story and one I’d rather not talk about on here. I’ve been gradually getting better since, but recently I’ve been back on a downwards spiral. I can’t find the motivation to do anything I need to and it’s really hurting my grades and my relationship with my family again. My mom knows about this and keeps asking me about it but I just tell her I’m fine every time even though I know I’m not. I want to talk to her about it and get help but I can’t. I know I should, but no matter how hard I try to convince myself I just put it off, tell myself I can handle it on my own and that I don’t need help. So basically I just want to know how you guys convince yourselves to talk to people about your depression.",18Feb2019,8
8,"Today i felt sad, more than sad. I cried for no reason. Sat in complete darkness. Couldn’t find music sad enough or shows to distract me. It was completely empty, and restless.  It was the lowest I have ever been. The person I started seeing completely let me down. 
I reached out. I really thought he would be available, or care. I made it very clear I was not okay or in a good state of mind. I acted like a complete psycho because i couldn’t handle being alone or dealing with my feelings  I called maybe 20 times in 3 hours. I was trying to get help from one person i wanted to believe was there for me. It ended up hurting me more. Two days in a row I expressed my despair to be left with nothing but broken promises adding to my misery. 

He’s going through his own stuff. But he gives me hope that he’s going to be available and help and then disappears. I should have known and expected this. 
I acknowledged in this darkness that I am so strongly holding on because I want to save him. I am so understanding of his faults because I couldn’t save my father. I want to feel conditionally loved by a human- and sometimes I force that feeling by choosing helpless humans. But I realized I don’t need to put myself through the disappointment and heartbreak i felt with my father. I need to stop projecting and take control. I shouldn’t be so willing to accept being treated like shit. I shouldn’t be so willing to forgive when it isn’t okay at all. 

I reached out to different people that were 100 percent supportive and it made me realize how people should react. How people that care about me feels. 

I need to move on from this toxic relationship that clearly isn’t what i need. 

I have never been this low or been this needy. I never reach out so hard. I have discovered a lot from reaching this point. I just needed to put it into words. I don’t know what I expect from this post. 

I really needed a friend today and the person I thought cared wasn’t that person. 

If someone reading doesn’t have the support they need I am willing to listen. My advice isn’t great...but I promise to acknowledge and care and listen because we are all human. We all need help sometimes. ",18Feb2019,3
9,"Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner?

I’m pretty good about eating on days when I have classes (college student). I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused (and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing). I always have a healthy big breakfast.

My problem is with weekends and dinner. I’m usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if it’s just microwaving leftovers.

I also live with others - I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really don’t want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I can’t always rely on his presence. Or if I’m out with friends and we’re getting fast food I can eat because I don’t have to put in any effort and I’m outside anyways.

And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I don’t feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry.

Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? 

When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college :(

I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. It’s really easy to drop a few pounds when I’m under additional stress; some weeks I just can’t do dinners at all.",18Feb2019,9
10,"Ik this will be a waste of everyones time but even if no one reads this I need to write it down....I'm 14 now....back years and years ago when I was 4 my eldest sister  raped my 4 year old self  she had mental issues...she started cutting me with knives and making me watch her cut her self.....she continued this till I was 9...that's when she finally moved out of my family's house...she had drilled it into my brain that what she did to me was ""notmal"" and if I told my parents or other siblings  she would murder them...so I never told anyone....not until a month ago current time... after my sister left the house she still kept in touch with my parents....my parents constantly made me visit my sister which brought the memories back...my sister hadnt changed she'd threaten me any chance she got...I started feeling so so depressed. And on top of that my father started...acting worse....he used to be so nice but I think the stress of my sister (they knew she had mental issues just not what she'd do) I think the stress kinda broke him... I felt like I'd lost my family around that time I was barely coping but then something worse happend.... my hands started going numb...I started having flashbacks...of a sort....dreams I was sleep walking...slowly but over a course of a few months I'd lost almost all feeling in my hands and started getting dizzy...my hands started hurting and I started getting sick more often...and every time I'd get sick my whole body would go numb...not even figureitivly my body REALLY was going numb... soon things became progressively worse and my parents took. Me to doctors  after doctors....they all did tons of tests on me but couldn't pinpoint anything...in the end they ended up just saying  welp we dunno but I guess you'll end up calling it fiber myalgia... a while after that my condition had worsened so much I decided to quit ice skating...one of my favorite sports because it was to painful for me...and since I'm homeschooled that was one of the few places I had friends...I started losing touch with them... I was in and out of hospitals for a number of things...each one being mostly untreatable...my other sister (not the one who raped me) my other sister said I made my problems out to be bigger then they were...I found out that if I DIDN'T speak up about anything they'd worry and see just how much I had trouble...so I stopped talking I continued trying to handle everything myself I kept the thing that happend in my childhood a complete secret....no one knew... it was eating away at me...I had almost no friends I was  depressed  and in pain 24/7... my parents sensed I was depressed and they tried to tell me it was a ""side effect "" of my condition. Which made me feel as though they were saying my feelings weren't my feelingss...  it built up...then one day on my birthday my parents invited my eldest sister to the house.... when she arrived she was visibly pregnant...none of us had known... she  had all the attention on her the whole day and I kept worrying how she'd parent the child when she was so cold hearted...  she told me that day that she would no longer harm me...because when the baby arrived it would be her new play thing she said.... I felt sick               to the stomach it was my 14th birthday and that was the day I attempted to end my own life... I had left a letter explaining everything about my sister to my mother and other sister... I had left that letter knowing they'd save that little baby from my sister...then I let go and tried to die...I felt so sad..all my life I looked toward the future with bright eyes...and I had decided in one moment I couldn't continue farther....turns out my parents had invited one of my last  friends over to surprise me...he was the one that walked in and found me nearly dead...when my parents saw me I'll never forget how my mothers face looked or how uncaring my father looked. They rushed me to the hospital  and I obviously lived or I wouldn't be typing this..  I still feel depressed but really dont want to die...but I am having trouble finding a reason to live... my mother is the only one who ever found and read the letter so she and I talked about my sister...my mother loves my sister very much and had a hard time with it...another reason why I didn't tell anyone... she just had no idea that was going on... my sister  dropped contact with my family and fell of the radar...I assume my mother had something to do with that... the baby? Well my sister had a miscarriage only a couple days ago...around the time she fell out of touch... I haven't pressed charges on my sister..I just can't get myself to do it... I know this is probably the lamest stuff to be depressed about but I honestly don't want to go to counseling where someone is PAID to care... I feel depressed like any other 14 yr old I guess.  And I don't see a future for me anymore... I'm sorry this was long and I'm sorry if I wasted your time. I just needed to type I guess....",18Feb2019,40

12,"I used to be depressed for a really long time. I used to not get out of bed, decline invitations, stay by myself and just sit there in my apartment alone. This went on for about a year. 

This is embarrassing, but I just wanted to get insight on it from other people. 

 I’ve gotten better, but somethings starting to concern me. I just feel like I’m on the edge of balling at any sad thing. I don’t normally cry at movies, but whenever I watch one I feel like I could just cry for hours. The thing is though I can’t. I physically just can’t. 

I can hear a sad song and it just shifts my mood (I try to stay away from songs that I know I used to use to enable toxic behaviors, but sometimes sad music is unavoidable). Same issue though I really listen to the lyrics and feel it in the back of my eyes, but then nothing. Whenever I try to “force” it the feeling of crying goes away entirely and it throws me off completely.  

I’m just not sure what’s going on and was wondering if anyone has gone through this and if so what was your solution? Did you find out that there was an underlying reason?",18Feb2019,4
13,"I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months. After my third change of psychiatrist, I was instructed to stop Paxil cold turkey in favor of staring prozac in 2 weeks because of the risks associated with adolescents taking Paxil. He is adamant on me stopping as soon as possible and I do understand why this is important, for the drug is **still not FDA approved for treating depression in teens even though it is commonly used for it**. I am currently 3 days in, and I am experiencing the full force of the withdrawals- Severe headaches and zaps, cold sweats, strange dreams and waking up in sweats, equilibrium and balance issues, tingling of extremities and numbness in hands, lightheadedness, suicidal ideation, dissociation, severe mood swings and racing thoughts. As someone very new to all of this and the processes associated with treatment, Id really appreciate anything, **and I mean anything**, anyone has to say about their personal experiences with withdrawals from Paxil or any antidepressant for that matter as well as any tips for managing this hell for the next 2 weeks. Thankfully, I am not currently enrolled in high school, so i am not forced to deal with this while stuck in class, but its challenging to go through this seemingly alone without contact from others. **Appreciate any feedback or thoughts I can get.**",18Feb2019,10
14,"Because our family is Vietnamese and I’ve been the only one who has actually gone to school in America, they use me as their translating device and then I’m done receiving direct attention for the day. I’ve reached the point where I’m even scared to be at home around my parents. They constantly argue and have become near divorce plenty of times, but the only thing they can use to bond is discussing how awful of a daughter I am with each other. They’ve taught me to be homophobic when I’ve realized what sexuality actually was and I consider myself bisexual. I’ve been through a complete cycle of thoughts of self harm because of them and I’m gradually recovering because of others who have supported me. I get angry when I find out that we have an upcoming break from school (which we have a lot of because our school has a year-round schedule) because I’d rather be at school finding more comfort from my friend group than I ever do at home. When I’m just at home in my room, I can always hear them speaking loudly about how they hate me and the friends that I have. They then tell each other things such as “this girl doesn’t know how to do anything besides sit on her phone!” when I have nothing productive to do because I’m just tied down and restricted to my house. My school is located downtown near a bunch of small food places and coffee shops and the kids usually like to go there and hang out for a bit before they go home. However, my parents complain whenever I go there because they always want me home even though I do nothing besides sit on my phone when I’m there.

I’ve always had the same parents, however, my mental state has only been getting worse because I’ve gained more maturity over the years and have only recently been noticing that they are toxic people. The only difference about them over time has been that they’ve grown farther and farther apart and have grown to hate each other. When they do talk to me, my mom ever talks to me about how horrible my dad is and vice versa. They also have a strange 19 year age gap between them, therefore my dad is old and retired and just sits at home more than I do. Nonetheless, he still puts a small amount of effort into finding another job that wouldn’t help us very much anyway. Meanwhile, my mom was a high-school dropout and now has a terrible job where she works hard to do stuff for the entire family. There’s a side of me that feels bad for them because I’ve considered their perspective and thought about whether the stress from that has impacted their negativity towards each other and me, but they both have done too many things to me that can’t be excused as just “pressure or stress.” I’m also not old enough to live by myself or even drive, so I don’t have anything to do besides deal with them for years and I don’t know what will happen by then.",18Feb2019,1

I have a disability and relationships aren't easy for me to find/establish and I get very depressed when they end.

17,"In the past year, my life went from amazing to absolutely horrible. My amazing girlfriend of 3 years, who I planned to build a life with, left me which caused me to plunge into a severe depression and which uncovered a myriad of mental illnesses in me that I was not aware of (MDD, PDD, bipolar, anxiety, OCD, avoidant personality disorder). For the past 8 months, I have not been able to do anything. I had to stop working, studying, playing sports, etc. I have seriously attempted suicide twice in that time and I had many near-suicide attempts.

Since the break-up, I screwed up severely with my ex as I am obsessed with getting her back. After several emotional encounters, including texts, phone calls, a meetup, and the two subsequent suicide attempts, she blocked me on everything. She still wants to be friends in the future but she thinks it's best for the both of us to not have contact right now.

I quickly sought out professional help, being referred to emergency psychological help after 2 months by a psychologist. I got this emergency care for about 4 months which consisted of weekly talks with a psychiatric worker while I was on the waiting list for actual treatment. I was also visited by these social workers at home for a while. In the meantime, I received Quetiapine and Sertraline for 1,5 months before being taken off meds as they didn't really work. Since January I have been seeing a psychiatrist every two weeks of a department that deals with personality disorders. Last Thursday I heard that I will have to wait about half a year to get individual therapy. Group therapy was ruled out and I am currently not on medication. I will only see my psychiatrist once a month from now on.

I have not only talked to professionals, but also to family, friends, and strangers here on Reddit. However, it does not really help me. It is only a distraction, but I cannot do anything with the advice they are giving me. I know they are right for the most part, but I just can't do it. I have tried to explain myself to them so many times, but they never really understand me. It frustrates them as they want to help me but they don't see me following their advice and they don't understand why. I am slowly losing friends as they are tired of talking to me and I have been isolating myself more and more out of guilt.

I have tried to pick up my old life here and there again; studying again, playing sports, being social, but nothing works or helps and I can't keep it up. My old life is gone. I tried doing new things, like going on vacation and dating girls, but nothing can fill the void. I was never a really happy or joyful person. I had a traumatic childhood lacking parental love and support which made me into a pessimistic and nihilistic loner who functions on hate, fear, and dark cynical humor. My ex was the light in my life who made me a better and more positive person. I was genuinely happy with her. I had girlfriends before, but she was the first one I truly loved and still love. I guess I became dependent on her without even being aware of it. It makes sense since she was the first person in my life to give me genuine love and support. Though I do not see her as my drug. I truly love her for who she is and I want to spend my life with her.

Right now I just feel trapped and paralyzed. I can't get myself to do anything. I'm living an anxious depressing life. I know I have lots of potential but I don't have the strength, motivation, or courage anymore to fulfill my potential or overcome my fears on my own. I can't do it without my ex. As the days quickly go by I feel more and more pressure on me. It feels like I have to do something; make something of my life; be a strong independent man. Instead, I do absolutely nothing as the pressure and fear cripple me. I'm already behind my peers which makes me feel even worse. They all have finished uni, have nice jobs, a girlfriend, living together. I was close to having that too and I was so happy about that, but now it's all gone. The only thing that could save me now is if I can talk to my ex. If she is willing to give me another chance in the future. I am running out of time however because my ex is leaving the country soon to travel for the rest of the year. So I have to talk to her soon, but she probably doesn't want to. I cannot wait in uncertainty, not knowing when I'll ever speak to her again. I just know that I cannot go on for much longer. Every day is pure torture and it has to stop. I'm at my end...",18Feb2019,1

Don't know if this is the right place to ask about it, but why not.... Is it weird of me to not want or have any friends, only people in my life are my family and my partner, that is it. I used to have friends but I noticied I can't nor seem to want to keep any, like I only have people in my life if they inevitably are there aka being togeather in school or working togeather. Now even if people write to me, I never answere cause I don't want to or feel like I have any energy to talk let alone have anything to say to that person. I could just be alone in my bubble and that should be okay as well right. But I still feel like I want to be close to people, share thoughts, be there for eachother, just connect and have fun like I know it is possible. Why then whenever somebody reaches out I don't want to do anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, maybe somebody can relate or enlighten me a little.
I think I might be suffering from avoidant personality disorder so it just mightbe a symptom of that. Can't go to get any help though cause everything has to be so expensive plus I'm too anxious to go to therapy. My partner is literally like my back bone without them I would not be functioning as well as I have so far, without them I would go crazy. It's quite scary to know that I'm so deppendant on that person if they would leave I would be all alone without anybody to be there for me and considering my anxiety and depression I would most likley do something bad.

I dont really have any friends i can talk to this about, and i just had a pretty bad mental breakdown while trying to fall asleep yesterday.

I cant keep living like this anymore, shut away from everyone about my problems, but i have no way that im ok with fixing it.

What should i do?",18Feb2019,1
27,"I'm not sure what I should be doing to pull out of this. This is my first real foray into treating my depression after several years of mild depressive episodes. Last summer/fall were miserable and I could tell that I wasn't going to snap out of it like I had in the past. Saw a psychiatrist in January and started my first AD medication. It's been about 4 weeks and I'm starting to feel it soak in. I know it's a process, but I feel so alone and scared of where this heading. Some days I feel incapable of emotions, other days I feel locked into whatever emotional state was last brought to the surface. Please tell me this isn't going to be the norm. Help me figure out how to get through this. I'm starting counceling in a couple days, but in the meantime I'm grasping for any sort of stability and calm. Where do you find your rock to perch on while the storm rages around you?

28,"Hello this is my first post on Reddit so i will try my best.

I wont say my full name, but i live in the Faroe Islands. My town is not big, so there isnt so much to do here. For the past months or so i just feel empty and sad, i used be a very active person, but now my interests are pretty much gone. Before i started feeling sad and empty i played badminton and was at some fitness thingy pretty often. I even have a girlfriend. (excuse me for my bad english)

I've had a girlfriend for 1 month, and she is the only thing that pretty much helps me cope. When I'm with her i feel some happiness, plus we even talk about it sometimes.

For some more info on me, every person i know says i have a very good heart, that i always put someone else before i think of me. I'm pretty good at helping people cope with something, and my girlfriend says that too (since i've helped her some times too). But I'm so scared of really telling anyone how i REALLY feel. There are so many moments where i just panic and begin to cry for no apparent reason. some times i even think of just ending it. If someone has any suggestions for me, please answer to this because i dont know what to do, if you want more info just write to me and i will try to answer as soon as i can.",18Feb2019,2
29,"I feel so fucking sad and horrible. I swear none of my “friends” even care about me. They just use me to help them out with school. I get left out of everything, they never hit me up to do anything. I’m always the one that initiates conversation. For the past few days I haven’t talked to anyone just to see if someone would actually hit me up first. I haven’t heard a single word. No one has even said hi to me or asked how I’m doing. I feel worthless because I don’t have any real friends. I hate myself. But I’m too scared to kill myself because I don’t want to go to hell. I don’t really know why I’m writing this I just am.

31,"Hey, r/depression_help. I have no idea if this is the right sub to post this, I haven't been actually diagnosed with depression or anything, but that's sure what it feels like. I feel gloomy and miserable af. I'm having a particularly bad day now, so thought i'll write this and get some advice. Here's my story.
3 years ago, everything was fucking perfect man, like legit. I had lost so much weight in the span of a few months and everyone was astonished. I was the talk of the school, so many people came up to me, expressing their congratulations and surprise. As a guy who had lived all of his life as a obese person upto that point, it felt really, really fucking good. Not only my body was doing well tho. I had somehow manage to make a a complete 180 turn when it came to my grades. I went from the second from last in my class to the 9th in the cohort. It felt like i was living in a movie, I swear. Great friends, great life. I enjoyed both school and holidays a ton.
Then came my big national exams, in 2017. Here's where some of the problems started, towards the end of the year , as preparations for the exam started intensifying, I found myself unable to focus and stressed out. Here's where i started stress eating for the first time. There were times where i'll cry myself to sleep in the dark, in fear that i was going to disappoint everyone who've believed in me up till that point. Eventually the exams came. And to my extreme surprise, I actually did a pretty great job! But then came 2018, where the shit REALLY started to hit the fan.
2018 started with me shifting houses, which was kinda devastating to be honest. I had a next door neighbour back at my old friend. She was far more than just a neighbour. A family friend, a godmother. She guided and helped me a ton in life. Lets call her 'auntie'. My old flat was pretty small, so i had to share a room with my grandparents. Problem was that I'm really fucking sensitive to snoring. I legitimately cannot sleep if someone snores, and unfortunately for me, my grandparents snored a ton. Auntie had a son who was overseas working, so there was an empty room in her flat. She asked me if I would like to come there to sleep at night. It was a win-win. I had my 'own room' to study and sleep in, and Auntie's husband had some ailments, so there was someone to help if anything happened at an inopportune time. I grew really fond of Auntie and the house over the two years.
Parting with her wasn't easy at all, a real tearful affair. But hey, my new house wasn't so far, and I tried to visit as often as I could. 2018 was also the start of tertiary education, and I was pretty damn pumped. My good results in the national exam meant that i had a wide variety of choices in the course I wanted to take. I decided on a media one. All my life, I loved reading, writing, and telling stories, so it seemed like the right choice. I started preparing for tertiary. It was the first time we got to wear casual clothes in school instead of uniforms, and I really wanted to look good. I went to the gym and actually managed to lose most of the weight I had gained due to the stress eating. I started a new skincare routine that gave me great results. I was all set for a great tertiary education, or at least that's what i thought.
It started out decent, My new classmates seemed chill, and the course seemed fun, yet educational at the same time. But as time went on, I started to realise that my classmates weren't what they seemed to be at first. I don't mean to slander them, but they seemed 'fake' in a way. No sense of genuineness. People were so eager to talk behind each other's back. I complained a lot about my classmates back in my previous school, but there, everything felt like a family. No matter the issues you had with a person, you'll help them if they were in dire need. But here, people were readily looking to trip you over. I made one close friend in the class, a diamond in the rough. We'll call him Daniel. Now around this time is where the negative thoughts and vibes slowly started to stream in. Every single second i'll start to think about how fun life was back in my old school, and how much i missed Auntie and her house. I had so much disdain for my class, and it really was an unpleasant experience to see them everyday.
The stress eating returned with a VENGEANCE. I ate WAYYYY more than what i did over the exams. It sucked, and i slowly started gaining weight. The semester somehow ended, and i had a two month break. I aimed to restart my reading habit that disappeared in tertiary and go to the gym to trim my body a bit, but hah, none of those plans came to fruition. The break ended in the blink of an eye, and I had to return to school. My new class SUCKED ASS. I knew none of them, and Daniel wasn't there. He was a pillar of support for me back in the first sem, someone who i'ld rant and talk to whenever i got the chance to. It really felt bad that he wouldn't be alongside me anymore. There were so many new people in the class who all knew each other well, but i barely had any contact with them. It felt fucking horrible. I started to realise that maybe this wasnt the right course for me after all, seeing how much passion these people had for the subject matter compared to me.
Here i am now guys. Ive gained back half of the weight that I lost back in 2016. It burns when the same people who complimented me once now point out that i've gained weight exponentially. I don't blame them tho. My skincare routine went to shit too, and my face is full of acne. I feel super lonely now. I've lost touch with almost all my friends in my previous school, again, I don't blame them, some of them have got awesome tertiary lives and I feel genuinely happy for them. I don't wish to talk to anyone from my current school, and i feel really fucking isolated. I miss how easy it was to meet up and converse with my best friends back at my old house, they all lived nearby. Speaking about these friends, unfortunately we aren't as close as we used to be too. I know it doesn't sound super tragic or sad or anything, but I really can't take it. I feel like i'm drowning. I don't even know where to start to help myself. I feel really fucking ashamed of my body, my clothes dont fit anymore. But I cant help it. Food feels so good, a source of comfort when nothing else is there for me. I feel like i've fallen from grace, and I dont know if i can ever go back. Thanks for hearing me out and reading this far guys. I hope everyone's doing fine. And please, help me if possible. Thank you and have a nice day.",18Feb2019,5
