0,"If you have that feeling where nothing seems to feel interesting, important, or desirable, I would recommend mentally asking the question ‚Äúwhat would make me feel better?‚Äù rather than the question that is likely going through your head: ‚Äúwhat do I want to do?‚Äù

The answer to ‚Äúwhat do I want to do‚Äù is very often ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know / nothing.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt move you forward productively. 

But if you ask ‚Äúwhat would help make me feel better‚Äù you will likely come up with a few reasons (perhaps, ‚Äúwork out‚Äù or ‚Äútake a shower‚Äù). Now, you may not want to do any of these things, of course, but at least you‚Äôve identified tangible goals that you estimate will improve your mood somewhat. Having a goal is a lot better than being completely confused on how to feel better in any way. 

And while this may not seem like much, compare it to what you got out of asking ‚Äúwhat do I want to do,‚Äù in which case you solved absolutely nothing and basically just went into a thought circle of ‚Äúwhat do I want to do?? Nothing... hmmm (*procrastinate*). What do I want to do?? Nothing.... hmmm (*procrastinate*)... etc etc 

Remember the question is ‚Äúwhat will HELP me feel BETTER,‚Äù this isn‚Äôt meant to be a cure. It‚Äôs just identifying and remembering things that improved your mood, however slightly, in the past - so that you can rationally consider whether to use those tools now. Often times you will find that you‚Äôre just forgetting about small things that will help improve your mood somewhat (for example, forgetting to shower).",25Nov2019,1

4,"I'm completely exhausted. I have no motivation to do anything in life anymore. 

The only things I feel like doing are sleeping, being on my phone, and eating. Even then, nothing actually brings me pleasure or happiness. I can't even put effort into anything anymore because I become so distracted and everything feels so hopeless so I procrastinate so much. 

Just thinking about what to write on this post is hard but I really really want to vent so much but I just cant explain it all. In school my grades are suffering because I end up missing school a lot, either due to depression or panic attacks. 

All I wanna do in life is sleep and eat and use the internet, I used to have so many interests, for example, drawing and gaming. I would draw all the time and was really into improving my art, but these days it feels like such hard work even getting a piece of paper out. When i start up my favourite games, it's sometimes hard to even play one round (like in splatoon) because it feels so pointless and repetitive. 

Everything just feels like a chore to be honest. A lot of the time it feels painful, like emotionally painful, just to wake up, a mixed feeling of dread and sadness and fear and disappointment. 

This post most likely will not be noticed but these are just my feelings and I really really need advice I guess.",25Nov2019,1
5,Me and my so called boyfriend broke up tonight and all he had to say to me was it's not me it is him because he says that he feels I would dump him because when he was younger his mother and father forced him to take estrogen pills and as a result he grew small breast he felt embarrassed about it and I told him that it is ok I still love you for you no matter what and later on I got upset and posted a picture as my profile picture on Facebook saying you are worthless then my ex texted me saying why is that your profile picture I went on to discuss with him that I am worthless and he kept insuring me that I was not but I told him I am. Later on tonight he text me again and said that he was telling one of our good friends (that me and him are dating) but then he tells me in text that he did not really mean it that way he was playing a joke with her so I got very upset and confused and asked him why he said that he was joking about us dating literally today me and him video chatted for 6 hours today and then out of the blue he wants to break up with me I am so devastated and heartbroken because I shared my life with him i told him everything that ever happened in my life because he wanted to know and now he goes and does this to me. Please tell me what I should do to stop all of these bad thoughts that are happening üò≠üò≠üò≠,25Nov2019,1

8,"My sister is 31 and has barely spoken to me in 8 years. For most of that time we lived in the same house. I recently moved out. She dropped out of college 9 years ago due to cluster headaches and other sickness. We thought she was just sick but it I soon realized she had other issues. She stopped talking to me years ago because I was not supportive of her. I tried to reach out over the years but she refused to acknowledge me or my brother. She became closed off to my parents as well who have been supporting her financially. 

I've tried to advocate her seeing a psychologist along with doctors for her physical ailments but she hates them and says they are mean to her. My parents said for a long time to just leave her alone and she needed time to get physically better. I didn't believe that and was heartbroken but let them do things their way. Recently my sister has stopped talking to either of my parents. She barely leaves her room and leaves only late at night when others are asleep to eat and shower. She's losing weight. My parents are heartbroken because they are now if ignoring her. They fear if they do something wrong she will hurt herself. It's obvious that she is very depressed, anxious and angry at everyone. They finally see what I I was saying years ago. They want to get her help but we don't know what to do since she is an adult and we can't force her to see anyone. We feel lost. I'm hopeful since my parents finally see how huge of a problem this is but I need some advice of what if anything we can do to help her.",25Nov2019,1

12,"As the title suggests, no one gets me.

Im a 16 year old male who gets mediocre grades due to the fact he doesn't study. I have no gf as no one would care about my shitty face/body or childish personality.

My own family critizises me for not studying hard enough while I wake up every day feeling like shit.

Some time ago I tried to cheer myself up and started writing 5 reasons to live every day I woke up. I can't even write two of 'em.

No one knows about this as the first time I talked about it I felt worse for the reaction of my parents and how broken they were while in treatment than the actual depression. Even if I didn't get any better, everyday I would act a little better until the psychologist said I was ok, even if I was only acting (look, one thing I'm good at. Took me 16 years to realise).

This ks my second one and the only reason I wake up everyday without ending my life is because, the only thing I really care about was what would happen to my parents if I not only died, but killed myself.

If you have read this far, just want to thank you for taking your time to read through my sh*t.

Hope you get something more entertaining to do from now on ;).",25Nov2019,1

18,"This isn't completely surprising, but I just realized how bad it's truly gotten. At my current job we've gotten a bunch of new hires, and I'm also starting a new job. So basically a lot of people I've been meeting. This has made it very clear to me that I'm at a complete loss of how to hold an interesting conversation for a length of time. I find myself always defaulting to talking about the most basic work topics. After that I just...cant think of what to say. I'm not that interesting so I don't really know what else to do lmao

I was really happy to get a friend like her she was supportive and caring but for the past six moths i have noticed that she was not replying to my text , tbh i thought it was fine and thought because of the semester. (We are classmates). I have noticed that she only act Friendly when she need to. I thought it was also fine as she may be nervous to ask for favours but for a past month i have noticed that she completely stop texted me (just a few days ago she asked about our friendship beyond college). This seems very suspicious. I don't know what have gone wrong. I see her as my friend still. It's okay to break friendship if one party thinks it. The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she don't reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone (i suffer from schizophrenia). I don't know if what happening is real or i am making the stuff up. Anyway despite of knowing everything she is not coming clean. I suspect she don't want me be her friend anymore (and it's fine,) but she is not telling me that because of the help ,/ benifit.

I am a university student and also work part time. I try my best to muddle through my tasks but any other free time I have I don't have the motivation to leave my bed, not even to eat. I have suffered with anxiety and depression since I was 15 but it feels like it's only getting worse.

23,"As the semester is coming to an end I‚Äôm starting to feel overwhelmed. It‚Äôs other things as well, work, friends, school and home. 

Work; I work full time and sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt have time to work on my passion projects. It‚Äôs an okay job pays well but I feel like a nobody there I‚Äôm miserable as hell! I have to see an ex and a friend is now dating her so I have to see both of them and it sucks! I‚Äôm kinda over it I‚Äôm trying but it bugs the living hell outta of me.. 

Friends; we are a group of four, I would say one of them is ride or die best friend but I feel like she doesn‚Äôt take my anxiety, depression or me being busy into consideration. She‚Äôll throw a petty fit if I can‚Äôt make it to functions, She‚Äôll guilt trip me. Lowkey I hate to say but I feel like my anxiety has gotten worse, when she kinda said she has feelings for me and I told her I really don‚Äôt and she made me feel guilty for not liking her and one of my other friends in that group just started being rude cause I didn‚Äôt have feelings for our friend. Idk it seems like my group of friends are now giving me anxiety then having fun... and I can‚Äôt tell them that because I‚Äôll come off as rude, selfish and unappreciative...

School; I‚Äôm a music production and illustration major, it gets very overwhelming, a lot of thoughts run in my head ‚Äúam I going to be a great artist?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I going to change the world?‚Äù I hold a lot of high standards of on myself I guess it comes with being the eldest in my family but like I feel like I‚Äôm running outta time, the pro part about being school even though I feel 
Amateur I feel like I‚Äôm getting way better..

Home; it just seems I‚Äôm busy with work and school that I feel like I‚Äôm not in touch with my family, I got to be with them Saturday and it was an amazing evening but I had anxiety of my friend not responding ( I guess I‚Äôm my head I was like did I piss off my friend to the point where I don‚Äôt have a friend anymore)

24,"No matter if I‚Äôm in what I call the hole/pit (my depression times) I always want to be dead. 

I was in the pit last week but my head feels pretty clear the last few days and I‚Äôm laughing and joking and actually motivated and wanting to leave the house and do stuff. And so I don‚Äôt want to die, but it‚Äôs also that I‚Äôm super aware that the pit is gonna creep up on me again and I will fall in (sorry for all the metaphors it‚Äôs just how makes sense in my head) and then I will want to kill myself again, like the physical action. There is a big difference for me in always wanting to be dead and wanting to die. 

When I‚Äôm in the pit I have no feelings pretty much except the occasional wave of sadness. And my friends know when I‚Äôm in them as I have zero contact and I never leave my room if I can help it. Im always embarrassed when people see how I truly feel as I normally portray myself as a happy person who doesn‚Äôt really give a shit about anything. So I don‚Äôt like letting people see that side of me which normally through me forcing trying to be normal around me gets me out of the pit.

I feel like though with this method I‚Äôm not ever truly out of it. One of my friends thinks I need to get therapy help and I agree with her even though I don‚Äôt really think I can be helped, I‚Äôve felt this way for as long as I can remember, I think. I‚Äôm not good at sharing feelings or really knowing what I‚Äôm feeling.  And I also have no money to afford a therapist anyway.

All I really want to do is push everyone out of my life so that no one will be hurt or aware when I kill myself. This is impossible though, so don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not a suicidal risk. If no one would be hurt I would have killed myself along time ago with no regret. I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people that love me though. I have no idea how to want to live.",25Nov2019,1

I'm grateful for a lot of things. I have parents who love me, can afford to go to college (barely), and I don't have a physical disability. 

I guess I'm afraid of losing what I have. I'm sorry, I'm in a bad state now.  I don't think this post will make sense.

Do you know how it feels to know you can't get anywhere in life? I'm 20 and I see it. I was a fool to major in computer science. I realized I was garbage at every subject in school. So I chose the one that I liked to major in.  No big deal, things will get easier.

Fast forward 3 years and 2 failed classes that set me back far. I barely got better at cs. I'm far too slow to learn, and I never developed a mind for programming. Every little thing is monumentally difficult. Everyone says you can achieve anything if you ""put your mind to it"". Well... my grades say otherwise.

The couple of people crazy enough to stick around me at school say I work hard. I know I do. I fucking do. But I'm also really stupid. Just intellectually stupid.

It's too late to switch majors. I need to support my family. They're old and broke. I'm the only way out.

My family. I'm the baby. My big cousins immigrated here. They're not doing much with their lives, but some of them seem to be happy. One of them died last year. Short story is drugs. My aunts and uncles, I pity looking at them. They're old. They don't say it, but they expected more from us. They left their home country to give us opportunities. 

I have to say, I'm a nihilist. I feel some negative feeling that I can't put into words towards my parents. Why have children who will have to work so hard? The way I phrased that makes me sound like an ungrateful prick. Maybe I am. I feel very negative feelings towards people who decide to have children these days. If they knew that people can feel really bad, hopelessly, disgustingly bad regardless of how they were raised, would they still have kids? If yes, that's so cruel.

I hate myself more when I bitch and complain like this. I'm supposed to be Christian.

There's only one thing I can do with my worthless self to make money. Find some seedy alley in NYC and suck dick for a dollar.

Did you ask why I don't just end myself? The answer is that I'm a coward. I'm afraid of what happens afterward.

I'm grateful I'm not overweight. I go to the gym at least weekly. I always feel like garbage the next day though, I don't know why. At first I thought it was a stretching problem, not I don't think so. 

I feel like I tried every piece of advice on Reddit. I go to the gym even though I really dislike it. I took up a hobby. I'm learning guitar at age 20. It's not good to learn when I'm in this state. It sounds bad and it frustrates me and makes me feel worse.
