0,"Hi everyone,
I’ve had depression for the past year and have lost a lot of weight because of it. I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t even eat food without feeling sick, it’s a real struggle for me because I have zero appetite and even when I do a little bit I get full after a few bites. Every bite is a struggle. It’s affecting my health and I need to start eating again - in withering away. 

My question is do you have any tips or advice for getting through this / starting to enjoy eating and having an appetite again? 
I can’t afford a therapist or psychologist right now. And I’ve been trying to drink a lot of smoothies because that’s at least easy to drink but it’s not enough and even that’s hard sometimes. 
Any advice / hacks/ tips would be so appreciated. ",02Feb2019,1
1,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with depression in 2007 (yes I've had depression for over half my life) but I was always had high functioning depression. As of recently I noticed that I am... well not functioning at all. I have some very important life changing events that I need to become prepared for, yet I cannot manage to do this. EVEN though I know things will be a million times better for my life if I manage to succeed in these events, I still can't manage to stop the sadness long enough to do anything about it. Does anyone have any tips or anything?",02Feb2019,1
2,I feel like I have no one to talk to for large portions of the day. I have very supportive friends that help when they can. I don't have the person that I could talk to about my mental health 24/7 anymore because they are the one that hurt me. I don't know where to turn during the times when my friends can't help.,02Feb2019,1
3,"I had an abortion 2 years ago, quit my toxic job in December. Currently unemployed but I have a new job that will take me in around March. I’ve been in bed all day and only get up to eat something. I eat one meal a day.. probably going through eating disorder. I’m always thinking about negativity... my bf and I had countless arguments and sometimes I just want to escape from living with him. But then again I am pretty broke. I tried going for walks and see nature but it’s not helping me. Instead it makes me think more negatively.  I need help. ",02Feb2019,1
4,"*VENTING*
I was trying, you know? To be okay, to get better, doing all *the things* you're supposed to be doing. I even made a deal: no self-harm, no binge eating, 8h of sleep. But I just can't do it. My brain broke 15yrs ago, and I just can't fix it. And I'm back at it, being a piece of sh*t again. ",02Feb2019,1
5,"Ok I have been diagnosed having schizoaffective disorder. I am on quite a few different meds, and they are helping, i would say i am depressed but its not the crushing weight of it like i am used to in the past. I just feel very lonely and very alone, its like there is an aching in my heart for something more. At this point I just do not know what to do, any advice would be appreciated.",02Feb2019,1
9,"Disclaimer: I am sorry if this post doesn’t fit, but I’ve tried posting elsewhere and haven’t gotten help. I have not been diagnosed with depression nor have I felt as if I did before.


To start, I watched this video on YouTube after scrolling through my recommendations for a bit.

https://youtu.be/mB_0FXiFHd0
To be honest, I thought it was pretty sad, and it spoke to me in a way I’ve never felt.
Afterwards, I began to feel an emotional hole in my chest, or, a void. I’m not sure what feeling this video triggered, but it’s happened to me only a few times before, and it’s never been this bad. Going on 6 days now, whenever i think of the girl in the video, I think of the song and what she went through. I feel it. It doesn’t matter where I am, what I am doing, or who I’m with. I’ve also began to feel less motivated to do things in my pastime. As a naive junior in h/s, I’m really not sure what to make of all this.  Help would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** why do things make me feel a void in my chest? ",02Feb2019,1
10,"I'm 26 and I'm realizing that I refuse to put myself out emotionally. I don't have any people that I feel comfortable being really emotionally intimate with and I think it's destroying  what relationships I do have. The consequences of this too often fall on my partner and I feel awful about  it. I don't even talk to them about what I'm feeling beyond ""I'm sad"" or ""I hate myself."" I've been with them for multiple years and I feel like they put so, so much into me emotionally and I don't do the same for them, I just expect them to be my unpaid, selfless therapist. 

I want to talk to a professional, but I really cannot afford it financially. I want to be a better person. I don't know. I feel like I've said very little here. I want to talk to someone but I don't really know how to convey what's wrong and I'm terrified of opening up emotionally and I fucking hate myself so too often my problems sound dumb and invalid when I say them to myself

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm on track to ending up without any real relationships. I know I need to start talking to people.

Any self help recs are appreciated.",02Feb2019,1
12,"I'm 20 years old and haven't been diagnosed or even seen a therapist yet. I've always felt empty and passively suicidal but I was doing well in high school so I've never found a reason to seek help despite cutting my wrists when I was 10-14 years old. I always thought that if I really needed to get help I'd ask but now that I really do need help (failing out of college, recently began cutting again, drinking a lot), I can't seem to find the courage or energy to reach out to anyone. I feel like I'm just being so childish and that I should just hurry up and tell someone but it never happens. I feel like I know all the answers regarding where I should go to get help but can't take the first step. How do I actually find the energy to reach out?",02Feb2019,1
14,"You might have read similar posts like this here before, and I am not promising anything original. I just want to write this down and complain, maybe I will have an epiphany during the process of writing.

I am 26 years old, doing my masters, still no income. My parents support me with everything, they pay for my school, my living costs, everything. I hate myself, I am very lazy, and the only thing I enjoy doing is to stay at home, eat and fail to fulfil any of my responsibilities. I should die. When I think of the future, I do not see anything for myself, because I hate the idea of taking responsibility. I have a huge inferiority complex, I always compare myself to others. 

As regards my studies, I do not communicate with my professors because I think they hate me and I don't deserve to be one of their students. I am less accomplished than everybody else. I do not get anything done and when I do, it's crap. Because of all the stress of deadlines and what not, I gained some weight last year and I hate myself for it. I keep eating my emotions. 

I think I am too old, yet have made nothing of myself, and I always pity myself for having no place in the world. I don't love and respect myself and I do not love and respect others. I keep repelling people off. I am no longer talking to any of my close friends. I hate the idea of people seeing me, asking about what I did, talking to others. 

This sounds all very melodramatic and somewhat like a teenager's post. But this is how I feel and I am just so sick of feeling like this. I've felt like a failure and an insignificant person since last 10 years. I've been to psychiatrists, which have all said I was depressed and prescribed anti-depressants. Then I want to therapy for CBT but I couldn't complete the whole program so it was not enough to solve the whole problem.  ",02Feb2019,1

17,"Hey, I feel pathetic for just searching up this subreddit and for typing it here. I just want to get some things off my chest for 3 years. Yes! I kept every bit of emotion in myself, locked and seldom visiting for 3 years. I won't say much, just that I am always depressed (24x7), can't sleep or eat properly. I fake smiles and don't even bathe regularly. I keep recalling of my failures and how I have let people down around me. I try to suppress things with loud music and seldom(once/twice a month) intoxications (drinking and marijuana). I am 27 years old and I feel the need to earn more money because of all the expectations of my parents, my girlfriend and my own. But, I don't get the motivation. My girlfriend knows about my state but doesn't understand how severe it is (I don't tell her much though because she doesn't like me talking depressing things). And I feel I need to work on it myself and not bring her into this. I get teary all the time for no reason. Even when I am not thinking of anything sad. I am from India and here 'depression' is a non-existential term. I have so much to say but I don't want it to be a TL;TR. Anyways, feel a little better now I guess.",02Feb2019,1
18,"Hi, I'ma 23 y/o guy and idk. I'm supposed to be a fun loving person but it just seems like I can never do good in life. I'm good but am I good enough? I just need someone to talk to. I don't like this. One minute I'm fine the next I got shit running through my head. Do I even deserve to be loved? I've done nothing wrong but yet I feel like I have.

20,"I don't know if this is relevant to this subreddit, I'm just so excited I have to share this with someone.  


I've been on a intense journey to recovery for the past month without really seeing progress. And when I say intense, I mean every second has been dedicated to getting better. But all of the steps I've took didn't actually make things better, but rather just prevented me from harming or killing myself. Basically I've stayed in the sattle while still being terrorised. And it never felt worth it, until now! 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I got 7 or 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep! And for the first time I genuinely believe there's hope for me.

  
Sticking to recovery has been the hardest most un-gratifying thing I've done in my life. But I'm sticking to it! I'll still take all the small steps, and whatever it takes. And whenever I'll start to question it, I'll have this to look back at, and know it works, it just takes time and patience.  


Lots of love to the other fighters out there!",02Feb2019,1
21,"FUCK this eating disorder. I was doing SO FucKING WELL this past week; keeping calories healthy and balanced, working out daily, feeling a lot better. Then today rolls around and I feel like SHIT and end up not exercising and fucking relapsing, and now I feel guilty (like I ALWAYS do when I relapse) and as if I'll never be healthy. I fucking hate this, looking in the mirror and body dysmorphia and dysphoria fucking ruining the whole thing.

23,"Hi, I'm brand new at all this posting stuff so bare with me. A little about my situation, I'm 21 years old and physically disabled and bound to a wheelchair.. I have a disease called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and it eats my muscles away and typically the life expectancy is mid-20's to early 30's.. I was doing so well in life, had the perfect girlfriend up until recently and this happening is what has sent me in a down spiral. Due to my disability I'm able to really only stay home and I have absolutely no one outside of family of now to speak to.. I just feel so alone in life and never happy.. I just want one thing to be positive in my life. I'm so fed up of people thinking I'm some brave person for never letting things bother me, but on the inside I'm in absolute shambles.. it makes me want to just scream. I'm just really stuck in this dark pit, and I feel like I have no one. I get so down about my disease and now this breakup has made it so much worse, and to add onto things my grandpa recently passed away. I just want an ounce of happiness in my life",02Feb2019,1
24,"Do note I'm usually a quiet person and have been said to have a face of a guy that'd beat you up just for speaking to him and me being a weight lifter doesn't help any better at breaking the ice so people aren't reserved/scared when they talk to me.I pretend to be an extrovert when I'm around anyone.

Getting straight to the point,I have depression and usually have the semester breaks in college for time of isolation to calm myself and avoid social media and texting during the period of time but the person I dated and had known for a year \[20F\] thinks it's a joke when she damn well notices the unstable state of mind i have time to time.

She thinks I cheated on/forgot about her because I couldn't get anything ready for her birthday even though I've told her why.She wouldn't listen to me and I just had to let her out of my life because it was hurting.

I've been played for a fool by her once which I forgave her for. Maybe this time I made the right choice? I just need some views on it.

TL;DR I don't know if I made the right choice as someone that's not very good at letting out my feelings",02Feb2019,1

26,"I have anxiety and depression and it's bad at the moment. I don't think I've ever hit such a low point. But the question I wanted to ask is this do other people find they get anxious about their phones? By that I mean I flinch if my phone pings at all. I've got rid of practically all social media because of this. But even when a friend texts I go into a blind panic and I don't know why. I can't get involved in group messaging because I find I become consumed by what my answers should be or if I'm replying enough, it's ridiculous! Its gotten to the stage where I wish I could just turn it off forever. I just want to disappear. ",02Feb2019,1

28,"My boyfriend always invites people over and tells me nothing until last minute. When I'm depressed I'm not really social. I just want to be alone. I don't care if he makes plans but he always includes me and then I'm forced to pretend that I'm happy or hide in my room. Of course on the occasion that I pick the latter, he makes sure I guests know where I am which always makes me feel bad because then they think that I'm avoiding them. We've had multiple conversations about this usually with them ending in him promising to at least not make last minute plans, but it never changes... I just want some way to help him understand why and how this affects me. ",02Feb2019,1

30,"I’m a 27 years old guy, depressed on and off. I’ve steadily lost my friends and network, I’ve often been completely alone without anyone for longer periods of my life before. My last two friends left me some weeks ago due to my depression and being unable to get a job, getting mad at me and so on. I feel both confused, hopeless, unable to do anything with my situation, lost in time, lost behind, lonely and I don’t know what else. My brain is eating myself up. Sometimes I’m fine, but then hell arises within my brain cells. 

I’ve been working so hard on my education for most of my life (Master of Laws with heavy specialisations), earned a lot of skills (languages, piano, knowledge, interests, etc etc), but I get nothing back, while others don’t do anything really and get everything served. I really have no social life either, my life never starts. I feel left outside, occupied, empty, angry, afraid, held back by the universe or whatever. I’m unable to do anything, I’m anxious, procrastinating, afraid. I’m just growing older and the world just runs away from me while I sit here starring out on it.

I don’t know what to do at all.",02Feb2019,1
32,"Wasn’t sure where to post this, but since I have been suffering with depression, figured it was the right place to do so. 

So... been living with depression for about 10 years or so. It’s been an awful period in my life and in the beginning really didn’t know what was happening to me. Started to become more and more isolated, resorted to porn for solace and basically shut myself in. 

Fast forward a couple years later and I’m in the same spot as I have been in the past. Even tho I have had medical help and all, can’t figure out how to move forward. 

Picked new healthier hobbies such as photography; which allowed me to go out more and enjoy life in general. 
Some other bad habits haven’t been as easier to deal with mind you (specially the porn addiction I’ve developed).

Got a part time job and met great people there; even met a potential person of interest to me. But... don’t even know how to act “normal” anymore. 
Always second guessing myself, being withdrawn and kept to myself. 
There’s no way I can relate to another person in the state I am right now, let alone finding a partner; or so I think. 

All in all, I ask myself “what’s next?”
How does one ever make it out of this box/prison? How do I cope?

Would like to hear some feedback if possible, if not, thanks for reading anyways. Had to vent out with someone. ",02Feb2019,1
33,"This is going to sound crazy, but fuck it. 

Sometimes I know why this depression shit happens. 

Sometimes I dont. 

I have an overactive imagination...I like to imagine that somewhere on this earth I have a “Depression Counterpart.” My Depression Counterpart is a completely different person than me, I don’t know anything about them, but unfortunately, our emotions are linked: When their life sucks, I randomly get depression, when my life sucks, they randomly get depression.  

When my depression randomly starts acting up, I think to myself, “goddamnit, Depression Counterpart! You didn’t keep your shit together!”

But then I remember that they’re also having a bad time. In fact, they’re feeling the exact same thing that I am. Plus, I feel guilty about all the times I randomly made their life hell. 

Then I realize I should try to keep things together, not just for myself, but for my Depression Counterpart as well. 

This helps with loneliness, powerlessness, and also to realize that happiness can be just as self-feeding as depression.

Do it for yourself. But also do it for your depression counterpart. You will help each other. ",02Feb2019,1
