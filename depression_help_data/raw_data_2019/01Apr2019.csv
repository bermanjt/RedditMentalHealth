0,"Why can't I take the necessary steps that I know I must take to overcome my situation? I was depressed as a child and was undiagnosed. People thought of me as a shy and quiet kid, and I did too. In fact, I still am. Im very withdrawn. Growing up was rough. My father ran out and my mother had to take care of me, my two siblings, and my grandmom. My mom and I fought a lot, and she would yell things at me such as ""I never wanted you"" and ""you're just like your father."" She used to beat me to. It hurt a lot back then, and still does now.

Being an Asian kid going to an all white school was rough. I felt different and got made fun of for my race. I just considered it normal. I did made friends, but now I rarely have any. In school, I didn't care for my grades and slacked, only doing well enough in class work to pass. I kept up that habit going into college. With all my ap scores, I was able to skip a lot of introductory classes, but I knew I should have taken them anyways. I majored in engineering without knowing what it was. I just liked math and science and heard about that major in class a lot. I was failing and felt guilty to the point of not withdrawing from the class and accepting the F. I eventually failed out of community college and spent the next 2 years isolated in my room playing video games and watching movies. I watched the days pass and wanted to die. I knew how much of a burden I was being for my family, and especially my mother. I never worked and used the excuse of being a full time student for not looking for a job. My tuition was paid by my mom and we filed for student aid and didn't complete the forms or didn't use the money. I was suicidal and the only role I had was to pick up my sister from school. The only money I received was $200 a month for gas and food.

After 2 years, I finally told my mother that I failed out of college... Yeah, it took 2 years. I was 20. During the time I was in school, my friend introduced me to weed, which helped drown away the pain and days. I finally started going back to school, but this time at a different county. I was doing well initially and looked forward to it. But I quickly got back into old habits and failed out. Started to skip, do minimal effort, be late. And when I would do well on an essay or test, I would feel bad because I know I didn't do shit to deserve it. Perfectionism. I started to see the school's counselor because I was being suicidal. At the peak of my sadness being secluded, I pushed a knife into my arm as hard as I could. I knew it was a dull knife and wouldn't go through. I remember a time in middle school where I fantasized about killing myself by grabbing a knife and shoving it into my neck.

I left all of my friends who cared about me to hang with the ones who don't. It was a toxic friendship that I dropped a while ago. I want to reconnect to my friends who I still hold dear and miss.

I stopped showing up before the semester ended and don't know if I failed out or not. I was once again out of school, unemployed, and isolated. It wasn't until 6 months after that my sister hooked me up with a job. It's a low wage job, but it's something. It brought stability in my life and made me a lot less depressed.

I started to see a therapist after failing college for a second time, but I stopped showing up cause I felt bad about lying to him and was discharged. My health, I fear, is deteriorating. I've vegetated on my bed for years being depressed. I should go to a doctor but don't know how... And that's basically it.

This is getting rambly so I'll sum it up. Ive been depressed again and know I should go to a therapist, doctor, and school again. But I don't know how, or at least that's the excuse I tell myself. I have interests, but don't know if I can pursue them. I never loved anyone, and feel different and alone to the point where it hurts and I cry. My job sucks and I need to find a new one, but don't know how....... Im tired of that excuse too. Ive just turned 22 and I tell myself that I should just wither away because I will never become what I dream about. Idk... There's a lot more that I never told anyone that I want to share, but this is long as it is. Hope you have a fulfilling life. ",01Apr2019,4
2,"First time poster. Some background I have not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety and I have not talked to anyone about it. I don’t know if it’s actually depression or if it’s just self- loathing. I have been feeling numb a lot here lately and depressed.

3,"If you’ve been unable to brush your teeth in a long time you may have developed mild gum disease. If that’s the case brushing for the first time will lead to bleeding and discomfort.

If you’re really struggling just buy some mouth wash, the cheapest I’ve seen is 70p for a normal bottle. Using this just once a day can be a start.

When you can start brushing your teeth Use sensitive toothpaste such as sensodyne toothpaste. It will hurt a lot less and claims to repair damage. 

If it hurts, stop! When I’ve been at my worse I had to build up from mouth wash to 30 seconds then adding 10 seconds each time until I built up to 2 mins and then flossing.

If you start to floss, use sensitive floss and don’t do it straight away after a long time, it can make the bleeding worse. Work up to flossing.

I tried to find this advice a few years ago but no one is really open about it so I thought I’d share. Good luck!

4,"Long story short, Ive been dealing with depression for the past few years. I don't really have any close friends and I had a few family members I would spend time with but I wasn't happy with how my life was going, so I decided to move to another country by myself. I made a mistake by going. I have always been pretty lonely but not to the point where I am now. I am completely alone. I have a job but I barely talk with the people there and they dont really find any interest in me. I have nothing to do. I have no hobbies nor have I found anything I really enjoy doing. I wake up, go to work and the go back home. I barely talk to anyone and I barely go out. I constantly think about ending it all and I dont know what to do.",01Apr2019,3
5,"Lately I've been feeling completely alone. I hate myself so much, and I'm constantly staring in the mirror, hours even. I don't look forward to anything, I don't take pleasure in much at all. I especially don't enjoy being around my friends anymore.

To give a bit of background, my friend group is very tightly-knit (and I mean *tightly* knit) - it's my roommate and a couple girls. They're the only people I talk to at my college, and it's near impossible to make new friends (even they don't converse much with anyone else).

 I've always been very close with them, but all of a sudden, a shift occurred where the girls just started fucking hating me for no reason at all. I'm serious when I say there was no provocation whatsoever. I did absolutely nothing. It came out of nowhere.

Now I feel completely unwanted. I feel worthless, like I don't belong anywhere, like I'm incapable of being liked or loved. According to my roommate, they say I've been acting like a dick lately, but even he says I haven't been. I'm constantly shit on when I'm with them. If I say nothing about it, they say I'm being too sensitive, if I do say something then they say I'm am asshole. My roommate is starting to get pissed at them about it too.

They have literally said they want to push me to my breaking point. I have no idea what to do anymore. Anything and everything I do is wrong. There's tons of other drama that's happened, but it's too much to write on a single post. ",01Apr2019,3
6,"Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive.",01Apr2019,8

Ive had depression for a while and lately I’ve just been so fucking sad. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so lonely and my anxiety keeps me from doing anything people my age normally do(parties, dating/tinder, etc).
I’ve tried anything, (that’s been available to me at least) anti-depressants, therapy, nothing has helped. 
I’m not one for sharing my feelings w anyone around me, mainly bc it’s difficult for people to help or understand BUT I don’t want to start now( I know it’s bad).

Objectively my life is going well and I've been very lucky. I don't actually have anything to be sad about at the moment. I'm just tired and no amount of rest will relieve my tiredness.

13,"Day 1 of this.
Im not really sure where to start or how to word myself out.
I think thats been quite an issue for me lately. I can almost feel myself getting dumber or losing my grip on vocubulary. This bugs me alot. Ive become horrible at articulating myself and its only a component of whats makingg me feel down. These nights have gotten longer and quiter. And for some reason, the pit in my stomach feels much heavier at night. When im all alone. Loneliness has been an issue of mine for a while now. I find myself being more desperate to be in the presense of people i would usually see on a daily, almost constant basis in the not so distant past. Whats wrong with me?.
The line between being around other people and genuienly enjoying myself, and getting completely burnt out on social interaction and wanting to be alone has worn very thin. Whats wrong with me??
Im absolutely mortified about my future, and whether or not i can make success out of it in a self fulfilling way. I would love to be an accomplished and respected artist, but i feel like my skills in drawing and painting have severly deteriorated before they even got a chance to improve. Its fucking scary and sad. So fucking sad to me. Its this time at night where i feel like im on the verge of tears or bawling my eyes out. And i just dont know why. My band hss become so distant. I only feel an intense emptiness while being around the same people i used to look very much foward and excited in being in the same room with for hours on end. When did this stop being fun? The addition of new members, something that could only benefit us in every way, has driven me away from some of the people i used to call best friends. My intense social anxiety makes it so fucking hard for me to accomadate myself into and with their talents. Everybodys just cooler than me. Im just so fucking alone at times, it physically hurts me. The alcohol used to help, but now its a gamble whether it makes me a more social person,  or an emotional wreck. I just want my mother to be happy and proud of me, but i can see the pain and disappointment in her eyes when she looks at me now. Im already 21, and i have not the slightest clue where im going in life. It scares the living fuck out of me. I just want to be succesful and happy. Where did the past 5 years go? Every time i look at an old tour flyer or see a picture or video from those times, it fills my chest with an undescribable emptiness thst i somehoe cant even put into words. I miss those days so fucking much. I miss when my brother was closer to me. We used to go to concerts together, when i was just a young, naive 16 year old. The world seemed like it was filled with so many endless possibilities, and now im 21, and the world seems like its given up on me. Ive been handed so many chances to succeed and make something of myself. Ive turned every oppurtunity away out of completely nauseating fear. Im such a fucking loser. I miss the simpler times. I hear people say 21 is still so young, but why do i feel like im already way past my prime?. Ive wasted so many days laying in bed and just thinking, dwelling on the times of past. I DESPERATLY want to get out of this hole. But i dont have the slightest idea on where to start. I geusse im just fucking stupid for expecting results from absolutely nothing. Life has become nothing but fear for me. Someone please PLEASE help me. Please help me find my way. Please help me succeed. I really am starting to fucking hate myself.

16,"I'm a recent graduate from university in my mid 20s. Since I walked down that aisle, I couldntve imagined how empty my life had become. 

It's only been a year, and I feel like my life is unfulfilled. Still living with my parents, their false impression on how degrees and how the job market works doesnt help my case. 

I'm slowly but surely working to return to school for my certification in teaching. With that I can proceed on my path. Though I feel this may be alot more difficult than I anticipated. 

I want to leave home. Strike it out and making a name for myself. I planned to leave home and get an apartment with my close friends. But my parents are urging me to purchase a house, citing that theres no point to getting an apartment if you can get a house that is yours.

I dont have a well paying job yet in my field. I dont have a family of my own to warrant buying a large empty house. I try explaining to my parents if I can go through my apartment route. All my explanations fall on deaf ears. They change the subject, try to get me to say yes no matter what I  truly think, making me feel like a leashed dog.

I do want to leave home, but buying a house of my own is not in my pay range and not in my best interests. I'm content with living in a small apartment. But the constant urge to get a house I wont even live in (they suggest I rent it out), bears heavy on me. I even suggested if i could live independantly in an apartment, rent out the  house, and get my certifications all the while working. The answers are always derisive. I feel they have me chained to them, that I'd always depend on them. 

I want to be my own man. But how can I be if my choices are seen as foolish,  my parents believing having a degree equals gurenteed jobs 100% of the time, and keeping me in many ways in the dark about many thing involving my life choices. 

All this has beared down on me. I want to talk to someone, I want someone to understand. I want to make something of myself, but how can I with this? I cant eveb get my folks to understand. They either refuse to hear my opinion, or consider it short sided. I'm just so pissed, angry. And to top it off, conveniently I cant challenge them because I still live with them. 

What can I do. How can i explain my plan for my life if I'm talking to a brick wall?",01Apr2019,2

19,"So almost a year ago, I left my longest relationship. The reasoning is because the last two years I was with her was the most unhappy I've ever been in my life. She manipulated me into doing exactly what she wanted, and even costed me a few friends. She put me in a spot where I wanted to leave, but I didn't for such a long time, because she genuinely made me feel like if I left, no one else would want me. Within the last two years of that relationship, she cheated on me with multiple people. When I found out, I got more depressed than I already was. She felt bad for it (well, at least that's what she said), so she got one of those books that has things already written, and then you write something on the blank (example, something like ""Something I've been too shy to tell you is ________________."") titled ""Why I'm Crushing On You"". I thought it was really sweet, and it made my heart feel better. Everything was good until about two months later, when she cheated on me with my ex friend. It really left a large irreparable dent in how I saw her.

Fast forward to this year, about an hour ago... I was cleaning out my closet, and I found that book. I immediately curled up and pulled out chunks of my hair. That book is cursed to me, and I never thought I'd see it again. The sad thing about a relationship like that where you're with someone who's that manipulative is that you know that they don't see the world differently and learn from what they did to you. But you have to go through life with an irreparable scar, and just hope that nothing cuts it open again. For example, I used to love the movie Hitch, but I can't stand it anymore, because that's what we watched on one of our first dates. I used to love the God Of War game series, but I hate them now, because it's what I was addicted to when me and her first met. I'm not claiming to be a victim, because I know I wasn't the best, either. I was (keyword was, I've worked on it) an emotional leech (if you talked to me about your feelings, I'd just get as depressed as you are), I'm extremely OCD (when it comes to schedule, cleanliness or anything, so if you're even a minute late, I'll be annoyed), and I'm not very social (which I don't see why she saw that as a problem, but okay). But the thing is, I'm the only one that will admit that I'm not the perfect person. She on the other hand seems to think she's perfect, and it's truly upsetting that people like that don't understand the mental scars they're leaving people with.

This is the kind of damage it can leave people with. Where something they loved can now be something they hate. Where the smallest things can trigger bad memories. Where they have to live in fear of not why, but when they'll be triggered next.",01Apr2019,1

At least i had some time now to clear my mind and since i had so much free time i got myself fallout 76....it all down hill from here,i decided to join a clan on discord to socialize and put my mind elsewhere from the other problems i had created for myself. i must of spent from release of 76 November 14th to December not even answering doors opening letters or leaving the house, eating junk and drinking ungodly amount of coke cola then over the horizon Atlas was coming out i wanted to play it. so i got it. now at this point my loans were looking hairy so i already had a loan out for my bike, so i decided to sale my bike for half of what i got.and cover a loan for 1 month, then take smaller loans to cover it. with the launch of atlas i spent another 3 months playing it. after the 20th of march the servers were getting wiped so i stopped it was at this point i become so sick that i could barley walk i had to get my mum to carry me to hospital the doctor told me i had Cirrhosis. and told me to stop with anything fizzy or with sugar in it. on top of that i now have the bailiffs on me i tried apply for new jobs but no one cares, it is now the 1/4/19.

22,"The Cornered Animal

A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all it's life it's been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now it's cornered, for the first time it can't escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm.
In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, there's no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread, anxiety and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, there's no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, it's you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.

Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown 

For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and anxiety is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and anxiety.

For me, this is a basic outline of my history.

Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.

Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:

•	Denial
•	Suppression
•	Distraction
•	Subjugation
•	Enmeshment
•	Underdeveloped sense of self 
•	People pleasing 
•	Approval Seeking
•	Validation seeking
•	Substance abuse
•	Self pity

After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and anxiety.
For me, recovery meant:

Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.

Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.

Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.

My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.

Understanding and Acceptance

Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression, anxiety and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.

Acceptance.

Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.

The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.

At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry... 

So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.

This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and anxiety is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you don't want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance... 

After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.

Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further. 

An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by anxiety and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create won't be wonderful.

For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.

At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and anxiety because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.

Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.

Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if it's hard... even if it's scarey... even though it's unclear whether you will fail or succeed.

24,"Hello there,

Somehow, one of my relatives said me that all the things that happened to me is all because I spent a lot of time in watching movies and musical songs (a day complete) and for some reason that thing pissed me off...maybe she was right. I consider me like I don´t have a big problem like lost a parent, being abused (more than one time in sixth grade but it was resolved) or even break up with someone. I don´t have besties or someone even to talk, and before the eighteens I was fine of don´t have it. Maybe she was right...maybe I don´t consider think in a dream because I was watching useless series...and that cause me illness.

My relative is demonize the media and she watch me to don´t touch the phone. She thought that the media is causing the blooming of new mental illness that I wouldn´t have it in normal circunstances. ""If I be you I could take advantage of the Internet in search good things instead of watching useless series"" she said me yesterday. Maybe she is angry ´cause I don´t be honest with her and my parents about my problems. I talked with everyone about it, but I still have a fear of telling them about that I quit college without permission.

I acted lazy like a moth and maybe they pissed off. She tell me that she had problems too, but she doesn´t be lazy...she musn´t. Maybe I was act caprice since the beginning of my illness, ´cause everything goes wrong and I don´t do anything to solve that and I don´t want to. If I be a poor guy maybe I don´t think that I would think in thet possibility of a illness...maybe that illness is a fantasy or excuse to don´t do anything.

She waking me up early to do duties. She still angry but I don´t have the brave to said that his efforts to make me enter to college was useless. I think in commit suicide (I said in another post) but I don´t seriously trying. I´m in april. 

I´m still alive, the suicide hotlines of my country doesn´t anwer me but I search a contact with a psycologist...but I think is useless ´cause maybe isn´t a problem at all. Maybe I fall in love to be sick because I watch everything in media. ",01Apr2019,2

26,"I may seem like some run of the mill edgy teenager to you, and maybe I am. Frankly I don't care how you see it, but I actually really want to commit suicide, so that's that. How I started thinking of suicide was when I realised I absolutely hated and couldn't stand quite alot of people around me, even my friends. Granted there are one or two close friends I feel absolutely comfortable with, but they aren't with me everyday so I'm quite distressed most of the time. I don't know how to say this but the way people act and behave and what they deem normal seems absolutely redundant and downright wrong, and overtime I started asking myself why the fuck do people want to continue living in this world. I'm at this stage where I guess it's coming of age and I start accepting more and more responsibilities and stuff but honestly that just makes me feel that the world out there is so unreceiving and cruel that I want to escape from it, which is why I started watching anime and playing games, because people there are way more predictable and won't hurt me. This feeling gradually accumalates and that's how I came to the conclusion that I really do not want to live in this world, which led to me thinking about suicide. So the why I want to kill myself part is done. The next part is why I can't. First off, I'm scared of pain. Yes I don't want to live in this world but I'm a coward who doesn't like to take risks, and most of the suicide methods involves a little bit of pain, albeit a quick one most of the time. I thought over and over and concluded taking euthanasia, which is way out of my league cos it isn't allowed in my country and I would have to spend a shit ton of money on it, and also sealing the kitchen air tight and turning on the gas stove and then sleeping. The latter is actually pretty painless imo but then if gas leaks out I might not die and second even if I die if someone creates a spark near it an explosion might happen. I don't want that. I really don't want to inconvenience others. And thirdly, the reason that I can't kill myself is cos of the possibility that something good might happen in my life if I continue living. I mean, I like writing, for one, maybe if I lived long enough, tried hard enough I could be a writer. So to see that happen I'm forced to stay alive, which is both a pain to myself and society. Honestly, what should I do? I bet there are a thousand and one people out there who would tell me to live or spew some positive bs, but rather than that tell me what keeps you alive or why you live, because the world I live in rn is too cruel and uncomfortable for a coward like me to bear",01Apr2019,2

I'm a 19y guy with depression from 2year at least (I don't have much memories) and had thought about suicide a lot before meeting my bf (20) 1 and a half years ago.
I live in Switzerland and he lives in France so we see each other once every month.
But even with him in my live I feel like I will never get better. Worse, I feel like I'm ruining his life.

I hate myself. I feel like I can't do anything good, even if I try. I'm not very good in my job, I write but can't really do any good story and want to develop games in my free time (I'm developper but in formation rn) but don't work fast or well.
Everything that I learned seems to fade away or at least be too hard to reach, making me feeling even more like trash.

I went to a psy for 6 months at the beginning and they gave me pills. But despite the pills it doesn't helped. I was just feeling less.

But I hate talking to people. I have social anxiety and just a call make me feel dizzy. With my bf we call each other on Discord every day but when I'm bad I try to hide it. I can't. So he notices and it takes at least an hour for me to tell him, crying.

But it's always the same. Always the same thoughts, the same feeling. I hate myself even more because I know that I will always make him suffer. Nobody would want to date someone like me. Someone who can be suddently sad with always the same problems. But I fear that he might stay with me by pity or fear that I end it all.
I want him to be happy.

I cutted myself at the beggining and sometimes want to do it again but can't because he will notice. But it wasn't really something... It almost faded away now...
I know that I will never have the guts to die. I ""tried"" to eat many pills the psy gave me but I think I was faking because I went to the bathroom throwing up just after. I will just stay as a parasite and destroy his life.

He tells me that he loves me, that I will get better one day and I know that I couldn't dream of someone better.
But why me? There is plenty of better guy out there, even some other who needs help more that me or at least deserve it more than me.

Idk what to do... Idk how to stop the loop.
I want him to be happy that's all but I could never break out with him. I'm too weak for that. I'm too selfish for that.

I'm sorry for bothering you with my problems.
I will try to not delete this post after.

34," I have moderate to severe depression and anxiety. What does recovery from this illness look and feel like and how do I achieve it?

 I've been suicidal on and off since I was 7. I disassociate daily now. I have break downs where I just cry and feel excruciating emotional pain numerous times a month (not on a daily basis so maybe I'm not so bad off). I tell myself I'm a piece of shit and abuse myself mentally. I have been known to cut myself. 

On my ""good"" days I feel numb. Maybe that's when my medicine is actually working. I'm spaced out. I don't feel okay. I have little to no interest in things. I have a small attention span. I fake being okay to everyone I know. Even my husband has no idea I don't enjoy doing nice things with family. 

I know there are steps to overcoming depression but I'd like to know what's worked best for other people. Here's a list of things I've come up with to help me but this list is incomplete as I have not recovered. Can you help me out?

Here's my list:
Go to therapy often and be honest
Take medicine as prescribed
Talk it out with supportive friends
Don't dwell on past or future
Clean house for 30 minutes daily
Stay clean (shower or wipe body down, brush teeth daily, comb hair)
Get exorcise often
Get fresh air
Do something you enjoy or used to enjoy
Bond with loved ones

38,"Obligatory ""this isn't me"" post.

My girlfriend suffers from severe depression.  I'll spare details since I'm assuming this sub knows all about it.  Basically it comes and goes in waves.  When it comes, even if it's mild she will be crying and not leave the room.  All she does is lay in bed, and sometimes she can't sleep.  Her mild is what I've seen to be most people's ""bad days"".  Her bad days, she will totally shut down and get verbally aggressive, relatively unprovoked.  When I say relative, I mean, asking how her day is or giving her a hug will set her off.  

We have talked about counseling many times.  Both her mother and I have been trying to get her to sign up.  She told me that she's been trying to make contact, and the local counselor won't call back.  Today she told me that she's been lying because talking about things just makes her think about it more, and that makes her more upset.  

I should note that we're both in college.  We both filed for under $15,000 last year on our taxes so we qualify for everything low income.  She used to have depression meds but she tried to ween off and she hasn't taken them since September (when she moved in with me).  

There has been many triggers in her life, but I see it as moving on in the world.  The major trigger was her grandpa's suicide.  That I understand and that's by far her biggest.  Whenever she even thinks about him, she becomes a mess.  However there are other things like moving to this new town with me, she left her friends and is struggling to make new ones.  We're physically active and both go to the gym often, but that doesn't seem to help when she gets in the slump.  She has jumped around from a few jobs because each location is just shy of abusing their workers.  She's a CNA and deals with her bosses changing the timeclock so she gets small paychecks, verbal abuse from coworkers, being forced to pull doubles or say over her shift because the boss doesn't tell her that she hasn't scheduled anyone after.  There are dozens of things wrong that would get any normal person fired, but healthcare is so understaffed, it's all ignored. 


Bottom line, I don't know what to do.  It's hard dealing with her depression but I know that it's not who she is as a person.  She's amazing about 3/4s of the time, the rest she seems to be in a slump.  I'm about to graduate in a health degree and have a much better understanding of mental illness, biochemistry, and general health than she does.  However whatever I try to do to help, she either refuses or it doesn't work well.  Can someone make recommendations?  Avoiding meds would be a plus, but I'm to the point where I don't see any other option for her since she said that she feels counseling would make things worse.  I don't personally know much about what happens during counseling other than just talking.

For example, he suggested I go out and take photos, because I used to enjoy photography. What if I don't enjoy it? What if I give up too easily? What if I try every type of photography and dislike it, but really I gave them all up too easily? What if certain conditions caused me to not like it?

She used to be depressed but at the time we met she was feeling better. 4 months passed and we've been very happy together, until today where she revealed she feels depressed again, and that she felt that way two weeks ago. I tried to help but she crying while crying that i shouldn't try to help her and she would only hurt me. Need advice on how to help her please.

# Full version;

She just came out of a break up with a 3 year old  long distance relationship when we met, apparently, she had a soft crush on me ever since she saw me in the uni. We started talking a bit more and more in class and at recess times until one day we kinda found ourselves walking alone in the street so we both got the idea it was a date. We even announced it just to be sure cause we were that awkward at first. Then we got more intimate for each date, we had great memories and beautiful moments (Some embarrassing or sad too). And after being separated for two weeks we finally met. At first we were really happy  but then we started talking about how our vacation went. Turns out we both didn't have much fun. (PS: we only met once on those two weeks and didn't mention any of our problems cause we wanted that day to go relaxing and perfect). After exchanging some details, she suddenly said ""By the way, promise me you won't blame yourself if anything would happen to me or to us, cause I've been feeling very confused and I've been kind of depressed these past days"". I was shocked, i chuckled a bit thinking it was a bad April fools but the tears on her eyes stopped my heart from beating. I told her what was the problem and why would she bring up something like that, she started talking slowly about it, while crying and repeating ""i'm so sorry"". In the end, the closest thing i got to why she got in that state is because ""she doesn't love herself enough"" and ""she isn't religiously correct with herself"". She hardly speaks about her feelings or anything very personnel to her since she's a strong introvert. (PS: the reason to her extreme shyness and lack of explanation is that she was born in Paris and lived there for 10 years until her parents divorced and had her move to another country with a whole different mind set, religion, culture and of course language. Needless to say, she and her brothers were bullied and scarred from that). When i insisted for her to try activities that would make her feel better about herself and/or have a stronger connection to religion, she denied my advice saying that she tried to do new things but none of them felt special to her and that religious activities might take her at least months if not years for them to take effect since her brother (also depressed) had been practicing them for 3 years but it still didn't help him as much. She admitted she's very scared that she might hurt me or even cut ties with me like she did with some of her closest friends who tried to help her. She feels so bad about it and I can see it in her warm tears and soft crying. She showed me a quote about letting someone go ( [https://i.imgur.com/Du9m5mP.jpg?1](https://i.imgur.com/Du9m5mP.jpg?1) ). At first i thought she was justifying her thinking she might end up break up with me, but then when i read it, i understood she meant it for me to let her go before she starts hurting me. I was able to calm her down and convince her that we should try to tackle this together and not by herself, i told her i'l be able to withstand any harsh treatment she might do to me. I really love her and I know she does too, if anyone was ever in a similar situation or knows an advice / solution please do tell me. I'll also gladly provide any necessary details if needed.

(PS: I am not an expert in depression, i know some might mistake something else for it and I am more than likely to do the same mistake. I don't think of my situation any more urgent or important than other's, to each their problems and how they feel about them.

I’m also significantly less smarter than them and I feel like a burden on them every time I talk to them. 

Also, I’ve had strabismus since I was young because my parents wouldn’t let me wear glasses. Now my eyes are getting worse and I’m starting to lose control of them. I hate making eye contact and I’m scared of meeting new people because of my weird eyes. Everyone look at me funny and my friends even make jokes but they don’t realize how much it actually hurts. 

I also keep picking at my acne because I get anxious really easily so now my face is a huge mess and has so many scars. 

I’ve gained some weight in the past year too. I’m still classified as underweight for a teenage girl but I’ve noticed my face getting chubbier and my stomach getting bigger. I hate it. 

I’ve never felt so ugly and worthless in my life. My older sibling is at an Ivy League school and I’m constantly compared to them. I don’t really know what I’m doing and I’m just so disappointed in myself. 

I have no one to talk to about any of this. I come from a very conservative family and no one has time to put up with my crap. ",01Apr2019,4
45,"I’ve recently moved to a new nurse therapist from doing counselling sessions and I feel like I don’t really have the chance to talk about external factors that contribute to my emotions. I’ve previously done CBT and found it easier to talk to my older therapist, with my new one I don’t feel comfortable nor find what we are doing to be effective. 

I don’t really know what to say to her",01Apr2019,1
46,"Hm so after a year of suicide-thoughts-free period, they hit last night again. Stronger and newer this time. Oh I mean the thoughts and the desires.

I have a lot of late papers at the moment, and skipped a make-up exam my professor allowed me to do today. 

The void is very luring, and I don’t see any point being stuck in between anymore. I tried very hard to become a better person and to live in a happier state, yet they are all temporary and superficial - I am always the person I am and any ways of living is not going to satisfy me, I probably am programmed wrong or something but was born by a mistake. lol

Honestly don’t know how I should go from here? Standing up and trying to live like a normal person really is too much of an effort lol But of course I do have some form of hope or feel like I am obliged to live on, or else I would have ended it already. May also be I am too lazy though.

Anyhow, have a good day everyone.",01Apr2019,5
