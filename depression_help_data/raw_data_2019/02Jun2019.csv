0,"I am a male, 21-22 years old. Born to 2 doctors. I have a sister (18) and a brother (15).

First 4 years of my life were hazy. just me alone and having my babysitter care for me until she had to leave when she married someone. She was the first person i connect with and lose.
When i was born one of my grandparents was dead. The other one died when i was 1 year old. I always envied people who had such close families and have relationships with their aunts and uncles and grandparents. Half of mine were senile and the other half was dead. 

Then My only friend was my pet bunny, my mother cooked him for a meal and i ate him without knowing because i was told he ran away. I learned about it a decade ago. I ate my own friend that i cared for. I felt sick for days physically. 

When i was 6-7 i made my first friends of my age. A guy and 2 twins. It was amazing until we have to move. i moved with my family to our own house in the countryside, it was a bad poor area. All the families that lived there were related in some way and Essentially a clan, i was the outsider kid. The ""rich"" spoiled brat. Because because they knew the parents were doctors. 

It took me a year to open up to one of the guys close to my age that lived there because his parents knew mibr and he invited me to play with him and the other kids. I had a brand new football jersey and they commented on it and i was embarrassed until the game started and i was doing good. The other guy didn't like it so he threw sand in my face and i pushed him in response. Next thing i knew all the kids were beating me in defence of their relative. Some of then were older, 14 to 16. I never went back again. They hated me and labelled me the outsider since that day and i would cry in silently whenever my father sends me to buy groceries because it means I'll have to meet them and endure the bullying i have to fight multiple people. Eventually i learned to fight and i started giving back more than i receive. I developed a brutality that would aid me later on in life. 

I am an introverted, Not shy. I am not scared of people, i just get annoyed and tired by people's presence. I like and i enjoy my solitude while listening to music or chatting online or playing or reading a book. My parents refused to understand that its normal and my nature and thought i was antisocial and kept pressuring me to go to relatives, attend parties, meet classmates etc. It made me distance myself from them and i can't fix it now. 

My father forced me to attend this martial art class. I enjoyed the fighting as it allowed me to release anger but i gates the environment. Its the same as my neighbourhood, all close and related and then there's me. Along the years i made some friends there. But it was overall hell. One incident stands out. One of the kids my age stopped me when i was walking home (around 5km walk) and demanding some money and he and his older cousins beat me but i managed to get some hits on him as well. 
Years later i would learn that he was clowning around in front of his middle school and a truck fucked him up when he got near. He is now a vegetable. Whenever i see him when the other guys meet him to give him a present or anything i just stand back and watch his fucked up retarded brain gazing around with those glassy eyee. God i am glad he didn't die. It'll be too good and fast for him. I enjoyed watching his dirty excuse of existence and the life he lived now haha. 

When i was in middle school i was forced to leave and enter school by climbing the back wall to avoid the thugs and bullies who would be around the front gate and target people who they don't recognize as parts of their ""gangs"". Bullying and fighting was as big as education in that period of life. I got jumped for money multiple times even tho i don't carry it or just bullying for the sake of it. I fought back and i gkt black eyes, i got someone literally bite a chunk of my shoulder with their teeth. I almost killed someone when i bashed their head with a rock. I almost got stabbed. I stabbed someone. Highshcool was worse in ways but better in others. I don't go into details about it. 

When i was 15 my grandfather's health started getting downhill, memory loss and delirious stuff. 
I would visit him with my father couple times every couple months and each visit he would be worse until he would not recognize me and ask who i am. 

When i was 17, i was preparing for a test when i heard that he finally kicked the bucket and died. 
I didn't even attend his funeral i just went on to my studying. 

I lived with my aunt and her family in the capital while i was attending certain language classes and i got a lot closer to her husband, my uncle. The only male in the family. He became another father figure to me. He helped grow in new ways. Died a year ago after his smoking addiction caught up with him. 

I fell in love for the first time in my life. She returned the feelings. It was perfect. She left almost a year later because she couldn't handle the distance. I was crushed and cried with my dog alone at night. 

When i was 18 my best friend admitted that he thought nothing of me behind a lucky failure that was blessed to have parents to bail him (after my very average scores in my finals) and the bridge between us broke forever. 

When i was 20 i met a friend in Poland (i am studying here as a foreign student) and he was my friend friend in a strange land and we were both foreigners in a xenophobic place since he was from the middle east and i was from north Africa) and we bonded. He was best friend and helped me through a lot. 
I wake up one day with the news that he committed suicide and dumped from a building's window. 
I couldn't even attend his funeral because i was away. 

During the same year i fell in love with a girl that returned my feelings unlike the other crush i had months before. I love this girl and we are still together. She's polish. Her family hates me. I am a filthy brown skinned scum in their mind. I already hate my nationality because i hate how limited by options are internationally since my nation is trash in the scale of things. I am not a Muslim and not religious yet everyone would assume i am because of my nationality and looks. I get stopped in airports. The distrust in public. Her parents callee her a whore for being with nr and that she better enjoys wearing a headscarf. Her mother cried and called her a disappointment. Her father called her a whore. Her grandmothers keep telling her to be wary with me. Nowadays with the family getting to know me i still see her grandmother telling her not to trust me. My self hatred is deeply rooted for my looks and nationality because i hate it end i hate all that is related to it. I am forever judged for something i don't control even tho i share nothing with my countrymen. 


Months ago i hear that my last grandparent, my grandmother died as well and her body gave up. I am abroad so i can't argent the funeral. Wouldn't have done so even if i was there. The family connection just feels cold. 

Days ago i receive a message from my little brother figure. My friend that i consider my little brother more than my biological one. He is living on borrowed time before he dies from heart failure according to doctors. 

The latest news made me scared. I am scared because i do not feel the same angst and heart break of the usual suffering. 

I feel numb. I didn't feel the same pain and anger and rage as years ago. I just feel hazy, numb, feeling with bursts of sadness, Rage, confusion. But just that. Random spikes. Otherwise just dead. Numb.
Am i losing my feelings? What's going on with me? 
I will fail my university year for the second time because i can't function recently in this state. I don't know who i am anymore. I can't seem to stop my mind from reminding me of all the things I've been through and yet my emotions seem as tired as I am.
I just feel lost and confused. Will i lose everyone i get attached to? Is this sick joke by life? 
I have not mentioned every single bad thing that happened to me. I just started typing and wrote down most of the big events i guess. Thanks for reading. It felt slightly good to release. Am i getting desensitised to pain and anguish?",02Jun2019,1
1,"Was gonna make a throwaway account but fuck it, I just need to get things off my mind so it doesn’t matter anymore.

I’ve lived with anxiety my whole life. Moved to the US as a little kid and had to deal with the trauma of constantly moving places and learning a new language. 

Things were eventually fine after some time of course, but learning to handle life currently has been extremely rough and my anxiety problems have shot through the roof over the last few years. I was failing college in my first two years and had to switch to community college, my grades have turned around for the better lately but I’m constantly worried about how much longer I’m going to take to finish and whether or not my major is actually right for me. 

While all that was happening, I grew very insecure of myself. I found it hard to socialize and I cut off everyone including friends who I’ve known for years, I tried to make amends but I just felt uncomfortable every time I saw them. My overall confidence in social situations feels lost, it’s why I refuse to get a job or find new friendships. Despite being told that I’m good looking, I also have trouble with talking to women now.

My family has been a source of stability, until very recently when we went to visit some relatives. My fathers siblings sabotaged our entire vacation. They live rather unstable lives and are very jealous of his success, on top of that they are also narcissistic and manipulative. They took advantage of my dads good will and almost forced him to pay for things from expensive restaurants to big parties, all while being very rude and treating my mom, her side of the family and my siblings very wrongly. My aunt would then tell my dad that we don’t respect him among other things. And he would end up being mad AT US. It felt very betraying. Coming back from all that has been difficult and I constantly worry about the influence my aunt and her family have over my dad.

So there you have it, my life over the last 2ish years leading up to now, not to mention a number of unfortunate accidents and hospital visits that I never dealt with until now too, which in turn has made me a hypochondriac. I try to tell myself that there’s better days ahead but most of the time I just feel defeated and miserable. I’ve been seeing a therapist lately but it feels very far and in between and I feel like I don’t have time to say all of this. I don’t expect people to comment or anything but it just feels nice to have this all out now.",02Jun2019,1
2,"As a 15 year old who's struggled with depression, anxiety, and ADHD for really as long as I could remember, I dont really feel like I have a purpose on my own. I feel most stable when I'm helping others, giving advice and being a rock to lean on, but I feel like shit when trying to explain my problems to anyone else. I have a hard time making new friends, so the ones I have are the ones I have. 

Once I graduate and go to college, and I gradually lose contact with my old friends, I dont really see my purpose to live. My purpose before was to help and make my friends life even the tiniest amount better, but without anyone, I don't think my life on it's own will have any purpose.

I honestly think before I am 20 I will have committed suicide, because I cant see myself just going on in the monotony of life, with no purpose. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm just crying myself to sleep tonight and needed to talk to anyone",02Jun2019,1
3,"I hate my life currently, have no job, no friends really since I stopped drinking a lot, even less friends since I stopped smoking weed. I feel so alone. My closest friend is an ex GF/old friend (dated for a few years on and off towards the end but known her for 10 years) and I still love her, sucks when the only person who can help you through hard times can potentially make them worse. I could definitely call her right now and she’d be there for me but idk. I was falsely accused of sexual assault a few years ago and even though i am proven to be 100% innocent some people still think I did it. Threatening phone calls, people talking shit about me, and sometimes I’m not invited to functions because of this. I don’t really want to die cause I want to believe things will get better and I’ll get happier but these past few nights when I think about dying it makes me feel calm. Like a weight would be lifted off my shoulders.",02Jun2019,10
4,"I was in a really good place about three weeks ago. It was the best I have been all year. My ptsd has been cured and I basically had no more anxiety or depressionBut then I  went off of one of my anxiety meds. It gave me a ton of energy back and made me feel less sedated. Then something changed. I felt, *bored.* 

I am so used to having stress in my life I miss it. I keep looking to feel something again. I never thought I would say it but being happy and peaceful all the time is boring. 

And I have picked up a couple of bad coping methods. I have started compulsively eating and playing stressful video games for hours at a time. Every night I stay up past one just wasting time or gaming just to feel something. I have done jack shit for school because homework is just too boring. I keep wanting to do something risky and dangerous like light fires or hurt myself. I want to feel happiness or stress or just something.

I constantly need adrenaline or stress to make me feel good. My self care has gone to shit because I keep eating random shit throughout the day. I barely get up from my computer at all. I have not done any homework like I am supposed to be doing and I am sabotaging myself. I have never relapsed before and I do not know how to escape this cycle.",02Jun2019,1
5,"(Not sure if this is the best place for this or whether you guys can help.) I kind of hate myself right now. I acknowledge that I should study and that I will literally fail my classes if I don’t but I don’t put a single effort to do it even if I think it will be quick and easy. Then assignments are late and then I have more to do, less time to do it and on top of that I lose points for turning it in late. I am literally paying for the class out of my pocket but that doesn’t motivate me at all. Each time I say something along the lines of I will try this new trick or I will be more motivated and push through and succeed but it never happens when it is time to put that effort in. I have gotten to the point that even I have a hard time believing myself but once I do my family is easily convinced although I can tell they are eventually going to come to the end of their rope. I have less than a week to get my act together or I will fail all my classes. I can definitely save at least one or two if I get my butt in gear and get assignments done. I also need a more long term solution but for the moment I just need to get through the next couple weeks.",02Jun2019,3
6,The way i look the way I sound the stupid fucking anxious side where I can’t interact I hate that I hate myself nothing seems to help me anymore i know I’m probably a dumbass for even posting this i push people I like love friends away how stupid could I possibly fucking be,02Jun2019,1

9,"I don’t know how else to describe myself sometimes besides that I’m going crazy. When I am really depressed, I can’t stop crying, everything feels foggy, things look weird, and I act totally different. I don’t feel like myself when I am scratching through my skin, lying on the ground, etc. I don’t know if I should see a doctor about this since I want to hurt myself (not necessarily suicide though).  I saw a therapist for depression and it didn’t really do anything to help, so now I am wondering what I need to do.",02Jun2019,32

12,"My sister just got out of a breakup. For her, that was like the last straw because she feels her life is already crumbling. The guy was a big help with her daughter and now that he’s gone, she has no help with her kid and that has always been a problem before she met this guy because her ex husband never helped. Now she’s worried cause she’s 30 with a toddler and thinks no guy will ever want her. All she wants to do is sleep in bed all day but it is impossible with her daughter. My mom helps sometimes but treats depression as taboo ( in my family, we’re black, the older adults think therapy is  for crazy people). When I was going through depression after deployment, I remember my mom being the worst, especially when I had to go to the hospital. It was embarrassing for her. But my sister relies on my mom for support and is upset about how our mom treats her depression (taunting her about needing therapy like it’s a bad thing). I know helping with her daughter would give her relief, having the guy back in her life might help, but what can I do? I just had surgery and her kid is allergic to my dog (my dog helped me out of my depression and I don’t like being without her for long. she’s not an emotional support dog) so I can’t really help with her kid but I know she wants me to. I listen when she goes on her rants but I do want to do more.",02Jun2019,1
13,"It’s 5:30 am, lost count of how many days whit only a few hours of sleep. 
Too many things in my head, how to make it through the day. How to make it through the week. I’m a horrible person, a bad mom. What can I do to make it, to get out of this abyss. 
I don’t want to continue with so many things, but is just a cycle I can’t seem to get out. I’m too scare to be alone, even though I feel alone all the time. I cant get out of this cycle, because she needs a “Family”, but in what concept is this a family. 
I trust no one, because they see the act that we put to the outside world, an act that just shatters more and more every day. 
I have cried for help many times, but I feel like every one has me on mute and only listen when I say the opposite of how I feel. 
I don’t like me, don’t like what I become, I just do what I’m told to do, because that is for her best interests. 
I pretend to be strong, like I have it all together  but all I feel is shallow and dead. 
I lost my willing to go on she keeps me going, but I don’t know for how long I can keep the act.",02Jun2019,1
14,"Recently, I just quit smoking (cigarettes) and heavy drinking since I was legitimately doing it on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day. When the semester was in session I would do it after class or after work depending on the day. I started to mentally go downwards and my apathy was happening again. Anyways, I finally stopped at a right time, but now I can't seem to shake the feeling of apathy or just wanting to be alone and shun everyone out. People have told me why are you so quiet all of a sudden or how come you don't want to hangout. I've only felt like this at my lowest of lows and now it feels so exhausting even seeing people. I'm getting tired a lot and coffee doesn't help either.",02Jun2019,1
15,"Posted this over in /r/depression but no one helped:

Ya boi ain't doing too well in these streets, as you can tell.

I just lack the motivation to eat, and I have for a few days now. I feel like I don't deserve to, and in a way, even though I know it's completely illogical, I subconsciously feel like I deserve the pain that comes with all of this. I'm losing strength in my arms, and while I'm not expecting to suddenly be able to clear a buffet, I'd like to gain enough motivation to just be able to lift things without struggling, as to not make anyone worried about me. The last time this happened, my mom had to beg me to eat, and I don't want to ever worry her like that again. No mother deserves to see their child struggle to finish a bowl of cereal at night after not eating for the entire day leading up to it.

What I do eat, I tend to throw up a portion of, not because of an eating disorder, but because it just happens. I don't know how to explain it. I've gotten to the point where my body doesn't even reel back or even really react when I suddenly have to vomit.

And before anyone suggests it: I don't want to get high. I gotta keep my pee clean.

I want to be okay. I want to get better. I want to be stronger. Wishing all the best.",02Jun2019,12

17,I’ve been in this constant mix of depression/anxiety and calm/normal state for a few days. I’m pretty sure the anxiety stems from fear (of self harm/harm to others) which then brings the depression in. Anyone have tips?,02Jun2019,1
18,"I feel always the worst during afternoons. I am so tired all the time and have the most negative thoughts. Also it's even worse during school I am tired when I am there so it's also really hard to do homework back at home during weekends and I also can barely manage to go outside during this time

What should I do guys?",02Jun2019,3
19,"My (19M) girlfriend (19F) of one and a half years has struggled with varying severities of depression throughout her life but recently it has become very difficult for her. Unfortunately, due to a heart condition she is unable to take certain medication including antidepressants. Additionally, her parents are fairly dismissive of mental illness, and even if she were able to take medication her parents would disapprove. Obviously this makes treating her depression very hard and I can’t stand watching her struggle. Over the last month she said she just feels so alone and frequently thinks about suicide or self harm. If anyone in similar situations or otherwise has any suggestions for ways I could help her get through this trying time I would be very grateful. Activites, date ideas, or just ways I should compose myself would be greatly appreciated.",02Jun2019,42
20,"I am in the process of getting a job and I have a few options. They are all part time and only for the summer. I only feel passionate about one, but I feel that choosing it would be taking ""the easy way out"" for work this summer since I need to prepare myself for a life of constant work and stress that wont have any break periods. I feel like I have to take a job with the UPS (I do not hate or despise the UPS by any means) and work as a package sorter on the midnight shift (10:30 -3 A.M). This job pays very well but I am afraid that it will overload my mind, I don't do well with high amounts of stress for extended periods of time for days on end. I have also almost fell asleep at the wheel due to being tired on multiple occasions, and I feel that being up till 3 along with working my ass off from from 10 to 3 will make me tired and I will fall asleep and crash. My Mind just keeps telling me to ignore this and push through. My ideal job is working at an auto parts store ( I am a car guy) but it is only on the weekends and the pay is less per hour. My heart keeps telling me that I should do what I desire and my head keeps telling me that I should do what makes me the most money, since I am very cash starved. 

I know what it is like to take the pay and not the job, I had a job two summers ago and it nearly drove me to insanity because I hated my job and I hated doing my work because it just made me angry. The one reason I stayed is because the pay was good. But I feel like I have to do this again, due to my finical situation. That of which being that I have money stored away for after college, but as for money to use and spend right now, I have about $300, which is pretty pathetic considering my spending habits and my gas consumption.",02Jun2019,1

22,"So I had this idea:

In a Word document in my phone, I'm going to type the unsaid words that I've been wanting to say to certain people but can't IRL.

So far I've wrote 2 messages - one for a former teacher that I'm friends with, and one for an old friend that I haven't talked to for almost a year.

In a message for my teacher, I told him that I'm grateful to have met him. I told him I've been wanting to come out as bi but I can't because a lot of people (including family and some friends) don't like that. I told him he gave me hope and strength when I saw that he supports the lgbt community. I told him he's one of the people in my mind that made me hesitate giving up my life countless times when I break down at night.

In a message to an old friend that I haven't talked to for 11 months, I wrote that I'm sorry for not reaching out and isolating myself without saying anything. He's a fan of Queer Eye &amp; Drag Race and he's also youth group leader in a Born-Again church I used to go to. In the message I typed that I've been wanting to come out as bi for a long time, but I know religion doesn't approve of that, so I isolated myself. I was undergoing discipleship last July 2018, and also because my dad put me in the Catholic church choir, I didn't go to that Born-Again church anymore. I wrote that I wish him well, and to keep being a great person.


I wish I could have the strength to tell them this in real life. I feel numb now. I'm tired and feeling hopeless but I'm not crying in tears. For now maybe I'll have to sleep it off, or stay up browsing Reddit/Twitter until I feel sleepy.",02Jun2019,5

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

	I know that you love me, you know that I love you 

	I want to tell you about the things that I’ve been put through 

	I only wish that you as my mom knew, and my dad too 

	How you make me feel when you berate me for minor things 

	I know that you’re trying to make me a finer man, so I can bring 

	Pride, knowing that you raised me as a fine person 

	But I might worsen, with sadness lurking, as you make me feel like a bad person 

	For not contributing enough, or being lazy and stupid, my mind is hazy and lucid 

	At the same time, and I am trying, but I’m struggling to prove it, ‘cause I’ve lost motivation 

	Due to my depression, this is my confession, I feel worthless 

	I know you won’t believe me, and telling you would prove fruitless 

	I seem like a happy kid but I beat myself down 

	You tell me that I’m smart, you tell me that I’m cool, but really 

	I feel dumb, like a fool, but I shouldn’t be, in theory 

	My life is good, my parents are involved, but my mood revolves 

	From happy to gloomy, in different times of day 

	I never feel either side all the way, except for my gloom, in actuality 

	In reality, I never really feel happy, only okay to no, wait- 

	What am I saying, it doesn’t really matter, 

	You aren’t going to hear it, so love me or not I often feel the latter 

	Even though in my heart I know it’s the former, but rather 

	Tough or harsh or misguided love, and even if I don’t believe in God 

	If he’s up there I hope that he can see from abroad 

	That I need something that I don’t get right now, and that is appreciation 

	But every time you yell at me all I feel is depreciation 

	I know you’re just trying to prepare me for the real world 

	But I feel burdened, or maybe I should feel that way 

	Either way my true feelings are furled and curled up 

	Into a ball and thrown deep into the caves of my brain 

	Don’t know why I’m feeling this way, maybe I am lazy, maybe I am stupid 

	Or maybe these problems are more deeply rooted 

	Whatever the answer I’m doubting myself 

	But deep inside I’m thinking, “why help thyself?” 

	I can’t, and I have no one to turn to 

	I wish I was happy, I wish that were true 

	I’m not perfect, so maybe I can learn too 

	But I hope that someone understands me 

	Then, someone can listen empathetically 

	As I let out my emotions, pathetically 

	This is nearing the end so to everyone listening, I hope that this suffices 

	Just know that I’d never harbor vices 

	To the people that made me and raised me as who I am today 

	But when I feel truly happy again then that’d be the day 

	That I have finally, finally broken out of my gloomy daze",02Jun2019,3

25,"I just found this sub and I need to get this off my chest. Please excuse me if I dont make a lot of sense or sound vague right now.
I have multiple recurrent thoughts/worries (not suicidal) that I understand are not rational, but I get stuck in a pattern. These thoughts come back and agonize me and destroy the progress I try to make with my self-esteem and confidence. I try hard to keep them to myself because they sound absolutely ridiculous saying them out loud.
I tried to voice a couple of the more mild ones to someone close to me and they now use these insecurities to tease me. They think of them as one time problems that have passed or me just being crazy, and Ill turn it into a joke to spare their feelings because I care for them. But these are very real and hurt so much more than Im able to articulate.
So the same thing happens today and Im sitting here alone in a bad place. My meds arent helping, my therapy and coping skills are just about useless now. Im stuck in my own thoughts and I cant even voice them to work on healing because I get laughed at by everyone I trust enough to tell them to.
I am embarrassed by how far I back-pedaled today.",02Jun2019,8
26,About 2 years ago I came home to find the person I loved the most had committed suicide.I've lost the few friends I had that cared for me most likely due to my own mental bullshit.I don't have family that is there to help me.I've also picked up a cocaine habit that I do on the weekends because nothing is able to bring me any sense of happiness.I feel completely lost and alone.The damage from this and other things from my youth is changing me.I'm trying hard to hold onto the what I think is the strong and good parts of me that I have valued most about myself.I feel like I'm loosing myself and changing into something I despise.I don't see hope for the future and feel completely worthless.Im not suicidal I would never it's just I don't see a way to pull myself out.,02Jun2019,1
27,"I have been depressed for a very long time (several years). Since my graduation from my bachelor’s, it’s gotten worse and took a more serious turn. I started masters abroad, which also involved exchange in a third country so I’ve been travelling quite a lot and I haven’t been at home long enough to get proper treatment. It gets sometimes very serious, I have absolutely no self confidence whatsoever. I avoid people, I am not a good student and avoid communication with professors and severely procrastinate. I am going to have to an extra semester to finish my thesis. I hate myself and consider myself worthless. I was at the psychiatrist once again a couple of days ago and he prescribed Prozac and Ritalin, the latter for my lack of focus. I cry randomly and I started to cry a couple of days ago during my oath ceremony for admission to practice law. When I explain all this to my mom, how awful I feel all the time etc, she says I am not trying enough to be better. I am not sure, but I guess if i actually had the will to try I wouldn’t be depressed? I don’t know how to explain this to her and hearing this from her makes me feel like more of a useless person. What should I tell her? Or is she right?",02Jun2019,1

I did a post here previously of which I've shared the link. I didn't get much help here before and I really wish more people would come out and just talk to me about what can be done. I'll be continuing from my last post (though it's quite long) so it would really help me if you read that too. Thanks in advance!

So I'm back home after so long and I got adjusted real soon as well as started studying for good this time. Everything went quite great for almost 2 months without medications and without even discussing anything with anyone.......until now!!
I was losing focus and pace of my studies for the past week and I don't know whether it was already my depression coming back or was I just tired of my studies and that is what brought it (the depression) back BUT it did come back and this time it felt really goddamn terrible.

So my grandfather has Alzheimer's and obviously it's not his fault at all, but we all being humans, my family get pretty much irritated by him all the time, not only because of his memory but he also hallucinates a lot. Yesterday I don't know what got into my head but when he started irritating us (not intentionally obviously I knew that), I hit him. I hit him pretty hard and that too couple of times. Even though he begged for mercy I kept doing that. My father wasn't there and my mother was probably terrified. So it just kept happening till he gave his word he would stop talking non sense and made him sign a paper stating so. Even though I knew he'd forget that too.
During all of this I got pretty emo and I told my mother about my depression. She wasn't too shocked as she always knew something was definitely wrong with me. After things calmed down and I apologised to my grandpa (even though he didn't remember what happened), I sat with my mom and she told me something!
While I was thinking that everything was going pretty fine when I was far from home I just got to know that things didn't change much.
Mum and dad used to fight and shit had gone bad atleast once. It was then when she realised that she might be having depression. But she let everything go away and both my parents somehow continued there life trying to find happiness as we all are!
When papa came home I told him about my depression too because I thought it's better late than never (though I didn't tell him about the physical torture I did to my grandpa). He said it's probably nothing and instead of seeking drugs I should ""just try to calm my mind"". I also requested him to take grandpa to his doctor as it had been a while and his mental health was degrading day by day. Also requested both of my parents to have a routine check up with their doctors as they both suffer from diabetes as well as hypertension too.
So this was day 1.

Now today, same thing happened fucking again. This time I first begged my grandpa to stop when he started irritating but when he didn't understand I just told my mother and grandpa that I'm gonna jump off the roof today! My grandpa didn't understand much but he knew I was talking about suicide so he asked my mother to stop me because he can't walk fast himself. But my mother even more depressed said she won't stop me if this is what I want! As I went out to do the horrible deed I heard my mother screaming real loud. That got me terrified and I walked in again to check on her.
She was just clenching her hairs and shouting. She was looking at my grandpa with all the anger she had. And man she was drooling 😭She screamed even harder when I held her again as if she's seen a ghost (God i wanna cry so hard). I had no idea of what to do and all of my emotions again shifted to anger towards my grandpa AND I TRIED TO STRANGLE HIM TO DEATH. I mean all I did was grab his throat hard for like 2-3 seconds but I still have all of it in my head. Just a moment later somehow (literally 10 seconds later) my grandpa said ""My tea is on my bed. I want it"" and I fucking tried to burn his head with hot tea!! My mum stopped me from that sin though. From that moment till now I'm thinking that I should be in jail. Even for life maybe. That would be better for everyone!

When I couldn't handle it anymore I called my father and he reached home as soon as he could. He was devastated. At first he was so angry that he said he's going to kill the old man himself (even though he still didn't know fully what has happened) and he opened the belt of his pants to do so! I tried to stop him but he was so furious that I had to say that ""if he dies then I die"". And I started walking out of the house (again). He said he would kill himself instead if I walk out and I replied in frustration that he should do it!! 
I do feel crappy about me all the time but today was the worst!!

After both me and my father trying to calm down each other for an hour or so, we both had an all day long discussion.
I opened my heart as much as I could (though not completely) about how I felt about myself and both of my parents and he too gave me some valuable life lessons.
At the end we both agreed that we'll go see doctor for me as well as for regular checkups of my parents as well as my grandpa.
I even asked them that mother should also seek advice regarding her mental health but they didn't want to risk more medications than she was already taking. So I advised them to talk to each other about anything and everything that they can and should so that basically they not become each other's therapists but also maybe a Better couple. I don't really think that any of my advice has been taken well as they were much much much more concerned about my health when I was giving them advice.


Basically what I wanted to ask of anyone who reads this post is how to live with the images of incidents that happened today.
My screaming mother, the face that she had at that time, probably this is what will become of her if I ever really end my life, and how bad her mental condition has become!
Me hitting the one person who used to walk me home everyday from school bus stand when I was small!
And the face of my father when I told him to die!
HOW CAN I LIVE WITH ANY OF THIS?

I always wanted this world to be a good place for everyone but now I feel that maybe I myself is the worst thing that has ever happened to this universe!!",02Jun2019,3
29,"So I recently been in a very bad time noticing that my friends actually are very toxic when we have a fight they tend to hurt me on purpose with things I told them. or well forget to invite me to stuff etc. so I cutted some of them off and trying to reconnect to people that showed interest in me.
But I pushed them away because i habe major trust issues because if my past.
But they don't seem to be that interested which I can understand but it still hurt.

And I do found a nice group of two peps to chill but of course they aren't always available and even if I'm hanging out with them I tend to feel lonley thinking about my past and stuff, not always tho it mostly happens when I see other friend hanging around questioning why they didn't invite me.
Or why other ""friends"" don't look out for me.
I know everyone has a life and is busy but why can't I be a part of it.
I mostly think it's my fault (but I don't think always like that). But it's hard to keep that mindset away if this was always your whole love friends coming and leaving.",02Jun2019,6

31,"i think i might have seasonal affective disorder, because in December of 2017 my depression began, then in summer i was fine. as soon as fall began i felt worse and worse and i considered suicide very seriously. now summer began and i'm starting to feel better, i'm not crying everyday anymore and i have more positive outlook on things most of the time. here's the thing, i don't want to be better, i feel like it's not genuine, while depressed i decided that i'm useless piece of shit and i'm better of dead and in general i believe that life doesn't matter. suicidal thought aren't pushing me to do it as quickly as i can, but looking at my future, which is full of me only studying for years without much fun at all and than still failing (as i always do), makes me remember that i don't have to torture myself like that, i can just die because nothing fucking matters anyways. i kind of miss being depressed, i feel like crying but then something positive comes to my mind and now i'm stuck wanting to cry but not being able to. depression feels real, it feel like the only fucking real thing in this world, real emotions. i don't want to lose that because everything is just so boring without real emotions. i guess suicidal thoughts are supposed to go away in summer for a person with SAD but when you actually thought about life and death and made a rational (at least it looks that way) conclusion, there's not much anything can change that other than lies. i don't know what to feel like, i am scared that if i don't kill myself in summer, depressions gonna hit harder than it has ever before. does anyone know how long does SAD last?",02Jun2019,2
32,"Currently my life is better than it has ever been, I'm living in accommodation with a bunch of friends studying my dream job at university. I'm able to adequately buy everyday things and live a pretty normal life. These are all things I didn't have until the past two years. My first year of uni was met with a strange type of euphoria since my circumstances improved substantially in such a short period of time. 

My second year however has been drastically different, I was told something that ended up traumatising me. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, sure I felt pretty shocked but ultimately I had wanted to know this information. It wasn't until my hair started to fall out and I couldn't control my thoughts that I realised the extent of how much it had affected me. The hair in the places I lost now grows back white and will never be it's usual colour ever again due to a traumatic stress response. (As said by my own doctor) Alongside this I couldn't stop thinking, my mind went into overdrive and I couldn't focus on anything. My head felt like it could explode and this lasted for months. My university grades took a considerable blow, I got straight As and A\*s first year and this year I've failed a few modules and barely passed others. 

My relationships also took a blow. I felt a deep sense of distrust for everyone, I couldn't have deeper conversations with them anymore as I didn't want to risk the onslaught of thoughts. My conversations are now entirely surface level stuff with a facade of humour. Other than that I just listen to whatever my friends are saying to each-other and keep myself at a safe distance.

I finally had enough after months of this, it didn't seem to be letting up like I thought it would. So I finally went to the doctor who prescribed me some antidepressants. I was also put on the waiting list for therapy which should start next August. The medication made me a lot worse for more than a month but eventually it reduced my anxiety symptoms considerably. I even started dating someone! I can feel myself opening up again to this person, but along with that comes a lot of fear and uncertainty. Depression is still something I tackle daily and my traumatic past is constantly looming over me. Can I maintain a close relationship with someone while simultaneously protecting myself from talking about my traumatic past? What if it's too much to handle and they gets scared off? This new relationship is making me question my history again and leaving me with little to feel confident about.",02Jun2019,5
33,I'm struggling right now pretty bad with my depression and I need some advice from anyone who has gone through this themselves. I have been eating a lot because of my depression and anxiety and I don't know how to control myself. I'm constantly mindlessly eating and I've gained weight because of this and it is making feel even worse than I already do. I don't know how I can stop eating when I'm not hungry to feel better about myself and then hopefully be able to workout and eat healthier to improve my depression.,02Jun2019,25
34,"I’ve been depressed and anxious for over a year following harassment and assault that happened to me at the workplace. I left my job to get away from my harasser.

I’ve been going to counseling (which helps) but the reporting process has been miserable to say the least.

I fell into a really deep depression even while taking 15 mg of Remeron. A psychologist added Effexor 37.5 mg, which helped for about 4 weeks. I felt great. I had energy and focus.

But when my dose was bumped up to Effexor 75 mg, I got really sick. My pupils were stuck dilated and I felt like I couldn’t breathe for hours. I was nauseous, very hot, my muscles started twitching, and I couldn’t think. The following day, I went back down to 37.5 mg, and those side effects went away—but the depression came roaring back. Now I can’t focus. I experience brain zaps any time I hear a loud noise. I’m lethargic and just want to hide in bed.

Should I go off of Effexor and try a different class like Wellbutrin? Does anyone here have experience with sensitivity to serotonin? 

I’d like to stay on Remeron because it’s the only thing that helps me sleep. I want to be healthy and strong so I can handle future court hearings, etc. I’m grateful for any advice you have to share. Thank you.",02Jun2019,1
35,"So I’m going to be a senior next school year, this school year is almost over. I haven’t done a lot during high school, haven’t had an actual group of friends. With that said, I’ve not done much with anyone outside of school. Now I have that group of friends and I’m so glad they want to do stuff with me.

We have been trying to do things, and when we do, I have a great time. Afterwards, I fall back into a depressive mood, not terribly, but it’s there. I just have this big desire to do things with those friends and I’m genuinely upset when we can’t do anything. I guess it’s the fact that I only have one more year of high school and most friends split when they graduate, so I want to make the most of it.

I can genuinely say I’m happy at times, but when that source of happiness is gone, it’s back to the awful feeling of hopelessness.",02Jun2019,2

37,"Hi
So this is my first post here and this might be quite lengthy because it just feels like my life is faling apart.
I feel so alone and I don't know why... I have friends and everyone seems to like me but ime never included. I feel like an outcast because evin though i have many friends none of them ever wana do anything with me. I feel like people only come to me when they have no one els to go to, like ime everyone's last choice.
Evin my friends do social things without me, like I don't evin know that they are doing things. I just don't understand, ime always polite and friendly, I try my best to be nice and helpful but no one wants to do anything with me
Am I just that ofputing or something?

People always tel me that ime so funny or likable but ime never invited or included in anything and 8t just feels like people only talk to me because they pity me or something. I try realy hard to start conversations or be part of one but always ends in awkward silences and people leaving. I talk about whatever the hell the people around me talk about sometimes just to be included.
Can anyone tel me what ime doing wrong or what's wrong with me because I just don't know what to do anymore.
Suacide just seems like the best alternative every time I try to fix myself to no avail. 

Pleas help, ime losing this battle",02Jun2019,1
