3,"Hey all,

Keeping this super short. How do I help a friend (of 10+ years) that has depression (other than with empathy)? I suspect (I could be mistaken) he has it if because he‚Äôs not turned out to be successful in recent endeavours. His behaviour is very similar to what the book ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù describes as entitlement. However, he believes his depression is the worst type a person can have, is completely involuntary and he can‚Äôt do anything about it to manage it. Yet, if you look at his behaviours, it doesn‚Äôt match the worst type of depression a person can have. I want to help him, but the beliefs he has, effectively put up a brick wall. With this, I know it‚Äôs a problem he has to solve himself. But just in case, maybe you guys have tips for me to help be a catalyst in him helping himself.

Here‚Äôs one conversation outline from a few months ago (I‚Äôve known about his depression for longer than this):
- He Tells me more some stuff about his depression. Says that only one specific drug may solve it for him.
- I suggest that he try seeing a psychologist/therapist for help. After all, it helps some people. If he doesn‚Äôt try, he won‚Äôt know for sure. It may be difficult, as a guy, to talk about emotions and see a therapist because it‚Äôs seen as immasculine, but actually, is really important and courageous to talk about your emotions.
- He responds, agreeing that it is often seen as immasculine. That he is also the type of person not to go because it is seen as immasculine. But he still won‚Äôt go. He agrees that he won‚Äôt know for sure unless he tries, but he still won‚Äôt try it.

So can I even do anything to help at this stage?

Thanks for your help in advance!",25May2019,5

5,"How do I alleviate them? I‚Äôm taking a ton of supplements to detox a hormonal food allergy (Reishi, BioGGGB, TheraSupreme, ZnZyme, Methylene) so I‚Äôm not sure adding GABA would be helpful. I‚Äôm also taking 75mg of Wellbutrin, which has been incredible. I‚Äôm pretty active with exercising, and I try to go to the gym 3-5 times a week. The brain zaps bring some dizziness so I‚Äôve not been able to go to the gym as much this week. Sorry for the information dumpüòÖ",25May2019,2
6,I know everyone is always like you should tell people about your depression or it will get better but I‚Äôm too scared to tell anyone that I have self diagnosed depression and I already know that this is going to follow me for life. I‚Äôm too scared that my parents won‚Äôt trust me with anything and my siblings will make fun of me and mock me(this is serious they would do this). I hate having no one to talk to when I feel extra depressed or when something happens. I‚Äôm scared to tell my friends and family I‚Äôm depressed because I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll think I‚Äôm faking it like all I see these days is the pretty popular girls of my school posting stuff about how depressed they are and well to be honest even I think it‚Äôs fake. I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm depressed just for attention. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore because this is taking over my life I‚Äôm only sad and it‚Äôs hard to for me to be happy anymore.,25May2019,4
7,"OK, so, I am a 14 year old who has depression, who has been socially bullied since year two and cyber bullied this year. My home life well it is a safe household but we have arguments a lot and i just hate it. I have to see a counsellor but that doesn't help much as i see them once a fortnight. There are a couple of good things in my life i am grateful for but i just want to run away sometimes! i once packed up and told my parents and my little brother that i was not gonna sleep  in the house that night but my parents said they would call the police and they made me stay home and the school texts parents when students are absent. Help!",25May2019,2

11,"So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids.  I fell out of love with my chosen career, and so bounced from job to job before my husband and I decided I would stay at home with the kids.

Since then, we‚Äôve moved far away from our friends and family - for husband‚Äôs work, and I do like living here - but I have lost almost all my friends, and since my parents died, no one in my family really talks to me any more.  My kids were never much involved in any school activities, so I never made friends with other moms.  Our neighbors never seem to leave their homes.

When my youngest graduated, I decided I wanted to go back to work.  My health threw me a roadblock or two, so I didn‚Äôt really start looking until February.  I reworked my CV/resume, and began applying.  Nothing.

A few years ago, my husband started what might be called a mid-life crisis.  He wants to open our marriage, and while we tabled these discussions because of things we‚Äôre dealing with, including financial struggles, he has started bringing it up again.

So, I basically don‚Äôt have a family, have very few friends, my health isn‚Äôt great, I don‚Äôt have the money to fix/replace/buy things that are needed, can‚Äôt get a call - let alone an interview - for a job, and my husband - who has been my rock up until now - is angry and resentful because I don‚Äôt want to talk about opening our marriage right now.

I followed the plan, and now I hate my life.  Getting a job would help so much, but my degree is old and my experience is old, and no one wants me.  I feel useless and awful.  These are office jobs; husband and I agreed other jobs would not work because of health issues mostly, lower pay secondly.

I have no one to talk to - friends aren‚Äôt that close; family dead or won‚Äôt talk to me; can‚Äôt afford therapy - so I am venting here.  If anyone read this far, thank you.",25May2019,8
12,"I'm just feeling lost, trapped in my own mind.

Every day is a new day. Every day is a gamble with how I feel, how I look at things. Most days make me feel extremely lost, as if I missed a good damn chunk of steps in the instructions somehow.

I have love in my life. I have a roof over my head and a bed to go to, despite how shitty they both are. I have free healthcare that I can access at any time, and for the time being, free prescription coverage, and I'm trying to find a good place for potential therapy (a place that hopefully doesn't offer the possibility of 12 sessions and then make you wait a year before you're with someone else... I hate that and don't find it helpful at all)

But... I'm near 24 and have no job, no where will hire me (even the place in my city that will take a chance on anyone, because I already had my chance with them and fucked it up with my anxiety.). I have student debt looming over my head, which I can't pay back at the moment. I'm back at my highest weight, which is a lot, and I can't seem to lose it.

I feel like I'm just going crazy. My head is always spinning. I get moments of brief clarity, brief happiness, and I cling onto these moments.

I know what I need to do. But at the same time... I just feel so lost... Everyones going through something, I feel like I can't turn to someone just because they're facing their own problems... I know this isn't fully the case, but, deep anxiety just prevents me from going to someone when they're having life issues themselves.

I'm told I'm strong... I'm only strong because I force myself to be.. I can feel myself crumbling at my very core. I'm not as strong as people like to think I am... We live in a world where the weak are rarely given a chance at life, and I don't even have the chance to break down... I need to be strong, I need to be. Maybe I can find my way soon... I hope I can find my way.",25May2019,2
13,"Some days I wake up and everything is just too much and I can‚Äôt imagine myself even graduating and I just feel so sad for no reason and I‚Äôm going to fail in life so why even try. And it‚Äôs like yeah I have friends but I feel like such a burden and invalid and it‚Äôs not like they hate me but nobody loves me or even likes me I‚Äôm just there. I feel like I never even have the energy to leave my bed or eat. Talking to anyone is so draining, even texting feels like I‚Äôve used three days worth of energy. It just feels like I‚Äôm living the same shitty day over and over and over until I snap and end it. Everything is so repetitive, everyday is the same feeling of hating myself over and over.
But on the other hand sometimes I wake up and I plan out my whole life and I feel so excited to become successful and make my family proud and I feel happy enough to go to work and take extra shifts and hang out with friends and talk to my family about how my day was and I feel like everyday I live is a step closer to falling in love and it always feels like a beautiful garden of flowers but it never lasts for long and it‚Äôs so scary because I know that soon I‚Äôll hit absolute rock bottom again and everything will fall apart again and I‚Äôm just so tired of this cycle",25May2019,1

15,"he's telling me im worthless again


he's telling me im arrogant and meaningless and that i have no reason to live


he's right 


i can't fight him


he's always right


he told me not to act that way, not to say those things, not to get too close to anyone

so why didn't i listen?

i knew he'd be right

i knew it, so why?

why did i have to think i knew better?

why did i get overconfident?

why did i overstep my bounds?

this isn't the first time

he warned me that it ought to be my last

he's gonna be right again, isn't he?

aah, he always is

he's too nice, to tell me in advance

he's too kind, to stick around with me, to listen to me

16,"Hey. I've been there and feeling empty is one of the worst experiences of my life. I want to be mad but can't I want to be sad but can't. It was so bad I had to train my face to have a reflex to smile when people look at me. No one would know I was empty unless I told them. But, I'm better now. It took me 2 years to get rid of it. The longest 2 years of my life. I'm here to drop some advice for you guys struggling out there. First, keep trying to laugh it feels fake at first but somehow it will start to feel real. Second, have good company to 've around. Third, stop doing things that you have or feel forced to do. It really drains the mind more than you think. Finally, never stop trying. Always keep fighting. It will get better. Really appreciate your fleeting moments of happiness and try to remember how to get it back. Love yourself and think positive. Good luck on your journey and keep fighting.",25May2019,15
17,"Hi, I'm new to this sub. Roughly a year and a half ago now my sisters and I found out our parents were getting a divorce. While upsetting, I'm old enough (20, M) to understand that relationships don't always work out. My youngest sister on the other hand (13) is really having a tough time because she is pretty young still and is the type of person you might call a day dreamer or a hopeless romantic; she can't stomach the thought of two people, especially our parents who hid their marital issues very well from us, falling out of love. In addition to this situation, my dad is someone who tends to favor my other younger sister (18) ‚Äì likely because they have very similar personalities. I'm doubtful that this dynamic is intentional, but my mom seems to think the middle sister and dad have somewhat nefarious intentions. My youngest sister's depression is also compounded by people at her school. She is often bullied for her weight, which has made her hypersensitive to any comments regarding exercise or diet. There is also another girl at my sister's school who has a crush on her, but my sister doesn't feel the same, and in turn the girl allegedly has spread a number of rumors to ""get back at her"". Middle schoool these days is pretty cutthroat I guess.

I've struggled with depression and anxieties myself for the better part of the past 4 years or so, and thought I'd maybe be able to help because I can relate and have been through at least some of the same things as her ‚Äì I was overweight throughout my childhood and understood the bullying thing, though I've since lost all of my weight ‚Äì but it seems any gesture I make gets shut down and my sister withdraws into herself, as if she's trying to push me away. My mom says she feels the same. Furthermore, any suggestions I make which I think might be helpful are met with aggravation. To be clear I personally wouldn't directly address any of the mentioned above issue, instead if I'm doing something alone, I'd ask her to tag along; my mom also says my sister is lonely. For example, if I suggest she tag along with me on a bike ride, my sister takes this offensively, thinking that I'm calling her overweight, when in reality I just think she might like to get out of the house. The exercise is a benefit, sure, but when I ask such things I have honest intentions; though I've found exercise and the aforementioned weight loss to have a remarkably positive effect on my mental health, and have theorized this would have a similar effect for my sister. Another example: if I'm making a salad and offer her to make her one too, she declines and suggests I'm only offering because I think she needs to lose weight. Interestingly I get get a similar response if I ask her to get ice cream with me, she'd think I'm only offering because I think she's overweight. It seems anything I say to try to be helpful or just to get her off her phone is futile, which brings me to my next point.

My sister is complete addicted to her phone. She watches YouTube and scrolls through Instagram in a fashion similar to that of a zombie. She has a pair of noise canceling headphones which are on her head probably ‚Äì without exaggerating ‚Äì 90+% of the time she isn't at school or asleep. They were a Christmas gift I got her last year, but probably one of the worst things I could have given ‚Äì though I didn't know at the time. The headphones are frustrating because she doesn't listen to nearly anything at all. If someone talk to her, she will maybe respond once, then turn up the volume as to tune the speaker outside. Usually she listens to a variety of influencers on YouTube, which is how she connects with my other sister. I think they watch the same ""reality"" YouTubers or something. I might be wrong, but my hypothesis is that the influencers are creating unrealistic expectations for her life, and in turn this is amplifying her insecurities and anxieties. The same is true for Instagram. It's a platform where she feels compared to her peers ‚Äì this one I understand a little more than the YouTubers she follows, as I've felt the same pressure myself. I've actually discussed this with her before, and she knows Instagram is a problem. I've even had some success in getting her to delete the app, which I suggested because I've done it myself and found I've felt better, but she reinstalled it. Maybe it's not my place to be telling her what to do, but I know she's going through a lot right now, and I was only suggesting things that helped for me.

Right now I'm pretty she goes to therapy every other week or so, and she goes to church most Sundays and to a youth group on Wednesdays probably twice a month or so. Despite the support groups one might think she would have, my mom told me my sister keeps talking about death and has said something along the lines of ""I don't care if I go to Heaven or not, I just want to die"". I'm not sure this is exactly what she said, I wasn't there, but no matter which way you look at it, it's grim. I'm not really sure how to conclude this long exposition, but pretty much any suggestions on how I or my mom can help my little sister would be greatly appreciated.",25May2019,14

20,"I'm 18 I graduate tomorrow and it's the most confused I've been in my life. I know that on it's own is normal, but this just seems like more.

I've never thought of myself as depressed in anyway and I still dont think this. I just dont know what I am. A few night back i was at a friends house hanging out with people I've never met before, yet in the little time I got to know them it's the most comfortable I've ever felt around a group before. They were all so good at making me feel important without even meaning to, but I would never belive anything good they said about me. I always dismiss compliments as pity. I try to tell myself that people care about me and love me but I cant make myself belive it. 

In my mind I'm always the burden and it's been like this for as long as I can remember, but recently it's been harder than ever. I feel more alone and scared than I ever have and I dont know how to handle anymore. I've always just tried to escape these thoughts anyway I can, but I'm tired of it and I just want to change how I view myself. All of this sounds so cliche to me and I'm sure there are plenty of people like me, but all I want is to get rid of these thoughts. I dont think it's bad,but I dont know, all I know is that I dont want these stupid thoughts to prevent me from being happy anymore. I've always been a lurker and tried to find help in other people's stories, but I just wanted a place where I could let it out because I'm too scared to tell those around me how I am. 

I've always thought I could handle it on my own, but clearly I cant.",25May2019,3

22,"I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this but I‚Äôm just so devoid of any sort of positive feelings at the minute. So I thought I‚Äôd try posting here.

I‚Äôm a university drop out, overweight, and about ¬£10k into overdrafts and credit cards, I‚Äôve never managed to hold a job down for longer than a year, and have had to resort to borrowing money from parents which I‚Äôm worried has driven my mum close to financial troubles. I‚Äôve lied to all of my friends about various situations in my life, what I‚Äôm doing for work, money troubles etc out of embarrassment. 

I‚Äôve been unemployed for close to seven months now whilst borrowing and using up savings, I finally have a new job starting next week. I found myself not excited but relieved rather than anything. 

This was immediately followed by my friends that I live with telling me that they‚Äôre going to live with other people in a couple of months when our tenancy agreement comes to an end. This sucked as they‚Äôre the only people I know in the city and the only thing that‚Äôs been getting me through the past few months has been how much I enjoyed living with these guys. 

Now I‚Äôll follow that up by saying would I be super psyched about living with someone who‚Äôs unemployed, probably not. But I‚Äôd never failed to pay my rent or bills on time and never ever asked anyone of them for money, so I don‚Äôt really know how much of a factor that was.

So that conversation was followed up by my girlfriend texting me to tell me she wants to break up with me and that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 

We‚Äôd only been dating 2-3 months but with that relationship over and my now awkward relationship with my housemates I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone to talk to.

The last couple of months have been tough and my minds gone to some dark places. However there‚Äôs always been just about something to pull me back. 

This weekend was one of my housemates birthday. So we were meant to be going out for drinks with a group of people. I am obviously absolutely broke and told them I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt come. After a serious amount of peer pressure and the innocuous ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy your drinks‚Äù I ended up going out for a couple of beers. 

I left a few hours into the event as I just couldn‚Äôt get my mind right, I can‚Äôt fathom enjoying myself. I‚Äôve just been crying in my kitchen for the past twenty minutes. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and I just don‚Äôt know anything right now really.

I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place for this post I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs not.",25May2019,3
23,"so i have this friend,
she is my best friend,
she has depression and is in a real bad spot right now.

we both finished high school last year,
and she thinks she is driffiting away from our friend group,
yesterday she blocked all of us on twitter,
i think i am the only one that noticed so far,
and she has been saying things like, no one can ""help me, ""or ""i don't think they like me"" and ""i feel nothing for them"",
i am trying to convince her that it isn't true, that they do like her, because i know they do.

i have always been doing the most that i can,
trying to be supportive and saying stuff like ""i am here if you need"" and things like that,
but it isn't as effective because i am currently living in the other side of the planet for my studies,
(we are brazilians but i am doing an exchange program in canada, if you care)
after i confirmed that she blocked all of us, i told the situation to 2 other close friends of her, and they didn't know about this until now.

so i'll just ask a few questions to anyone that cares to answer:
did i do the right thing telling the situation to other people??
is there anything else that i can do??
is there a sub dedicated to advice on how to help people suffering from things like this??
