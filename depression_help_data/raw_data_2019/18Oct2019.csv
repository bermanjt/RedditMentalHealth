0,"Apologies in advance, I know this'll be rambly and all over the place, but my mind is completely numb right now and I'm doing this instead of practicing a speech I need to memorize by tomorrow.

My mental health has, I guess, been declining fairly subtly over the past six months or so- subtly enough that I didn't notice until about a month and a half ago, when things started going downhill very rapidly. I'm a sophomore in high school (16 for non-Americans) so this started being a major problem around the time the school year began, but it's not like all the other September slumps I've experienced. Usually I'm back in the swing of things by a few weeks into the school year, but this year I can't handle anything that's hitting me. My schoolwork isn't much harder than last year, and I don't have much more of it, but suddenly I just can't do anything.

I'm scatterbrained and I can't concentrate on anything I'm doing. I constantly zone out and stare into dead space. I've become exceptionally slow to process, get moving, and generally do things. I have to make a very prominent effort to homework because even the threat of grades can't motivate me. This is surprising for me because I've always been extremely invested in school and generally get good grades. I'm just numb, tired, completely indifferent to any good or bad news. Either that, or I feel impatient, but I can't put enough energy into being snappish. I'm not interested in any of my favorite hobbies anymore, and almost nothing except for my dog, my best friend, and my music makes me happy anymore. I either don't eat much, or eat a lot at once, even though I'm not hungry.

I also genuinely feel worthless and stupid and terrible for a variety of fantastic reasons, and I feel like it'd be a hell of a lot easier not to exist. Or to sleep for a long time and wake up much later and continue with my life. I don't want to kill myself, and I'd never actually attempt anything, as I have a lot of things and people to live for, but I wish I just didn't have to exist and deal with everything. I can't believe I have to endure 60+ more years of constant stress. I've got that sexy impending sense of dread about the future, and I'm constantly berating myself for very small things like how I'm walking or how I've said a sentence. 

I think these symptoms line up pretty well with depression. A few of them have been building gradually (self-worth issues, berating self, impatience) but other symptoms (exhaustion, slowness, numbness) have just gotten much worse since August/early September. My parents are great, and accepting/open-minded about everything else I discuss with them, and I'm planning to ask to go to therapy if these symptoms continue so I know this isn't just a fluke or single episode that I can get through on my own.

How do I cope with this? I still have responsibilities. I still have school and social obligations. I can't afford to misstep. But I'm just so tired and right now I'm sitting on my bed, and before writing this I was staring into blank space instead of doing the homework due tomorrow. It's registering dully in the back of my mind that I have things to do but I can't handle that right now. I know the only cure to procrastination is to get up and do it, but I am physically recoiling at the thought of doing that right now. 

I am at my wit's end and- don't freak out immediately, I'm about to elaborate- over the past few days I've caught myself thinking it would be so, so much easier and less painful just to off myself. Disclaimer: I'd never actually. I know how much it'd hurt my family and I'd never want to hurt them. I'd never want to leave my dog alone. I'd also never want to leave this world without meeting my best friend in real life (Internet friends) and getting a car and going to college and getting married. I know I have so much to look forward to, it's just that I'm so tired and nothing feels okay right now.

Please help. Everything is piling up around me and I don't have the energy to deal with it. It's so overwhelming.",18Oct2019,1

3,"Thats just how i feel. Im not close to doing anything as drastic as killing myself just yet but life just seems to be an endless circle.

Of loneliness, overthinking, catastrophising, not knowing how to communicate, wanting to be better, being stuck in my head, why cant i talk to people, why do i fuck everything up, why dont i feel anything, why am i so unaware of everything, why dont i have priorities, why haven't i lived a life i should be. 

Im fucking 20 and i do nothing all day. I dont go out. I dont go drinking (responsibly). I think my sex drive is fucked. I want a relationship. But yet at the same time im not interested in sex or a relationship. How. I need someone to show that they care for me thats not family. I wish my only friend asked if i was ok. I wish i could enjoy life but no. The lows are getting lower and so too are the highs. How am i meant to live off small moments of contentment. How can i get a working relationship with my emotions. 

Why cant i find a way to recalibrate myself? How do i go forward? What is there to do? What is the next step?",18Oct2019,1

He does all of this to get his ""crush"" to like him. Sometimes he even empties his chocolate milk on my hair, and he always forces me to clean his shoes in front of his ""crush"". This has put me in a way that makes everyone at school fight me for no reason.

8,"I just walked away from my friends and locked myself in my room because this is my third mental breakdown of the day and I need to experience it to get it out of my system. 
For starters: I am a college student who is genuinely over involved and way too competitive and doesn’t have proper outlets to release her stress and tension. 
My therapist (or counsellor that the school matched me with) is a racist piece of shit and I am in the process of getting a new one, but until then—no therapy.
I am currently also stressing over graduate school even though I don’t even graduate until 2021 because I am afraid of failing. I feel like no one helps me the way I help them when they’re in mental distress, but again, my friends are not my therapists. I don’t know who to reach out to, it almost feels like there’s no one who’ll just listen to me. 
So hello reddit, I am reaching out. This is a humble request for resources and motivation that may prove to be helpful until I can go into therapy again! I am feeling completely and utterly shattered, and almost stupid for writing this post or even breaking down in the first place, but every bit of help is welcome and appreciated!",18Oct2019,1
10,"I’m new here but I am at the end of my rope.   
I am so completely lost and while I know what I could do (BS and MA in Psychology and 6 years as a counselor before teaching) I can’t seem to do it for me. 
Background:  youngest of three where I was not planned and not really wanted by my Mom. My older brother is her shining star. She tells anyone who is near her how she doesn’t like me and I am not her favorite. Yet I am the only one who helps her and checks in on her. I am closest to my father, who has dementia and I am losing him slowly. 
Growing up my brother was mean but when he flunked out of his college and had to move home to go to a local community college so he could get back his financial aid he became even meaner. Since I was the only one at home he took it out on me and became physically and verbally abusive. He did it when no one was around and when I went to my mother she told me it was my fault for making him mad. The one time he did something in front of her she asked me to not call the police and ruin his career before she asked me if I was ok.   I haven’t spoke to my brother in 14 years and because of that I do not often go to family functions or holidays. 
My older sister keeps her distance from me as she feels my husband and I are not “Christian” enough.  And she lives in a “bubble” and does not want conflict or to admit anything is bad in her life. 
Personally I have a loving husband of 20 years who is the best thing to ever happen to me. We have been together 25 years, but he is scared for me.   We were told we would never have kids but after years of struggles we did. 
I have a 17 yr old son who will soon be graduating. I spent a lot of hours working with him and dealing with teachers to get him help as he has dyslexia. He is a wonderful young man. 
I have a daughter who is 14. She is amazing and talented and next week on the 30th it will be the one year anniversary of when she tried to kill herself.   That day my world fell apart and I can’t even express how it was watching the ambulance drive her away for treatment 4.5 hours away from our home. And while she is better it is still a daily struggle to keep her on track and mentally healthy. 
And me. That’s all I have. My husband and my two kids. I do not have friends. I was extremely bullied in school so I think I don’t really know how to make them. But the sad fact is that I have no one to talk to. I work in a job I love doing (art teacher) but I work in a place that is hostile for teachers. I have been there 17 years and just was gone for two weeks for surgery yet not one person emailed called or sent a card. I often don’t speak to another adult for days, my classroom it’s own wing. 
Today I could hardly get out of bed. The only thing that got me up was a visit to my new grand-nephew who is only a week old. 
I live reading but haven’t been able to pick up a book to read or even a brush to paint. Since my surgery I haven’t been able to use my camera, my passion, and I feel that has spiked my depression. I am on meds. And while I do not want to kill myself I do not want to live. My family would be way better off without me and no one outside my little house would even notice I was gone. 
Sorry it is so long. I should not even post it but I am so amazingly lost.",18Oct2019,1
11,"Please excuse the grammar, typos and formatting, I am doing this via my phone and thank you for your time reading this in advance as it is very long.

When I was 16 I was diagnosed with depression, it runs in my family along with kidney problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. At least running can keep the diabetes away while it seems the depression and kidney problems have already caught up with me like a couple of Usain Bolt's and are clinging on harder than fat child to his last lollipop.

I struggled a lot but made it through episodes of downward spirals, failed relationships, almost failing school, suicidal fantasies and general stuff people go through in life or watch on a bad tv sitcom. Kind of like that terrible 50 shades of grey book, my narrative was also badly written and not nearly as kinky or fun even if I did feel whipped or chained down at times.

I tried a couple of antidepressants and counseling, eventually it helped but I have come to realize that it never when the core of my problems and that as I grew I experienced different trials that came with adulthood and learned coping mechanisms as I ages. Both good and bad like a terrible pun: A pun walks into a room with ten people in it, they all die ....pun in, ten dead.

And that's what I felt like for as long as I could remember, dead, like I was surviving but not really living life. I completed a degree in psychology while studying away from home and while that was a struggle too I enjoyed the experience.

Then I had to come home again and fell into a downward spiral over the next two years, I found it hard to hold down a job, retail positions with poor pay and bad management that dragged me down further.

The unfortunate thing about my depression is that it happens gradually and you don't notice your cognitive abilities declining. My memory, concentration, planning, holding a conversation, everything that was my usual witty self declined until I was living in a haze and not the fun purple kind.

It was only when I started to come out of it did I realize just how badly my cognitive abilities were affected. I couldn't hold a conversation or remember things. When I thought back about how I behaved, the opportunities for jobs, socialising or relationships that I simply didn't see or pursue I felt extremely frustrated and guilty with myself like a priest with his hand stuck in the collection box.

I did force myself to apply for a few masters in applied psychology. I was always fascinated by it and didn't see myself in any other kind of career. I got a few offers and deferred my places to this year. I should have felt more excited or happy but simply having this one thing to work towards made me feel a lot better.

Unfortunately between working low paying jobs and being unemployed, I didn't save a lot of money, enough for deposits onna couple of courses and living expenses but certainly not enough for college fees.

Thankfully I could apply for a loan and did that, one application got declined, then another and finally one application that I thought was going smoothly just contacted me a couple of days ago and I don't have other options for loans. The fees aren't that high compared to colleges in America and the UK (I'm in Ireland) but myself and my family have been struggling financially for quite a while and both my parents have a poor credit history so i couldn't get a loan in time.

I really really thought that I could could do this, I got a part time job that let me work three days a week as an ABA tutor so that I could work and attend my college lectures during the week. The work is intense and challenging but an insight into autism that you can never get from reading about it. I went to college and was able to take notes and pay attention in class even though I didn't have access to the library, I made friends, joined societies, spoke to lecturers.... A few days ago was the final deadline for payment of the registration fees, even after getting an extension from college I was unable to pay in the end.

I am extremely disappointed and disheartened, I don't know what to do. I feel like I should be panicking or crying, or something but I just feel numb. I haven't told my family that I won't be attending the masters this year. I don't know what to tell my friends.

If I quit the part time job I have to repay training fees of 1500 euro since it's a 9 month contract. Can I work full time or get another part time job? Do I reapply for another masters for next year? I am lost, I was tired of struggling and just once I wanted to thrive, I wanted to really live my life. Almost everything fell into place but now it's all fallen apart.

It's still possible that the deadline could be extended and that I could get a different loan. I have been looking into that, but I am still 7 weeks into college with no access to a college email, library etc since I am not a registered student. Not going to sell my organs either as China seems to have that market cornered already.

I have also been dating a lovely girl who is great to get along with and quite supportive. I haven't had time to see her much and I'm not very attracted to her. I'm unsure whether it's because I'm stressed and numb at the moment or if I genuinely am not attracted to her because we get along great.

My family is supportive and my mother especially is helpful regarding getting paperwork for a loan sorted. She's a good mom and I feel bad saying this but we don't have anything in common and her bickering over little things drives me crazy.

I find myself shutting off from everyone and trying to recover....from day to day life. Some days I can deal with this well, other times I break down crying and can't cope.

I am so tired of struggling, I wanted to do well, I wanted to deal with life head on and excel for once instead of feeling like I am drowning.

I have started to have thoughts like what's the point and I don't care. About doing a masters or keeping a job or getting up in the morning or seeing the girl I am dating. I feel guilty having these thoughts when everyone is supportive.

I am not my usual witty self, I have stopped exercising since I am so tired when I come home. I feel like I am trying to survive instead of living my life. Like my depression or something else about me has impacted my development, slowed me down and prevented me from reaching my full potential.

I don't have any more witty comments or jokes now. I don't have specific questions either, general guidance would be helpful. Has anyone gone through anything similar and what helped you?",18Oct2019,4
12,"I'm tired. It feels like I don't have any emotion left. I can't smile, I can't cry either. I've been thinking of a lot of things lately and it makes me feel pressured. I only started working a couple of months ago at a home-based company. Usually, I'm left alone at the 'office' and this does not help with my creeping thoughts. Imagine having to work for 8 hours, just talking every four hours, eating alone, and dealing with quite stressful work. When I come home, my parents are already too tired, thus usually short-tempered. I don't really have much to talk to; I have my S.O. and a close friend one chat away. But there are times that I don't want to open up in fear that I might be annoying them or making them worry too much. 

I breakdown at the slightest raise of voice, small inconveniences, and sometimes I just cry without knowing why. I just feel so empty. I feel lost. Last night, out of deep frustration from a small fight at home, I scratched my forearm on purpose. It feels like I need to scold myself and punish myself for being irresponsible and stupid. So yeah, just discovered that physical pain from scratches are way better than feeling nothing at all but still aching inside. 

My relationship with my S.O. is going downhill these past weeks, he's far away and we only see each other once a week at most. My best friend hasn't talked to me for a couple of months and I don't bother to ask why because I'm too tired of confrontations. I feel like I don't have any emotion left to show. It feels like I'm a walking balloon, looks full but filled with invisible matter.",18Oct2019,1
13,"This morning, my mother finally told me why she hasn't been working in the past two months and half. She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. I told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months. Indeed, I was thinking that something was horribly wrong and she was dying or something like that. I am 18 years old and I dealt with depression last year. I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school. Merely writing this, as his grandson, brings tears to my eyes. I've spent most of my days and nights since his death crying, but I cannot imagine how my mom feels. I haven't seen her cry, but it would be extremely typical of her to hide her woe if she thought that it would pain me to see her suffer.
I suspect she's at the lowest point of her life, having to deal with clinical depression and then the death of her father, but I don't know how to help her get through this, which is why I need advice.",18Oct2019,86
14,This is so ridiculous. My life has been a mess for a year and I don’t see anyway out other than putting myself in inpatient. But 13-20 thousand dollars? That’s enough to make me spiral into a deeper depression. I am so grateful I had some money saved but that’s all I’m worth. And now what? Pay this off and be even more useless? Mental healthcare in America is so depressing for a person already going through the darkest of times. I don’t want to talk about my shit insurance. That makes me feel horrible. But I guess it is what it is. Also I’ve been dealing with this for 15 years so I have tried nearly every other Avenue.

(shortened:
i hate everyone in my life and they make everything so much harder for me, yet theyre all i have. )
 
my friends tell me to kill myself and laugh at me when i attempt, yet theyre the only people who will hang out with me and have conversations with me. 

my dad calls me a psychotic bitch, questions why i have any friends, has tried to get me to kill myself, calls me fat/ugly/useless. yet has always supported me and i know would do anything for me in a heartbeat 

my mom hated me up until i was 17 (18 currently) to the point she tried to kill me, sent me away to school, calls any job i have and tries to get me fired, yet recently she has had a ""change of heart"" and has decided that she wants to help me and i do know she is serious.

my grandma abandoned me after my grandpa died, cut off any funds that he left to me and made the rest of my family stop talking to me and my parents. yet, she introduced me to some of my favorite things, and she was my person for the longest time.

i know everyones not a good person and i have to realize theres good and bad to everyone, but my whole life seems so black and white and it would almost be easier to work out if it were all greys.

and believe me, ive tried the whole pack up and start a new life thing. i worked my whole life to get into a good college and couldnt stop having severe panic attacks the moment i moved in to the point i had to move back home. i hate my life, my parents wont let me go back to college because they think ill do the same thing again.

I'm in my early twenties, and a student. I recently broke up with my ex over the summer. It was pretty challenging, given we had dated for 3 and a half years, and given we lived together.

She's not the main reason for my depression, however. The fact is that I don't know the source. I realized my depression in January, six months before we broke up. I've been through a program to combat social anxiety, which actually worked quite well. I've had a lot of personal growth since then.

Everything seemed great after the summer ended, regardless of the breakup. I traveled solo for the first time, almost as a final exam for my anxiety (I would say I passed!). I found new friends, and my existing relationships flourished when I could spend more time with them as I was now single.

But the last month or so, problems started to occur. At first it was a lack of time. I had too many extracurricular activities, combined with difficult courses. Suddenly I was neck deep in unread material. Next was my fading relationship with my ex. I have a feeling she isn't interested in talking to me anymore. At first that was fine, I didn't talk much to her either. But the last few weeks she's been in every single dream of mine.

These dreams all start off with us together, either as good friends or as a couple. But every time she seems to get bored or annoyed, and slowly drift away. These dreams have caused me a lot of trouble with sleep. It's both hard to fall asleep and to wake up. I can't recall last time I woke up feeling fresh.

There's a lot else I could talk about, but I don't want to drown others with details. I'm mostly writing this to have a place to vent.

What I want advice for is what can I do to better my sleep, and to stop dreaming of my ex?

Tl;dr: I keep dreaming of my ex and don't know how to stop.",18Oct2019,1
17,"Hey,

So, this is all really new to me but i feel like this is the only outlet i can get at the time. I am a guy from Ecuador, in my life despite all adversities I have always maintained a positive attitude and pushed through whatever life threw at me. I had been dating this girl since i was 12, she was my first love, my first time, my best friend and my everything. She and I maintained a long distance relationship for a little over a year and to my surprise it worked. I was working after high school as every gig I could get to have money to go see her every two weeks on a bus for 12 hours and then 12 hours back. She did the same for me every other week and we made it work. We had plans to go to study to Germany and I started to save up to pay for my german lessons which after a year I passed the exam. She was going first as she was older and graduated first. On the airport, with her family's blessing I proposed, to which she said yes. Something like engaged to be engaged, to show her and her family that I was really committed to her. She went away and I was calm for a month, after that I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and had to get it removed. I didn't want to tell her because i didn't want her to worry while she was adjusting to her new life there. I was working 2 jobs at the time fresh out of high school to be able to afford school in Germany. After the Doctor announced I had to get surgery I figured I had to tell her as it was now becoming something real, at least in my eyes. (I just didn't want it to be real)

I told her and promised that I was going to fulfill the plans we had made and live to see her the next day. She told me she couldn't help me, that she wasn't ready to be there by my side and she broke up with me. I was shattered... 

I don't get along with my mom nor dad, and my family is the same story. I was alone. I tried to reach out to her a bunch of times and on the day of the surgery I called her (a little bit of a drama queen there) to tell her that if didn't make it that I loved her and that she was always going to be my best friend, that I wished her love and happiness, you know... the shit you say when you're fishing for a response. I fully recovered just to find out that she was already dating another guy over there. I tried to be happy for her and tell myself that it was better this way. I lived alone with my dog which I found on the street 10 years ago and took her home, a few weeks later my dog died and that was it...

I just felt like I needed to die. I really felt the need to just close my eyes and never wake up again. Not to make a show, not to cause a reaction in anybody. I just wanted it to end. Cried for months, kept going to work as it was the only thing keeping me sane, but still recurrently cried in the bathroom. I needed a change and went to another country to start over, tonight she sent me an email to tell me that I am the most pathetic guy she's ever met, that deleting all my social media was a weak move to ask for attention as her mother had asked her if I was ok. We had a miscarriage a year ago, and she told me that she was glad that I was not going to be the father to her child, that I was weak and didn't give a fuck if I died. I didn't answer, because at the moment I felt she was right. Despite being pretty young when we got pregnant I was really excited, and promised myself to be the best father I didn't have as a child. I kept it to myself and wrote songs and letters to my son, which even if I didn't get the chance to meet love with all my heart. That broke me. Im in a pretty dark place right now. I keep having panic attacks and really struggle to get up of my bed. I cry every night before going to sleep and rarely feel the need to eat or talk to anyone. I am really struggling with finding the meaning to any of it. 

I don't want to be weak, I really want to show my son that I'm strong and keep going. I have never felt this way and really want it to stop. To anyone who actually took the time to read this, thank you :). Just writing this down makes me feel a little less of the burden as it is no longer weighing in my heart but drenched in this post. Any advice is appreciated.",18Oct2019,1
18,"I want to get out of this mindset. Im a person that i dont want to be. A few weeks back things looked up. Got an appointment for CBT, best friend came back from Poland, talking non stop with him, barely feeling down and a girl showed interest in me. But i fucked most of that up. I enjoyed the attention and affection from her whilst we were drunk but 2 weeks ago she just wants us to be friends. Now shes moved on to someone else which contradicts something she said to me. Shes the first woman to show interest in me and affection. And technically my first kiss with a woman. 

But i cant get her out of my head. And i know i cant go anywhere near alcohol or anything to do with sex or relationships until im recalibrated. But i feel like shit watching people around me able to move forward with ease. Be able to socialize. Be able to put themselves out there. And i want that attention and affection again. But in seeking it out i would do more harm to me and other people.

19,"It's not just that I find it scary. I feel like I don't have a good connection with my feelings (maybe due to my autism). I also just don't know what I want to do. Basically, I don't have motivation for anything. There's not really stuff I want. I feel lazy and apathic as hell. But I don't know why it is, and so far, my therapist also doesn't really know where my depression comes from, so we're mainly focusing on life style (going for a walk outside everyday, going to bed earlier, etc.). That's going better, but I don't enjoy life. Even if I hangout with friends that like me, I always feel kind of isolated by myself. Egh.

It was so sudden and unexpected and I can’t process that I was dumped over a text message while I was asleep. 

I need motivation to keep going. I’m already suicidal and it got so bad last night that I had to text the crisis help line to keep me from jumping out my window on the 12th floor. 

I just need kind words to help me recognize that it’s going to be ok eventually",18Oct2019,2
21,"I’m 21F without a job or a college degree (dropout). 
I’m living with my parents so i don’t really have any bills to pay.
I still have depression &amp; anxiety after 10+ years and i’m about done with it, all of this.
It’s pointless to even try anything if my anxiety &amp; depression makes me back out last minute with EVERYTHING. 
I’ve become unreliable because i let my anxiety control me and i honestly hate myself for it- i’ve become the person i wanted to never be..

And boy have i tried controlling my anxiety, it’s close to impossible when anxiety to me is rapid heart beat along with tearful eyes &amp; confusion of reality. 

I literally have NO IDEA what to do with my life. Not a clue.
I enjoy a ton of things so it’s insanely hard to pinpoint 1 career path.
i’m very creative, As well I get bored/unmotivated when i have to do the same things for hours on end- i need to be doing different things throughout the day.
I have insane social anxiety so like a cashier job would never work, let alone do that for 8hrs a day..
I’m too scared to try anything in fear of not enjoying it, having to back out bc not the job for me, &amp; of course not being able to push they my anxiety.
There’s literally no jobs out there for me (they all require a degree or 2yr+ experience) so i’m about done with trying anymore.. life is just too much right now... and i’ve been stuck jobless &amp; school-less for about a year now because of my stupid fucking shitty mental health that is now uncontrollable.",18Oct2019,2
23,"Nothing makes sense. My exterior is calm and portrays very little to the uncontrollable chaotic battle of my brain. There is no speed limit to my thinking and thoughts and no limits it wont cross just to catastrphise everything.

I haven't eaten right in 4 days. I cant get to sleep. I cant stay asleep. I struggle to get out of bed. I struggle to think that lifes worth living. I struggle to even drink more than a single cup of anything a day. I have no energy. People keep moving on in life. I struggle to know or understand emotions. I struggle to even have a shower. Most days feel like thry drag on. My memory feels like its fading. My brain feels like its deteriorating.

There is no positives to life. Im only alive right now because my mum would be heartbroken and i help look after the cats. But yet i dont think about my best friend in a reason to live. Probably because hes an uncensored version of me.

How can i move forward when im struggling to much? How can i move forward with no understanding to my emotions?
How can i move forward when everyone says it gets better but its getting worse?
How can i move forward with no idea of how to truly help myself?
How can i move forward when my drive doesn't exist?
Would it be better if i didnt exist?
I need someone, in person, to tell me what to do. Where to go? How to do things? What helps? What doesn't?",18Oct2019,1
24,"Today was a horrible day for me... So shortly after I got home from school (around 3:30ish) my dad came home. Normally this isn’t a big deal, but today was different... the moment he walked in I could see the rage in his eyes. He was furious. Enraged. Angry. Inflamed. Irritated. And worse of all,Horny. He started to break everything in sight, after the whole house looked like japan after the atomic bomb was dropped, he spotted me. This was my first mistake, I should have left when he started breaking stuff. I could see the anger in face... so I bolted out the door. I was fast, but my dad was quicker, he caught up to me. He grabbed me and picked me up. We walked back to our house... he brought me into the room and proceeded to undress me, he started giving me the best head of my life, after about 10 minuets he whipped out his massive cock and proceeded to rape me, and I hated it... he took a video and sent it to all my friends, it was a horrible experience by far the worse day of my life. Fast forward 3 months I’m extremely depressed and want to kill myself every single day.",18Oct2019,0
25,"I used to be a very happy person till i lost my girl because of my mother.

Now my mother blames me for being unmarried till now.

I cannot harm or retaliate towards my mother because of my love towards my parents.

My father due to his illness has become a child now.

While i have lost everything a person can have.

I don't even have my health anymore.

I had everything: confidence of 10 men, flare n strength of 10 men a great body.

Exciting career.

A beautiful girl that I was in love with and wanted to marry.

I am constantly thinking about ending my life day in and day out.",18Oct2019,2
26,"Support or advice.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and mixed anxiety/depression at 14 yrs old. I tried every antidepressant and then when I was 15 I was put on Effexor XR, not realizing how hard it is to come off of it. At 24 I had to stop taking it cold turkey because I lost my insurance and my job. I completely broke down. I went thru 6 months of horrible withdrawals and was a crazy person. Started supplementing with hard drugs and occasionally alcohol until I finally gave in and went to my doctor and he put me on xanax. I stopped using drugs and rarely drank. 

Fast forward 8 years and thru the death of my husband and other abusive relationships and instances with men, I became desperate enough to use the same medication again because just taking xanax clearly doesn't help severe depression and I had begun drinking myself half to death.

It's been a year and the side effects were outweighing any minor benefits so my doctor is slowly weaning me off this time (I was on a much lower dose this time as well) but even with properly weaning off and being on klonopin for my anxiety attacks and withdrawal induced emotional breakdowns... I just feel at a loss. 

I'm on week 3 of weaning down my meds and I'm so depressed. I'd never kill myself and I know this is just something I need to get through but I'm afraid that really, there's no light at the end of the tunnel after all this and I have next to no support from people in my life. 

I feel alone and just keep crying. Even randomly in public. It's awful. Sometimes life is just too much for me. I got a gym membership 2 months ago and haven't gone because I'm too anxious to walk there alone but over the last year, the meds made me gain over 50 lbs and so I'm even more depressed. 

I feel so lost.",18Oct2019,1
28,"Hello, everyone!

I'm a 25 year old woman, I'm a developer and I'm a married to my best friend. I love what I do and I love my relationship, but I'm never enough, I guess. I don't really get this feeling too often, but this last month, I couldn't do anything right, my head is a mess...I was diagnosed with mania last year, depression was never ""my thing"".

I hate the way I look, I think my husband deserves someone better than me, which is not that hard...The company I work for, they should hire a better developer, cause I feel like I'm not enough. Everyone looks so excited about life, girls look so pretty, people are so in love with their careers, and I'm just not enough. Everyone is better than I am, I'm not good at anything and I was always a quiet person, but right now I feel like when I open my mouth, I ruin everything. 

My husband has no idea what to do, so he's just there, quiet, leaving me alone. And I'm so, so, so sad...Cause I'm wasting everyone's time again. And I don't know where this is coming from.",18Oct2019,8

31,"I turned 15 recently, and I just am never really that happy, i've had this mood thing since I was 11 that'll happen every few months where I get really depressed. But now it's just always prevelant. I think its partly because my gf ripped my heart out and dumped me a few months ago, so i've been drowning myself with working and exercising and soccer to distract myself but I feel like it's spiraling out of control. I don't want to call it depression because that is inconsiderate of people who actually are depressed. I don't know what to do. someone please help",18Oct2019,1
32,"I am currently in the process of moving overseas ~~not by my choice.~~ Amidst all the stress of moving, I just feel this unbearable sadness? Melancholic? I don't even know how exactly to put it into words. By moving, I have better job opportunity, in fact I already got a called up, I'll be closer to my family for the very first time in 7 years or so. But, it doesn't make me happy at all. I dreaded waking up every morning knowing it's just another day closer to leaving. This is not even the first time I'm moving, but I never felt this way before. I am depress, by all this moving thing just hit me harder and with my irl not exactly going the way I want it to be, I feel like I'm hitting all time low. I'm just tired feeling this way.   


If anyone have ever went through similar situation, please share how you at least get through this.",18Oct2019,1
