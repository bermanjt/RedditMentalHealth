0,"During the school year I always started to feel stressed, worthless and like I should just stop. Stop trying and just die. Whenever school ended I felt less stress and I didn't feel that way anymore. After school ended last year it started to get better but then it started getting worse again. My parents were busy more often, my sister started to talk less and less, and my friends got busy with relationships and new friends. I feel alone, unloved and I just want it to stop. I feel like a failure and that nothing will get better.",12Jun2019,4
1,This is basically my only other option because I’ve tried so many ways to deal with my depression but nothing and I mean nothing seems to work. I haven’t self harmed in a couple of weeks and it feels like I’m going through withdrawals. Does anyone know of an alternative to self harm?,12Jun2019,1
2,"How am I supposed to help myself when I feel like this? I don't even know how to describe it. I feel nothing most my days and then when I do, it's something painstakingly sad. I call it ""The crossroads of my existence"" because honestly, that's what It feels like. I'm not having good days and bad days anymore. I don't have any energy or motivation. I sleep as much as I can and will have a headache for the rest of they day because of it, and then from there, it's how long can I distract myself until the sadness demands to be focused on. I spend most days completely alone, except for a few small hours and it's to the point that, some days I'l cry when I'm alone because I'm \*Worried\*. Im scared that when I'm numb to everything, I'll do something dumb but logically, I feel like I think too rationally to actually do anything.

4,"(I also posted this on another subreddit so sorry if this is the second time you've seen this)

Actually, my mom is just all around a fake arse.
She acts all friendly around neighbors, family friends, and my friends, but when there's no one else to tell her she's wrong she turns into something else. She has 0 patience with my baby sister (2 in September) and yells almost all day. That's not why I'm making this post though ^^'

No I'm making this post because about 4 months ago I told one of my teachers that I thought I might have depression, she talks to me in person (I told her over email) and I get sent to the counsilor's office. I talk to the counselor and she says she has to tell my parents because of suicidal thoughts and such. I become a little uneasy at the thought but whatever, I tried not to think about it because it was first hour and I didn't want my day to suck more. At the end of the day my mom picked me up and on the way home she talked to me about it. When we got home I sat in my room all afternoon like always. We talked about having 1 day every month with just me and her, and we did so that weekend I think. 

Cut to a couple weeks ahead and I haven't heard anything out of her until one morning on the way to school. She tells me that she wants to take me to the doctor to check out what's wrong with me. This makes my day immediately better, because I was starting to think she forgot about the whole ordeal.

And just a couple days ago I heard her on the phone with my doctor on the way to the restroom and once I closed the door I almost cried, because it had been what seemed like forever since I last heard something about it, and this time I had lost hope that I was going to get any help. But of course, at dinner my mom is talking to my sister and suddenly hear ""oh, and I scheduled a doctor's appointment for you"". I paused and looked at her to see if she was talking to me, but no. She scheduled an appointment for my sister to get new birth control. I cant even put into words how disappointed I felt hearing that. But then she looks at me and says ""and i dont know what to do about you"" in a tone that didn't sound like she was concerned in the slightest.

I just want to add a couple things as well.
-My sister has had depression before and my parents got her a councilor and medication within the next month, so it's not like they have no clue what to do
-After talking to my sister I found out my parents are actually emotionally and verbally abusive to both me and her 
-Just to put it in perspective, it's been about 4 months since I first told someone, that's about 120 days, she only did the monthly thing once, and talked to me about it once. So in 120 days she has done 2 things about my possible depression.
-If you actually took the time out of your day to read all of this I just want to say thank you, even if you dont upvote",12Jun2019,2

10,"My boyfriend of almost a year suffers from a great deal of depression at times . We were friends for several years before dating so I knew this going in to this relationship. But having never been in a relationship with someone suffering from depression I didn't understand how it would truly effect our relationship .

  When we first started dating everything seemed to be taking place like any normal relationship and then suddenly I felt like he was trying to distance he's self from me ,wasn't really into any physical efection anymore and if there was it was always started on my end . I began to feel like maybe he's feelings were changing or weren't as strong as mine we're for him . I often wondered what I was doing wrong .


 After a few months he slowly started getting closer holding my hand more , not fighting as much not pulling away I was so relieved I thought we were over whatever it was . Well here we are a few months later and it seems like we are back to square one . I hate to say this but until a few days ago it never dawned on me that this might be  the cycle of depression I always just assumed maybe his feelings were changing ,he dint want to talk to me or dint like me as much as I did him . Everytime I mentioned him not doing things like he used to or how I felt yeah said it wasn't true . I try not to say to much about it because I don't want him to feel like he is doing something wrong but the distance and him pulling away is really starting to break my spirit .  

I'm hoping for a little insight from people who  experience this or can give me some tips on how to deal with this situation. I am completely in love with this man most of the times things are great but when things are like those I'm not sure if it's him loosing interest or if it's all part of his depression . I just want to understand and try to help him /us through whatever it is .",12Jun2019,0
11,"I recently got into a big mess. I did something really stupid a while back and hurt someone close to me. I didn't even do it because I was trying to hurt them, but because of issues I have with communicating my feelings to said person, I hurt them in the process of doing so by other, less savoury methods. Recently I did something stupid again. Not of the same caliber, but based on past experiences, they took it that way. I don't think they believed me when I tried to explain my reasoning to them, and I don't think they'll ever trust me again. I want to explain to them that I have communication issues, and that sometimes I don't know how or are afraid to talk to them because I'm afraid they will get angry and lash out at me, but, I am afraid that if I try to explain that to them, they won't even believe me, get upset and insult me and I'll just make things worse. They are already so angry at me and I don't think I can change their mind. I don't know if they'll ever come back from this and I don't know if our relationship will be the same. Even if they forgive me, I don't think I can get over my own guilt and self-hatred for something that could have easily have been fixed had I recognized my issues earlier on. This situation is the first thing that made me seriously consider taking my own life. I don't know if I'll ever be able to fix this and I don't know if I can live with these consequences. I just threw away a bottle of sleeping pills I recently stopped taking, and moved another bottle of HTP pills in my room to the kitchen because I couldn't stop thinking about OD'ing and going to sleep.

14,"I know something is wrong with me. For two years now, I've known something was wrong with me. I've not known what, and I don't know what, but I know there's something wrong with me. Whatever it is, it's keeping me from living a life that's worth living, and I'm tired of going on this way. The problem is, how do I begin to address an issue that I can't identify?  


My first instinct was to say depression, I've had a history with it, but... I don't feel confident in that diagnosis. Depression seems to me to be a far more... aggressive mental illness than what I'm experiencing. Depressed people are, at least stereotypically, sad. I'm not. Really, I'm not of low mood in general. My problem is that I seem to lack a mood period.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Friday, I went out to a local Asian restaurant that I've never been to before with a friend of mine. He kinda turned me onto Asian food in general a while back, but I've never been to a nice or authentic Asian place so this should have been a bit exciting. After eating there, I feel confident in saying that it was the best meal I've ever had. It was so good I went back last night with basically every good friend I know. I've simply never tasted food that was so incredible. And, despite all that, I basically don't care right now. Thinking back on it, it doesn't strike me as being a particularly good time. I know while I was there I was entertained, and the food was good, but... that was about it. I could have been eating at Arby's with my dad and I probably would have felt about the same way.  


That's how things have been for me for the last two years. No matter what it is I am doing, everything just feels... hollow, empty. I can have a good enough time, I can be entertained, but that's where it stops. No matter what, everything just feels like I'm passing time.  


I've not always been this way. Far from it, I was the kind of guy to get deeply emotional, excited, etc over just about everything. That's maybe why this hurts as much as it does for me. I went from being so lively, to just... nothing. I was thinking about my mom who passed away (around two years ago, obvious connection there) and I cried my eyes out... and despite that, I didn't feel much. I was sad, certainly, but it just felt... hollow. I'm pretty sure I was more emotional at the end of Your Name than I was thinking about my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what this would be called, but I *know* it's *something*. How do I go about getting this diagnosed by someone who maybe actually knows? What steps do I need to take to get this shit sorted out? I don't want to keep going on this way, but I don't know what the next step for me is. Thank you for any advice you might have!  


Note: already seeing a therapist, doesn't seem to be working. Have been seeing a therapist for 6 months now, time split between two therapists. Therapy feels just as empty as everything else to me. Therapy doesn't feel therapeutic. That's why I'm focused on diagnosis and medical solutions at the moment. My current therapist I really don't feel understands where I am at all, so not sure how much I want to bring him in on this.",12Jun2019,3
15,"Before I say anything I just wanna say that I am writing without really thinking of grammar or in what order I write, because I just need to write this frustration down somewhere.

  
Context: Denmark's school system is different from many other school systems, and I am about to finish 9th grade (pretty sure it's the equivalent to 10th grade in the US.) and I care a lot about my grades especially biology/chemistry/physics because I like them a lot and my brother is currently studying at a university to become a chemistry engineer.  
I am not diagnosed with anxiety or depression for various reasons and I am \*ironically enough\* almost 100% certain that  I have them. I know the online tests don't actually 

&amp;#x200B;

The last 2 months I've been working on a science project for my science exam.  
I've done tons of Quizlets and Anki decks.  
I have read a book that is on a higher ""level"" than I am supposed to be at. (something that's made for gymnasium students)

I have gotten help from my brother (it wasn't really helpful tbh, but I still got help and it bothers me I didn't ask for more stuff I would like to know)

All in all, I have tried really hard IMO to get the highest grade possible, especially because I didn't say a lot in class because I stutter a lot cuz of social anxiety I am afraid people will laugh at me, etc. so I have a barely passing grade already.  
Although I know I'm gonna pass 9th grade anyway because I calculated my average grade if I got a ""4"" which is what I think is the lowest I can possibly get with the effort I put into studying.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I got the grade for my exam is probably a good enough reason but I just can't admit it to myself. I can't accept it.

I was in a group of 3 incl. me I studied about bacteria and yeast which was relevant to the experiments we had done.

But I ended up talking about someone else's ""topic"" that I studied nothing about and couldn't possibly have studied.

We all helped each other decide what topic we were gonna talk about and since I have anxiety I couldn't ask to get the topic that was about bacteria etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I basically just read text up from the screen while looking at both teachers. It's just so frustrating that I just couldn't make myself ask for the topic I studied for. I can't even express it in words.

I don't have the energy to write more. I feel really unmotivated and depressed obviously... even when it doesn't actually ""count""

My husband tells me depression is a state of mind and I just don't have a backbone.

And now when I tell him how hurt I feel, he makes it my fault saying usually people get upset for a day and move on. 
He doesn't understand at all and is never emotionally there for me.

20,This is my first post on reddit honestly i am feeling really desperate about my depression lately. So i have been feeling depressed for almost 5 years. Of course i have ups and downs but i started taking medication when i was around 14 and i'm 19 now. Honestly i don't feel like i solved any of my problems at all. I tried going to a lot of doctors tried a lot of meds tried doing therapy but nothing seems to help. Honestly i feel like none of the doctors get me noone takes me seriously. I think that i have a severe memory problem. So much that it affect everything i do it brings me down i don't feel motivated at all. And i am not talking about memory problems like forgetting where you put your keys forget what you ate for lunch yesterday this is much more severe. When i am gonna do something first thing that comes to my mind is what is the point of doing this if i am not even gonna remember it. I watch a lot of movies and tv series. But honestly at the end of watching something i dont even remember the character's names and  most of the story. This goes for my memories too i don't remember  most of my life like when someone asks me what i remember about my childhood there is literally almost nothing that i remember about it. The doctors think that it is psychological but it feels more than that i have never heard someone that had the same problems as me. Even my grandma who is 82 years old remembers stuff better than me. It feels like my mind is empty.  Does anyone know what my problem is i feel like if i don't solve this i am never going to be happy please help,12Jun2019,3

23,"My boyfriend suffers from depression ,I knew that going into the relationship but I guess not ever being in a relationship with someone who suffers from depression I dint fully understand how much it would effect us as a whole ( really dumb on my part ) 

I would like to clarify I relationship by know means is a bad one when we're good were really good but when we're not it's really hard I am completely in love with this man I know that for a fact but here is where the trouble lies .

I myself am a complete over thinker and I will over anayalize situations to death till they make me crazy . A few months after we got together I noticed he wasn't doing things he used to such as giving me compliments , seemed to pull away from hugs hand holding , taking longer to answer msg etc . Me being me figured he was loosing interest or that I was doing something wrong I made a consistent effort to show him affection and let him know how I felt but it seemed like the harder I tried the harder I failed and the harder he pushed away .if i mentioned it to him he would say everything is the same and he doesn't know what I'm talking about . 

Well a few months of that and then as fast as it came it left we were back to being on the same page he made me feel special again he showed affection everything was good I was so relieved and excited but low and behold we are now back to the distance and I started wondering again what did I do wrong ! Then I started realizing oh maybe this is part of being in a relationship with a person suffering from depression but I'm not sure I guess my question is is this a trait of people with depression? How do I know  if it's just part of a cycle or if he truly is loosing interest ? I don't want to keep bringing it up one because I don't want him to feel like he is doing anything wrong or to feel bad for going through something he has no control over . 

Any advice or signs to look for would be greatly appreciated any one who has gone through similar situations I would love to hear how you get through them as smoothly as possible I never want him to feel alone but I also don't want to smother him .",12Jun2019,1

Made a throwaway to share a bit of my story with hopes that someone that relates can chat with me or help me.

I've been dealing with depression for quite some time now. Been on and off the meds and have seen a therapist for the last year. I am going to a different place in a while for more intensive help, but that can take a while. Thankfully I live in a country in europe where health care is affordable and resources are available.

I am a 30 year old male. I live with my younger GF. In 2017 I went through a divorce. This was my first relationship, we met when I was 20. It was also the first and back then the only girl I'v ever had sex with. This started to give me issues that I never experienced sex in my teen years. No girl saw me as someone they wanted to date or have sex with. This has cost my marriage as I cheated on my ex because this out of my league hot girl wanted to have sex and I went for it.

Later, after some Tinder experiences and more sex with different girls. I met my current GF. I started developing problems because she was hot in her teens and has had multipe relationships and sex partners. This has made me insecure. She even had sex with I guy I know from school which bothers me a lot. Also she had a relationship with a black guy which makes me insecure because you know what they say about the size of a black guys penis.

Since a year now I've been struggling with thinking or talking about my teens. I also can't see old pictures of my GF or hear old stories. I have a feeling it's going to cost my relationship. She was super skinny in her teens but now she's fat, which doesn't bother me cause that's how I fell in love with her. But I always feel like I am an option when there's nothing else left and everyone had their experiences. I don't want her ex boyfriends to see me or anyone that knew her back then.

I feel like a total loser and I can't change anything about the past. Lately I've been quite suicidal and my mind is fighting against me trying to stay okay.

To name some positive things: I am still very social, I work, I get out of bed every morning, I shower every day, wear clean clothes everyday,do a lot of housework and have a lot of good people around me.

So I can still function, which makes me believe I'm a strong person. I just always feel very sad and I've been crying alot because I feel lonely. I can't talk with anyone about it and I am afraid this will cost my relationship. If that happens, I will end my life.

32,"Throwaway because they might frequently visit this sub.

I have a friend who has been depressed and suicidal for many years, most the time I have known him. He suffered bullying all through the end of middle school and high school, spare a small friend group, and because of this believes everyone is always out to get him and no one cares about him when this is simply not true. We are now 4 years removed from that. There is a group of 6-8 of us, his friends, that are here for him and listen and try our best to help. We try our best to include him in things, yet when he is he often begins to feel very anxious, and wants to leave, and afterwards will complain that no one invites him to anything.

Lately he has been getting worse and worse. 7 months ago he was sending pictures of himself cutting to multiple people, myself included. We had a meeting with his parents explaining the severity of the issue, and they said they would work on it. Since then they have tried to get him into a program, he refused the help, and I haven't heard anything else from them since. Just this week his parents also canceled his cell service, making him more angry and making him spiral more and more.

Because of this we have to help him ourselves. He is resisting it constantly, saying he doesn't want help because no one cares about him and that we are threatening him. We tell him we care about him but we can only do so much as friends, and he needs to get professional help. He has tried medication and therapy in the past, not sure if he still does either. He just vents to me daily (which I gave him full permission to do, say anything he needs to, etc) about how horrible his life is, how all he does is drink and smoke all day, and how he wants to end it all or kill himself, yet won't let us help him.

He has shared his Reddit username with me and I can't help but check it, and see him posting on subs like suicidewatch, foreveralone, etc, saying he has no one in his life, everyone abandons him, no one cares about him, and asking for help. Just this morning he texted another friend saying ""I spent the morning cutting, probably ODd too"" and no other information, other than ""it wasn't a lot, just a little more than what was normal, and when we offered to help him seek help TODAY, he said we were just threatening him and he doesn't need us in his life.

Should we attempt to get him involuntarily admitted to a psych ward? We have done our research on it and it is legal in our state, but the laws don't seem extremely clear cut. Our biggest worry is that he'll see it as us betraying him and he cuts us from his life or ends up actually killing himself because of it. This post is only a small view into the situation, and I've tried to be as clear as possible.

Thank you very much to anyone who can offer advice, we all really appreciate it.",12Jun2019,6
33,"This is a throwaway, (I know it's against the rules but I don't want to do this on my actual account, as there are people who know me, let's just hope it's here long enough)


I am too scared to tell my parents, or anyone close to me, about how I feel. I feel empty inside, I lost interest in the things I used to love, and I stopped hanging out with friends because I don't have the energy. I ger tired so quickly, I can barely do anything before I just want to lay motionless on my bed, not even sleep or anything. I have trouble sleeping at night, even on the nights that I can sleep relatively good, I can wake up at 1 PM and still feel like I didn't shut an eye. My parents start to notice I'm not okay, they ask me multiple times a week if I'm okay in that weird ""I think I know what's up but I am not sure"" empathic voice, and everytime I reassure them I'm fine, but I really want to tell them I'm not. I'm repeating 10th grade next year because I couldn't find the motivation to concentrate in class or to study, even though school was never an issue for me, I was academically adequate. 

Sometimes I stand bare-feet at the edge of one of the wooden planks on my bedroom floor, close my eyes and pretend it's the edge of a building. And I keep telling myself it is, and if I take a step it's over, and then I stand there for 5-10 minutes and take that step.

I want to know if something is wrong with me, obviously I've googled symptoms and some do seem to match, but there is nothing in my life to trigger depression, I have a loving family, good friends and a privileged life. Am I depressed or am I just being a little bitch?",12Jun2019,1
34,"Hi there! 

Let me give you the short version of my life right now.
I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Polycystic Ovary syndrome, I’m on a shit medical aid, I’ve been struggling with depression (also been diagnosed with BPDII and adult ADHD, but idk) and anxiety for years and after my mother passed away last year and my dad recently got married, things just kind of get worse.

I dropped out of conventional college to take care of my mom at home (cancer), and I continued my studies long distance. After she passed I was just looking after the house and my dad. He met up with a woman (nasty person tbh) and almost immediately moved out and left me here. 

Now all that sucks and I get stuck in bed over this and obviously my physical disabilities and junk doesn’t help. But in the type of person who thinks (and often overthinks) a situation to try and figure out how to fix/change it, not just wallow in it.

Medical aid sucks, so I can’t afford to see a psychologist, but I know I desperately need one. 
I got my TEFL certification so I can teach English online, to afford a better medical aid, so I can see a shrink.
Problem is I’m an anxious wreck and I get stuck in bed. 

See the problem here? I’m sure a lot of us have similar issues or are in similar situations.

What can I do? 
I would go for the hotlines and the free services given, but I live in South Africa, the “services” provided by the government is horrible and they don’t care and all the others I’ve tried aren’t much better. 

I tried seeing the university psychologist at the conventional college, but they just say they’re there for students, it’s a massive pain to actually get any help. 

My siblings are too preoccupied with their own lives, I want to blame them for never being there, but I can’t really blame someone for focusing on their life first.

And as I said, my dad is living with his new wife, he isn’t all that interested in my mental well-being (he’s not the type to take is seriously) and the new wifey calls me lazy and useless and can’t understand how I lose weight when I do nothing all day. So she isn’t the nicest or most understanding person. She also tried to steal mine and my mom’s jewelry from the house so there’s that. She’s banned from the house now. But my dad feeds her other stories to “keep the peace”

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do? 
I’d really like to dig myself out of this hole and it doesn’t look like I’m gonna have anyone around to help me. 

I have access to a laser cutter and I have designed a few things too, but actually making anything and trying to sell it comes with so much anxiety too, investing my own money to get the resources, shipping costs, constantly doubting myself (bit of an imposter syndrome going on too). 

Any help/tips appreciated.",12Jun2019,2

37,"I'm 28 year old male from uk this might be long and full of irrelevant shit but this is how iv become me.

when I was in school I was bullied, I talked a lot but never made friends. people just shit on me most of the time making fun of me or hitting me that sort of stuff, I lost all confidence in myself and in the last year of school I stopped going and nothing happened, no angry letter from teachers asking where I was and no parents asking why I never went to school nothing. It was like I never existed there and it was great, I was alone playing games in my room and no one bothered me. I would go months not talking to anyone except yes, no ,ok and thankyou. I had become invisible to the world and I felt happy this lasted for 16 to 19 years old and no one in my life said a thing.

age 19 I was in a job centre trying to find a job witch was hard not having experience, education or confidence, when I saw a guy I knew from school and he invited me out for drink with his friends. I was excited I thought I might make some friends and get a life, I quickly realised that shutting my self in and not talking had left me with no social skills what so ever (20seconds of talking 10mins of silence), they eventually stopped trying to talk to me. I felt like a creep following these people around and they treated me like that. I went home and felt embarrassed and ashamed at myself and hated the person I had become, so I went back to shutting myself if back to the place I felt safe.

age 21 I had found a job and started living on my own. I was surprised I had gotten the job I look miserable, talk slow and confused and never even looked the guy in the face or shuck his hand when he extended it.

I still work there now and it has helped me talk a little better, it was hard in the beginning there is a guy at work who makes fun of everybody but focuses on me a lot because I work closely with him, he would call me gay ask me if I fucked my own dad and all sorts of other crazy stuff. This used to bother me but now its just part of my daily routine and some of the stuff he says is so messed up it has me crying with laughter. I still don't feel comfortable around them most days and can go days not talking as the busy work can make me blend in but its better then absolute silence of living on my own.

age 26 I have enough money for a deposit on a house. I was so proud of myself and told my mother hoping for advice but she changed the subject on how that money would help her and how I would be a good son so I gave in and gave her a couple of thousand. she then told my 3 older brother who have never really talked to me, all came at me with sob story's and asked for money promising they'll pay me back and how where all family. long story short I caved in and they ignored me,avoided me got angry and aggressive when I asked them questions, I lost almost all my saving in a matter of 2 week. they all talked about me like I'm a bad person and ungrateful son.

age 27 I have numbed myself to the world nothing can affect me I don't care about anything I don't just sit in silence my thought are gone like there's nothing in my head for hours even days and then one day it was like every emotion had stored it self up in me and it all came out, I felt like killing myself.

for the first time in my life I feel lonely and hiding in my room just makes me worse, I'm to scared to change I don't have the confidence to change how can I trust people and even if a got over these things. iv got noting to offer people I'm an idiot who afraid to talk to people whos worried about where to put his hand and where do i look and am I standing like a weirdo. half the time I'm a robot the other half I'm scared what the hell do I do it has taken he weeks to have the courage to write this and hours typing it out I feel embarrassed and pathetic and feel like im taking away from other people with more serious problems.",12Jun2019,3
