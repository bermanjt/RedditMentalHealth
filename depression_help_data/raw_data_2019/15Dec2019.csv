I started causing myself harm, and I have started thinking about ending it all. How do people deal with this? Sorry if this is not an appropriate post, please remove if necessary.",15Dec2019,1

2,"Sorry if this isn’t for this subreddit, but I honestly don’t know where else to put this. For the past week, I was talking to a girl on tinder. To make a long story short, she suddenly stopped talking to me, like 3 days ago. This isn’t the first time. I was lucky enough to even get a response from her. She was one of a few people that I got more than 1 or 2 responses. After this one, I though, she respond eventually. Not a single response. I sent gif this morning at 10 that said, “Come back.” Almost 12 hours later, no response. But the thing is, I asked her a question 2 days ago with no response. I won’t say that I’m depressed, but it feels like I’m either sad, or having a small depression phase. I feel like no matter how much I try, I can’t find a girl to date. What am I doing wrong in life that has led me to come to realize that love may not be for me? I just want to happy with somebody and love and care for them when they don’t give me a chance to show it. Is there a way to find that one person to love? To be happy with? I hope soon.",15Dec2019,1

4,"(F19) Everyday I wake up and I feel like I want to just cry. No particular reason, I just feel miserable, and I know I have depression, I’ve been diagnosed with that and a hand full of other problems, but I just don’t understand why I can’t get over it. Everyone around me is tired of me being such a bummer. They don’t have to say it, I know by the tone of their voice and the “your still not ok?”. I feel so alone in all of this. I try to push through, and ignore it. I try to distract myself, focus on school, go out with friends. But at the end of any interaction I’m just waiting for them to leave so I can stop pretending and sometimes just go cry. Everyday feels so bland. Eating, sleeping, socializing, all of it. My mom tries to understand, but all she can say is sorry. I feel bad for making her feel bad. My father on the other hand, he wants me to get over it. Go be happy because his life is worse than mine and he’s experienced worse. I understand his problems, but every time I tell him I feel awful he tells me he feels worse. I don’t know what to anymore. Fake It till I make it? I’ve seen many therapists. I’ve been on so many medications it’s not even funny. I’m on meds currently, but I feel bad on or off them. The stereotypical “oh go for a walk, take some deep breaths, take a bath ect” just don’t do it for me anymore. I’m in such a hole and I feel like I’ll never get out. Any actual ways you all have found to cope with this feeling of despair and hopelessness? Thanks.",15Dec2019,1
5,"So I was a tad unsure if to put this here or on r/teenagers but I decided to put it here.

&amp;#x200B;

So put simply I am in a really close and touchy friendship with my crush (basically cuddle buddies) and before that was really all I needed to be perfectly fine and happy with every thing. lately though I guess she told her girl friend about us being cuddle buddies and IG she wasn't ok about us being that close and now knowing that I could be that happy and blissful with just cuddling with her I'm back to being depressed with little to no way of coping. I genuinely don't want to upset her or her current significant other but I really want to them to break up (I cant lie) so I could be with her or at least cuddle with her again, but that's unlikely to happen for a long while. Now I'm just kinda stuck trying to decide if I should or shouldn't just leave our friendship as is and try to be patient till they do likely break up (long distance relationships don't work, usually at least) or if I should try to ask her if she could be my go to emotional support person. I have never had any kind of emotional support person IRL and now that most of my online emotional support have either forgotten about me or are busy with school and/or stuff at home I'm more desperate/in need of emotional support.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking for any one here to try acting as an emotional support person I'm just looking for advice on how I should or if I even should ask her to be my go to emotional support? I mean by this point I'm semi-interested in just telling her about my reddit account posts on this subreddit and just let her decide what to do with that. I don't know what to do, please just give me a tip or something here.",15Dec2019,1
6,"Her parents are getting a divorce, her dad has an affair, and she just plunged into depression. Her parents also don’t really spend any time with her, and never have.

I know details because I’ve known her for years, but how do I help her through this? I can kind of emphasize, I have been depressed before, but all I can do I think is try to be there. I’ve listened to her talk about how it’s hard for her to get up in the morning to face the day, and to keep her head up, but she keeps closing herself off, like a shut-down state. I don’t know what to do. I know she’s hurting and feels alone. I want to help, but I also don’t want to mess with her recovery in any way.

7,"I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and I’m losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. 

I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when it’s not reciprocated in the end. I know that’s selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. 

I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesn’t have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. 

My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time I’ve really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. 

I have one friend left but I’m afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isn’t fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we don’t talk the emotions come back.

8,"Leaving my house is getting harder and harder everyday. Sometimes I just lay on my bed watching my toddler babble at me. She is my rock. She keeps me tethered and at the same time makes me feel like sinking. Lately all Ive been thinking about is losing her. Its my depression take a nasty turn. Ive done therapy, both group and individual and I think its time to start medicating. I want to be here for her. Ive done hobbies and Ive done excersing. They work for a while but as a mom I just dont have the time to use these as a coping mechanism as much as Id like. Im scared the medication will prevent me from breastfeeding as I find this to be very helpful to my day. The hormones you know. Today was hard. But I know itll get better.

9,"I've(16) been texting a girl(17) for a month or 2 now. I really, really like her. She's amazing. She's also in the same class as me. I neve told her, that I have feelings for her, and i don't think i ever will. In the time i texted her she ended up kissing and having crushes on 3 different people with the same name, then thought she was the reason that one dude's relationship ended, cuz he didn't tell her that he had a girlfriend. She went running to me over WhatsApp and was crying and stuff. I tried to tell her that nothing's her fold and she's a good girl. After doing that for 3 hours she said ""Thanks for being here"". If she sees me as a  friend, that's ok. I'm just unbelively sad, that i can't be with her. She's been screwed over so many times, but I don't think likes me in that way, so I sadly can't make her feel the way she really does deserve to be treated. I am also shy, kinda fat, and I'm trying to be funny as much as I can. However, a couple of weeks ago I was overwhelmed by emotions, so I started losing it. I thoight about all the bad shit that always happens to me, all of the times i was left out, all of the times I was alone in the end. I don't know how I should feel right now. I feel sad, angry, and yet joyful and happy that she's still alive after that day she told me what's up(with the relationship she appearently destroyed) . She's been everything I've been able to think about and idk what I should do. She appearently doesn't want anything more than friendship from me, I would litterly kill Godzilla with my bare-fists to go out with her one day. She's like no other girl I've ever met.

To make it short: Another girl doesn't see me as boyfriend material, and my depression, that I had for 3 years and thought I was freed by a month ago came back. I don't know why people don't ever love me the same way I do. Help.",15Dec2019,1

11,"I can’t take this suffering anymore. Everyday feels meaningless and miserable. I don’t remember who I am, the past few months it feels like I’ve completely lost myself.

I can’t think normally anymore. I don’t laugh or smile like.. EVER anymore. I don’t find things funny. I’m sad and lonely. I feel like there’s no hope in me getting better. Another thing I’d lik to add is that with all of this I feel like I’ve lost my imagination. I can remember vivid images of things I’ve seen, but coming up with something myself feels impossible. It hasn’t been like this before, I’ve always been creative and had a great imagination, but now it just feels gone. I feel so hopeless and useless. I don’t know what to do.

12,"I feel as if I have no real place in this world. My father is a manipulative abuser (though he always insults you if you try and confront him about it) who only bullies me no matter what I do or ask of him. My mother is also extremely manipulative. She's generally just airheaded though, and insanely over the top about everything. Except when it matters. Whenever it matter, she crumbles. Whenever I need them, my parents AREN'T THERE FOR ME. It hurts. To want to feel loved and safe and cared for by the people who used to mean the world to you, and only be shunned or disrespected by them.

I've asked for therapy for years. I was raped as a child. My parents know this now because earlier this year I tried to report it. My dad told me not to tell on the guy and my mom made it about her, telling me AGAIN and AGAIN about her brother who raped her. I would never want to make her pain any less valid, but she did NOTHING to help ME report this. She just sat back and did... Nothing. Ranted about her shitty life instead of helping me fix mine while we had the chance. My dad said it wasn't that big of a deal and so many people had so much worse.

I was sexually taken advantage of from 4 to 11 by my brother on and off over the years. No penetration below the belt. I was raped almost every day from 8 to 15 by my other brother's best friend. I can tell the story a million times over, word for word. Day by day. I remember everything. I wanted to report it. The pain was, and still is, too much. I lived in constant, CONSTANT fear for YEARS. YEARS. I cannot live or function as a normal person. I still have that constant fear living inside of me, and now the depression and hurt of realising what happened... I feel worthless.

My own father doesn't care. I don't know what I could tell him to make him feel anything other that disgust towards me or annoyance or whatever the fuck he feels for me. He once told me if anyone hurt me he would kill them. He might just end up killing me at this rate.",15Dec2019,1

15,"I've been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where it's a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long.

My son (late teens) and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. It's his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer.

He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, ""I need some space for about a week, just working something out."" I respect that and I let him know that.

I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if there's anything I can do to help. She responded that it's teenager stuff and he's not in danger. (Son lives with depression and anxiety too.)

So I give space.

2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that it's scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I don't know anything about what's going on. No response.

I e-mail his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing.

It's been over 3 weeks now. I e-mailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. I'm worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before.

This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. We're usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. I'm very worried for him.

Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and I'm an occasional thought and memory. That's what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler.   
(Whole other story why that happened that I'm not going to get into.)

I'm not ready for it to be today. Especially knowing that something was wrong enough for him to go see a psychologist.

I don't know what to do or think about this. Any advice? I'm very much in the 'don't want to wake up tomorrow' space, but also want to be here in case he needs me.",15Dec2019,1
16,"This past month my ""depression"" (I call it this in quote marks because I haven't been officially diagnosed) has been getting towards the extreme side of things. The feeling of wanting to end my life has grown to the point I'm not afraid to do it anymore. So to give me that little satisfaction instead of doing it I just think about doing it, or how I'd do it. I'd want myself to suffer because it's what I believe I deserve. What have I done to deserve it? I don't know but it doesn't take away this horrendous guilt.

It's weird to say how my own death excites me. It's like going to a concert you've long anticipated and you can't sleep the night before. I imagine how carefree the afterlife is. I imagine how much simpler it'd be and I wouldn't have to feel. That's the worst of all of this, as numb as they are I still have feelings. None of these feelings are good, they make me the way I am. This might be why I feel the excitement when it comes to suicide. The excitement that this shit show that is my life will finally come to an end. My feelings will no longer hold me down. I won't have to feel anything. I'll feel the pain at the end but once that's over I'm, weightless. Not tied down by any responsibility or things that are stuck on my conscience. Just free. Freedom comes into this a lot, I suppose feeling trapped isn't exactly helping the way I'm feeling? More or less amplifying it I guess. However that's the thing about being trapped. You can't escape, trust me I've tried, so you just give up and wait for the inevitable. I feel as though killing myself would be (for obvious reasons) my last fuck you to the system. The last little bit of control over my life that I have. It gives me a choice and I get to choose, not have it chosen for me. I find comfort in that. I guess to summarise before I end this lengthy piece of writing I'd say the idea of my death is the only cure for my problem. Sad that being defeated is the only victory, a sort of oxymoron in itself but that's how it is, I can't find a way to change it.

Yes I am certain that I can maintain a family and have children and support and give them everything they deserve, but I will never be able to love them. I would be sad if god forbid something would have happened to them, or to the women who brought them to this world, but still I would never be able to accept them in my heart as mine.

The issue is that my boyfriend doesn’t believe in therapy and doesn’t see it as an issue but my “behavior” is affecting our relationship. As much as I try to explain that I can’t control it, that I am handling it, and that I would appreciate his support, he doesn’t know how to support me and becomes distant when I try and open up to him about it. 

How do I try to help him understand what is happening and how to best explain my symptoms and what I need from him?

I had the initial side effects as predicted like sleepiness and vivid dreams, etc. which resolved in a couple of weeks as well as all the negative feelings and dark moods of loneliness etc. plus the anxiety and feeling overwhelmed which have mostly gone, however I’ve been feeling extremely unmotivated and low that I’m barely making it to work and the rest of the time I’m in bed. My sleep was also quite bad feeling unrested in the mornings. Normally I drink one coffee and one tea a day but recently I’ve been taking triple shot espressos and I’m not feeling any difference. My sugar and carb consumption has also increased. Last Monday when I had my follow up with the doctor he decided to increase the dose to 10mg/day.

23,"i’m a responsible, good-natured guy in my mid 20s. from the outside it would look like i’m totally set up for success and happiness. lived in a handful of U.S. states after leaving for college, trying to find one suitable for me and far enough from my family. i have a great living situation since i moved in june. before this, i lived with a girlfriend for a year who i now miss dearly and think about multiple times a day. i’ve always kept my circle of friends close, meaning i only have a max of 2 or 3 at any time that really know me. right now i have zero because i’m so deep into this depression that it’s hard for anyone to relate to me. i don’t respond anymore to the typical “get some sunlight” or “go talk to people” because i’m absolutely done with distracting myself away from my problems. about 6 months ago i realized most of my issues stem from complex trauma (CPTSD). i have a solid job, got a good undergraduate degree from a top school, i’ve had plenty of attractive girlfriends over the years but feel no self-confidence as soon as we break up. people generally don’t seem to hate me, i have a dog of my own, but still not feeling like this is worth it.

i haven’t spoken to my family in over a year but had to threaten them with a restraining order via email recently. i’ve been going to therapy for around 6 months and have tried 3-4 antidepressants in the past year or two. i feel no one understands my issues, and i feel like i’m being penalized for being so high functioning. it gives the appearance that i’m doing fine, when that couldn’t be further from the truth. i’m just barely hanging on. people i’ve told my issues to just say “get over it” or “the past is the past.” 

i can’t really look people in the eyes anymore. i use self checkout at the grocery store. i’ve gotten good at mindfulness meditation, but it made me too aware of the effects of my trauma so i had to dial it back. i’ve read reputable books on ptsd and cptsd. i watch people talk that inspire me: jordan peterson, joe rogan, etc. every day, which only gets me through the day. i’ve battled hardcore chronic insomnia for as long as i can remember. the doctors thought i might even be narcoleptic. i’m always tired and mentally foggy, always pushing through it, and never reaping the rewards. i *always* feel mentally out of breath. they gave me a couple of stimulants for the fatigue, but they only act as temporary band aids. i’m running on empty. i have to smoke weed every evening just to keep my mind under control and help me sleep. recently i’ve been smoking during the day too and adding alcohol and/or a benzo into the mix for before bed. i’ve looked into the newer treatments like ketamine (can’t afford), mdma (applied for clinical trials), and psilocybin (tried recently for the first time and made me feel whole for about a week or two, but don’t have access to more).

i don’t have anyone besides my therapist that i talk to on a regular basis. all he does is ask how my week’s been and try to attack the symptoms of the issues on a case by case basis. he’s not really piecing the story together any better than i already have. in our last session i managed to bring up the fact that i don’t have much time left and started crying. every day i have to consciously save myself from consuming myself. i can’t go on like this forever. if it’s going to be like this forever, see ya. 

i work from home. i’m constantly trying to wrestle with all these painful thoughts in my head but cannot figure out a way to win. i’ve started working out every couple of days but it doesn’t help much.

I haven't been eating or showering regularly, although I've been able to hide it from people (wash cloth/soap on problem areas, shampoo my bangs in the morning before work, a block of cheese or granola bar from time to time) I've missed out on important family events and cancelled on friends because I had to ""write my paper,"" but in reality I haven't been doing anything. 

I am a tereible, useless, worthless person, clearly. I'd kill myself, except I honestly don't even have the energy to find the means to do it cleanly in a way that wouldn't end up with people I love finding my body. I also would want to leave a suicide note that made it clear that I cared about everyone in my life and there's nothing they could have done-- it's simply that my brain isn't able to function adequately,  and it never has, and it never will. I don't write well enough to convey the sentiment convincingly though-- everything sounds too cold. I don't want people to take it personally because it's not about them at all.

I just get in the way of others happiness who care about me. I can see the other side but can't get there. It leads to thoughts of not wanting to exist, to not be a burden/factor in their lives anymore. I can't get it out of my head that I ruin everything. What am I suppose to do? Been trying to combat negative thoughts actively for over a year now. Going to counseling. I'm tired.",15Dec2019,1
