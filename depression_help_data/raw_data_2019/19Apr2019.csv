1,"I don’t know if I’m depressed. I’m not weeping into my cereal every morning or anything. I just feel... meh. I can’t be bothered with anything. Nothing brings any feelings of joy or satisfaction. I’m not looking forward to anything. Going through the motions of keeping house, going to work, looking after my family, cooking meals, tidying up and cleaning and I just feel like I’m existing to care for others. All I want most in the whole world is to be left alone, preferably in my bed. I can’t see the point to it all.

4,"I thought I was sitting at bottom. The only person left who I truly trusted for 8 years I guess finally had enough and betrayed me then broke up with me. Part of my already terrible depression was the guilt of how I treated her but the girl I shared my adult life with wouldn’t do something like this to me if I was stable. How could she possibly crush me so much farther down than I ever considered possible when I’m already a disaster. So I’ve lost my best friend (only, actually, due to alienating everyone to hide misery) and the girl I didn’t deserve but was too busy hating myself and feeling sorry for myself to realize she’s too strong driven and cute to stay with a bum forever. But why not just leave me instead of now proving what I am convinced, no one can truly be trusted. Ironic I dumped all this in my post about not talking to a therapist but tbh I’ve barely slept in days and feel like I’m buried deep deep down in the middle of nowhere.

7,"Okay, so I don’t really know if this is exactly the place for this, but I just want to share my entire experience and recovery. 

I’ve been depressed for about 6 years now. I don’t know if this happened to anyone else, but for an extremely long time, I left it untreated, and then it got worse, and around the same time that it was worsening, I had met this really amazing guy. He’s been extremely supportive and understanding with this illness, in ways that most people can’t be. I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment. For me, on days where I got low enough, I notice that I may not have treated some of the people who cared about me as kind as I should have, but the fact that he, as well as a few others in my circle, understood and worked with me towards improving shows a lot.

Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. 

Flash forward, I started college. I landed myself in a large city where I knew absolutely anyone. I know how to speak to people, but I have too much social anxiety to willingly put myself out there and make friends, so I had no place that I really belonged socially. On top of it all, I was taking 17 credits, I had no life outside of my coursework, and my now long-distance boyfriend had dumped me. All I could do was cry myself to sleep every single night at that point, and that’s when I remember everything going downhill. I thought I was at my worst, but little did I know that was just the start.

Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. 

I mentioned from my experience in high school about hurting myself, and that urge to hurt myself returned yet again. I did it enough times to drive my boyfriend crazy. I was putting weight on him to be responsible for me, and eventually he had to call the police in fear that I’d go too far. The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me. One guy had to be watched by two people at a time to ensure that he doesn’t try to hurt someone else (because apparently he had a history of that in the facility). 

Anyway, after going to the psychiatric ward, I was treated with medication. I’m not saying medication is the solution to it all. My mood felt better at least. It became harder to cry for no reason. I still have bad days, and I still consider myself depressed, but it’s more manageable. My relationships with others have improved too. 
After being on it for some time, I’m actually noticing my life take a turn in the right direction. 

I don’t believe it was all about the medication, because quite honestly, the medication can only do so much. At some point, it was my responsibility to look after myself (this should be common sense, I know, but my entire life I put happiness and wellbeing in the hands of others to be responsible for). 

Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me. I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. 

Depression is the hardest battle I’ve ever had to fight, because trust me, before any of this dramatic stuff happened,  I truly did want to get better, but it felt impossible. I did everything I could. I went to therapy. I made an appointment to see a psychiatrist. I tried to walk outside and workout more. I tried talking to new people. I tried to keep a positive mindset on everything, yet I still felt waves of sadness that I felt were out of my own control. 

If you would have told me 6 years ago that things were going to get better, I would have laughed in your face. I sincerely believed that I would be stuck in this dark hole for the rest of my life, but the truth of the matter is, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Time has a funny way of making everything work itself out. Be patient and kind to yourself. My life isn’t rainbows and sunshine. I still do feel depressed here and there and I do have bad days, but I made the choice to better myself and to get myself out of that dark place. Every day I wake up, I have to make the choice to allow myself to feel okay. 

Thanks for listening.",19Apr2019,3
8,"I understand just how pointless it can be to post this kind of thing on the internet but honestly I Just have no real desire to talk in person about this so hooray anonymity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior in high school and I'm just done.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had moderate clinical depression since 1st grade, asperger's my whole life, undiagnosed ADD until recently, imposter syndrome, painful constant stomach cramps, IBS, and anxiety to form what I like to call a fine fruit salad of problems. Recently 4 years of work and dedication in a competitive event I've participated in for all of high school ended up going down the drain. It really hurt but what hurt worse was that 1. I came in literally 1 ranking away from success in three different ways, and 2. all my friends succeeded. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad because my friends are all talking about it and I just hide and cry while they do. I resent them for their success yet know I shouldn't. I also am arguably the least liked member of the friend group so that's just peachy. For 4 years this has all been my priority and now it's over. I don't have anything anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say, I'm not fully suicidal, it's not that I want to die, it's that I don't want to be alive. I really just wish I could simply freeze the world and remove myself from it, and then have the world just continue on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm bad at actual school while everyone around me gets great grades, I'm going to college and my roomate is getting thousands to go to the school whereas I can't get a single scholarship. I have no motivation anymore while my friends get extra credit for how good they are in class.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any extra-curriculars left, I, again, annoy my friends, I'm not good at anything, I hate my job so much I've legitimately considered wrecking my car so I don't have to go in for my shift but I can't quit because I need money and have been denied every other job I've applied for. I know it's stereotypical to say I've got nothing but I legitimately have nothing, there's nothing in my life that motivates me or makes me want to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

Failing the way I did in the one thing in life I had just broke me, it's been nearly 1-3 weeks (depending on how you count it, it's complicated) and I have not recovered, I've just gotten worse. I sit in class and can only picture that failure, I try to do my homework and there's just no point. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I want is the ""take a deep breath"" advice, it just doesn't work for me, my depression is and always has been constant, it never goes away, it's with me constantly, anti-depressants haven't worked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what I'm looking for because I don't know if anything can help. I just don't care anymore, the only reason I didn't kill myself earlier this week when I was next to a bridge was because I just really want to see how game of thrones ends, so that's a thing I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

11," 

I feel like I’m a character or a bit that I have to do in front of people. Whenever someone comes around it’s like I change into a character. I spend all my time alone rehearsing basically. I’m so consumed with what other people think that’s it’s sick. I hate it. I’m so empty and worthless inside and part of me wants people to see that so I can stop playing this stupid character. But another part of me wants to become the character. He’s a funny and nice guy why can’t I be like him. But I’m not. I also wish I had someone to share my feelings with. Seeing couples makes me mad. I hate that about myself, I should be happy seeing people in love, but no I hate it. I resent others happiness. I wish I didn’t.

The only thing I put mental effort into anymore is drugs. Drugs help me escape my worthless reality, as cliche as it sounds. Everyone in my life gets so mad when I do drugs. They don’t understand that it’s the only thing that makes me happy anymore. Which sounds stupid, I know. I should have more to live for than drugs. But honestly… I don’t. I spend all my money on it and I just pray my parents don’t find it. Why am I so worthless? Also, why is this world full of people who are worth more than me?

13,"Apologies if this isn't the subreddit I need, but it felt like the most appropriate.
I've always been a private person, but a bit of a joker in public. I suppose to deflect people from what's really going on in my head. But, I finally cracked. Recently a girl I REALLY liked rejected me. I wish it was a simple as ""I don't see you that way"" but it was worse. Apparently, she kept me around because she didn't think another guy she liked liked her. I guess she must of got the green light from him because here I am! What also stung me was the fact for the first time in years (I do mean YEARS) I thought I found someone who ""got"" me. We shared the same interests, had similar views even work in the same industry. She even said to me that she wasn't looking at other guys. Gave me the impression she wanted to give me a fair shot.
I realise this sounds like I'm randomly venting, but I'm trying to paint the picture of how hard this has hit me. It seemed like all the stars were aligned. ""This is IT, Chuck! You've finally met someone you can ACTUALLY relate to! And she likes you, as well!"". As such, I've gone back to being the introverted, private person.....only this time, there's no joker. I've lost my passion for anything, life seems meaningless and there's nothing on the horizon I'm even remotely interested in. I've been in this funk for years and the idea of this girl liking me started to bring me out of my shell. People even commented on how I'd changed for the better. But, now I fear, I've made things worse. I don't have the energy or the will to get out of this funk. What's the point? I feel like a round peg in a world full of square holes. And for those, reading this post, I get that I sound like a depressed teenager, really I do. But these feelings never really left me since my teenage years. I'm 40 and I still can't figure out why I can't be happy. Why can't someone love me? What did I do in a previous life? It's very easy to spout cliches like ""You have to forgive yourself"" or ""It'll happen when you least expect it"", because none of it is true. People see what they want to see.

16,"I bounce between suicidal as my ultimate trump card, and leaving everything in my current life behind - the latter is where I'm at.

I have had most everything packed in my car for a while now, it's mostly camping gear. Backpack and go-bag have been packed for a few months now, ready to go whenever. I have a checklist of steps to take if I have some time before bailing on everything (nothing that would be 100% needed, so I could still leave on a dime if necessary). Previously this idea has always been just picking a direction and driving. As of today, I now have a destination. Not sharing that here, my paranoia tells me I could still be traced down to who I am if anyone in my personal life chose to dig into my remaining online personas.

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I am severely codependent and without someone literally at my side or readily accessible, I cannot stand on my own. I've been a serial monogamist for much over a decade now and have little sense of self outside of relationships. I have a small support group that is reactionary only, if I were to call in a panic-state, they would be there. Some respond quickly via text, too. But none reach out on their own. I get people have lives, I just don't think I'm built to survive on my own.

which seems ironic considering one of my trump cards is to up and cut off all contact from everyone. I guess I want to throw myself into the fire and see what happens. Force myself into a situation of survival. I'm not terrible  at surviving out and about via my past wilderness endeavors, I'd certainly have a lot to learn. and I think isolation and ridding my negative aura from those I care about &amp; wish for their validation, would be beneficial albeit very sad.

I just don't know what to do anymore except run. I'm in a rough cycle currently from relationships &amp; the inevitable fallouts, and I'm tired of it. something needs to change and I've been at this for YEARS. No one is actively in my corner, helping me. I feel like I'm mashing the panic button and nothing is happening. No one's saying oh shit, he's finally tipping. I'm sure plenty will regret not taking action after-the-fact but that is my entire point. No one is next to me. and when I am allowed to be off on my own, these are the things I start thinking of.

I don't know. I have a meeting to get to now.",19Apr2019,1
17,"My ex (26f) split up with me in November. She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in August. She had obviously struggled for a while but she really folded in to herself from August onwards - barely wanted to see me, had no energy to do stuff she likes, really struggled to be honest. Whilst together she had a drastic drop in interest in sex which caused us issues but otherwise we were perfect. Obviously this was the depression but we never knew this for months and so sadly it continued to cause arguments even after her diagnosis. That must have been shit for her but I just didn't understand. When we split I spent a couple of weeks desperately chasing her and acting stupid. She said it was done and she felt so much better etc. Over December and Xmas we barely spoke except bumping into each other at work (we work together) In the new year I saw her and asked her for coffee. She agreed. I went over and she was crying about missing me and liking me etc. We ended up meeting up a bit including a cinema date. Then out of the blue she said she couldn't do it anymore. I pressured her a bit asking what was going etc and this stressed her and just made her kind of close up. She said we needed to stop talking which I argued against initially but then accepted it and decided to try and move on and let her be. Over a few weeks we had minimal contact but a couple of times I bumped into her and she asked me to go a walk, I told her I couldn't but was still polite. After a month or so of this she asked me again and I said ok. I visited her and she was very upset again about missing me, liking me, wishing it was different and apologising for being difficult. I basically just tried to comfort her. Gradually over a few weeks we met up and done stuff but as it went on she seemed to lose interest again. I felt like it was only ever me suggesting we meet or making the effort to talk. She would be flaky or cancel plans or even ignore me in work. So a few times I asked her what was going on. She just got stressed any time I asked. This kind of continued but we had a lovely night walking her dog and getting pizza followed by another night where we meditated together as I thought this might help her. But then for a fortnight after that she would ignore me again or I would ask her to do stuff and she would say no or cancel plans. Meanwhile she is happy doing stuff with friends etc so I feel like it's just me. I again and up asking her to explain it all but trying to not stress her. She just got stressed and closed up and became difficult to talk to. So a couple of weeks of nothing much then I seen her on Monday, she wasn't being very nice or open with me but eventually she got upset so I tried to comfort her and reassure her. She told me she feels awful still and can't motivate herself to do basic daily tasks. She also picks her toes until they are red raw and bleeding which worries me a bit. I've asked her out a couple of times this week and she has said no and also said we need to stop talking. I asked her if this is for good or what but she doesn't really seem able to have a normal discussion with me without working herself up so it's really hard. In fact she just blocked me on messenger before this. So what do I do? Do I just leave her and move on? Or is her depression making her sabotage everything? I know she will get better but it's impossible getting her to see that. Also She lives 80 miles from home and has no family or friends here. So I worry about her being alone. She is desperate to move home though.

Also should mention that earlier I said we had issues with sex, at no point since we split have we had sex or have I even remotely attempted anything like that. I understand her better now and respect her so tbh I have zero interest in that either.

Any advice welcome!",19Apr2019,2

27,"I'm 17 and in Sixth Form. It's the Easter Holidays and I've been alone for three weeks. My best friend has gone on holiday and won't be back until the first day of the sixth form (and we go to different sixth forms so it's not like I'll see her for a while)  my mum has been at work all the time and my other friends are really active, so I can't really join in with them (I have chronic pain). I’ve been alone in the house for pretty much three weeks. Everyone I know js incredibly busy and I just don't want to do anything. The only time I’ve left the house in the holidays is for a doctors appointment (useless as I have chronic pain and there's nothing they can do about that). Sixth form starts back on Tuesday, but it's not like I talk to many people there either.",19Apr2019,3
28,"(God now that I say it like that I realize how much of my life has been overshadowed by it) I have always been kinda opposed to medication but I am starting to think that maybe I should give it a go. Was there anything, aside from meds, that helped?",19Apr2019,6
29,"This morning I found a dead body when I was walking my dog, and its all I can think about. I'm wanting to go to sleep but the whole morning just keeps repeating in my head and then I start overthinking it. 

I just want to forget about it but I can't and its making me so nervous and anxious. I tried walking my dog this afternoon but had a panic attack because I was so scared of finding another body etc. 

I just want to black it all out but I can't.",19Apr2019,2
30,"so, not too long ago, i joined the US Navy. my dad told me when i ship to boot-camp, im no longer his son. now, i know this girl that i really like and actually was about to ask her on a date but before i could she told us at the table that she really likes this guy at work and is going to ask her out today. now i know, these problems dont sound all that bad, but they really do hurt for some reason. i used to not be depressed, where everything said and done to me never touched my emotions, i used to feel nothing and i loved it, so my question is, how can i get the feeling of nothingness again so this sadness can leave me once and forever?",19Apr2019,1
31," 

(for background information: i'm in my mid 20s, and i live at home with my moms and my brother, and i've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder.)

i don't feel like there's any reasons left for me to hang on to life.nothing to look forward to.i don't even know what i'm looking for by posting this.

but, i can't even figure out how to word a paragraph for it.and i'm only good at making lists, so.here's everything i have the mind to allot right now.

* i can't move away because 1) i am financially entangled (split car payments, and rent that the house relies on, etc) and 2) my mom has repeatedly stated she'd go crazy living with just the other 2.
* no one wants to hire me, so i'm stuck at a job that overwhelms me so much it gives me daily anxiety attacks; i cry out of frustration or stress generally once or twice a day. some days are better than others. some days are worse.
* i'm afraid to talk to my (initially caring) managers about it because i feel like, after my previous health problems and missed work, they either don't believe me, or they're tired of me.
* i just came back from 2 weeks of unpaid medical leave because of a kidney stone. i haven't gotten the bill yet, but who knows if i can even pay it?
* i suffer from anorexia nervosa, but i can never seem to get a handle on it; i've relapsed several times over the past 3 years.
* everyone forgets about me. people stop talking to me mid-conversation. sometimes, my family forgets about me entirely, even when they're going out together or getting/making dinner (which is an Everyone thing in our house.) they forget my birthday.
* no one wants to date me--but, i understand it sort of. (i'm quiet, boring, and sad.) people i catch feelings for either reject me outright or just stop talking to me. someone i've known for 8 years (and dated 4 times) suddenly cut contact with me after not talking for months. the person i've been saying 'i love you' to for the past 1.5 years doesn't even want to be in an actual relationship to me. it all just feels like sweet but empty words.
* one mom is on disability, and my older brother doesn't have a job--he just picks up ""gigs"" maybe once a month. my other mom just quit her job on the spot two days ago, and has just been sitting around watching TV. i'm the only one in the house with a stable job. so, i can't quit.
* my health has never been the best, and i'm honestly just waiting to see when it finally tanks. part of me hopes it's terminal.
* i can't even afford a therapist that i desperately (obviously) need. i know i can talk to my friends, but i don't want to burden them when they already have a lot on their plates. no one wants to talk to somebody that's always bringing up negative or heavy topics. i don't want them to leave me too.
* not even online friends talk to me very much. i'm just kind of Here.
* i'm pretty convinced that the only romantic, lasting relationship i'll ever have is with imaginary characters in a dating sim game. now i can barely play anything with a romance plot because i'll just make myself sad.

i almost went through with it on christmas eve.the only reason i didn't was to keep from ruining christmas for my family.sometimes i wish i did it anyway.

tl;dr i feel trapped and alone in everything, and i feel like it's drowning me, and i want to let it.

edit:  i tried posting this a day ago, but it didn't even show up on the feed lmao.  just my luck!",19Apr2019,16

I am trying to FUCK my Wife's sister. She is 13 but the IQ of a 5 year old and has down syndrome. It has allowed me to French kiss her a bunch of times. I have felt her breast(nice C CUP TITS TO BOAST) and have rubbed her ass while frenching her . NICE CURVES. I have also felt her soft PUSSY FUR and I have put part of my finger in her, but her camel toe is small and tight. . We are going to be alone this weekend for about 5 hours. I want her pussy so bad. I know she is so tight and I would ROCK her world. Any ideas? I really WANT THIS. NEED HER PUSSY BAD. I will use lube as well because I don't want to hurt her too badly. Thanks Family Have a blessed day PS I promise NOT to get her pregnant!!! I JUST KNOW HER SLIT is SO TIGHT AND SMALL!! Can't wait to see the look in her eyes, the moment I POP HER! WOW!\\ This is what love is all about. I explained about making LOVE and how important it is. She has not had love made to her so i have a chance to pop a cherry. I told her that making love is important and she will die before she is 21 if she does not have loved made to her. She is scared and does not want to die. I told her, that if I can make love to hear and keep it a secret she will be fine. I think I got her hook line and sinker! Caring and SHARING while we suffer the burden of taking care of these rejects. God Bless you all",19Apr2019,0
33,"When my anxiety and depression is really bad I have this strange sensation that I can’t quite describe. It’s like experiencing the emotional part of having an itch - though nothing actually itches, and nothing to scratch to relieve it. I call it an itchy soul. Does anyone else know what I’m talking about?",19Apr2019,92
