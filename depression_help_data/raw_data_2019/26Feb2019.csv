0,"Hi y’all. I went to my psychiatrist today and she pretty much said I needed to do inpatient treatment. I’ve never been treated for depression or anxiety, but I know it’s probably for the best. I had made a plan to kill myself and it’s been very dark lately. I’m still freaked out to actually go in though. I’m dealing with trauma from a sexual assault on top of just so much anxiety a depression. First, work is kind of super busy and I don’t feel comfortable leaving during a time like this, second I have a dog and I’m afraid to tell my roommate the situation. I’m just really scared. For those of you who have checked in how was it? Are these feelings normal?",26Feb2019,1

2,"I'm not looking for help, this isn't going to ruin me, I just really want to share this. For awhile I've always wanted to live in a world were movies, tv shows, and video games were real. I would always get sad when I realize that that will never happen. First it was Pokemon. Then Adventure Time. Also, I always wanted to go back in time and live in the mediaeval times, with knights, dragons, no internet or anything, inventions to be made. Recently I saw How to Train Your Dragon 3, and it was very good, but after the movie. I became really sad, more than ever, because I very much would love to live in a world like that, vikings, dragons, battles. I'm a big animal lover and seeing Hiccup's relationship with Toothless was adorable. But I know I will always live in this gray and boring world. Thanks God, couldn't given us anything cooler? That is what drove me to post this, and this kind of helped. Thanks for listening.",26Feb2019,7
3,"I was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows",26Feb2019,5
4,"So where to begin. 30/M, healthcare professional, only child, 3.8 GPA student in school, and for at least 10 years I've been taking 5-HTP ever since discovering it ""fixed"" my issues. This is the only form of self-medicating that I do. I usually take 100 mg at night with B-vitamins.

Not sure if this is depression, anxiety, or bipolar, but I get into these mood swings / ruts where I don't really want to do anything except for sit there. Here's one example: My wife and I are discussing where we want to eat dinner, we can't choose and I get into this ""mood"" internally where I just decide I don't want to pick where we are going, and I think it's better off to just sit at home in the dark, or by myself looking at my phone. Eventually internally I feel bad about what I did, but then I feel too proud to change my answer and pick something until it's too late, or we're talking an hour or two later. This does not happen every time, but lets say once every month. 

Another example. When I go home to visit my parents on the weekend, my mom or dad could say one thing to set me off, and I just get internally conflicted and my mood just snaps from good to bad. I just want to leave. I can't really explain it, but I just want to stop talking to them and just leave and go back home. I never act on this mood with anger or physical abuse ever, but it comes off as depressed or sad on the outside. I feel more withdrawn lately. This weather in the Midwest has been very depressing. I just switched my hours recently to 4 x 10 hour days and at the end of the day I just want to be alone. 

Lately its been harder and harder for me to make a decision when it comes to my own life. I can gladly make decisions for others, quick ones if that (working in acute healthcare), but even something as simple as picking a white or black iPhone has become challenging for me. Something like living with those consequences. What will hold up better over time? I got black last time, do I want to change or get the same thing again? etc etc... simple meaningless things like this give me anxiety.

Big decisions, healthcare, financial decisions, etc are completely fine for me. These small insignificant things are torturous. 

I guess my biggest concern are these mood swings though. I don't know how to stop them from happening, and not emotionally self-harm. Is it as easy as ""I just need to forgive and forget"" and start over, and everything will be better? Is there something deeper that I need medication for? There are so many questions that I have about this, I'm surprised it took me almost 10 years to actually post about this on a message board. ",26Feb2019,3
5,"Ive been passively suicidal for quite a while but for example at school everybody jokes about depression and suicide and I laugh it off but I don’t know what to do I score well in school but I feel empty and worthless and it doesn’t help that I am always made fun of for being overweight. I have also lost interest im many things I used to find fun I used to love theme parks and waterparks but with all the fat jokes I feel like every time I do something I will be made fun of. I don’t like my appearance so I never take off my jacket at school because it I think it makes me look normal, there is also the constant talk about relationships and I feel like I might be gay or bisexual but everyone makes fun of anybody that isn’t straight. Whenever there is a presentation or speech that I have to give I get anxious and feel like everybody is judging me and that they are saying the worst things possible. Im sorry if this was long but I really needed to tell someone.",26Feb2019,3

7,"I'm a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, I doubt anyone thinks of me. I know this story has been told a thousand times by thousands of people before me, and thousands of people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or at-least, something I could do to help myself.

Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \[X\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this.

9,"Yesterday someone emotionally scarred and hurt me with his words. I think I cried for almost 12 hours. I managed to sleep for 1 hour before classes and  I kept going to the toilet due to this crying. Right now, I am crying for almost 1 hour something. I didn't eat yet since last night. I know it is self destructing. I just wanted this crying to stop. I don't have any medications as I am always afraid of the clinics. I have the urge to go but this crying....

13,"I had a procedure done incorrectly a couple of years ago, it deformed part of my body and I became very depressed. I finally forced myself to see a plastic surgeon a few months ago and they are telling me that they can improve the area with a fat graft. The problem is I am very thin and they would have to take fat from my thighs. I’m really scared and having trouble trusting that this procedure will turn out ok given that the last doctor performed a procedure recklessly and lied to me about the risks before it started. I’m so terrified that it won’t fix the problem and will cause a new defect on my thighs. I don’t have many support people because I lost most of my friends over the last couple of years and I am too embarrassed to tell most people what happened. I have a high stress demanding job that I am trying to keep. I also have been facing a permanent injury that causes frequent discomfort and loss of ability to easily stay active over the last 6 or so years. I’m still kind of young (28), but this has robbed me of so much. I’m so exhausted and scared. I don’t want to have this surgery but I don’t really have another option. I don’t wanna lose my job but I don’t know if I can keep working with all this stress. If I didn’t work I’m worried I would be really suicidal because I don’t have much else in my life anymore and I have worked so hard to keep my job throughout all these stressful events. Sometimes I am so tired and overwhelmed, and feel like I’ve lost so much already, that I just want to die. ",26Feb2019,8
14,"uhhhhmm okay disclaimer: I'm sorry if I wasted your time if you read but I feel that this is probably my fault.... um so sorry in advanced but I just need like others to re-evaluate my thoughts so that I don't overthink things like I am rn.

So, I am kind of confused on what to do / think because this was my first therapy session and you know hearing the words ""you're not depressed"" really hurt me in some way especially since I feel like I am and have been for many years now. Most of which I was unaware because I'm still young-ish / ignorant (I'm 16)and this is new information I'm receiving / learning all by myself. uhh anyways, less than a week ago i saw a therapist / psychiatrist (can't quite remember their specific profession)  for the first time and i told him about how i hate myself, how i hate my body, told him how i hate my life, i hate the way i talk, i hate the way i act, i hate everything about myself, told him about minor family issues, told him about social and family pressures, told him about issues regarding friends, school stress, how i'm always negative and expect the worst out of things. BUT he says I'm not depressed. He seemed to excuse things as ""i'm a teenager and all teens go through this phase of feeling sad"". he excused my self-hatred as being self-conscious and that its an easy thing to fix. And idk, I just think that doesn't feel right. and I feel like for the most part, this is my fault. maybe I didn't provide enough information or didn't open myself up that much to really ""diagnose"" me with anything. I must admit, I wasn't too comfortable in regard of speaking with a stranger, so I guess thats why I didn't go too much in depth in regards of how I really feel. I also maybe sugar-coated or lied about some serious things that may have been better to actually talk about but I feel like my problem is that I don't want others to worry, especially my parents. And I felt this way because the psychiatrist I saw was a work colleague for both my parents (they are all from the same work place) and I feel like my parents would've discussed things that i'm not ready for them to know about. (I'm aware all things said are confidential and what not and that he needs my permission to speak to them) but there was just this feeling of uncertainty and doubt. Um yeah, so I must agree that lying to him wasn't an ideal thing to do. but yeah, this has been on my mind all week and I just feel stupid. It makes me think that i'm being too sensitive and that i'm stupid or dumb for being sad and feeling lonely all the time for nothing especially when a trained professional says that i'm not depressed. I just hate myself even more. ",26Feb2019,1

16,"So yeah we've only been together for 6 months but it's kinda hard for me to see my girlfriend suffer from depression, this clings to her almost every night after we got home from school/date, she tells me that she feels empty, and wanted to be alone,  and to my part i really wanna help her at least lessen her negative emotions but no matter what i do i just get pushed back , i know she doesn't mean it and this is in fact the symptoms of a depressed person, she often shut herself out from everyone and this gets me worried because i'm scared that she might end up taking her own life. this is making me frustrated, i love her and i'd do anything to make her feel at least a little better, i always make sure that i show her i care every single moment, but there are times that she just can't deal with anyone or anything at all and just disappears for a day or too, and for a person like me that has anxiety it makes me terrified not hearing from her, i get paranoid and stressed to the point i cant eat or sleep and just constantly think about her every second.",26Feb2019,6

I'm physically healthier than I've ever been.

20,"I’ve had depression since I was 13 (28F). I’m on an antidepressant that is pretty successful at regulating my moods, but my memory is all messed up. I can’t remember some conversations we’ve had, and she gets very frustrated with me. I don’t blame her, as I have an easy time seeing all my faults. This morning she saw that I forgot to get gas on my way home last night. She said to me “what will you do at a job if you can’t problem solve or critically think?” This really hurt, guys. But I see her point. Despite the fact that I have a college degree, have been successful at many jobs in my adult life, and am constantly trying to work on myself. I go to school full time studying robotics, which is a whole new language in itself. I work part-time at night cleaning a bank. 

I'm stressed out. I know that she is stressed out too. I'm not trying to make excuses for myself, but I feel like my explanation is reasonable. 

My go-to action when my depression kicks up is crying. I've been called a Cry Baby my entire life, ever since preschool. This is something I have tried to change, to no avail. My wife doesn't cry, hardly ever. Her go-to reaction when she gets frustrated is yelling.

The yelling makes me cry, the crying frustrates her more, because then she feels like she can't vent to me. This leads to her shutting down with the words ”well I guess I just have to keep my mouth shut and keep everything to myself then”

This is not my goal. Of course, I want an open, honest relationship. I just don't know how not to be so sensitive.",26Feb2019,1

24, This is my journey with depression [https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com](https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com/) ,26Feb2019,1
25,Not posting this from my main account for obvious reasons,26Feb2019,1
26,"I'm writing this because I need help to understand what i'm suffering of. And I guess that u will ask why I don't go to some kuind of therapist, its because I can't since everytime I try to engage a conversation about it, I either get to stressed to actually talk about it or someone in my familly comes around and say how stupid I am to think I have depression.

Im now gonna try to describe wat I feel (or more what a have to go through ) :

Im 18,male and lives in eu

Ive never been the social type of guy, when I was young ( kindergarden and all )I didnt had any friends till the end of elemntary school. At this point I began to stay with the nerdy kids and it was pretty sweet( when we didnt got bullied). When I got into secondary school i began to exercice heavelly to be more popular ( yes I was stupid), and I never stopped ,going from Jiu-Jitsu to bodybuilding/powerlifting. 

I've never been able to open my self to anyone even when I had the occasion ( causing major anger problem and violence rage when I was being really stressed), thats why in my familly nobody really knows anything about me appart from me being an iron addict and an ""artist"" (I dont know how to call myself, I just love drawing and art in general). They dont know anything about my love life and if I ever had a girlfriend( wich I haven't).

I woudnt describe myself as ugly but I never had the occasion to have any kind of relationship since everytime I get near to get a girl I get unintrested and remember I dont really feel anything for the girl( I only feel exitment when I flirt and thats all).I dream of finding someone who's gonna make me finally fell something.

 And I dont know why but Im really good at understanding what the others feel ( Im not like feeling pitty when theyr sad or anything tho, I just see really fast the way someone feel.

As I said before I do exercice a lot , like at least 2-3 hour a day even if Im over trainning because its the only thing that make me feel something. And when I dont train I mostly think about it ( like all day) and if I wasn't living in the familly house I would be thinkikg about what I would be going to cook to reach maximum protein intake. I suffer from biggorexia , or at least im pretty sure i do since I never feel big enough and always feel small compared to others ( Im 1m83 {72 inch} and 90 kilos{198 pounds}). Ive become addicted to the feeling of pressure and the pain of the weight , and soreness is a feeling Im dreaming of getting (since I train so much my muscles dont really get sore anymore ).

When Im with a group I mostly hide my ""sadness"" ( if I may call it like that , I dont even know it is ,its just like emptyness all the time). And most of the time I seem really happy but I aint. I never stay happy or sad , It can change a thosen time a day but its only on the inside ( since Im a fucking Iceblock, and cannot express any real emotions with my face appart from all the acting). Oh, also I can't cry , no mater how hard I try.

I mostly really feel the ""primals"" emotions only, like anger or thing like that.

Also when ever I try to express my feelings, I dont know why I seem angry to the others (I mean that they think I am) so my parents always get mad at me for being ""rude"" to the other family members.

That's all I can think of, sorry if I made any grammatical errors and if its a bit unorganised but its my first time writing down my feelings and all that shit. If u have any questions or precisions u need, feel free to ask in the comments( I may be realy in a bad stat but Im a pretty sweet guy). Also if u think u know what is my problem tell me please...",26Feb2019,1

As the headline says I’ve contemplated suicide in one form or another since I was very young. I’m now 37 and the feeling is stronger than ever. 
I’ve never felt I belong anywhere and I seem to always self sabotage my life to the point where I throw away perfectly good opportunities to improve my situation. I don’t know what wrong with me.
I grew up in Egypt, the son of mixed parents, my mum was Greek/Egyptian and my dad is Danish/Egyptian. I went to an American school where all the American expats in Egypt sent their kids so I never really fit in or was accepted as I wasn’t American. I also didn’t fit in with other Egyptians as my Arabic isn’t great (English was my first language) and I can’t read or write Arabic, only speak it. 
I got into some trouble in Egypt when I was a teenager during the old Mubarak regime ( because I looked and behaved like a westerner, the police would arrest me and beat me till my dad would come and pay a bribe to get me out ) so I left when I was 16 and came to the UK and sought asylum. 
That was granted to me after 10 years, but as you can imagine, being an immigrant means you will never really be accepted as part of that country by a lot of people. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve met some loving people here but I’ve also met some horrid people who only judge you by the fact that you’re a foreigner and an immigrant. 
To cut a long story short, I’ve never felt accepted. Not by my ‘own’ people. Not by people here. 
I feel I’ve carried that with me all my life and it’s affected every relationship I’ve ever been in. 
I use to want acceptance so badly. I learnt to play guitar and sing so people would accept me. I started a band and thought that would fix me and make me happy, but again, at every turn or opportunity I would self sabotage myself in some way or another and needless to say, it never amounted to anything. 
I had a daughter at 27 and she’s now 9. Me and her mother have long since split up but my daughter is literally the only thing that’s stopping me from ending this shit. 
I’ve fucked every job I’ve ever had, every opportunity to make something of myself, everything. 
I’m now in a relationship that I thought would be the one that would see me through till the end but even this one is starting to fall apart.

I’m so sorry I’m rambling. I don’t know where to begin. I’ve never written out any of this before and it’s just flooding out. 
I always thought that I should just shut up and stop being such a pussy and get on with it. Man up and lose myself in work or some other distraction until the feeling passes. That’s always worked in the past, but it’s not working anymore. 
I can’t find the motivation to do anything. I’m overweight, my job doesn’t pay enough for me to survive on. I live at my partners house and I’m well aware that she holds all the cards when it comes to whether I have a roof over my head or not.
I know there’s a lot I need to sort out but it’s so overwhelming sometimes I just freeze up and do nothing.

So now I’m here. I don’t know what I’m expecting from writing all this out. Probably nothing will come of it, but I thought I’d give it a try. 
I really don’t know what else to do.",26Feb2019,12
29,Last year I lost an extremely close friend to suicide. He had struggled with a Keaton addiction for three years before he died. When he died last year I didn’t think about it. Pushed it out of my mind and kept on throughout the day. Recently near the anniversary or his death I got in contact with his mom and started reminiscing. Maybe to much because I like started having shitty thoughts. It’s literally the worst I have to pretend to be happy around my friends and shit I don’t know wtf is wrong with me man. It’s literally fucked I can’t function in social scenarios anymore I just put my head down and walk past. I push like all my friends away and it’s just what is going on. ,26Feb2019,1

Im a 24 year old guy and pretty much got what i wanted in life, but why do i feel so empty ?? i dont understand why i do what i do, and i feel like im faking being ""happy/okey, and im not. im not alone but it feels like it.",26Feb2019,1
32,"Hi, i am 16 right now and i am playing rugby in high school, I have been a position called scrum half for the past 2 years in the school. Today someone told me that there is a kid from grade 10 who played rugby last year in junior high is really good and insane, he might be taking over my position. I am a bit nervous that i will lost my play time because of it. But the coach told me last year that he won't change the scrum half and the fly half since we are a great combo, but still......... i am really nervous about that kid, i love this position and i enjoy it a lot, help?",26Feb2019,1
33,"I’m terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but I don’t see life as something precious or valuable. All I see is suffering and endless hopelessness. I am losing interest in everything and I can feel myself slipping away. It’s been like this for so long I don’t know what happiness feels like and I spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. I’m so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. School on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. I’m scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. Even then though, I’d have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isn’t anything to be happy about. And it hurts because I can’t escape it. No matter how many nights I spend trying to cry the pain away it’s still there. I have no motivation to really change my life either though, I physically can’t force myself no matter how much I want to, to do anything productive. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, does anybody know what to do? I’m overflowed with these feelings and I can’t help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if I know it’s not going to help in the end. I’m just done and I can’t keep up with school or my relationships anymore. I need some advice on what to do :(",26Feb2019,47
