1,"I’m 19, im not in college, I’m depressed, I have anxiety, and I’m so tired of trying to find a way to be happy. 

I try so hard. I go to the doctor, I’m trying a new med because the last never worked. I tried a psychologist. I read every book I can find about finding yourself and inner happiness. I meditate, I’m spiritually involved. 

I’m just tired. I feel like I’m not moving forward. I’m in a shitty living situation, with friends I can’t talk to about this seriously and family that means well but doesn’t understand. 

I don’t know what to do. I want life to get better, but I’m tired and angry at myself because im not going anywhere. If this is 19, I’m not sure how much more I want to see. 

I’d love advice, anything you have. I’m out of ideas.",12Jul2019,2
2,"i think ill be okay, except for one thing. locker room. in junior high i changed in the bathroom stall everyday for two years. ive always been the weird girl that changes in the bathroom. i dont want to change in a stall all throughout highschool. but in terrified if changing in front of the other girls because 1, im fat and ugly and gross and dont want anyone to see 2, i have self harm scars on my arms and dont want people to know 3, im a lesbian and i dont want to accidentally stare at them. its terrifying and i might have to wear a tank too every day. just help me. i feel like my only hope is to lose weight before then. i have anorexia and i know its not good but i am actually overweight and i only need to lose like 7 to 10 lbs. im just so stressed iut and so scared",12Jul2019,4
3,im sorry but i have this pain inside me I can't handle it anymore .. I don't know how to describe it but it's so fuck*d up .. I don't want to feel like this anymore i can't take it it's so painful ..,12Jul2019,2
4,Tomorrow is my birthday and I’ve done nothing but manage to fuck up everything good in my life. My birthday haven’t even officially started and I already am regretting my existence. This probably won’t get seen but I just need a space to vent before I go Insane. I’ve just been so bored and done with life. I have relatively no close friends besides my dogs and my exbest friend who I used to date and she left me earlier this year and also had just stopped talking to me all together won’t even be bothered to unblock me to say happy birthday. Now I didn’t come here to get pity but rather Im looking to find some hopeful positive outlooks and maybe a friend or two. Something to give me hope that my life isn’t a mistake. Btw I have aspergers and so being social isn’t my strong suit.,12Jul2019,22
5,"I don't know how to start this. 

Long time problems with Depression. I am a 36 old man who spent most of my life severely depressed and closed up. I used to be a very happy kid, late teens I fell into a bad bout of depression thanks to relationship issues that lasted until about 30, I was able to dig out but after a difficult event forcefully and the underlying sadness has never left. I have been in therapy before and it never helped much. I'm from a smaller town and the only therapists available were male. Well, when I was about eight I was sexually taken advantage of by another male and I just am uncomfortable talking to men, I can never open up... Its damaged my relationships and self worth most of my life. I have talk to people before but its caused those to push away, and I now have few close friends and don't dare talk to them anymore. Even spending time with others is hard, I don't even want to be around me why would they.. Recent events have cause me to slip even farther and I don't have anyone to help me through this.  I feel empty to my core, and its already started to hurt my work and the already few relationships I have left. Therapy has been a waste of money and time but I am in dire need of someone to talk to.",12Jul2019,1
6,"Long story short, I have always been awkward, and recently was dumped by my now ex girlfriend of 4 months. It was not long, but my first relationship so I'm not taking it well 3 months later. She had social anxiety, so there was always a little awkwardness, but that was when I first was exposed to it knowingly. Looking at the symptoms of it now, I believe I have social anxiety. I went to my schools health and counseling center (I'm M21 btw) because my mom said I was noticeably sad and not myself. It started out talking about the breakup the first couple sessions, but then I brought up the social anxiety thoughts and my fears of never finding someone else again. I have been depressed and struggling with the strong possibility of me having social anxiety for a few months now and want to go see a doctor and see if I'm diagnosed with it so I could start treating it more professionally or take medication. But how do I tell my mom about it? I dont normally tell her or talk to her about feelings or stuff this serious and I'm worried how she might react to it or she will try and talk feelings out like that with me more often, and I'm not super comfortable with that (maybe because of anxiety reasons). But I want to feel better.",12Jul2019,1
7,"Recently discovered husband of nearly 19 years is having an affair. This plus his behavior towards me has sent my already bad depression spiraling out of control.
Im trying to deal with so much all at once right now.

 The person i should be able to turn to, isn't there for me because he's busy being there for the person he's having the affair with. He doesn't believe my depression is real. But the person he's been with, hers is real because it's hers. What a slap in my face.

He is moving to another state eventually, and I'm trying to wait it out so I have a roof over my head and my pet's heads. 

I'm close to giving up because I'm tired of the pain. 
My healthcare fell apart, and I'm trying to figure out a way to get it going again. I'm without therapy and medicine for my depression, and those things were vital to me even being able to somewhat function some days. Nothing is improving.  It only is getting worse. I just want it to stop.",12Jul2019,1
10,"It feels like I'm trapped within never-ending walls.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start. I've been reading reddit threads these last two days as my latest short-term obsession while trying not to break down. So it's all rambling, as my thoughts are in disarray. I feel like I should be doing 10000 things to feel better while doing none of them. I just need to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been years now that I feel like can't do anything. I almost wrote that I can't do anything, but I'm doing my best to address the negative thoughts about myself instead of affirming them. Since I started college, I haven't been able to finish one semester without failing either some or all classes. My last try was last autumn. I've also had anxiety breakdowns that made me lose a job, and I haven't been able to maintain one since then, or even get over my anxiety to job-search. I long to leave my parents' nest (I'm in my early twenties), but I have no income and pretty much survive on theirs, which is far (far far far) from what I'd like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so tired of my own apathy and stagnation. I've spent winter through spring in a depressive state. Two new elements have recently brought me in a seemingly brighter path. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and started better understanding my difficulties in school and in life. I've also discovered a passion for web development and started online education that fit better my needs than in-person university. I somehow thought that depression was past me. I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that's difficult is that I am not alone in that state. My partner is going through something similar, and we see each other pretty much 24h/7. And we're very isolated. TBH, the isolation kind of started when we began dating, a little over a year ago, with the honeymoon bubble. We were friends before dating, and our relationship quickly became intense and long-term. Then, some contexts within which we saw some friends faded away, and both of us had anxiety and depressive symptoms that made it more and more difficult to reach out. She recently got diagnosed with a chronic illness that has deteriorated her mental health, intensified the isolation (because of flare ups) and put her in a similar situation as I found myself, in that she's had to drop classes and stop working.

&amp;#x200B;

She now falls asleep around 8-9 am and sleeps through most of the day. I try towards maybe 5 pm to fall asleep. Even though I officially live at my parents, I haven't slept there I over a month. A main reason is that I'm stressed that my parents get anxious over my mental health and my ways to cope (ordering food, staying in bed, etc.) as they express their concern in ways that can increase my anxiety (something I often talk about in therapy) while my partner and her roommates are of course understanding. They still can be very supportive, but the thought of risking another confrontation where I get emotional and their only answer is ""CALM DOWN"" is making me more and more anxious right now. I've still talked to both my partner and my therapist about coming back to my parents' for a little while, and told them that I'd still try as it might still be worth it to at least see how it feels to get some distance from my partner. It's been days now that I've said that and I can't get myself to do it. I can't get myself to cook myself some food. Or do a wash of laundry. Or continue my online classes that once felt almost like an obsession.

&amp;#x200B;

It brings me to today, when I realized how I'm back into a depressive state. These last days, or weeks - who knows, my working memory and perception of time are out of whack - I've felt like I'm going against the current, trying to be okay, while trying to accept that I'm still not okay, and how the overall situation is affecting me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good therapist, at least. And I'm incredibly lucky for my parents' support. They've learned a lot about mental health, even if they're still sometimes limited in their ability to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, right now, I feel stuck.",12Jul2019,1
11,"(I am currently in therapy) I just cannot get over my fear or distrust of my therapist. I know she’s a good one, but for the life of me I can’t open up. I become silent at any terrorizing question, but joyed when we can talk about useless shit. I hate everything about it I can never get sleep the night before an appointment, they fill me with anxiety.

12,"I’m too exhausted to even type this. I’m sorry I don’t have enough Karma, I just never have enough gumption to post and I migrate accounts often for feeling like I’ve messed up.

These past few weeks have been tough. I’ve been bottling it all in and I’m just so tired. I’ve noticed signs of depression through an increase in sensitivity, time spent crying which went from nothing to suddenly tearing up at night.. I’ve noticed myself being unable to clean my room or find energy to go work out, and I either sleep too long and feel guilty or spend all night awake exhausted but unable to sleep. I’m so tired. I can’t do anything, I can’t even hang around my friends because it feels like they hate me or I’m not good enough. I either try to starve myself to feel the pain of hunger or overeat to get rid of the pain. I have no one to talk to. I feel guilty and I’m not diagnosed so I’m wondering if I’m just faking it, but I’m too scared to bring it up to my doctor because last time she brushed it aside.

I can’t talk to my parents because one is mad at me and the other thinks I’m dramatic. I don’t know what I want, if anything can someone just please tell me it’ll be ok?",12Jul2019,3

What are your experiences with Wellbutrin?",12Jul2019,1
14,"Hi, i’m Laura. I am a 14 year old girl from the Netherlands.
Lately I've been struggling with depression. I am becoming obsessed with facts and a lot of these facts are about death. I am very smart and I have an fotographic memory so I don’t really forget thinks. My mom thinks my feelings are fading away because of all these facts. I still do have feelings, but I never talk about them, I never show them and no one ever really notices if I’m feeling down. Everyone knows me as the happy kid. I always smile. But it’s never a genuine smile. My mom also thinks, because I read so much, I don’t enjoy life anymore. This is very true. I think that that is the reason why I’m obsessed with the death. I have suicidal thoughts and I want to die. I don’t think I want to kill myselI, but I do want that something bad will happen to me. That I die of a natural cause. This might be a bit weird, but it’s just the way it is. I’m also an introvert. I can overthink everything. I can stare at a wall for hours and just think about life without getting bored. My mom thinks this is weird. She wants me to go to an psychologist. Do you guys think that is a good solution? Does a psychologist really help? And, has someone maybe experienced something like this?

15,"For the past couple months, I've been feeling like there's two personalities in my head, each having their own name and interests of their own. The problem is, I don't feel like I'm there, it's just them having control over me while I watch from the side. I don't want to self-diagnose with any disorders, but going to a therapist or psychiatrist is impossible because I'm a minor and my parents don't believe in the idea of therapy (saying that a therapists's job is to convince you that you're crazy so they can make money). I just want to feel like one person again, and I can't choose between the two personalities because they're both still here. It might be good to include the fact that those two personalities are based on people that I admire and want to become, so I don't know if it's just me being self conscious about my own attitude and interests.",12Jul2019,1

Sometimes I really do think I do because I’m constantly feeling so empty inside and feeling as if i’m so void of life and there’s no purpose in being alive when all it does is make you sad.

20,"Hi. Writing on a throwaway account. Just need a bit of a rant and other peoples perspective. I'm just feeling a bit flat, I don't think I am depressed but I don't know where to post.

(I'm 29) I've been with someone for almost 10 years and no signs of marriage or babies even though we discuss it regularly. I have tried to bring it up as a more serious conversation but just get shut down. All my friends are pregnant/small children/married and I feel so lonely. I have no social life, my relationships with each of my friends have really changed - I knew they would but I'm struggling!

I work in a hospital and people die everyday and its really beginning to get to me. We have had some really young patients recently and I have found myself crying most shifts.

I feel like I am a wasted brain, and doing nothing with my life. I would like to go to Uni and study something interesting but I have financial ties at the moment so unable to not work full time.

I've recently had a massive argument with one parent who never has time for me any more which has been building over the last year or so.

So yeah I just feel flat, lonely and sad!  I don't really know what I want anyone to say. I just wanted to say it.",12Jul2019,1
21,"My depression journey has been like 10 years long now and honestly considering how bad of a shape I was in when I was a late teen/early 20-something, I'm drastically more mentally and emotionally stable these days. I'm semi-functioning but from the way I'm under performing in every way, how little effort I put into my appearance and from how much time I like to spend at home doing nothing indicates that I'm not all there, but compared to my lowest moments I'm doing great!

However, I'm still seriously riddled with apathy. I just don't care, at all. I have no dreams, no aspirations, no goals aside from bettering myself mentally and physically but I have no motivation to really pursue bettering myself unless I'm working out. Working out is the only thing I'm able to plan out and adhere to a regime with. Every potential relationship I run away from, because I fear my partner won't accept the real me.

But I was just hit with this realization today. I ***WANT*** to care. There's nothing more I want than to give at least a complimentary shit about being a Respectable Person with integrity and values, about my education and having a career and getting raises and whatever, and about learning new things. I wish I cared enough to start pursuing the things I feel like I'd want if I was 'healthy' in the head!! I used to care about these things at least but now at 28  I hate how freaking content I feel about having a part-time job as a maid and about barely scraping by, even though I feel really ashamed since my friends and family are accomplishing big things every day, and it embarrasses me to tell them what I'm doing with my life. It's hitting me though that I can't keep doing this forever if I want to keep having food at the table, and from how many romance dramas I watch it's obvious that I crave having a partner at least subconsciously. More friends would be great since I don't really have any close ones.

A big problem with my depression is that a lot of my thoughts and feelings are extremely suppressed and barely there. I'm so jealous of people who get passionate about things. I want to be like that too. How do I let them out and start caring about things again???

Any pointers from my previously depressed folks who managed to somewhat pick themselves up by their boot straps? And please, more practical tips than just telling me to see a therapist or suggesting CBT.",12Jul2019,83
22," My relationship with my mother and Brother is so bad that it literally triggers my depression and suicidal thoughts. After my bf broke up with me (who was my biggest supporter when things got rough) I contacted my family because i felt lonely. Now things are going really bad again so I'm going to stop trying with them because my mental health is getting worse because of it.

If you feel down and need an advice?

Remember these things.

1. Stay calm - for few seconds atlest you must be                    blank, stay away from struggles you are into.
2. Try to Remember your loved ones,  may be your dad or your mom or your pet.
3. Close your eyes take deep breath till you fill comfortable - this will help you to relax.
4. Don't take decisions when you are depressed, just don't take.
5.  If you still panic try mediation - if you wonder what mediation is? It's very  simple - just concentrate on your inhale and exhale. Just do this for sometime.

By now I trust you would be little better , now try to speak to someone you trust.

You can contact me anytime.

I really want to help as many as possible.

I am yoga trainer, just stretching my helping hand.

If anyone found this helpful, please comment. So that others can really take it seriously.

Stay blessed stay happy

I was on SSRIS for 6 months, on and off ive been on them throughout life but since my last long term period of doing them i havent felt the same

Ive always had depression, i was diagnosed at 14 but i dont remember ever feeling right. I have only recently realised how much i seriously need help, i am even phobic that family members are going to sexually assault me even though they never have 

 getting help quite hard in the UK with waiting lists and so as well, they are years long

It took me 2 suicide attempts when i was 14 to get help, at least 2 that landed me in hospital but my mum never could commit to getting up early to take me to the psychologist appointments so i got taken off of their list

I havent spoken to anyone qualified to give me proper help since then, ive genuinely tried to but my doctors keep referring me to this place that is meant to call me but they never do call me. I always get told “thats all we can do” every time i attend

I quit SSRI in february again, i was on zoloft
I didnt feel right or normal, i didnt feel good
I was far more inattentive which i already struggle with, i was still unstable (much less so but it hardly did much good) and it was causing issues in my relationship 

But since being on them and also quitting i feel disconnected from my actions and thoughts and bad things that ive done or have happened to me

I cried once after my nan died at her funeral, i cried once when my cats got taken away from me after spending half of my life with them (though i guess i knew they were going to a better place and a no kill charity and cattery that treats cats well) 
I havent cried since my dad has cut me off again.
 
I long term kept from my partner that i still had feelings for an ex, and i felt a complete disconnection from that huge lie until i admitted to him last night, ive never been one to keep lies in relationships 

Ever since my first relationship when i was 16 i was always honest and felt a moral duty to always be honest to my partner and never abuse their trust

I just dont feel human anymore, i dont feel like myself, i feel disconnected from everything and i feel different to who i used to be.",12Jul2019,4
27,"This post is likely going to be a little disjointed because my head is all over the place...

I (27F) was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder almost a decade ago and have been coping with depressive episodes periodically all my adult life. Various traumas and difficult times in my life always throw me back to dark places that I try to claw my way out of. Recently, my SO lost his job and has become depressive himself, leading to me suddenly becoming the one who has to hold everything together. I am required to go to work for a full-time job, to perform well, to come home and be my SO's cheerleader and job coach, and to do the full housework because he refuses to/can't help. And I am crumbling.

I have been getting into trouble at work because I've been arriving so late (can't get out of bed), now I think I've set up a support system that works to at least get me to the office on time. BUT I can't perform at the office. I have a shit ton of things to do, I'm on deadlines, and all I do is scroll through reddit all day. Today, I've been having a headache all day and feeling dizzy, and my anxiety kept telling me that I was about to have an aneurysm and drop dead any second. Now it's gotten a little better but I am utterly unable to concentrate and do actual work, and it's been like that for weeks. I need to read every email 5 times before I grasp its actual meaning, my attention span is approx. 10 seconds long, and my head keeps telling me ""you can't do this"" and ramping up the anxiety. I surf the internet all day to distract myself from the fear and obviously I'm not getting any work done. 

I am so, so afraid of my ineffectiveness and websurfing being found out and getting fired. I really need this job to keep me and my boyfriend afloat... and he's as much a wreck as I am. At home, I can't talk about my mental health issues because he's feeling even worse and has no understanding for my problems.

I am currently sat in the empty office (it's Friday evening) and almost had an actual breakdown when the cleaning staff arrived because I just desperately need to be alone and need the pressure to go away, my mind keeps spinning in circles of ""I need to do this - but I can't - they will find out - I feel so dizzy ----""

I feel like I'm just developing new disorders on a daily basis, I was recently told I also display symptoms of burn-out, one of them is that I almost started to cry this morning when trying to choose what to wear, or this evening when trying to decide whether or not to take home some of the office flowers that the clean-up crew are about to throw away. I'm also super oversensitive, see: reaction to presence of cleaning staff. I'm stress-eating all the time, thus gaining wait constantly and having all sorts of body-confidence issues... feeling ugly, despairing over that, etc. (I'm currently moving from being ""normal weight"" to ""slightly overweight"", so for any normal person, this probably wouldn't be a huuuge issue).

I have run out of insurance-paid therapy sessions and don't have the money for privately paid ones. I have 2 weeks to go until an appointment with a psychiatrist to possibly get medication. But honestly, I've tried at least 5 different meds and none of them have ever helped, so I'm not holding out much hope that this time will be different.

I am under immense pressure to just ""function"" as a person and I feel like I can't get myself under control. I need to function at the office, I need to function at home, and I need to at least try to be a halfway happy person in the process.

I am also really afraid of ... you know, what's going to become of me? I'm already 27, I am dreaming of becoming a mother, but if I keep performing like this I'll never earn well enough for that to happen and if I keep being such a wreck, how can I take care of a child? I'm one of those people who COULD technically be really successful, but never will be because my mental illness is screwing up my life. And my SO being jobless just makes everything worse; the existential fear, the panic, the frustration after every rejection, the resentment about having to take care of everything all the time... I could write a novel on all the negative feelings I am experiencing on a daily basis.

I am just despairing. Does anyone have any advice??",12Jul2019,1

I am under immense pressure to just ""function"" as a person and I feel like I can't get myself under control. I need to function at the office, I need to function at home, and I need to at least try to be a halfway happy person in the process.

I am also really afraid of ... you know, what's going to become of me? I'm already 27, I am dreaming of becoming a mother, but if I keep performing like this I'll never earn well enough for that to happen and if I keep being such a wreck, how can I take care of a child? I'm one of those people who COULD technically be really successful, but never will be because my mental illness is screwing up my life. And my SO being jobless just makes everything worse; the existential fear, the panic, the frustration after every rejection, the resentment about having to take care of everything all the time... I could write a novel on all the negative feelings I am experiencing on a daily basis.

I am just despairing. Does anyone have any advice??",12Jul2019,8
29,I was doing good when I moved to university. This is my second go around. 23 years old and a few years pretty behind. I don’t know but now I don’t have the same motivation and I can’t get out of bed. When I’m finally up I feel normal again and hate myself for even allowing myself to sleep that late. Some times it’s subconscious and I don’t even realize I turned off all my alarms. I don’t want to sleep my life away.,12Jul2019,6
30,"Okay so I (18F) know I'm a bitch and a bit horrible at times. I'm quite closed off so I don't message people, spend most of my times looking at memes and I can say some pretty mean things that I don't realise can hurt.

I get it, I know i can really hurt people but I am trying. Recently I've come out of the other side, got a full time job which I love and went on my first holiday in spain with my boyfriend, mum and her partner. I do think I am doing better.

But recently my mum has really been nagging me, saying I'm lazy and thoughtless for not messaging or going to see my family since I came off my holiday at 2am, 16 hours ago. After everyone I think I have strengehtned from, she still isn't happy with me especially as I just spent 10 days with her.

As I'm writing this I'm probably sounding like a bitch teen but the contrast harrasment of saying she's disappointed in me and that my priorities are wrong and getting me down again and not sure how to proceed?",12Jul2019,5
31,"So yesterday I've met up for the first time with a psychiatrist. I was meant to start taking my depression meds today. I was prescribed Asentra (Sertaline). I was told that it's a good medication for young people in general, but as I started to read more and more about it, I'm actually even more scared to take it, so that it won't make it worse.

Is it actually that bad? Or what to expect during taking the meds? Was anyone taking it and it improved their condition?",12Jul2019,2
32,"Hi! So I'm still kinda new to this reddit thing (used it once like 3 years ago) but I'm just at a loss of what to do and my friends are getting sick of me complaining so I'm trying to keep everything to myself but am imploding. So on paper I'm doing okay, I'm a full time songwriter living in LA which is what I have wanted since I was a little kid. But I'm here, and LA is crippling me. I honestly didn't think everything was going to be this hard but comparing myself to others has completely ruined me to the point where I just feel so isolated. The worst part is I KNOW what I need to be doing to make myself feel better but I just can't and I'm grappling with the fact that hey maybe I'm just lazy? Does anyone else feel that way? Like I'm such a piece of shit for not getting out of bed? I just feel so low about myself I don't wanna move like I've found comfort in just hating myself. I've been told I have depression by my therapist but why can't I just get out of bed and fix it. I take my meds everyday, I exercise, I try to eat healthy but why isn't it enough? I'm in this spiral of just not feeling good enough for anything so I've just given up and I'm so scared that's what my life is gonna be. Because I am the only one who can fix it and that is terrifying. I'm not sure where I am even going with this, it just feels nice to type it out. If anyone has any advice and has gotten through something similar please let me know, I'll probably be in bed.",12Jul2019,3
33,"Long story short, I have always been awkward, and recently was dumped by my now ex girlfriend of 4 months. It was not long, but my first relationship so I'm not taking it well 3 months later. She had social anxiety, so there was always a little awkwardness, but that was when I first was exposed to it knowingly. Looking at the symptoms of it now, I believe I have social anxiety. I went to my schools health and counseling center (I'm M21 btw) because my mom said I was noticeably sad and not myself. It started out talking about the breakup the first couple sessions, but then I brought up the social anxiety thoughts and my fears of never finding someone else again. I have been depressed and struggling with the strong possibility of me having social anxiety for a few months now and want to go see a doctor and see if I'm diagnosed with it so I could start treating it more professionally or take medication. But how do I tell my mom about it? I dont normally tell her or talk to her about feelings or stuff this serious and I'm worried how she might react to it or she will try and talk feelings out like that with me more often, and I'm not super comfortable with that (maybe because of anxiety reasons). But I want to feel better.",12Jul2019,2
34,Any tips or suggestions on how to deal with the suckiness of poor hygiene? (Mainly not brushing teeth before bed and washing face to take off makeup) I keep makeup wipes by my bed but don’t even have the energy to use those most nights.,12Jul2019,6
35,"I feel lots of shame posting this.

I pretty much live in my partner's room (she lives with roommates). Both of us have depression &amp; anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. We've been very isolated to our room. It's already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, it's more and more cluttered, including boxes of take-out.

Its state affects us very much and though we've tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we haven't been able to do much.

We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skill-trading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but I'm scared of imposing. We don't have that much money either, but honestly we haven't been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like I'm being very lazy doing so. And I'm not sure where to start. Did anyone considered or tried doing something like that? Does it make sense?",12Jul2019,22
36,"I’ve never lost someone this close to me before. It’s hard to tell the difference between my normal depression level and what is added on to that from this loss. It wasn’t a sudden unexpected death, so maybe that made it a little easier. I cried a couple of times thinking about him, but most of the time I’m just depressed like usual. It’s been a couple of weeks now. I’m not really sure if I’ve actually mourned his death. I just feel empty inside, but that’s my normal state.",12Jul2019,69
37,"I often think about suicide but don’t think I would ever go through with it. But I frequently think about ways to kill myself and how easy or painful it would be, but I don’t think I could actually bring myself to do it. Should I talk to a doctor about this or is this nothing to be worried about.",12Jul2019,13
38,"So for some reason my dad(step-dad) just absolutely loves telling me ""your not special"" lately. Its really stupid of him, like for example, yesterday we were going somewhere and he came in my room and said its time to go. Okay. No problem. So i get up from my piano, and put my phone in my pocket. And as were walking out the door he goes ""oh put your phone up, your not special."" In such a demeaning tone, that i just responded ""yea ik. I never said i was."" And he just gave me a shitty look. There's been more times. And lately its started to get to me. Idk what to do..",12Jul2019,15
