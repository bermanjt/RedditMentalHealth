1,I was seriously suicidal a few months ago but now I want to live. But every once in a while whenever I am in a really stressful situation I think that I really want to kill myself. Or when I almost have a panic attack and my fight or flight response kicks in. Now I am not really serious about it but the thought provides some relief or some promise that I can quit anytime.,27Apr2019,1

3,"It feels stupid to write this, but im scared of getting help and it feels like every time i am ignored because i am a female, or im told everyone my age experiences it. I am 14 years old, but i have felt horribly depressed all my life, i experience almost all of the signs you can list and its effecting me badly.

I have suicidal thoughts nearly every night and am constantly on the edge of crying 24/7. I am always extremely tired, sometimes to the point i cant keep my eyes open any longer and i feel like i cant concentrate on anything anyone is saying without spacing out or not taking it in. My thoughts are always running wild about everything and i often feel completely helpless, and that my future is full of failures and misery, im constantly counting down to the next horrible thing that will happen to me. 

Ive also felt like ive had a social anxiety disorder for a while, maybe around 3 years, and for the first time in all those years i recently decided to open up to a friend who recommended i talk with my mum, and i briefly did so she booked me in with a gp, but i was not diagnosed. However i am persistent and i know theres something wrong. I didn't talk about my experiences to my mum before going into the appt, and the gp hardly asked me any questions other than ""how are her grades"" or ""how is her sleep schedule"" to which my mum replied with bad answers which felt like lies. I didn't want to open my mouth because i was scared.

i only wanted to really get diagnosed because i have an important speaking exam the following week and im desperately trying to find a way to avoid much of the suffering of it, like doing it infront of a small group of close friends instead. Since i wasnt diagnosed i feel stupid and delusional, im not really sure about whats wrong with me now that its happened.

But either way theres a problem and this anxiety and constant stress is making me feel suicidal more than before, im thinking of doing things because i feel so desperate for attention. It feels like whenever i try to reach out no one cares. Ive even taken a week to pluck up the courage to speak to a teacher who deals with these issues, and told her i felt anxious about most of my lessons, but she lied to me saying they werent giving out exit passes and that she would email my teachers. She never did. Ive gotten my mum to ring up for me twice since i struggle speaking to people and since then its been forgotten about. And now consulting a professional. None of it has helped me.

I feel this way about a lot of things. I am quite attention seeking in subtle ways but somehow no one deems it in a way that its not normal. Some days i dont talk because i feel like i may cry and my self esteem has hit the lowest point. Everything feels pointless because no one listens and i keep writing suicide notes in my head and making plans on how and when to do it. It doesnt seem like a scary thing to me anymore and something i am capable of doing.

I suffer a lot and rarely i get anxiety attacks too. I keep getting pushed into sutuations i dont want to be in and its making me so stressed to the point i cant sleep, and its been like this for over a year. I constantly feel sleep deprived and unable to think properly because of it. I dont know what to do about anything because the last thing i want to do is go back to the doctors, they cant prescribe anything to help, but i really want therapy or something. Talking to people is really hard for me so i want someone who understands because i want it to be worth it.

Because I feel socially anxious all the time and that things are pointless, ive concluded killing myself is the only way out. I dont want to feel like this and its causing a chain of problems for me but reaching out is really difficult. things that should be easy are now so difficult, even getting out of my seat in class or going outside. Theres no motivation and nothing really makes me happy now. I just feel like killing myself

And i know i shouldnt be saying this to people online but i dont know how to say it in real life and feel like im actually getting across how i feel because ive been turned away so many times. If youve read this far then thank you, i mainly wrote this to seek validation because i feel doubtful after being turned away and lied to, called overdramatic, ignored etc. If theres anything you think would help me or a way to answer something, help me find a way of finding therapy or something, please say because maybe im willing to try anything right now.",27Apr2019,3

7,"I hate life so much right now. This girl that was talking to for almost about 4 months now started dating this random guy out of now where, like we talk all the time even hang out, I just didn't really feel like it was time to ask her out on a actual date yet. Then today the worst thing happened in my life, all of the sudden  I see her holding hands with some random dude that I didn't even know who he was. I tried texting  her and everything but no response. I'm gonna try and talk to her tomorrow and congratulate her but also I'm gonna be depressed as fuck. I just really liked her and out of no where poof their goes my chance. She's super nice, pretty, and all around a good person. I just really wish this day never happened and I could go back to yesterday to ask her out. Like why choose him over me? I've never even met the guy and he already seems like a douche.

10,"My friend has gone through a lot of stuff since they were little.

 They just told me about everything and I really want to help them.

 They said that they were bullied since elementary school.

 He said that he is losing interest in the things they liked doing and used to cry themselves to sleep on a nightly basis.
 He has more home issues than friends.

He said the voice is getting louder.

He said that it's getting harder to ignore.

 He said that he contemplated self harm and suicide at one point.
I want to help him. I need to help him.
The thing is, we've never met before. I have never heard his voice, or seen his actual face. Hell, we don't even live in the same state.

I met him on Twitter, and we were about the same age. I think he's a little older than me, like a year or two.

I could make it better but I don't, I could not suppress my emotions but I don't, I could stop setting myself up for failure but I continue to do so.

I still feel the attachment and I've tried everything to contact them but it seems pointless. I don't even want to work anymore and I've been sleeping for around 15 hours a day and I can't even bring myself to get out of the bed, I just keep crying over what happened.

15,"I'm just tired of this all. All I wanted was to be loved. But everyone loathes me. Im underqualified for everything. I want to get out of here.

I have planned for a long time and actually attempted suicide twice.

My teeth, gums and eyesight are rapidly deteriorating. My general (as in mental, physical, etc.) health is getting worse. I've got a better body because I have hit the gym, but it is barely better. (0.5-1cm increase in measurements). I've taken poor care of my T1 Diabetes. I'd rather end it now than suffer later. The girl I liked for 5+ years absolutely hates me. My pathetic and miserable ass is too much of a hassle to babysit. Relationships only exist in my dreams. It's a luxury, really. My parents are wasting over 2000 dollars a month in medical supplies and private tutoring. I feel like a waste of resources. I'm not worth it, I don't deserve this luxury. 

I have tried insulin overdose and asphyxiation with no avail. Guns are hard to get by around, and because of my T1D, if I botch my attempt with a knife, I risk infections and possible amputations (I kid you not). Any surefire way? I honestly do not care about how much it hurts. The more the better, actually. I can punish myself that way.

I am juat too tired to fight on. My therapist and I have had very little progress. My parents and teachers believe that I'm doing this for attention (I had an episode in class, where I fell unconscious in class, and they said I was doing it for attention, until we presented scan results which basically showed that my brain can't stay in REM sleep due to delta wave suppression,leading to sleep depravation and fatigue build up which caused the episode). I don't give a rat's ass about what they think of me, anyways. My own family hates me. My grandmother CLEARLY dislikes me, my younger cousin is a much better person than me, in every single aspect. That is from an objective perspective. I have a myriad of problems that I'm too pathetic to face.

I just want a surefire way to end myself. I deserve this.",27Apr2019,1
16,"I've had numerous people thank me for saving their lives on Instagram because of the content I post. And all that content got banned because some people here are so miserable.

It's one thing to be so trapped in depression that you see no way out for yourself. It's one thing to be so disgruntled with life that you reject any help people try to give you. It's an entirely other nasty thing to sabotage those opportunities for other people.

I've been dealing with that since I started trying to help people with depression. And this is how twisted it is to think depression is a part of who you are. It gets to the point that you are so convinced it's a part of you and always will be that you lash out at anyone who says they can actually help you get better.

The reason I know it came from posting here is because I've been doing this for 10 years. I've had my IG account for 8. I've never had a single problem until I posted here, now that entire account has been removed from public viewing.

I struggled with depression for 2 decades. For those of you who haven't caught on yet, here's a hint: It gets to a point eventually where you're no longer depressed because of circumstances and environment you can't control. It gets to a point where you're depressed because you choose to be. You choose to reject help. You choose to dismiss, discredit and sabotage people who try to help. And you choose to reject help on behalf of other people who would have otherwise taken it and gone free. 

That really sucks. Please stop. People are dying and some of ya'll are too busy looking for reasons you can't be helped when you could be looking for opportunities to help others.

I don't even want to post here anymore because I don't want to risk having my other sites shut down. That's ridiculous. The subreddit literally exists to help people with depression, and I'm afraid to help anyone here now.",27Apr2019,1

ve waited for one girl ive loved since 18”. Ive never wanted anyone else. Im 35 now, she asks me to stop writing. I try so hard but i get depressed. She blocks me i make new accounts. I dont know why. How do i let go? Shes a nice person and honestly shes the only person talking to has ever helped my depression. I feel so desperate for her to care. But i know she has no reason to. I still write her and cant let go. I want to but when im in the depth of despair i reach out still knowing she doesnt want to know. Any time ive tried to talk to other girls they never measure up to her. I cant even feign interest in them. Its not fair to them either, but they just arent her.

23,"Im on my phone... 

So one thing that's been playing on my mind a lot latley is the want to not be alive, and thinking about it everyone else wants me to be here and alive but I dont. I dont have a job, my husband is stuck in another country and basically cant come back. I dont have any assets, job or work prospects I live with family friends who have 2 children and their own problems.
Life is seeming less and less pleasurable or needing for me to be in it. Basically I dont feel a need to be here anymore but everyone else seems to want me to be, who is more selfish.

I feel guilt for just about everything I do. Shopping is getting harder, nearly everytime I leave the house I panic, food is seeming less pleasurable, sex (havent since husband not around) and masturbation is less pleasurable or I dont even want it. I miss my husband, he is my everything and him not being here or maybe us not being able to be together makes me not want to be alive.

It just feels like theres no point anymore. Just sayin I suppose. I dont want sympathy, I want to know if you've found a point to stay alive? I think im clinging to straws, buying everything I can afford that will help keep my mind busy.

27,"So, I’ve been struggling with Depression for the better half of ten years and it’s slowly gotten worse. I moved to a completely different state a year ago. The main reason why is because I wanted a fresh start and I wanted to accomplish a lot of things I couldn’t where I was residing. At first it was going well. I got here, a week later I found a full time job, a couple months later got myself an apartment and then found a job in the career I wanted. Unfortunately that fell through about 6 months later and I got a job back where I originally was working which is awful and very very corporate. I’ve been struggling lately with finances and my stress, anxiety and depression has gone through the roof. Unfortunately I don’t have any health insurance at the moment so going to a doctor or therapist isn’t an option unless I want to pay an extreme amount. Over the last ten years I’ve had friends and family pass away and a lot of my friends committed suicide. It’s on my mind a lot. I constantly think about what I can do to make myself happier but there’s always obstacles that I can’t seem to get over. I’m not one to ask for help or anything like that, which isn’t healthy but it’s hard for me to reach out. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought about ending my life but the fact that I’ve dealt with other friends doing that and I know how it felt and feels makes me not want to have anyone I care about to through that. I don’t reach out because it doesn’t seem like anyone truly understands what I’m going through. Anyway, thanks for reading this. I’m just at a stand still and I don’t know what to do.",27Apr2019,3

The hours I work are insane I don't see my friends or my family I get home at about midnight and even though I work kitchen staff I don't get to eat any of the food and because when I get home my younger sister is asleep I'm not allowed to cook anything because noise/smell 
I also hate my job it's stressful the hours are a lot the pay is £4.35 per hour and it takes a toll on me physically and mentally it's bad as for the last few shifts I've spent the entire thing rewriting a suicide note in my head it's to the point that suicide and cutting myself is all I think about and I haven't been like this in so long 
I don't take any medication other than strong painkillers for my back as I have a family history of back pain and I have got it bad

I can't even quit this job because I have to give my parents rent and honestly there is nothing I want to do obviously I'll work and make money and stuff I'm not out for handouts I mean I just don't care anymore there is nothing I actually want to do
