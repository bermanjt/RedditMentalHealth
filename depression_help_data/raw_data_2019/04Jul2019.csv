I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now, I've been on med's for my anxiety but it's not really helping. I'll be 15 soon and I'm scared that I'll end my life someday, I don't want to but it's been really hard  


It's hard for me to post this, I don't reach out much",04Jul2019,2

Hello! I am working on a research project as part of my MSc in psychology programme. Would you be interested in filling out two short online questionnaires: one that asks about thoughts &amp; feelings and another that asks the question “Who am I?”

You must be over 18 to take part.

5,"So I’ve been going to therapy (not seeing a psych) for about a year and a half.. my therapist always brings up black and white thinking and says that I tend to do it lot.. I know what it is and I understand it, I just don’t know what it means in terms of what’s going on with me.. every time I google black and white thinking and things that can cause this, it’s often associated with borderline personality disorder, which I don’t think I have at all.. 

Is there anything “nature vs. nurture” wise that can cause this type of thought pattern?? Is this a symptom of depression or anxiety??",04Jul2019,1

Not sure if this is a part of my anxiety as well, but i’m gonna assume both disorders play a role in how I feel as they usually do.

I’m taking a course in summer school so that I only have to do it for July rather than 5 months in a semester. Every night since exams ended (June 25), I’ve been unable to sleep because all I could think about is how much time I’m wasting and how I could be studying for Canadian History (the summer school class).

I’m lucky to get an hour of uninterrupted sleep before my brain jolts me awake as if the house is on fire. 

This has been going on for a while (past 7-8 months?) but now I finally have a reason as to why it’s happening.

So anyways, do any of you feel like you’re running out of time and can’t sleep because of it?",04Jul2019,3
10,"I’ve been putting so much effort into trying to cheer my mom up and make her realize that she’s going to be ok (my step dad passed away a few months ago and all my mom talks about is being alone cuz she’s terrified of being alone) that I haven’t even been putting any energy into myself and my own family. She’s consuming my life and always has and she always picked men over me, yet I was always working so hard to make her proud. 

I don’t even want to get out of bed or eat. I’m exhausted mentally from her. I’m exhausted from always trying to be there for her and give her advice but she doesn’t listen to me, goes in one ear and out the other. I really wish I could just stop the way I think and stop putting all my energy into trying to make her happy but I don’t know how, I’ve been doing this my whole entire life.

Unluckily she had the worse partner who is my dad. My dad wanted to marry my mom but things just came up and unfortunately my mom had to deal with his hating and bad treatment. One night my dad left my mom outside of the house in the cold rain. He left to the US never heard from him after 5 years he send 50$ in an envelope. His cheap.

So I posted a while back onto /r/depression and got a total accumulation of 1 upvote and some motivational qoutes. I'm hoping this sub is a little more active. Please excuse my bad writing.  


So, a little about me to understand where I'm at and maybe someone who has had similar experiences even though mine is probably pretty unique might be able to help advise me in my next steps. I'm gonna skip up till things really started to affect me because i feel anything before is really just build up.  So, at the age of 16 i was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia. It was bad, really bad. I had the delusion that people could read my mind and i knew it was impossible, but even so the experience is like staring a ghost in the face and telling it ghosts don't exist. It's a very difficult thing to endure. The Illness evolved due to peeping toms from simple voices to someone rummaging through my mind for all my secrets.  I couldn't sleep, daydream, listen to music, watch movies, enjoy any resemblance of privacy, or even retreat to the back corners of my own mind, because they were there to. I couldn't even masturbate, literally stopped for months at a time because the whole act felt broadcasted nationwide. Not to throw in any jokes while i'm opening up and being serious, but imagine that journey for a 16 - 17 year old. Had to take showers in the dark while completely covered in fear someone was watching me. All this while i had to deal with my family's alcoholism and drug addiction, the DEA, county police department, stealing from stores and people getting conned just to make ends meet. We couldn't even hold a place to live. I think i lived in a hotel maybe 3 times at this point. I couldn't even really enter a new county without feeling like i crossed some threshold barrier and everyone i knew within miles of me suddenly had full prime time access to the back reaches of my mind. The best way for me to described what i been through would probably be something like the Truman show with Jim Carrey, they were everywhere.  I spent years fighting this, breaking multiple times along the way, constantly vigilant and always at the ready to defend my own sanity, my mind was like driving a car as fast as you can knowing full well the moment you stop those following and chasing you are gonna catch you, so the only option was to keep driving and never laying off the pedal, i had to drown them out with my own thoughts. Years of fighting this i finally started to adjust myself, the race started slowing down to the point that i felt i could finally do the speed limit. Then i made even more progress, and as hard as it was, i was finally able to slow down and take breaks. I made so much progress i was even able to start my first part time job at 23 years old.  It was an easy job, but it was still hard. I almost never said hello, a part of me didn't know how, i never made eye contact without great effort. Someone would ask me a question, i would reply with the most minimal response thinking they couldn't possibly want to actually speak with me. I often remember days i felt someone watching me i would almost lose track of how i walked, i tensed up so bad i had to go hide in the back part of the store and sit down till i calmed down and regained the ability to not walk like a new born baby deer. Then i made even more progress, instead of fighting the voices in my head, instead of trying to lock every door closed hoping no one would ever see inside, you could say i built them their own room, I invited them in. the more i let them see, the more i realized i would still see the next day. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

The last few years i have now even have a full time job making enough money that i am even searching for my own home at 27 years old. Even my family has made progress, stable jobs and no drug issues. I can greet people with a smile, I can start conversations, I can walk with confidence, and I'm trying everyday to take a step further no matter how hard it is. The last few years i can finally say i won, i beat it. As broken as i am i finally won against my illness and i know how to live with it now. But during the last couple of years and even before that a new problem was slowly festering in me. I realized that i spent so much time fighting just trying to make it to the next day, that i never really lived. I have no friends, I never truly had a girlfriend, no funny stories to share, just pain. I'm still socially inept beyond words and have no idea how to actually connect with people. Not without them seeing my pain and believe me, the stigma follows you. People learn of the illness you fought, you can no longer be the new you so fought so hard to be. It defines you.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm rotting inside, like constant fear, pain, and sadness wrapped like a blanket around my heart and it's a whole new battle. I didn't know you could feel like this. It seems like no matter how hard i try i'm only kicked back down in the dirt. I've grown an egg shell exterior that the smallest things can pull so much pain out that it's unbearable. It's getting worse and i don't know what to do. Has anyone ever been in such a fight that you almost feel disconnected from the rest of humanity? I been picking trees on the way home from work thinking about which one would do the most damage and that's not who i want to be. I never talked to a therapist before, would they even understand? How would they help? I'm so broken anymore that i don't really know how to share my pain without feeling humiliated beyond words. I wear a mask day and night pretending I'm ok for every ones sake but my own.  I don't know what to do, this isn't the same fight.

Thank you for reading. 

Edit: A small addition to add to this. I've been informed today by a co worker that I'm not a normal human being. I also walked to go get some water, looked back to see 2 Team leaders wondering where I was, and made that finger twirl gesture you do for crazy. It hurt. People laugh at me for my lack of opportunities with women and not sharing my personal life. It hurts so bad.",04Jul2019,5
14,Hi I am a 18 year old who just graduated high school this year is is regretting my past and it is causing me major depression. Last summer me and my friends started hanging out with these group of girls and one of the girls liked me. I decided not to date her because I was to focused on my business and saw that every month she was dating a new guy and I didn’t want to be just another guy. Time went on and the school year began and she found the guy she was going to date all school year. I regretted my decision right after she started dating this guy and it ate away at me all year. The boyfriend is a sophomore and she is a senior. Anyways we both just graduated and are going to the same community college this year. The boyfriend will stay in high school as a junior. I would say I am a good friend of hers and if she broke up with him she would be interested in me again. During their relationship this year they broke up a total of 4 times but got back together almost the next day. I have heard some negative things about their relationship however they are still together which is confusing. I am just wondering what are the chances they break up ever? I am going to give some random details because I don’t know how to put them in order. I go to the gym with her 3 times a week. They are constantly texting each other about something. I run a business that makes 60k a year in passive income and have a significant amount saved up. I have went from a tall skinny lanky kid when she first liked me to a tall stronger looking man thanks to working out and growing a beard. Which she complements me on every time I see her. Anyways if you had to put a percentage on them staying together what would it be? Also any tips or advice you have please comment. Thanks,04Jul2019,1

We know each other a half of year and I love her, but she doesn’t. That’s okay! The idea of stopping relationship is mine, because this is very difficult. She allowed me to get her hand, we walked holding hand. I thought relationships was developing, but no. I asked her what happened, and after long conversation we realized that she doesn’t feel that feel I. Now I am thinking about her constantly. That was my third relationship and previous relationships were easier, I mean stopping. I am disappointed in the relationship and it seems that everything is lost for me.

I've been with my fiance for over 5 years. His depression has gotten worse. He needs pro help. I've tried many ways to help myself. Getting him books and workbooks. Finding podcasts and YouTube channels. Offering to schedule the doctor appointments myself. Introducing him to reddit and the depression communities here. He's refused everything. He feels it's hopeless. I feel im at my ropes end. I don't want to walk away because I've been there. Hell i still am there. I have regular bouts of depression suicidal ideation. Ive learned Barr coping skills through out the years and can crawl out of my hole in days instead of weeks now. Ive tried sharing my coping skills. 

Idk what to do. Idk where to turn. I feel this is unhealthy for me since when he gets down anytime he accuses me of cheating bc he was cheated on once during his teens. I don't go out with friends anymore. I don't have friends anymore. I want to help. Idk how. Tried to use 7 cups dude just told me to try harder. Im not making him feel appreciated. I need to change his perspective. 

How long do I hold on? Do i just wait and watch as he slowly destroys himself?",04Jul2019,7
19,"Hi guys. My mom has had several depression episodes in the past 18 years. One very recent of hers started three years back, and it was very difficult for the whole family. But back in December, my parents had their 25th marriage anniversary and my mom wanted to celebrate. Since this was the one thing she asked for after a very long time, my dad decided to keep the gathering short and celebrate. After this decision, my mother was very happy. But then the problems started. She had to prepare herself for the celebration, and rest of us had to take care of other things. During this period, I don’t know what happened, she just defeated her very long depression episode(or so i think) and returned back to her normal lifestyle. Then we noticed that she was not feeling empathy. She didn’t stay home most of the day. She was spending too much money. This raised problems in their marriage and our home. But we made it through somehow and whatever happened that time was over. But now recently i was hospitalised, my dad was at work, and my brother with me. For 7 days she was alone at the house. For the first five she was fine. But on the 6th, she started showing the signs again. Now it’s been almost one month since and she still has a depression episodes. She can’t get up in the morning, says her hands and feet are paining a lot, always wants to lay down. She wants us to leave her alone. So what should we do right now? Her medication is going on and she is constantly checked by the doctor. Help me please, next week onwards both mine and my brother’s college starts and she will be all alone at the house again. What should we do to help her through this?",04Jul2019,8

27,"Next month, my brother will be getting married. My rapist Nfather will be there. I won’t.

The asshole who pretended to be my friend and sexually assaulted me in his dorm room when we were in college is living it up, working in finance in California. 

My psychopathic ex-lover is a successful gynecological surgeon in Boston pulling in millions a year, even though he intentionally infected me with chlamydia and gardnerella vaginalis when he stayed with me over the weekend when we were still dating. 

I’m not hiding their identities. I went public about what they did to me. I named all three of them. Nothing has happened. I didn’t expect the world to shift, but I expected to get some questions/queries as the relevant people investigated. 

Someone reported me as a suicide risk and so the cops came to my place. I told them about my abusers. They didn’t ask me to file a police report. They didn’t say they would investigate. They just locked me up in a psych ward overnight. 

Previously, when I was scared out of my mind that my psychopath would come back and kill me because he had kept my apartment key, I called the police station to ask if they could just keep an eye on my place for the weekend until I could get my locks changed. They straight up yelled at me and told me to call back when he was actually in my room trying to murder me. I no longer live in that apartment, but when I did, I made sure to sleep with a hammer under my pillow. 

I told a reporter what my psychopath did to me. I have reason to believe that he’s done much worse to others. I provided materials. I offered to make my medical records public. Radio silence. 

How am I supposed to believe in justice in this world when it regards my experiences with such apathy? No one will do anything because nobody cares. I've always had to resort to self-help, to be self-reliant, not to depend or rely on others. But even after I went public about the abuse, it's all still the same. Maybe everyone thinks I'm a liar. Or maybe they think I deserved it.

Encouraging folks will probably tell me, “Being happy is the best revenge! Happiness isn’t external, you have to create it within yourself.”

Well I can’t help it, I don’t know how. My hatred and anger will never subside while I suffer all the consequences for their criminality.

“Lean on your support network, they will make you feel better!”

The reactions of all my friends are pretty much “Whoa that sounds serious. You should see a therapist.” My family initially just called me a liar and I estranged them. Now our relationship is distantly cordial. But I cannot trust them when they keep maintaining a relationship with my pedophile father.

I’ve just totally given up on society. I’m done with humans. The onus is always on me, it’s always my burden to carry, to make things right. No one can survive life alone, but it seems like I have to because no one in my life will help.

So how can I make my life bearable? Is it possible to process all this pain I’m carrying just on my own?",04Jul2019,1
28,I'm 23 and I had to recently move back home on account of graduation and unemployment..family history of raging alcoholic dad and domestic abuse since years..and yet if I had to come back home then please understand that I barely had options left..and seeing how nothing at home has changed keeps gnawing me all the time..and yesterday I cracked and was crying and yelling about why I feel suffocated coz of both of them in front of my mom and she just got up and left the room and only came back at night and pretended nothing ever happened..its almost like ohh is she crying.let her.she'll eventually tire herself out and shut up..the same thing happened last year when I'd come home for a visit and happened to confide in them that I was having breakdowns throughout the day and so I finally consulted a psychiatrist who gave me a diagnosis and medications..I distinctly remember both my parents nodding and then changing the topic to never bring it up again..today I and Dad had an argument and I was in a meltdown and ended up scratching my entire face and after a bit when I was just in my room trying to calm down..thats when mom came in and said I should visit one of my aunts maybe n not stay at home..and I ended up yelling at her that why has she come to give me advice now.She should just keep using her strategy of ignoring me completely and letting me tire myself out right..And she just straight up slapped me and said that I should try and behave myself..I don't know what to think..I guess I just need to accept the fact that I have parents alive and well..its just that they don't care about my well being at all..like..nothing..ever..forget trying to change their behaviour to treat the root of the problem and fix their own lives too in the process..they don't even want to listen to me..even when I'm a helpless heap on the floor crying my eyes out..how do I even overcome this..I have two younger siblings still in school..and its only their thought that keeps me from doing something drastic..I don't know how to cope anymore..,04Jul2019,2

The past few weeks were looking up for him where he was getting out of the house and doing other activities. However, recently he has fallen back into a loop and admitted he started to hurt himself again and is feeling at a complete loss. He asked if he could stay over tonight because hes scared of what he might do. I told him that he could of course and that we would figure things out together and that he was not alone in this. I want to possibly suggest when I pick him up if we should maybe go back to the hospital. He's admitted he needs help. I'm just wondering if anybody knows what would be the best action to take? Or if we should just go back to my place and make a plan together on what he would want to do next?",04Jul2019,1

35,"My little brother suffers from depression, anger, bad temper and anxiety and possibly bi polar.

He is not suicidal, but also has almost 0 reason to live.  So it is very difficult to get him to do anything that does not provide him with enjoyment.  A lot of times it's me reminding him of a new game or movie coming out when hes really down trying to find short term hold overs just to find a sliver to wait for. 

We live together so he is not out on the street, he does uber when he is emotionally up for it and it 100% goes to him, not a penny for housing food ect.  Which I do not mind in the slightest.

What I am asking is how to constructively get him more involved like helping with some of the chores and such,  once or twice a week he might volunteer 5 min to pick up some of his mess, but I do 100% of the communal stuff.   That does get frustrating I am doing housework, or dinner, laundry and such and he is  playing one of his games.  But I hate that it frustrates me.  And the absolute last thing I want is one day for it to boil over and snap at him when hes having a bad day and it spiral out of control over something stupid like cleaning the kitchen or a load of laundry.",04Jul2019,3
