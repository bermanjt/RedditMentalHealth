1,I honestly feel as I’m gonna relapse tonight so ducking bad... I feel worse then I did at my worse two years ago... I fully feel as I’m gonna do something I’m gonna regret or idk... I keep panicking and my thoughts are wandering ... I locked myself away for 6 months and didn’t talk to anyone or even look after myself... I feel worse then I did then and it’s just because of my dumb head and not being able to say anything because of stress and anxiety,14Jun2019,3

3,"Every year, my high school holds an athletic competition which concludes at our end of the year pep rally. Pretty much all the fit students partake in this event every year, and I’ve won the past 3 years (freshmen, sophomore, &amp; junior yr). I’m a graduating senior this year so all I needed was one more win to pull off the ‘dynasty’.

I would also get additional scholarship money if I won again. Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then a tall, boney sophomore girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face of against me. I didn’t think much of it, as I had figured there’s no way a young girl would beat the experienced senior guy. 

I lost. This scrawny little girl beat me to win the trophy and scholarship money. The worst part is all my friends and fellow classmates saw it. I’m so humiliated. I’m not very used to losing and I know I probably sound like a spoiled brat but I just can’t get over the fact that only one person, a girl of all people, stood between me and my destiny. 

I’m depressed and embarrassed to go out where everyone can see me and mock me. I feel like a giant loser. I was suppose to win this. Instead, the worst possible outcome happened. I lost to a total unknown and that person was a girl. It’s humiliating.

It’s already been over a week since I lost and all I can think about is her holding that trophy up. I can’t get over this. I’ve tried to think about other things but I just can’t. I honestly feel like I don’t even wanna live anymore. I have lost my desire to do anything. I don’t want to go out in public where peers can see me and remind me of the humiliation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2019,1
4,"Hi! I wanted to volunteer some of my time to people who need someone to hear them out! I've got a bunch of apps on which we could talk. I need to emphasize a few things beforehand: I'm looking only for a polite platonic call (and I'm not female), and I don't feel like I'm well-equipped for being a good psychological help for someone who's significantly younger than me, so I'd appreciate if people of college-age and older would be contacting me. I just wanna say, please, consider asking for help from your education institution's counselor or your relatives (who care about you) or your older friends, in any other case. I'm a fairly good listener and can carry conversations on a seemingly large amount of topics (albeit, on superficial level, sometimes).

10,"(English is not my native language, also I'll delete this tomorrow maybe)
Hi there, as many of you here I too suffer a lot of depression, a deep one and honestly I can't get any help whatsoever so I'm battling on my own and it's hard, but I'm okay with it. However, I'm having a hard time being alone, not talking to anyone for a month because I would look like I'm evading them or something... It saddens me now that I made a friend mad because I responded very ""rude"", while in all honesty I didn't know how to react to what she was saying, I just responded happy for her but now I'm trying to explain that I didn't meant to respond badly... It's very sad because how I'm feeling is also affecting in how I talk to people, sometimes I go through my chats and I noticed how by time I've been responding with less and less words, how I've been getting very introverted and also no talking about my life a lot. Also my father feels like I don't like staying with him, and when I almost reveal him that I've been suffering deep depression for years, he told me ""You sound like an emo""... That made me feel worse, but I know that he didn't meant it in a bad way, he was trying to give me advice in something then the conversation ended with that.

A lot of things have affected me into being this way, not wanting to talk, and also because the little group of people I talk to... well, I really don't like to share what I like anymore with them because I feel I'm annoying. And nobody knows that... Sometimes... Just sometimes I want to tell them ""Look... I need to take a break from social media, I need to be left alone to concentrate on my mental health, on being a better person, I really need to make myself happy at least for a month, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings or even thinking that I did. I want my time to think for myself and don't worry about other people... I just need it, please"". But sadly, I don't know what to do.... There's a lot more to it, a lot more of story but I just don't wanna share what I've been through all this years, I'm just a guy who wants to be alone only for a month to make himself happy.",14Jun2019,2
11,"Ive been feeling alone, unsatisfied and completed disconnected since I was about 16 years old. I have denied ever thinking I may be depressed, but have done expensive research over the years. I don’t understand why I feel this way. I don’t find joy in anything I do and I can’t pretend to enjoy anything. My family travels and goes on vacation several times a year to great places like Cancun and Cabo San Lucas but I’ve always made up stupid excuses why not go to.. simply because I don’t have fun and dread doing anything with them. They complain about my attitude and my mom is constantly yelling how I have a nasty attitude and how I don’t want to spend time with them. I have gone on vacation but when I do it’s almost like I’m bored even though I try so hard to have fun and they take it as I don’t want to be there with them. I’ve tried picking up hobbies but I don’t care about it after a few days. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the idea that this will pass and I will be holy some day. But the thought to kill myself is always there, I always think about it and a lot of the time I wish I could just end it. I’m only 20 years old I feel I’m too you g to be feeling this way I want this feeling to end so bad but I don’t know what to do. I have talked about it with my close friends but they brush it off or think I’m just talking about depression as if it was a trendy personality trait. My boyfriend doesn’t seem to take me serious when I talking to him about me feeling depressing because “there are children dying of hungry you have nothing to be depressed about...You’ve  never experienced anything to be depressed” I don’t know and I don’t understand why I feel this way. I want this feeling to stop. Does anyone know what I could do?",14Jun2019,2

13,"Intro:
I'm primarily looking for anyone that has had a similar experience as stated in the title. I'm going to try and keep this as pithy as possible for convenience but there's just so much. I will try to keep up with comments to discuss or answer questions before my Dr appt tomorrow. Thank you for taking time to read and for any advice given. Gotta be careful bc Google is a black hole, y'all. 

Renunciation:
I want to elaborate what I mean by ""alternative reasons"". I'm looking for other possible medical issues other than Depression. I know I have Depression, that's not the issue at hand. If you must suggest that it's Depression, please be constructive and give me something specific to work with. 

Background (Major Depression, A.D.D. and bipolar II):
 
- Diagnosed with Major Depression 8 years ago. 
    * been going to the psych Dr, taking medication, and going to therapy since then. I've been meditating occasionally for 5 years. 
    * I have yet to find a medication or combination of medications that is effective for me for more than 6-12 months. 

- Diagnosed with A.D.D. back in grade school
    * took Adderall for a couple years but stopped
    * started taking it again in college 11 years ago and mostly consistently since then. 
    * within the past 4 years, I cannot stay awake the whole day without Adderall/Vyvanse/Focalin.

- No official bipolar II diagnosis but Dr's have brought it up 
    * Almost all of the mood stabilizers and antipsychotics I tried did NOT help me and made me so much worse
    * I really don't feel I've ever been hypomanic as even my best moods are like a regular person would be. 

More recently:
- Started taking 50 mg Zoloft (sertraline) while  weening off of Viibryd (vilazodone) in mid-April.

- Have been taking lamictal (lamotrigine) almost as long as I've taking medication for depression
    * I've been wanting to get off of it for years but I either haven't been consistently stable enough or it was not a good time due to school or work
    * finally started tapering off today

To the point:
Throughout the past month, aforementioned symptoms have been worsening (excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation). No matter the amount of sleep I get (4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, 10hrs, 20hrs) I feel overwhelmingly exhausted when I wake up. Any energy or motivation I have seems erratic and is dwindling. Motivation is very up-and-down but progressively more down. 

My depression has always been heavily tied to excessive sleep and lethargy. These symptoms are definitely nothing new to me, HOWEVER, it's always been accompanied by very low moods. At this time my mood is decently stable and that's the baffling pay. I wouldn't say I'm the happiest I've ever been but I'm stable. 

Instinctively I assumed it was a med problem since my symptoms are indicative but my Dr isn't entirely convinced that's the case since my mood is stable. She didn't up my Zoloft but we finally decided to taper off lamotrigine. 

She doesn't really know what's causing the excessive sleep and exhaustion. She mentioned that it's possible the Vyvanse is negatively contributing even though it's pretty much the only reason I can stay awake all day. She suggested there might be something else medically wrong.  As luck would have it, I see my primary Dr tomorrow for my yearly exam so she told me to bring it up. 

I've had my thyroid tested twice, the last time was a year ago and that checked out fine both times. I don't recall getting treated for anemia ever so maybe it's that? Any other ideas? I'd like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr. 

I brought up the possibility of doing a sleep study, but she said they probably won't be able to do much about excessive sleep, it's mostly for people having trouble getting or staying asleep. But she said if/when my primary Dr rules out any non-depression related reason I'm so tired constantly, she could refer me to a sleep specialist. 

I'm sorry for the god-awful formatting and thank you again!",14Jun2019,5
14,"I feel this way far too often.... I’m 22yo and I want to die almost every day. As time goes on, the thoughts of suicide increased and seem more and more appealing. It started to get scary for me once I realized that the one thing stopping me from actually offing myself (the pain I would cause others around me) didn’t matter to me anymore and that dying would be worth it. Because id be dead and nothing would matter. The only thing stopping me now is the fear of becoming paralyzed or failing the attempt and having to live with that. So I just hope every day I get hit by a car on my way to work or die by some kind of freak accident. I feel so alone all the time even though I have supportive friends/family. While I’m not alone physically, mentally I can’t help but feel worthless and like people hate me. I know the cliche of people telling depressed people that they’re “not a burden” I just feel like that’s untrue. I feel like this issue is consistent enough that having to have someone help me and comfort me when I become this way prevents them from living their best life and it takes away from their happiness. I know that being around me is not easy when I am depressed or having an anxiety attack. I have a really hard time verbalizing my thoughts and feelings because I feel like if I don’t say them out loud then they won’t be as real. It’s something I’ve been working very hard on these last few years but it’s still a work in progress. I know that might sound crazy but it’s just how I rationalize my lack of coping mechanisms I guess. I feel like I can pinpoint all of my issues and I’m pretty self aware. I want to change desperately but for some reason I can never pull myself out of the void once I feel myself sink in. And it’s devastating. It’s hard for the close ones around me trying to help. I can’t let them in no matter how much I want to. I just feel like there’s only so much someone can do before giving up on you. It tears me up inside. I’m worried about my relationship failing because of my inability to fight the depression. We’ve been together nearly 6 years and he is the most amazing and supportive person I’ve ever met. But a person can only take so much for so long. In my opinion anyways. I lay in bed most of the day usually sleeping or watching videos when I’m not working my full-time job + a part-time job to just barely be able to pay my bills. The financial stress of being 22 years old, fully self sufficient, living in a big city is insane. I have a history of disordered eating that I’ve noticed resurface this past year. I eat, on average, maybe 6-8 small meals a week. I know eating helps stabilize mood but my ED makes me actually physically nauseous even just thinking about food. Attempting to eat triggers my gag reflex and I’ve puked on several occasions just trying to satiate myself. I just try to tell myself that these thoughts are temporary and that better times will come and make living worth it. I don’t know if I even believe that but trying to have some optimism helps a little. Ive used marijuana as a crutch to help deal with my ED/depression for years, smoking several times daily. I actually just decided last week that it’s time for a break (hopefully to quit permanently). I feel like it used to help but it has just started to hurt me and I haven’t even enjoyed smoking for a long time I just do it out of habit. I feel like it’s making me stupid. On top of my depression that I also feel makes me stupid. Obviously I know healthy diet, exercise/meditation/breath work help symptoms. But committing and forcing myself to do these things regularly seems nearly impossible for me. I can’t find joy or interest in ANYTHING. Which makes it really hard to distract my mind from my thoughts. Antidepressants/anxiety medications (viibryd) have also helped me in the past but I’m not financially stable enough currently to go see a doctors. And I’m not feeling this way every day, it comes and it goes. But it comes and goes fairly frequently. frequently enough that it gets insanely exhausting having to constantly regulate my thoughts and tell myself to snap out of it. If I repress, things get worse. If I let it out, I spiral out of control. I’m not looking for people to tell me that things get better, I’m hoping someone can offer useful guidance, tips or advice to maybe help me pull myself out of the void when I fall in. I hope someone can relate and find comfort knowing they’re not alone. Deep down I know I’m not alone but all logic gets thrown out the window once the cloud comes over my head.",14Jun2019,1
15,"just like my name suggests... throwaway for obvious reasons

every now and then i always think about how hard it is for a human being to stay alive. like, there's all these standards you have to live up to, there's all these people judging you all the time, so many factors.

i have a partner that always tells me off every day for very random reasons. today it was because of a girl that added me on social media and i pressed accept, but i haven't talked to her; we just met during a trip that we all went on recently.

i quit my 6 year job recently to pursue an entrepreneurship, now swimming in debt because my product isn't ready to launch yet and i have zero income (actually i have negative income because i still need to pay employees)

my partner wanted to get a dog so now we have a puppy that i have to deal with during the day whilst still working on my useless startup that's not going anywhere. i lack motivation every day because i already feel exhausted dealing with this puppy...

i have no friends, well actually maybe i do have friends but firstly i'm afraid of talking to them because i don't want to get judged, and also because if i do, i have no idea how my partner's going to react (as most of them are female).

ehhh.. i'm just ranting now, i don't expect anyone here to even give any shits about me really -- you don't know me, i don't know you, why would anyone care?

how does a human stay alive?",14Jun2019,32
16,"I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post ever. I honestly dont know what I'll say or how I'll say it, but i guess its a good place as any. I know it will go unnoticed in the torrent of posts here, but it's a good as place any to say anything, after all I'm on the internet.

The only reason I'm posting this here is that in case someone replies, I have someone to talk to, even if for a moment. I know I sound very edgy or a sissy for saying these things, or even using the word sissy, but its been months since I've had a good conversation with someone, anyone. I honestly can remember the last time I talked with someone which wasn't a yes or no question. It seems like there is no point anymore.

I saw a post here about someone asking what would the women be most sad about being a man, and the number of people replying to it gave a bit confidence to post this. I even wrote something on that post, but thinking that who would wanna listen to me, I deleted the entire thing.

Its just a bit hard to say something if all your life people have told you that your opinion dont matter and that you have no say what so ever in how things are done. Honestly, this is the longest text I've written in ages, or written anything on my phone for that matter. I mean, do people judge other people this extensively?? I know about the situation of Jews and African people and all, but this is the first time I've experienced this in such close quarters and on such personal level. I would be lying if I said I haven't contemplated suicide or running away, but then again, I was told that I'm a scared little shit who will amount to nothing, and I guess it did came true, cz thats what I see everytime I look in the mirror. Just sad guy looking at himself in the mirror for a good 15 min, not saying or doing anything. Just standing there, looking at your reflection thinking nothing.

I cant remember the last time I felt something. I cant remember the last time I cried, like really cried, or felt anything for that matter. Most times it just feels derivative to live, like whats the point in living if all the days are same. The only thing keeping me going, is my mom and sister. I just wanna make sure that they are taken care of and once that is done, I just wanna be free of this shit once for all.",14Jun2019,6
17,"I'm still pretty new to reddit, so I hope I'm posting this in the right subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been quite a hard (almost) year for me with my depression along with my social anxiety (slowly developing). The one thing that I've been thinking about quite recently is just the fact that most of my friends were either fairly quick to judge me or don't really seem to care as much about the friendship even if they claim to be. I'm not usually one to not get any sleep and just mope for hours on end about it, but it just kinda sucks. Guess there's a reason I did...and still keep to myself for the most part. Even when I tried to slowly open myself up to some of my friends, I kind of felt that judgmental or idgaf vibe from them. I'd say that opening up myself did help me to learn more about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So...it kinda sucks that most of my friends make me feel worse and affects, to some extent, how I perceive myself. Sometimes I feel like it's my fault and that maybe I'm not good enough for anyone. I really don't like feeling this way, but I don't know how to get myself out of this mentality.",14Jun2019,2

21,"My (M21) first girlfriend (F18) broke up with me 2 months ago after a 4 month relationship. I know it isn't that long, but we moved kind of fast and had high hopes form the beginning (it was both of ours first relationship). She wanted to stay a virgin till marriage and we same the same religious values, which I loved and respected so much which I think is part of the reason its so hard on me. But we did have some differences, yet I still tried to imagine a future with her even though I was never 100% sure. 

2 months later, and I'm dealing with it terribly. I keep imagining a future with her, constantly think about her, mope about it, bring it up with others to the point where I think I annoy them, and I seeing counseling for advice and to find out if I might have social anxiety and/or depression. Its just been so hard and I'm trying all of the advice that everyone is giving me, but she is the only thing on my mind and I debate on whether or not I was just in it for the relationship or her. At first I didn't know, but I really did love her, and still do. Some of my other friends are also going on dates and have girlfriends so I keep comparing it with them and wonder how they do it. I'm just in a rough spot and somedays I just want to end it. Thanks to anyone who listened or comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: she broke it off because she is transferring and switching majors, so its bringing a lot of stress into her life and doesn't feel like she has time for a relationship, and was starting to think because of that that we seem to have different futures in mind.

22,"I've written about this in other subreddits but didn't really get much support. 

Long story short, my dad became mentally unstable and abusive after a car accident left him in a wheelchair. I was 14 when this happened and I was going through undiagnosed social anxiety disorder and was mildly non verbal at the time. He mostly bullied my mom but she would then yell at me for not standing up to him (due to my social anxiety). He knew of my social anxiety so I was the perfect target. AS my mom said, he didn't like meek people (which I was). 

Sometimes, (like right now for instance), I still blame myself for the abuse and dysfunction that went on in that house. I've been depressed and in self-hating mode all week. I've been thinking of him a lot lately. I'm not suicidal but I get urges to self harm and I worry that I may give in. It doesn't matter how many times my husband and therapist tells me this...I will always blame myself. I feel there's nothing I can do about it at this point, except learn to live with it.

Only problem is, one job isn't cutting it for me in terms of how many hours per week I get, the other one, I hate how disorganized and lax the law firm operates. I also recently moved back home with the goal of saving money for a home, but my family is driving me crazy, and I don't feel like I can relax there, so as a result I also feel displaced.

I've been struggling with depression for a long time now. But the downside of living in a country where people don't count depression as a ""problem"" or even a ""thing"", it's hard to find help. Practically since my teenage, I've been through some harrowing stuff. The icing on the cake was when I lost my father. I've mostly kept it bottled up. But there are times when things slip through the cracks. When I fall through into this put of sadness. Remembering that everyone I loved is either dead, or either will be soon. And those are the times I crave for support, I crave for love. I want to become a better person. And I'm trying. God knows I'm trying. But it's not that easy. Especially when people label you as crazy or needy or whatever the hell they can think of. I crave for happiness in people for I have none of my own. Things like this are hard to imagine for people who've had a normal childhood. For them it's easy to find happiness in things. But when all you've remembered your every waking hour is the agony you went through it's hard to do that on your own sometimes. I don't want to be sad all the time. I don't want to sound scary. I don't want to scare people away. I didn't choose this. I didn't choose any of this. Heck, I'm a fully functional adult. I work. I pay my taxes. I fulfill most of the social duties required by a functional adult. But when the dust settles, in my loneliness, it's always me against my demons. Alone. Because the world doesn't stop for you does it? It keeps moving. Either you flow with it, or you drown. And the people you look to for support are just trying to swim themselves. They don't want anymore dead weight on their shoulders. 
I am as down as I can be today. Without breaking, without losing hope. I had ambitions. Now I have dreams. But they're still there. I just can't find the way to reach them. I want to. God knows I want to.

There. It's out now. I've said what I wanted to. Most of it atleast.",14Jun2019,1

32,"So I have been depressed for two years now, and as the time goes by I get more and more annoyed at myself for being in  my current state. I have tried looking for help but free resources where I live are scares at the moment and paying for them whilst not working also isn't possible. Despite all of this, I am grateful to be on waiting lists and not have had any suicidal intentions so far. Anyways, my question to everyone is whether it is normal or logical to have little desires in doing things when having a distaste for who one is or a specific issue they may have with their bodies? I have always struggled with my mood since young but have been able to cope in one way or another. I have never experienced any distaste towards myself up until some life changing events, including some of my own making like getting tattoos which I hate (one in particular since the day of getting it). I feel as though they do not allow me to move past that difficult part of my life and mark me as that which I am now, someone I never intended to become. This feeling of insecurity is very alien to me. Yes I had suffer from anxiety and depression previously but it was more due circumstances outside of me whereas now it is very much the opposite. It is now personal, relating to my integrity and being. It thus drives me crazy because in myself I know that things aren't bad, in fact I have been very lucky so far and have achieved everything I had hoped for...yet I am stuck in bed and in my room weeks at the time. I am not able to enjoy the things I was so fortunate to accomplish or receive so far in my life. So I find myself  doing nothing useful with these gifts. It drives me up the walls and it makes me hate myself even more. What can I do? Would removing these tattoos help in anyway, or would that be a poor attempt in resolving the root issues at hand? Would love to hear some of your experiences with similar matters.",14Jun2019,1
33,"so i've been feeling worse recently (more ""bad thoughts"" than ever before), already visited 2 psychotherapists before (last one over 3 years ago) but nothing really happened there (maybe my mother ran out of money or wanted to save it up idk) and... im pretty much scared. so i just created this account to ask you guys, how to get rid of it. or do you perhaps know if healthcare will pay for psychotherapists? (in germany / saxony/ aok) because i really dont have the money for it. appreciate your help guys!",14Jun2019,1
34,"I recently moved to a new city by myself for school and work. I live alone and I’ve lived here for 6 months. I had a friend we did everything together but I had to cut things off with her because things where becoming to toxic. So when we weren’t friends anymore I realized I had nobody else.. I’m gay and have been on a couple dates with different girls even went on 3 dates with one girl I thought she was close to becoming my girlfriend but then she texted me saying we have no chemistry. There has been a lot of rejection and ghosting in my dating life . I don’t have any friends right now and my 18th birthday is coming up in a week my family lives really far from me and I don’t have anyone in my life close enough to spend my birthday with me. 

My life for the past month has been so incredibly lonely. I feel an overwhelming feeling that I’ll be single and will have no friends ever. Things have been so hard for me getting rejected and then having no one to talk about my feelings is so hard. I’ve never felt so down in my life I always at least had 1 friend to talk to or spend time with. On my days off I just spend the day in my apartment crying and watching Netflix. I ask my self “how will I get over this ?”

Truth is I’ve been pretty depressed having no one to talk to is mentally exhausting. I’ve been trying to make my self feel happy and move on from the negative things in my life but I haven’t been able to . 

My birthday is going to be hard, your 18th birthday is a big one your officially an adult. I’m so sad I just need some advice !",14Jun2019,2
