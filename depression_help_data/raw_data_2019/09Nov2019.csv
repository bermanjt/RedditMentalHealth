0,"I know it sounds selfish, but I’ve been so sad and feel lonely. I don’t want a relationship due to many personal reasons, but there are times where I feel like I need to be in one just to fill my sadness. 

I’ve downloaded Tinder (a dating app) just to randomly talk to people and I feel pathetic. It’s like when they compliment me, it just makes me feel even lonelier. I don’t know how to make myself feel less lonely without having to do all this unnecessary stuff. It’s as I’m sounding like such an attention seeking person right now but I’m awful and I know that already.",09Nov2019,1

Trying to think positive but, it is not really the best of days at the moment I would say.

I do have bipolar disorder so I have had issues in the past, but not this severe..

4,"it has been quite a while, since i've felt sad.. without no reason... for years i thought it was normal, and i had it under control- i seemed completely alright to everyone, but when i was alone, i isolated myself as much as i could, procrastinated, felt worthless.. now i think it is getting out of hand, because it now starts to affect my everyday life- i cannot get outside of bed, feeling like that is so much to do, but once i get out and get a shower i think to myself- i will do productive stuff now! i can do it! and today was the same, but after shower i just collapsed in bed and cried myself into sleeping again 

i feel helpless. to many people i seem alright - im an artist and musician and have gigs, releases, shows, hang out with friends... but it takes incredible amount of energy to do this and no one realises that. if i dont answer to texts or am late, or something they probably think im a bxtch, but the truth is- im extremely anxious about everything and there is no right moment to answer. at least i have few close friends who are going through/went through similiar things and at least we connect and i dont feel as alone in this...

i try to draw, compose music, do creative stuff which before made me feel better, but now it seems worthless.. im sad because that was the thing that always made me happy but now its super hard to start even doing these things

my parents think its all their fault and they are sad that they dont know what to do to help, because i turn into some dumbass teenager whenever they show some affection (im 24)

i went to neurologist recently and found out i have epilepsy... that took a toll on me.. we also talked about feelings and mood, and she asked me to fill out some kind of test, and she said i seem pretty depressive..  so i am starting to take anti-epileptic medications with antidepressants now... will it get better? i want to know if it is possible to heal from this endless sadness with medication and support of friends? 

the more i think about the sadness now- at first i thought it is completely unreasonable, but now im at the start of questioning my gender.. i think this may be the root of so many problems...

i dunno. anything. i just needed to get this off my chest and maybe having the thought that someone could read this could help me feel better.

ps. sorry for the messy text, i hope its understandable",09Nov2019,1

6,"So I've struggled with depression most of my life, and over the past five years I've gotten a lot better about being on top of it. I still get blue days or weeks or occasionally months, but I can usually shake it with a one two punch of cleaning and organizing my space and getting a haircut (change your hair, change your life!"") I recently decided to make a pretty big change, I'm moving out of my folks place and up to a city where there's more job opportunities/networking in my desired field. I saved up considerably more than my moving goal so I decided to take a month off and tour the southwestern national parks, see some family I haven't seen in awhile, all kinds of good stuff. I've been planning the trip for the last two weeks, all my gear is in order, the itinerary is laid out, and I'm excited to get on the road. 

So a couple of days ago I gave my two weeks notice at work and now it's just a question of working until next Monday and than I'm on the fucking road! And since I did, I have been so down in the dumps. I'm keeping busy and luckily I have a lot of packing to do for the move (getting everything stowed before I leave on vacation.) But I feel like I'm sixteen again, I've just got this unshakeable blue feeling. It doesn't make any sense, I've got a bunch of good things on the horizon but I feel like shit.

I can't find enjoyment in anything I do anymore, I constantly feel like there is an empty void in my chest, my overall view of myself is almost next to worthless, and  I constantly try to isolate myself away from everyone at my school (its a small school and everyone knows everyone).

11,"Hi all, I thought I would come to make a post here to talk about my struggles with depression and anxiety. I have always dealt with depression and horrible anxiety for the majority of my life. Before I even knew what it was, I blamed it on myself and just thought I was weird and that there was something wrong with me. This, of course, didn't help that I was in an abusive relationship that totally warped my way of thinking and tarnished who I thought I was. I  had lost any sense of self. I was totally numbed to everything and was isolated from friends and family who were very worried about me. I  hit rock bottom about 5 months ago. I thought I was going completely crazy. I dealt with the worst panic attacks regularly while being alone and not knowing that I was having a panic attack. I thought I was actually dying. I just kept denying to tell anyone out of fear that they would also think I was crazy. I let it get so bad to the point where I was completely disconnected from myself and was dissociated with reality. I was living with fear and anxiety 24/7. every minute of the day. I thought about suicide every day. Before bed and the first thought  I had in the morning when I woke up. My closest friend and family members noticed something was really wrong and encouraged me to talk to someone... I had gone to a therapist for years and tried every alternative to antidepressants. They suggested it was finally time to try some out and I did. I got out of my abusive relationship and started taking them and surrounded myself with people that loved me. It took time to notice a change but it finally happened. I've never felt more free than I have recently. I can now have fun effortlessly and enjoy the small things which were impossible before. I got lucky and felt a change by trying only one type of antidepressant. I encourage anyone who is suffering like I was to check out all your alternatives and please remember that things really do get better. I know we have all heard that a million times but it really does. And don't get mad at yourself for not being able to feel happy or even get out of bed. Don't judge yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back for being able to get out of bed or go to the grocery store or going to work because it is hard when we are dealing with this. I'm here to tell you that don't give up. Things will get easier and everything takes time. Even when you feel like nothing is getting better, it slowly is. I encourage you all to talk to someone and be the motivation you need. You are not alone! I hope this post gave some of you motivation or inspiration. If any of you are hesitant taking antidepressants like I was, check your options and be patient with the process. They really helped me!",09Nov2019,1
12,"Im only 13 so this isn’t something I talk to people about because they think it’s just a puberty thing but I’ve had a horrible past if I can even say that, I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was around 9 and started cutting at 11. Recently my father had his day out with us (my dad left my mom for this horrible lady when I was 3 and I get to spend the day with him every other week on a Saturday) at the end of the day we went to Burger King so my older sister and I could eat it when we got home. While waiting for our food I spotted my best friend and her family, I’m really close with her family so they almost consider me as a daughter rather than their child’s friend. I had not seen them in a couple months so I obviously was ecstatic to see them, thus I jogged to them with the biggest smile on my face I said hello and we were talking about our days, my food was ready so we said our goodbyes and left. A soon as we got in my dads car he went off on me, he said that family is nothing to me and I almost tripped from running over to them (which was not true) he was yelling at me the entire car ride home (around a 10 minute drive). Near the end of the car ride he yelled saying that I don’t care about him so why should he care about me along with saying my mom should eat shit and he’ll sell the house to see what she would do since the house is under his name. This is what broke me he expects me to act like I haven’t seen him in years when we interact in person for the first time in 2 weeks. Seeing my friends family gave me genuine happiness for the first time in a VERY long time just to not even last 5 minutes because my “dad” is mad I don’t interact with him like that (keep in mind I hadn’t seen my friends family in MONTHS). I did shed a couple tears (not that he cared) but was not shocked, I’ve always felt like the unwanted child my parents act like my sister is a goddess that can do no wrong while I’m nothing but a mere stain they can’t get rid of. My family has made it all too clear my best will never be good enough. I had gone to therapy last year but my mom told me to tell my therapist I’m fine so I could get out quicker, my mother is another story I won’t get into right now because this is already too long but the main point is, my suicidal thoughts have never been stronger and I’m completely numb to any joy these days...being alone is starting to get dangerous because I don’t know if I’ll do something to either harm myself or even take my life. I just need support I never get and possibly some advice on what to do about my father basically telling me he doesn’t care about me. 

If you actually read this entire thing 
1)your an amazing human being
2)sorry for wasting your time with my issues
3)if you don’t have any advice please just say something nice like “I’m proud of you” it could possibly save my broken soul

13,"On 17 September I attempted suicide. I was in my Uni, it was a German class, I couldn't answer the question again, I felt stupid, miserable, those bad feelings started to flood me. I screamed, broke my pen and ran out of the classroom. I ended up in the restroom. The window there was open. I jumped on it, and just looked down for a while. I couldn't make the jump. I hid in the stall for about 10 minutes. I cried, beat my legs and head, and eventually I felt like I was ready to go back to the classroom. After I left, I saw a girl in my group, whom I had conflict with, and I snapped and hit her. I was called ""больная"", which is a rude way to say someone's mentally ill in Russian. I screamed back, saying that I am ""больная"". Meanwhile, the class had already ended. I started to pack my stuff. Then, something hit me. The window in the classroom was open. I immediately stopped what I was doing and ran to the window. The teacher was there, too. She rushed towards me and when I was already ready to jump she grabbed my hand, called me stupid, an idiot and pulled towards her. She didn't say it nicely. I ran away again, finally packed everything, left the room. Then another teacher suddenly pulled me to her. I wanted to break free, but she clenched my hand and then we already were in teacher's restroom. She told me to calm down, look in the window, and a jumped back as soon as I saw the window. I was a complete mess for the rest of the day. I cried, screamed, i couldn't pull myself together, I was breaking down. It felt like I was loosing myself. My mom picked me up. I don't remember the rest of the day, but it still seems like it was just yesterday, even though almost two month have passed.

After that, the officials suggested I take an academic leave for a year. My psychiatrist and my therapist were against it, though. They thought I wasn't that bad and that an academic leave now would only be a waste of time. So I didn't take it.

Now, October hasn't been too bad. I changed my group and now German isn't the first language for me, although I still have it. But now, In November I feel terrible again. I can't study again. I want to cut again. And I'm scared of German. I cannot study it. I just can't. I can only make myself do something at home, where I'm alone, but in school I start to panic, even if it's something simple. When I hear my teacher speak in German, or when I see my previous groupmates, I panic, I remember that day and feel dizzy.

I don't know how to handle this. I would really like some support now.",09Nov2019,1

I am 19 years old, 2 or 3 years ago I started using drugs, crystal, cocaine (especially crystal), and because of that, I had a lot of social problems, and school problems, in fact I skipped all my classes, I  which made me owe many subjects, that important people for me, move away, after a while I left it on my own, I began to improve my life, I told my mother that I would stay one more year in high school, and it cost me work  to convince her to do it, she gave me the opportunity and I passed all the subjects in that year, but now I don't have a university 
I have to do an exam of 120 questions of which I have to answer 110 well, I began to generate depression again, slowly
 I didn't see anyone, I didn't have any more friends, I didn't leave my house, my girlfriend left me, because she told me ""you're boring"", knowing that my mom might not be able to walk anymore and more things led me to depression again, and I started to consume meth again
I've been like this for a month, I miss a lot of go out with someone, study, I miss my girlfriend, I feel really bad, a few years ago I got to take a glass of the floor and cut myself, I still have the scars and I feel that it will not take me to get to that point again, I can not  stop consuming and I'm very anxious about that, adding that I am afraid that my ex gets someone else so soon, I would not bear to see her with another, every day I feel worse, btw, sorry for the bad grammar, i'm mexican
I hate my life, every day I feel worse, I miss my girlfriend too much, and go out to school every day, I stop eating well and sleeping well because of the crystal, when I get over drugs at that time and everything gets better, I value life, love everything

20,"Living with depression is fucking horrible, I can't physically do anything no matter how much I want because of my motivation being absolutely shit and even when I want to do something I give up within 10 minutes because I'm comparing myself to other people and I've not accomplished anything which has stopped me from trying because I know inevitably I'll end up giving up or bursting into tears.

The combination of depression, social anxiety and possible ADHD (heavily suspected but am waiting for an official diagnosis) is ruining my life. I don't have social skills to speak of, think everyone is judging me, want to change every aspect of my appearance and personality, get angry at everything which I don't want to do but have virtually no control over, sit on my phone all day because I can't do anything else, have no patience,  am not able to study, give up on learning new things even if I want to do them and it's a bitch to try and develop getting into the habit of practicing things because developing routines and fitting in everything I want to do is a fucking nightmare (I only have a proper routine in the morning and even then it's only because I feel like everything will go terribly if it isn't there and have panic attacks if it isn't followed directly).

I don't even know why I'm here at this point its weighing me down, I don't do anything in this world, I can't do anything. The only escape I have is through maladaptive daydreaming and thinking of how I want my life to be instead of the way it is right now. If only I had the ability to laugh at myself and develop social skills maybe then I might be happier instead of the lonely sack of shit I am right now.",09Nov2019,1
22,"My husband and I had a huge fight last night again because he wants me to do more to get better. I had to sell my house a few months ago after finding out I can't work due to my other mental illnesses, which threw me into my current clinical depression.

He keeps saying he wants me to ""do more""--more self-care, more chores, more anything, so I can ""feel better"". I've very slowly been adding new things to help myself; I take meds, am in therapy, and I'm doing DBT. I've been cooking more and doing dishes and laundry. I've started going to the gym. This is a far cry from when I was lying in bed crying literally all day, but he wants more. I want more too, but I'm not there yet. We're in couples counseling and had this a conversation on the same topic earlier yesterday during a session, but he still doesn't seem to understand that this is a process that moves at its own pace, even with a therapist mediating.

I'm just at a loss. I was really proud of the things I'm doing to help myself. I do have really far to go, but hearing that I'm not doing enough from my husband over and over makes me want to stay in bed all day again. I feel like I will never be good enough for him. If we break up, I will be homeless after the money from the house runs out, but I just don't know if I can take hearing this over and over. I feel alone with my struggles and pain. He used to look at the situation with a loving attitude, but he doesn't anymore.

I have dated one very beautiful and smart girl with good sense of humor . The relationship was going well , at least that's how I felt . She told me that she had some mental problems that made her feel bad when touching other people (even me) . I was patient and haven't pushed her into anything . (We never kissed , or even held hands) . 

About 9 months later , after summer holidays I broke up with her , because she didn't find any time for me and we haven't seen each other for 2 months (she was also more interested in my best friend than me previously). Few weeks later after we broke up , she started dating my best friend . However , she has definitely no problem touching him . 

Now I  just wonder how disgusting , useless, ugly and boring I am when my ex had those problems with me and no one else . I just wish I never introduced them .

27,"Hi guys, starting this thread because I don't really know who to turn to at the moment and you seem like a supportive bunch (:

After returning from vacation in early October, I've been hit with the news that both my contract will not be renewed and my mother has had a mild stroke. Thankfully mom is recovering quick and I have landed a new job rather fast, but the whole experience has nevertheless left me shaken. Some more backstory:

- I've suffered from severe depression a few years now. Since getting back and moving in with my boyfriend I've steadily been doing better, but I have my off days, obviously. I have seen a specialist about my depression but since I don't have the money, I stopped going to therapy about a year or three back. I felt confident I was doing better at the time, and it feels like everything has only recently upped in intensity again.

- I think I've had intrusive thoughts and experienced extreme loneliness since my early teens. I'm 28 now, for context. I can be by myself, but when my boyfriend goes out to hang with his friends and play D&amp;D, it's easier for me to get anxious and lose myself in negative thoughts. Not on him being out, it's just easier for me to worry about money or my place in the world or whether people care about me when I am not in the company of someone else. I hope that makes sense.

- I've tried talking to relatives, friends and the bf about my experiences (the anxiety after mom's stroke, me not feeling comfortable about this new job at all, feeling 'wrong' somehow for feeling this way, etc.) but none of them are very ecperienced with these sorts orlf things and chalk it up to nerves and say that it'll all blow over. They're amazing people and I love them very much, they just don't know how to handle all of this. Please don't come at them for this, they try so hard to help me and they are always willing to listen. They just... don't understand how to deal with this, I suppose?

Since the bf is out of town right now, I'm home alone and Linkara and Game Grumps videos on Youtube have not distracted me from my thoughts at all. Do any of you have any tips or suggestions on how to deal with this? Maybe advice on how to make future alone time less anxiety-inducing?

Tvhanks a bunch in advance, I've been debating whether or not to post anything for a while now",09Nov2019,1

31,"So long story short I was diagnosed with moderate depression 4 years ago and recently told by a dr that I have severe depression. But here’s the thing.... I don’t really know what depression feels or looks like. I have a good career, own a home, have great friends and an amazing girlfriend and a dysfunctional family just like everyone else. I have no thoughts of hurting myself or anyone else, which to me is what I’ve always thought of when thinking about being depressed. Not true, I know but still. Anyway probably for the past 6 years I’ve been very aloof. Don’t want to do anything ever. Would be perfectly fine shutting myself in and just laying around. Nothing sounds like fun or piques my interest anymore. Doing errands around town are procrastinated until last minute and I’m always late to everything, inconveniencing everyone else. I’ve got poor self esteem even though I’m fairly okay looking. I feel like I’m not really good at much of anything and definitely have no special skills which bums me out because I don’t feel like much of a “man” because of it. I’ve got no hobbies besides playing video games when I can even find the enthusiasm to do that. I basically feel like a potato all the time, even at work. I stay glued to my phone or my screen any chance I get just to drown out the noise around me. I mean none of that is okay, right? Somethings got to give.

33,"In mid-October I contracted scabies from my mom who lives in another state then me on a meetup camping trip. She got it from a coworker and treated herself before the trip. However, she didn’t actually get rid of it and gave it to me on the trip. She told me the same day and we used tea tree oil to keep them at bay on the trip. After I got back home I eventually begin aggressive treatment regimens using 10% permethrin cattle dips, 10% sulfur, and horse paste oral ivermectin and daily dryer treatment of my clothes/bedding/towels. Although it took a couple weeks to figure out how to best do everything. While I have mostly defeated them they remain persistent over the weeks. I have an otherwise happy life, but I do work full time and the daily grind of treatment is taking a toll on me. I have/had some bad chemical burns on my body from my aggressive use of permethrin and sulfur. If I would remove the topical chemicals they start eating me and I can feel it.  
My boyfriend came over the last weekend just so we could hang out and watch some TV so I’m not so down. But now he caught it from the bean bag he was sitting on while here. We went to the urgent care clinic after work on Thursday. They gave us some of the prescription medications, but I don't think they alone will stop our cases. I am a biomedical research technician and have read about all the internet has to offer on scabies over the past weeks. I believe I have a worse strain (permethrin resistant) then some people get, although I could be wrong. I don’t think the 5% permethrin cream or human ivermectin will help us much. I think we are on our own, but I went to the doctor just in case I’m wrong. I will try the doctor's orders over the coming days. I was just able to get the medications today.

For some scabies is extremely easy to get rid of, and then some strains seem to be a lot more persistent. For those cases it seems like it takes doctor's orders + animal product home treatments + home treating in order to actually get rid of them.  
I had lice 3 times as a child. My mom has had bed bugs once and easy to get rid of scabies several times (she is a nurse). So I’m familiar with the trails of parasites but at least with lice I could shave my head bald if I wanted to. For this there is no such option to stop the scabies. If this was lice I would have shaven my head bald by now that is how much of a grind this has been.  
I know that persistent and careful treatment will get rid of them in time but it is hard. There are only a few people I can talk to about it, without destroying my whole socioeconomic structure I’ve built for myself.  
My roommate has never had parasites and she reacted very angrily to me telling her about this because I didn't tell her until about 5 days when I returned from the trip (fair enough). I told her just to be thankful we don’t have bed bugs which are (typically) much harder/more expensive to deal with then scabies. So far she has not contracted the scabies, so she settles down over the weeks about it.  
I had to reschedule a weekend trip me and my boyfriend have been looking foreword to for months although we will take the day off work. That was a let down, but we can still go next spring. I will not tell my boss and coworkers because I believe they will fire me for “exposing” the animals I work with to the mites without telling them (at least if I told them the truth). I like my job a lot and I like my boss, I would likely not find a job like this again if I lost it. If I could just get rid of this quietly and carry on with my life that would be best, even if it takes months. I do have good sick benefits at work and could just refuse to tell them what I’m out for (I've done it before). Just staying at home everyday will drive me even more nuts then what I’m doing now though. My job getting out of control will cause me more stress. My coworkers will do their best not to step up if I take time off work, and things get really messed up really quick when I am gone. My coworkers are unlikely to catch it as I don’t have a skin to skin contact job, and animals don’t get the human subspecies (supposedly). I'm not posting this for a big moral lecture about the situation with work, such comments will be ignored by me. I can make those decisions for myself. The CDCs page about returning to work after scabies reads something like ""yeah slap on the 5% permethrin the night before and clock in the next morning"" so I don't want to hear it.   
There are a lot of horror stories on the internet. I mean it is not awful bad for me as I am able to keep them from eating me too much by keeping my treatments on me but they just won’t fing die. What is bad for me is that some remain over a long period of time, I mean I don't even have visible rashes. They will go anywhere on my body to try and live. The time it takes to treat my bedding/towels daily is taxing. A lot of the articles saying how easy they are to get rid of with 5% permethrin don’t seem to apply to me. Also that the itching after using permethrin is just from the feces and egg cases is a lie at least in my case because I can feel them moving on me. The doctor agreed with me that this kid of permethrin resistance can exist based on studies. I can feel they are alive and there, duh that is why my boyfriend was able to catch it.

Me and my mom have figured out a few things that I think we were doing wrong in the last couple days and it has helped, but it won't be easy to get rid of them. I will continue using all the strategies to try and defeat them for the foreseeable future.  
To top it off my dryer needs a new belt and idler pulley. It is still running for now though. I ordered the replacement parts and have them. Under normal circumstances I would take it apart and do the repair but I’m too afraid that I will mess it up. Then I will have to pay some jackass $300 to replace a belt and plastic wheel due to my duress from the mites. As you have to have the dryer to be able to fight the daily war with them. Me and my roommate agreed it will be best to replace the parts after I get rid of them or only if the belt breaks.  
If anyone has faced some depression or negative feelings from having prolonged parasites I would appreciate your mental coping advice and support. If I can just make it through some months/weeks of doing battle with them my life will go back to normal and I won’t be down anymore. Any support is appreciated. For those reading this that have never had parasites, be kind to those in your life that catch them. You may need to stay away from the person but support them and don't act morally superior. A lot of people from all walks of life get parasites sometime in their life.",09Nov2019,1
