0,"I don’t know if this is the correct place for this as I’m new to the whole Reddit gig but I just really need to get something off my chest and get it out there so I can start to move on. A few weeks ago. On Saturday the 15th December, I tried to kill myself. It had been building and building for awhile and I snapped. I took way to many tablets. (I’m on 50mg of Sertraline daily for depression). I then didn’t sleep the whole night as it was physically impossible. I couldn’t stop shaking, I was having difficulty breathing, I was hallucinating, I was feeling nauseous, I couldn’t stand up, which I later found out where all side effects of taking too many. I didn’t know what it would do to be but I was hoping for the worst. I didn’t want to be on this planet anymore. Obviously I’m typing this post so it didn’t do what I had planned. I haven’t told anybody this. I needed to get it out there and say it all.

I’m genuinely scared of myself now. I have always felt down but I didn’t know I had it in myself to try that. I’m scared that one day I’ll try it again and no matter what I do it’s inevitable. I also hate that I tried it because I would be leaving my mum and dad in a bad place. The last thing I want to do is break them and I know it would break them. I really don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m trying my best to plod along and take each day as it comes but I can feel the pressure building once more and like a safety relief valve, I’m gonna go and explode to let it all out.

Truthfully, I don’t wanna die. I’m scared of death, it’s so final, it’s the game over screen at an arcade and you’re out of coins. But I think I prefer that to the reality of continuing to live.

I don’t even know why I’m like this. I don’t have a bad life, I have a good job, I have a loving family and I have a small group of friends. But yet, I feel this way. I know there are a lot of people on this planet who have genuine problems at home or in other places who have a reason for feeling like this and I feel guilty that i feel like this without a reason. 

I have seen counsellors in the past and I’m considering going back as I’m determined to get better. Since I tried, I’ve noticed changes in myself, I still have tremors although they are no where near as severe as that night and I’m struggling to sleep a lot more. 

Once again, I apologise if this wasn’t the place to post this but I just needed someone to vent and get it all off my chest where I’m sort of anonymous. I wish everyone the best new year and I hope that this year brings you all your dreams. Peace and love. ",03Jan2019,1
1,"First of all, glad you are still here.

Second, dont feel guilty for not finding a logical reason to feel this way. Depression isn't rational and sometimes it hits someone who has a pretty normal, good life.

I tried to kill myself a few years ago aswell and I never told anyone really because in this moment i just lost myself, I didnt think straight. And im glad i didnt die, i actually tried it twice and I regret it. And still, I (I even wanted to post it right now) have some pills that could potentially kill me on my desk and Im afraid I will once again lose my mind and just take them.

My depression is getting worse each day and Im scared of what I will do when Im alone and breaking down.

Please, whenever you feel like harming yourself, taking these pills or doing something else, write me a message or someone you trust. I tend to drive crazy when Im all by myself. I will be there for you, I promise

I hope you see this and I hope you can find the courage to ask for help when you really need it. Take care of yourself",03Jan2019,1

Mentally however, I've been going down. I spent an entire day just sleeping, didn't have the energy to do anything else. 

My laptop charger broke so I'm unable to constantly keep myself busy. It's just not the same with a phone. 

On the upside, I guess, got healthcare. Going to see a doctor so I can have meds again for my depression. Not ready to see a therapist again, will eventually.

though i'm open to most, just adding some stuff about me to try to find compatible friends: i have conservative values but i am not conservative, more like pragmatist. straight edge. likes intelligence. stubborn. lazy. hardworking when i somehow manage to commit to a purpose. severely depressed but stable.

7,"My older sister has been battling depression for at least 4 years now. Her life is an absolute mess: she doesn't sleep well unless she is on prescription drugs, she keeps squandering more money than she can afford week after week and has snowballed into a ridiculous amount of bills to pay, her relationships always end in the worst ways possible etc. But what torments me even more than seeing all of this is that I just can't seem to help her. 

Over the past six months, she threatened to kill herself three times. All three times she just stormed out of the house, drove aimlessly through the city for like 30 minutes and then came back home after sending tons of messages talking about ending her life. It seems to me that she absolutely needs to be confronted about her terrible life choices and how they're not helping her with her illness, but how am I or the rest of my family supposed to do it when she is so unstable? 

It has become mentally and financially overwhelming for all of us. She keeps getting into bad relationships with assholes who only bring her down even more, she constantly borrows every last cent from me and my parents to cover up her mistakes, she keeps throwing tantrums and freaking everyone out everytime the smallest thing goes wrong etc. And we are all too scared to confront her about it because we believe the best thing we can do is to be supportive and affectionate, and that confrontation could push her closer to the edge.

I cannot live like this anymore. I'm constantly terrified of losing her, I'm constantly broke because she keeps asking me for money and I'm too scared to say no, I get literally paranoid every time she leaves the house, it's been affecting my productivity at work, my mood when I'm home and my own mental health. I need to help her and I need to help myself.

She is currently on pills prescripted by a doctor she used to see, but has refused to see her therapist for at least a couple of weeks, saying she is looking for 'a shrink who does not try to comfort her but instead tells it as it is' to her. I want to be there for her and support her unconditionally, I want her to feel loved and I want to help her overcome all this, but her acts are draining me and my parents of all energy and I just don't know what to do. Should I take the bull by the horns, convince her to go back to therapy, stand my ground and say no to her more often etc?

Please help. I have not been able to eat, sleep or function well for the past six months or so, my anxiety has shot up and I cannot take much more of this.",03Jan2019,1

I started a new job today, but it's not at all anything I'm truly passionate about or anything at all related to what I went to college for. I hate thinking about continuing to show up there, honestly. I'm applying to another school program for something I've always wanted to do, but I keep hearing and seeing examples of people younger than me who are already doing what I want to do, and I can't turn off my own inner bully.

10,"I’m fighting a really really long and hard slump right now. The longest I’ve been through. I’m not suicidal, and I haven’t been before. I guess I could get there but I don’t expect to. I’m extremely afraid of death or any sort of injury so I wouldn’t hurt myself. I just don’t care though, and it’s an issue I’ve had for a while, but never for this long. I have a girlfriend who I love, and friends who care about me, and it’s not fulfilling and I’m forcing myself not to push them away to keep entirely to myself, which I already do too often. I’m not motivated in school and overall should care more about everything but I have no such energy to do so.

I want to taste the unknown future with my partner at my side, and guide new souls into the world as their seasoned shepherd. But the meat inside my skull feels otherwise. It wishes shamelessly for death... whispers for me to slice my arms to the bone and let them bleed, leap from a tree behind my house and hang there like a broken puppet, slip a helium-filled bag over my head. And I can't help but listen. I can't block out the sound of its seductive siren call. It's compelling, and awful, and delicious, and repulsive, and hypnotizing - both alluring and terrifying in the same moment. It feels as if some great cosmic force is dragging me towards a dark and horrifying pit, while I thrash and scream  and desperately cling to a single branch in the quicksand for survival. And yet, I willingly stare into the very abyss that I fight so hard to avoid, captivated by its sinister promise. Will I wrench myself out of it's grasp and ascend from this sickening haze? Will it suck me into the oozing void as it has so many others? Only time will tell. For now, this long and tiresome battle rages on, without an end in sight. If I am to survive, I must continue to swing my sword at the darkness, though it grows heavier and more unwieldy with each passing day. Perhaps in the end, it will simply be enough to crouch behind my shield and bear the blows until the enemy tires of toying with me and leaves. Until that day arrives, I raise my sword to all of you in combat at my side. I pray that this ravenous  beast we each battle, collectively and yet utterly alone, does not claim any more souls from our ranks than it already has... and most of all, I wish all of us strength enough to see this through to the end.

I was recently at my doctors to try and get a small adderall prescription for work as work has been a mental block and a vicious circle of anxiety. At the office, questions were asked and I ended up crying a few tears. Doc diagnosed me with depression and suggested anti depressants along with meeting with a psychologist. I’m afraid of taking pills for fear they may negatively affect my long term mental health/state. I don’t know if I’m even depressed. I think about death a lot and do not fear it. I don’t feel a lot of happiness daily, however am happy in certain situations ex: NYE 2019 was great. I have a gorgeous and nice girlfriend who is very in love with me. I care for her immensely but I am not sure if I love her back. I don’t even feel as though I love my parents. I just feel sad 75% of the day and now lack motivation to do anything but the minimum and sleep a lot, not keeping to a schedule, bad memory, smoking weed to fall asleep. Am I depressed? Will anti depressants help? Thank you for reading and your thoughts,

I've moved from Texas all the way to Indiana about three years ago. I left behind my mom and grandma and was never able to say goodbye to my grandma on the phone one last time (one of my regrets, it weighs on me a lot). After my grandmother passed two years ago, I've suffered from the worst depression ever. My mom is suffering right beside me too even though we are states apart. I tried killing myself, (don't fret, I have a wonderful therapist and support system) but my mom on the other hand. She has no one really. It's always been us three. I'm not there to take care of her. She suffered a heart attack, triple bypass surgery and is currently going through major depression. She does not want to treat it, even after telling her many times to talk to her doctor. Even her doctor got after her because her diabetes is getting worse and she is also not going to her therapy for her heart. Her birthday is coming up on the 18th and I just really want some honest ideas on what to send her. Things to comfort her. I just wish I could send some of my strength to her, honestly. What can I send her to really brighten her week? ",03Jan2019,1

On Christmas eve the girl I like told me she had a boyfriend, told me I have issues ""You have issues"" ""I think its because you don't have a dad"". Said that I have an insane fear of attachment and that she won't wait.

Same night I see my ex girlfriend of 5 years who cheated on me with my best friend, I get stressed/edgy anytime I see her and her around my friends. Left the party after seeing her in my best mates bed. Reconfirmed what that girl said.

Christmas was a nightmare, mother got shit faced and started a fight with my step dad, I tried to diffuse the situation ended with my step father taking off, after both parties admitted to cheating on eachother (I did not know this but I was disgusted). My little sister was having a panic attack in her room. 

Can't confide in my friends, they're all messed up too. Very negative attitudes.

A FWB who lives on the other side of the country and whom I'm good friends with came to hangout for a couple days. We got an airbnb I thought it would be good to have time away with somebody not connected to my life here, however she left today and was quite moody at me last night/this morning and I can't figure out why.

I've had a good 2018 however I've been drinking very consistently last 2 months. Taking drugs very consistently. In fact I'm coming off MDMA right now, still have a baggy left in my wallet.

My parents are alright I mean I argue with them quite abit but ik they do love me and stuff same with the rest of my family. So I mean I don’t really have much to be sad about yet I still feel a broken and numb. 

I feel like life isn’t even worth it and I feel like no one cares . I feel upset every hour of everyday as if someone has tied a weight to me and every time something kind of good happens the weight pulls me back down into a low mood. 

I haven’t felt happiness in a while , last time I felt remotely happy was when I took mdma ( it was so incredible I want to take more but that’s how addiction starts and I’m not that stupid ) but I want to feel happiness by myself and not have to rely on something else.

I wish I knew why I got so upset because then I would be able to work towards solving it but there’s nothing . I just feel dead inside for no reason  which makes me furious at myself because idk what to do about it ugh.

Now usually I can barely talk about being upset because I don’t feel comfortable at all doing it. I don’t trust alit of people and talking makes me feel vulnerable but writing on here I guess I can feel abit safer.

22,"So I’ve been living with multiple mental disorders my entire life and on top of it all, I’m autistic. 

God knows I’ve been in some dark places in my life, abusing drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Thoughts of suicide constantly creeping into my head. Broken relationships, heartbreak, loneliness. 

In my 23 years on this planet, I have always thought, “why me?” “Why was I out here with so many issues?” And I just had so much anger towards my parents for creating me with issues. I told friends I didn’t have plans past 30 years old. I told them I didn’t want to get married and ruin someone, I didn’t want kids and pass on my disabilities to them and ruin their lives too. I felt happy when I was alone and sad when I was with friends. I’m sure a lot of you feel these same things on a daily basis too. 

But I finally reached out to my family and they supported me and my close friends supported me. I quit doing drugs, started going to the gym and got myself into the best shape of my life. I went from almost dropping out of college with a 2.2 GPA 2 years ago to graduating 3 weeks ago with a 3.0 GPA and a degree in Public Relations with a minor in General Business. I built new relationships with people I never would’ve met if I dropped out. 

I gained confidence and started asking out and talking to girls who would have made me shake and sweat profusely if I tried to talk to them before this. I’ve had dates with sorority girls, and it’s proof that we can all make changes in our lives no matter how tough we have it. It’s just about confidence and self esteem. 2 things in my life that were extremely low until I started self evaluating myself. Started practicing speaking in my room. Started smiling at myself in the mirror, trying to ignore the flaws I used to see. Now I can speak in front of entire classes and my clients. Can talk to attractive girls and make them feel nervous for a change. You can all do this too. I promise.

Lord knows I still struggle everyday. I still get the dark thoughts that try to get me to relapse, but I’m trying to be a better person, to challenge myself everyday to do something new, talk to somebody different, make new friends, go on adventures. And my demons will always be there in my head, grabbing me and trying to pull me back into my darkness, but for now, I’m here fighting like crazy because I will not go back into the darkness without a fight. 

Find that one friend who truly supports you and has your best interests. For me it’s my best friend. When I start to feel darkness, I face time her and she is always there to pick up and talk to me no matter what time it is. She listens to me and gives me advice, and sometimes it’s harsh advice but it’s what I need at the time. She gives me peace of mind, she truly loves me and I probably would’ve taken my life if I didn’t meet her 2 years ago. Find that person in your life and when you do, hold them close, don’t let go because we all need support if we’re going to make it through the pain.

For everyone out there struggling, You will get through this. We are the strongest people out there. We face death and darkness and stare it in the eyes. We push it away from us and we’re still here. No one can call us weird or different because we aren’t boring and ordinary. We are strong, unique individuals who have a story to tell. You are all beautiful and full of life. Please don’t ever feel like you aren’t worth anything because I grew up with those thoughts and once I figured things out, I realized that I still have a lot to give to this world, even if I am autistic, even if I have borderline personality disorder and OCD and severe depression and anxiety. Through all of my disorders, I’ve still managed to make my life into something I can feel proud of, even if it took me 23 years of pain and suffering to get here. I love you all. Keep fighting and remember how beautiful and unique you all are:) treat everyday like a step in the right direction. Try and do something each day that brings you positivity. For me it’s art, but it could be sports, cooking, reading a good book, etc. find your happiness and carry that with you. We got this guys. I promise:)",03Jan2019,1
23," Look. to preface this i'm a little drunk. I'm super sad and have been dealing with depression for quite some time.

So first of all i moved back in with my parents pretty much 1 year ago. Give or take a month. I was diagnosed with severe depression around the same time. I've always been pretty hopeless but i thought moving back would help.

Now i have been getting better. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist and that has really been helping me. But today is a new low for me. I've always had a hard time making friends. I'm pretty socially awkward. So when i was asked to come out and hang with a workmate of mine I decided to go just because I was constantly being told to be more active. Anyway i went out with these people and had a fantastic time. I really felt like for once I was happy, even if it was for a moment. A few months pass and i'm seeing my workmate and all his friends pretty regularly. Having fun. hanging out. I feel like i'm actually doing something with my life instead of just wolloying in self hate. It was nice.

Well it WAS nice until today. I found out that actually the only reason any of those guys were hanging out with me was because I was a friend of their friend, my workmate. Apparently after the first couple of times they would just rip on me for thinking i was their mate. The only reason i found out was because I saw my workmates snapchat which consisted of all of them laughing about how much of an idiot I am. I feel sick. I feel like all the good feelings that i had in the couple of months i was with these people wasn't for me. It was just because I worked with their mate, It was just because I was amusing to them. They apparently have had enough of me though. They've cut me off from all of their group chats, discord chats, snapchats and everything else. I feel like a total piece of garbage. I'm sure at first they gave me a chance. But i stuffed it up somehow. I don't know what i did but my personality got in the way. Honestly i can't really explain what happened in what way but i'm totally cut off now. It's actually one of the worst experiences I've ever had

I don't know what to do right now. I'm too embarrassed to tell my parents who think everything is going well for me and i've actually made friends. I don't want to goto work tomorrow because i'm not going to be able to work properly with this guy. I'm sorry if this post is against any rules but i don't really know where to go now. I don't have any friends left. My workmate is just talking to me because we work together. I feel like once again i've stuffed up my life.

I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I don't want people to think i'm a baby. I don't want people to ignore me. I don't know how to make people like me. I don't know how to make people see that i'm not a useless piece of human garbage, even if i am. I just want someone to talk to. So thank you to anyone who reads this, even if you don't comment. I just needed to vent somewhere.

""An anxious person will recognize this as rumination. We repeatedly replay bad events and negative emotions in a constant loop.

While we’re wrapped up in our experiences, Henshaw explains, we’re missing out on simply observing life. We miss the things happening in the present moment because we’re worried about the future. When life becomes a series of one worry after the other, are we really living any longer?""

""Repeated complaining rewires your brain to make future complaining more likely. Over time, you find it’s easier to be negative than to be positive, regardless of what’s happening around you. Complaining becomes your default behavior, which changes how people perceive you. 

And here’s the kicker: complaining damages other areas of your brain as well. Research from Stanford University has shown that complaining shrinks the hippocampus—an area of the brain that’s critical to problem solving and intelligent thought. 

All the extra cortisol released by frequent complaining impairs your immune system and makes you more susceptible to high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. It even makes the brain more vulnerable to strokes.

Since human beings are inherently social, our brains naturally and unconsciously mimic the moods of those around us, particularly people we spend a great deal of time with. This process is called neuronal mirroring, and it’s the basis for our ability to feel empathy. The flip side, however, is that it makes complaining a lot like smoking—you don’t have to do it yourself to suffer the ill effects. You need to be cautious about spending time with people who complain about everything. Complainers want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves.""

""There are different kinds of Automatic Negative Thought patterns (ANTs).

**1) Fortune Telling**

This is the ANT of almost anyone who has a panic disorder. They are masterful at predicting the worst, even though they don’t have any evidence.

**2) Mind Reading**

Where you arbitrarily believe that you know what someone else is thinking, even though they didn’t tell you. Many people do this, and more often than not it gets them into trouble. It’s a major reason why people have trouble in relationships.

**3) Guilt Beatings**

Thinking with words like should, must, ought and have to. The words we use to talk to ourselves are very important. Guilt is not a very good motivator for change. Telling yourself “I should go see my grandmother” rather than “I want to spend time with my grandmother” only serves to make you feel negative.

**4) Blame**

Whenever you blame someone else for the problems in your life, you are a victim and you can’t do anything to change it. Many of us play the blame game, but it rarely helps us. Stay away from blaming thoughts and take personal responsibility for changing the problems you have.

**5) Labeling**

Calling yourself or someone else a derogatory name. This diminishes your ability to see situations clearly and labels are very harmful.""

""Many of my thoughts centered on the fact that I didn’t feel good enough. These thoughts caused me a lot fear and anger, and stopped me from doing things that I felt would bring me joy.

When you start thinking negative thoughts about yourself or others, tune in to your intuition about what would bring you fulfillment. When you devote your energy to things that bring you joy and satisfaction in life, there’s less energy to devote to negativity.""

""I believe the root of a lot of residual negative energy is the failure to forgive others and even ourselves. When you refuse to forgive someone, you only hurt yourself because it grows into bitterness, resentment, anger, and sadness. Those are all very dark and negative emotions to carry around which impact your daily life in significant ways. And remember, these feelings can also emerge when you won't let go of your own mistakes. Learn to forgive - you don't have to reconcile relationships but let go of offenses committed against you for your own happiness!""

31,I feel like a waste of space. Everyone tells me to go out and do something but I don’t have any energy at all. I just get up and feel like absolute shit. I feel like I was a cosmic mistake and I never should have been born. I’ve been to three therapists and I’m on my 4th medication. I don’t think I’ll ever get better,03Jan2019,1
32,"Hi everyone,

So I’ve struggled with mental illness for almost all of my life.  

During the past six years things have gotten dramatically worse. I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression. I’ve wanted to get better since then but ive been struggling   With consistency and perseverance. All I wanna do is avoid the reality of life and how far away I am from being normal. I do this through shopping, tv, or just doing anything that doesn’t make me think about my issues. Every time I try to do therapy, I feel extremely unmotivated, sad and just can’t focus for shit.  I’m just extremely tried and sad most of the time. 

In addition, I haven’t had the best experiences with therapists.i’ve seen a couple throughout the years and honestly they barely helped me at all. They didn’t  even seem to care or take me seriously. And For some reason, exposure isn’t working as good as it should for me.  despite how many times I try to gradually face my fears I’m still the same. In regards with cognitive restructuring, I have no idea how to do it. I don’t know where to start, how to do it right or anything like that. How am I supposed to think straight and change my thoughts? 

I’m just so tired of life and the way I live it. I’m not living  guys, I’m just rotting.

I want to reduce my anxiety and depression but I don’t know where to start. I have major self esteem issues that I believe are like the core of my anxiety and depression.  And also I  suspect I have body dysmorphia as well. 

I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts.

Thanks for reading ",03Jan2019,1
