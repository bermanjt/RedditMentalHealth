0,"My friend has had depression for at least 4 years now. My friends and I have been helping him through his depression for a while. He's been through therapy and had been admitted to  a mental hospital about a year ago for attempted suicide and self harm. But it doesn't feel like anything is changing. He's still numb with not much to look forward to, and I don't know what he wants to do with his life. I need some advice, because I don't know how much longer he can hold on before he inevitably kills himself. ",20Feb2019,38
1,"Hi all. I've been dealing with my D&amp;A for about Nine Years now and am just becoming an adult. I have only accepted my D&amp;A and started working on it for the past year. I seem to have reached some sort of Plateau with my apathy. I do not feel distressed I feel like I am not feeling anything at all. I am so apathetic about everything, nothing seems to bring me enthusiasm and my motivation is non existent. I realize that I am just being a lazy bum and am embarrassed but I feel so chill and unfazed by flaking on all of my plans including buying things masturbating eating or anything of instant gratification and my subconscious just says ""Don't care."" or ""Will do later. Have plenty of life left."" Do you use any activities or techniques to give you a returning sense of feeling or emotion of any kind? I've been this way for weeks. ",20Feb2019,6
2,"I need to get this off my chest because I feel violated and angry and there's no one I can yell at because it'll land me in the same situation.

Yesterday, I did something stupid. The miracle of it is, I haven't even blamed myself for it. Normally, I'd have berated myself from unbelievable start to finish. I still would be calling myself stupid and all kinds of names. That bupropion must be doing something right. But it's not helping my paranoia.

I made a call to a certain government run healthcare organization because I discovered my spouse and I can't keep our current health insurance.

So I might've gotten a little upset while talking to a CSR and said some things about killing myself--which were not actual ""I'm going to do it right now"" things. They were just what-ifs. I think about death a lot in general. I'm depressed and anxious and stressed...like 97% of everyone. 

I thanked her for her help before I hung up. I might be crazy, I might yell, but I try to be polite in the end. I went back to my crochet (a skill I read would help my depression...ha ha, just like exercise, right? Nope.). I'm working on an afghan. It's 6'10"" wide and already 5 1/2 inches long. This is important, I promise.

An hour and a half later (you read that right), I'm getting ready to go to the gym with my mom. We walk a lot because I used to be really overweight. Physically, I'm pretty healthy. Mentally is a whole other spotted pony. Anyway, there's a knock at the door. Weird. I was going to Mom's. She wasn't coming to me. I answered it. Huge mistake.

There's a deputy, looking all concerned. He asks if I'm itsalice4sure. Stupidly, I say yes. He says the sheriff’s department received a call stating I was going to kill myself.

I tried to deny it. I could see he was listening to something on his radio. Maybe the call? Maybe a dispatcher? Who knows. He was all, let's get off your porch (it has some weather damage). I'm a big guy. Might fall through, blah, blah.

I was wearing two day old pjs covered in dog hair and flip flops. I hadn't even brushed my teeth (yeah, yeah, so it was almost 3pm). Then it was, let's go stand in front of my car. 

He goes from being buddy-buddy to Captain Deputy Sheriff, saver of idiots who talk too much. He kept grilling me about the call. Did I remember the lady saying it would be recorded?

She absolutely didn't say that.

What was he going to hear if he listened to it?

I was like, how should I know? For all I knew, it wasn't even recorded. (Spoiler alert: it was recorded.)

Mr. Deputy suddenly grabs my arm. I'm being detained because I had threatened to harm myself. Hands behind the back. I hadn't done a single thing except cooperate and they kept assuring me I wasn't in trouble. Really? 'Cause handcuffs and a ride to the ER courtesy of a cop car kind of suggests otherwise. The other one wanted to know why I thought I was in trouble. I couldn't even muster up any sarcasm. I let them stick me in that stinky car with its mystery stained backseat and faded 'smile you're on camera' sticker and kept my mouth shut all the way to the hospital except to ask him to call my husband. 

When we got to the hospital, he asked if I was going to run, make noise, or try to harm myself or anyone else if he uncuffed me to avoid any embarrassment. I'm like, my moments of idiocy have passed for the day. Embarrassment has not. We're in a police car. People are looking.

It was around 30 degrees, freezing cold, me with no jacket and flip flops and it took him forever to uncuff me. We made the walk inside and got registered. He filled out his paperwork and had to ask how to spell bupropion and made a joke about it, then looked me dead in the eye and said he thought I was downplaying the seriousness of my threat so they wouldn't keep me. From buddy-buddy to a hard-nose faster than me from cray-cray to perfectly calm.

I was like, should I drop down on the floor and start wailing? What kind of crazy antics would you like to see? I didn't say any of that. It seemed better to stay quiet.

Pretty sure I'm going to catch the flu. There were droves of sick people in the waiting room. Super.

My mom showed up and I stood there and joked with her about the flu, talked about my crochet, and generally had a good time despite being under close scrutiny.

They called me back and made my mom and husband stay outside. The EMCT brought me paper clothes to wear and told me to change. Spiffy shade of maroon. I almost said, yeah, all the better to hide the blood, huh?

I knew I was on camera. But was I supposed to change right there with the door open and everything? He wandered off and I thought, well, okay. Pretty much had all my dignity stripped while I was in my yard hoping to a god I don't really believe in that this was a crazy dream. He came back while I was in my birthday suit and stood in the doorway. He wasn't looking, not really, but still, it's been a while since I had a wax and shaved my arm pits. Some other chick got in a fight with him about who was going to ""sit on"" me. My dad was a prison guard. I'm very familiar with the term and hearing it in reference to me was unnerving. Anyway, the chick won. Maybe he was disturbed by all the hair on my body. Things I learned yesterday: always shave, and your mom wasn't joking about clean underwear. They took it. Put on antiperspirant every morning too. That 24-hour stuff is lying to you. I never, ever go out of my house looking like a hobo the way I did yesterday. I'm depressed, but danged if I'm going to let strangers know it.

And then a slew of nurses and whatnot wandered in and out. Took some blood. About 10 different people asked what happened. I left out a few details. Don't know if the attending physician heard the phone call or not, but he seemed kind of disturbed by the affidavit the cop filled out.

I was there for four hours before I got to talk to a psychiatrist. She asked what was going on. If I didn't do it right, I was fixing to take a trip to the big, scary mental hospital in an ambulance where I'd have to stay for who knew how long? No thank you. I explained and then asked if she'd ever dealt with that certain govt health care organization. Of course not. She has great insurance through the hospital. Not the leftover for the rest of us that doesn't even cover anything except free pap smears. In a lot fewer words, though. She said the affidavit was pretty compelling toward my intent to harm myself. I'm like, really? I've been nothing but polite since I was walked through that door. I didn't even swear once. I caused practically zero trouble except someone had to ""sit on"" me and someone brought me blankets. She asked about my education and I explained I have a degree (that's gathering dust) in mass communications. She laughed and said maybe I should've used what I learned there in that phone conversation. I desperately wanted to mimic her in a high-pitched voice. Smart enough to know that would be a poor choice. I'm an expert in customer service and laughing along with people even when I think they're totally stupid.Then she suggested I need a psychologist. Duh. I was trying to find one, but the certain health care organization isn't helping me with insurance and they're already unlikely to pay for this little field trip, so it might be a while. She said she'd talk to the attending doctor and tell him she thought I would be okay to be released as long as I followed up with my own psychiatrist  (who we'd just discussed getting because I don't have one. Whatever). Dr. Who Was Actually the Attending when I Had a Car Wreck 15 Years Ago came in and said, if we let you go and you kill yourself, it's going to come back on me. Ahhh, another guilt trip. Not working. Sorry, pal.

Okay, A) I explained to several people I was being treated for depression and anxiety already and it was working okay and B) I'd just switched the dosage of my bupropion and C) I started taking Buspar a little over a week ago. Yeah, things might be a little screwy on my head until everything balances out. Dr. Been There Forever nodded in agreement. But if I feel like I'm going to kill myself, I should totally come back. I'm like, look, I'm working on an afghan. It's going to take forever to finish because it's single stitch. I'm planning to run twelve 5ks this year. People who want to kill themselves don't make plans like that. Angry off people say stupid things. Like any of those people had never been angry at a situation?

So then I've ""down played"" the situation enough to go home. Sit-upon nurse person brings my clothes. I start to change and she says, you can go into the bathroom there. I was all, really? That other guy wouldn't let me. She was like, wow, and with the camera right there. Yeah. I don't know about you guys, but I'm thinking that's against the law. 

Then I got to go home, but my mom insisted on stopping for food. I was so sick from everything that happened, I couldn't even eat half. I was glad it was dark so she didn't see. Went home and took two OTC sleeping pills, but I couldn't sleep. I had to go to work today, so I couldn't even get up and go sit in the living room so I wouldn't bug my husband with tossing and turning. My hips hurt from sitting on that horrible bed for four hours too. That always keeps me awake. Even in my dreams I kept going back to that horrible little room. Laid in bed for ten minutes after my alarm went off desperately trying to think of a way to get out of work, but I finally had to get up. I've been dragging all day. Every time I try to eat, I can get a little down, but then I feel sick again. Husband had to work today too. Told him I was coming home to take a nap. I got maybe 15 minutes of sleep and then laid here obsessing about everything that happened. I kind of want to go stand in the shower forever because I feel better there. Except I jump at every noise because what if the cops are coming back? I changed into sleeping pants and a tshirt when I got home, but I left my bra on because I'm not getting dragged out of this house again without it. Even if they do take it away from me at the hospital. I took my contacts out, but I'm terrified someone might make me leave without them. I'm really blind without them.

I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm afraid to take off my bra because some health care CSR tried to ""help"". All I want to do is cry. I'm so glad my husband isn't home and that the weather is bad so I didn't even have to leave the house after I got home from work.

Sorry to ramble so much, but I'm really upset about the whole thing. It's my fault, obviously, but it's on that too, because I'm even more stressed today. I seriously hope she doesn't think she's some kind of hero. The cop too. He probably thinks he scared me straight, but all he did was make my mistrust of the sheriff’s department that much worse. He made me feel like I'm an inch tall and he has all the power and I'm the worthless piece of trash who has to bend down and take whatever is shoved at me. I've never been in trouble with the law except for some speeding tickets. I've never been cuffed and now I feel like I'm as worthless as any other criminal who sat in that backseat.

That ""help"" was no help at all.",20Feb2019,1
3,"So in June 2017, I was prescribed Celexa. I’ve been struggling with depression since ~2007 and anxiety/panic attacks as long as I can remember (~1999, 4y/o). I never talked to a doctor about it at all until 2017. The Celexa never helped me, and month after month I would call my doctor repeatedly telling her it wasn’t working, she just increased it to the max dose and wouldn’t do anything else. In March 2018, I got really bad. I had a whole plan and date on how/when to end my life. The last thing on my list was to break up with my boyfriend. He knew something was wrong and wouldn’t let me leave, and I’m so thankful because he saved my life. He snapped me out of it enough for me to stop taking the Celexa, and I improved a lot after that, but definitely still have issues. I went to a new doctor in April 2018 and she wouldn’t prescribe me any antidepressants until I saw a therapist. So I went and waited forever. The therapist sucked. Finally in November 2018 she prescribed me Pristiq. I fill the script each month, then stick them in my cabinet and never touch them. I don’t know why I do it, but I can’t bring myself to take them. Maybe because of what happened last time, or maybe because I just went so long without them. After practically begging my doctor for them for months, I don’t want to tell her I’m not taking them. Now I don’t know what to do..",20Feb2019,2

I suffer from frequent migraine headaches, daily acid reflux that won't go away, constipation, stomach pains, a weak immune system, I wear laughably thick glasses, yada yada yada. I know what the comments will be: see a doctor, eat this, not that, blah blah blah. Nobody cares! I just want to put a bullet in my brain. I don't expect to live more than a year or two. I'm waiting to get esophageal cancer, throat cancer, stomach cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, or any other fatal illness. Why can't I just commit suicide? I'm not brave enough to kill myself. Physical pain is part of my very being and I hate it. Could somebody kill me? I just want to die already! Life is meaningless and meaninglessly full of suffering. My father may still be alive in his sixties, my mother her fifites, my grandfather may still be alive at eighty-three, my uncle in his fifties, but I don't expect to live long.

5,"This is my first post so I'll give a lil background info. I struggle with depression and a panic disorder (diagnosed in 2015 but haven't been back to therapy cuz I'm poor) and for most of my life I have had this feel of extreme urgency and hopelessness cuz of that combo. I moved from new England to Texas and I have never been happier than when I was there. Amazing job with respectful coworkers, awesome weather and decent money with lots to do. I seriously can say I was HAPPY the 10 months I was there, which is just mindblowing for me. 

Moved back to NE due to complications and the job I have now is a bit of a hostile environment. Very small business. I just started three weeks ago and I'm still trying to get the routine down but I occasionally make little mistakes such as putting the paper towels in the wrong spot but I have made big mistakes too such as not giving a dog his probiotic one night because it wasnt on his med list. At my previous job in TX, I was so appreciated and I was a really valuable worker, I got a raise in a month and I felt good coming in each day. I was also working on a team and now I work independently. Now I am scolded daily and I have not heard one positive thing from anyone, and I feel like they make my workplace problems into personal problems. 
Anyways, my problem is that I have never worked somewhere where I was actually disliked as an employee and personally too. It's taking a toll on me to the point of danger where I am ready to make incredibly risky decisions to escape my situation like moving back to TX without telling anyone, injuring myself so I can be in the hospital for a while, and just never showing up to my job again. I want so badly to get out of this situation and even when I have days off I am in full panic mode and j am completely unable to relax. Its driving me to drink alcohol very frequently. Weed only makes me think about my problems more and panic more when I am in this state of constant panic and pain. I dont know how to deal with this because i have never felt like a shitty worker. I always try hard and go way past my limits just to please authority but it's not enough this time. I need some ideas on how to not let these workplace issues completely take over my mind even when I am home and shouldn't be thinking about it",20Feb2019,1
6,"Hello,

Yesterday I cut myself, on my arm. I'm wondering how it will heal?

I feel terrible about it, and really don't want anyone to see my arm. But I can't hide it forever, and my girlfriend will see it eventually. I can hide it from other people, but not her. I just wanted to escape my thoughts but they have only turned worse as a result of what I did. Usually I'll just hit my knuckles into walls, until I physically can't do it anymore. But that heals faster, from what I've heard this can take a while.

12,"My frustration of recovery from anxiety and depression is like this… I started out thinking, “Ok, I need to work on recovering from anxiety and depression, let's do this… how hard can it be?” So first I start with going to my doctor and admitting I have a serious problem that I need help with… I start medication and I get an appointment to see a psychologist… confronting yeh, but straightforward enough. 

The psychologist starts me on the path of mindfulness or grounding exercises and outdoor activities and hobbies to treat the symptoms and to feel a bit better in the here and now… “Yeh, that's great…” I think sarcastically “… sorry, but I want to dig deeper and get to the root of the problem…”  so I start digging… I go through my childhood history, I already knew I had a screwed up traumatic upbringing so clearly there was something there that needed my attention… 

I learn about my problems of low self-esteem, feelings of social insecurity and the subsequent maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, validation and approval seeking… so I work on that and get those things under more control… nope, still anxious and depressed… 

So I then learn that my problem runs deeper than that, into the world of codependency… that sucked to find out… started getting the hang of learning to curb codependent behaviour and started getting on top of that but…. But nope, still anxious and depressed… but by now somewhat less… 

But then I learn my problem runs even deeper… into a wonderful little trio of feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and underdeveloped self… so now I'm just really wracked off, angry, annoyed that the deeper I dig the more crap I find… one would think that surely this “another thing… and another thing” scenario doesn’t go on forever… it's like digging through Mary Poppins bottomless toilet of crap… lol

It's a bit like cleaning the house… the cleaner it gets, the more dirty spots you notice… it's like digging a hole for a swimming pool in the back yard only to break a main sewerage pipe… you get it cleaned up only to find a land fill full of boulders… you remove them only to hit solid bedrock… its like building a house in reverse… you finish the roof only to have to pull it down to build the walls, only to have to pull it down again to first pour a concrete slab… only to have to demolish everything again so that you can prepare the site and dig proper footings into the bedrock… and the frustrating thing is that there doesn't seem to be a better way… other than not being psychologically screwed up in your childhood to begin with.

Sometimes I envy those who seem to get through life through denial, suppression and distraction… it's what I did for 30 years… I even believed that my false self was my true self… so I'm writing this to help me process stuff, but also to help others benefit if at all possible… because there's just so much damn ignorance, stigma, unhelpful platitudes and condescending “help” out there from well meaning people who just don't have a clue.

You're depressed? You're anxious? Just switch the channel and get over it… yeh, it's a tiny bit more complicated than that…

So if of you are on this fun journey of “recovery” don't kid yourself… it's not simple, it's not just one or two things… it's a lifetime of repressed unresolved crap that is going to take a lot of time, determination, a willingness to suffer and fail, and to do it all over again… and even then the positive results are minimal and slow to come… 

So if you're going to do this, like me, you're going to need to brace your mind for an epic journey through the scenic routes of emotional hell… but in theory, this ride can't go on forever… it will just feel like it… the sad thing is, nothing can change the past, it's gone… but we're not alone in this battle, so don't give up… 

“Never give up, never surrender…” 

“Just keep swimming… swimming, swimming, swimming…”

13,"There are a lot of activities in our school that I've missed. I've made a lot of consistent bad decisions lately, and I don't know what I've been doing in my life. The first one being the swimming activity in our school. I feel stressed and anxious, and a lot of times, I feel very tired. I made a decision that I won't join this activity. Reason? Personal Problem. The teacher gave not one word after I said it was personal and that I don't want to talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Our second activity is swimming again. Next week would be the last activity for physical education. This time, it is recorded as an exam. I don't know what I should do, and I can't decide on whether I should come or not.

&amp;#x200B;

One reason why I don't like to go in a swimming activity is that my classmates would make fun of my body. I'm not physically fit, and I don't even do any kind of physical sports. The second reason is that I have a traumatizing background about swimming. When I was a kid, I almost drowned in the pool. I can still see the very clear image of that particular scene. I thought that I was going to drown, but thanks to my sister, I was caught. I don't know if she thought that I'm drowning, but I think she thought that I was practicing (too young to practice, eh?). I don't know if my family know about it. I haven't opened up this one on them. The third reason is that because of that traumatizing event, I never learned how to swim. My sister wanted to teach me, but I insisted not to learn a thing. I'm a man, and I feel embarrassed that my sister knows how to swim while I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'll come to this activity, I'll get a grade in this subject. If I fail to come, I would instantly get a zero, and that is recorded as an exam. I don't want to fail and let my parents feel down, but I also don't want to let my classmates see my embarrassing side of mine. At the same time, I also don't want to drown because I don't know how to swim. This means that my classmates would laugh at me because of it. If I'll not come, I need to tell a reason to my teacher. I'm stressed, I feel tired everyday, thinking of reasons that I can give to my teacher.

Any advice?

17,"I posted here not too long ago when i was in an especially dark moment of thinking and got some amazing words that truly helped me. Now in a better mood than before i can't help but reflect on my situation in life and how my depression is affecting it. I feel as if im heading towards self destruction. I tend to lead myself to distractions as much as possible and ignore what should be simple issues until they become large and important issues and sometimes even then i ignore them. It feels like any form of confrontation with self or reflection of self leads me to a hollow feeling combined with feeling like everything about me is being dragged down like a great weight rests on my very being. I feel myself coming to the 'Rock' with my 'Hard Place' being my self destructive tendencies and im not sure what the 'Rock' will be but i think i don't ever want to know.

Many times I've had the thought before that i know all of the things i need to do in life to improve my own situations, whether that is learning a skill, applying for a new job, or even simply playing a video game consistently so i'll actually get better at it, however every time i present myself with opportunities or solutions i seem to get the stated above feeling of emptiness and do nothing or quit. What this self-tirade boils down to is that i desperately have the knowledge that i need to make changes in my life but i need advice on how to change the way i change how i feel.

19,"So I went to the doctors to get some advice on my medication. I’m on 10mg of citalopram per day at the moment and I feel like they arn’t working. I’ve been on them since last June and only since I’ve been on them have I progressed to self harming and suicidal thoughts. I have a history of depression going back to 7 years old and I feel like I may have an undiagnosed issue that I want to get resolved. 

I went and asked to be forwarded to a mental health assessment so I can find out if it is more than just depression. The first time I asked was in December and going back yesterday they said they have no record of any requests for me to have a mental health and autism assessment. I showed him the self harm and explained I am really struggling. I took my GF with me as I feel like I cannot explain how much it is effecting me properly as they never seem to take me seriously. So I get there yesterday at 2:50pm and my appointment is for 3pm he leaves his office and doesn’t come back till 20 past 3 and then asks us to go into his office. I explain as best I can and my GF helps.  My doctor then explains that changing medication won’t change anything and I just need to stop thinking negative thoughts to get better. 

My GF goes bright red with rage by this point and starts trying to explain that I need some help and asking why medication isn’t going to change anything when I’ve been on them since June last year. Have I taking them for no reason? The doctor still seems uninterested and unhelpful but with more persistence that I need to go for a mental health assessment he agrees to send a letter for me but says that i probably won’t hear anything back from them. 

I’m from the UK does anybody know if this is normal for doctors to approach mental health? Any advise on where to get the most effective help? I’ve been with these docs for 8 years and they have always been the same. Even with us complaining about their approach today they said they could book me in again with the same doc or simply find a new GP. They were extremely unapologetic and basically just told us to go somewhere else for help. What do I have to do to get help? I’ve been telling them I’ve been suicidal for months and months and they just don’t seem to care or take any action. I’m feeling hopeless and lost after yesterday’s appointment.  ",20Feb2019,4

23,"I've been wanting an emotional support animal for a long time, I think I have depression but I don't have any real diagnosis. I have an appointment with my doctor soon to talk about it but I'm really afraid she's going to tell me I'm fine and nothing is wrong. I think my main problem is anxiety because I have panic attacks when I try to leave my room to do anything out of my normal schedule (like groceries, getting my mail). I just can't bring myself to do basic tasks like brush my teeth, there's times when I don't shower for days because I don't care about anything. It's been 4 months since I've done any laundry. I can't enjoy anything I used to like any more. If I ever have a thought that I want to do something like draw, I immediately give up and feel exhausted. I tend to just go home and nap until I absolutely have to get something done, because my panic attacks causes me to have to do something (like homework)(I'm in college). I feel like having a cat around might help me with the constant sleeping because will have a reason to want to exist, but I don't know if this even sounds like a valid reason, or if I even have depression I feel like if I talk to my doctor about it she's just going to say I'm lazy and insane. Does any of this sound like a valid reason for getting an emotional support animal?  ",20Feb2019,1

I have not been living well, why cant I do the things that I want to do. Why does it seem imposible to do the most easiest of tasks. I feel like im trying to speak a different language with no knowledge. I can see all the possibilities in front of me, and im sprinting after them but im making no progress. I dropped out of my class, I stopped going to the gym, I just destroyed my car, my life, my will. I just want to be a part of life, I want to make a difference, I want to use my brain. I desperately want to use my brain, why do I keep coming back to this dark place. I hate the dark place but I wont get myself out. I feel trapped in this dark empty space in my mind that is void of emotions or feelings. I feel overwhelmed by my existence but I refuse to give up. I am determined to find my place in life, wherever that may be. I could have died in that crash. I wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and my car flipped twice. How the fuck am I still here. Whats fucked up is I really think I flipped my car on purpose. Why would I do that to myself, that’s horrible. I deserve better for myself. I have so much to offer. I understand the things I am doing wrong, and I can fix those things. Yet here I am doing the exact opposite of what my mind is telling me to do. The changes are little seeds that I have to plant in my mind but for those to grow, I have to water them, make sure the soil is perfect, ensure all sides to get sunlight, but that takes willpower, that means I have to care for those seeds everyday until they flourish into a beautiful field of flowers. Right now my mind is a barren wasteland, I have to turn it into a field that makes planting seeds possible. This feels so difficult to obtain. Every time I try it seems like my field goes through a drought and I have to start over again. I cant give up though, I have to see what that field looks like. Even if it doesn’t turn out as a beautiful field of flowers but just one flower alone. I desperately want to see colors in my mind not a gray barren wasteland",20Feb2019,2
26,"Yeah, I know God has a purpose for me, but why must it be like an endless whirlpool if all I’m gonna do is hit the bottom?

I want this all to end. ",20Feb2019,5
27,"I am a self-taught artist. Whenever my anxiety or depression gets bad, I automatically do art. But recently, I've been feeling worse about my art. I feel like I'm doing something wrong all the time and I don't know what to do about it. Using art to help me feel better has become a risky thing to do, because a lot more than not, I feel worse after trying to draw because it doesn't look good enough. If anyone has any ideas for what can help me (whether it be feeling better about my art or finding new things to help me relax), that would be really appreciated.",20Feb2019,3
28,"I have now been here for seven hours. I still have yet to see a psychiatrist. So, the solution to being lonely, depressed and suicidal is to leave me alone with nothing but my own thoughts for several hours. Has anyone else dealt with this? Any advice?",20Feb2019,2
29,"I don’t know if this is just me but usually when I get engaged in an activity I usually just don’t feel depressed like almost like it’s just gone for a bit or if start doing my work I neeed to do, once I start working on it it’s not as hard to do and I can usually get it finished, but despite that, after those moments pass I go back to feeling the same. Maybe what I just described is extremely common and I just didn’t know but I thought it would be worth asking anyways. Thank you.",20Feb2019,2
30,"I posted this somewhere else already but I still need help.

I’ve been feeling pretty low and stressed lately. And I can talk to my friends and my boyfriend about my problems and how I’m feeling. But when it comes to talk normally about sports or films or projects, anything really, I struggle so much. I don’t know how to keep conversation going. I get uninterested and off. Especially if my friends talk about happy stuff going on in their lives, I get sad. 

It makes me isolate myself because the relationships are just not enjoyable for me, and probably not for them either. 

Does this happen because of depression or simply because I’m selfish and a bad friend? ",20Feb2019,2
