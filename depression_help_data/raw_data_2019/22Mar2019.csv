0,"It's been almost 4 months since the absolute love of my life broke my heart and all the promises that were made to me. I was diagnosed with anxiety as well as depression about 7 years ago, and my ex partner knew that, I made it clear. Yet she never realized what she did, did to me. After we broke up she would call me and tell me how useless I am, how useless I was, how I would never amount to anything, ever. I was cheated on multiple times and she's now dating the person she cheated on me with. I know that this might be wrong place to post this, but I'm sitting on an 8 on 2 week off rotation in West Africa, I have 6 weeks left, and it takes all my energy to get through each day, I hardly sleep, I hardly eat. I haven't been suicidal in a while, till a few weeks ago, and I'm hoenstly struggling so much, I'm so hurt, so broken, so disappointed and so destroyed. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the point of resigning, going home, and ending it all. I need help, please, if anyone can reach out, anyone, the loneliness is eating at me and I'm decaying very fast.

And it's like a physical feeling like I feel sad all the time like my neutral emotion and idk how to change that it makes me think like something is actually wrong with me like I have no reason to feel sad all of the time but I do and idk what to do about it.,22Mar2019,1

7,"So my friend who plays waterpolo has been wanting me to edit her a video of her waterpolo reel, and I stupidly agreed thinking that she already had the clips organized and all. But she just dumped all of the full hours of game footage for me to look through, and expected me to edit for free.
I told her that it would take time, but I stupidly agreed to do it for free. 
I’ve been extremely depressed lately and I am falling back into insomnia, so I’ve been pushing it off.
She texts me today asking when I’d get it done, and I tell her I’d get it done by this weekend. BUT then she adds on these words OUT of NOWHERE. “i rly don’t mean this to be rude, but why u so stressed dude? u do nothing so u should have time to finish all ur hw and stuff” and then I started to type of a huge mass text of me ranting, but then decided to delete it and just say “I’ve just been really depressed, just like everyone else at school”  which is the truth, but I added the “everyone else” to avoid talking about it. I just felt really shitty having someone say that I do nothing.
BUT THEN AFTER I SAY THAT she has the AUDACITY  to say “u don’t actually have depression tho” 
it sucks. I just sucks to hear that. I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and my therapist and I have been working really hard to combat all this and hearing someone say something like that is just so frustrating. Like it just invalidates so much.
I ended up not responding to her text and I am just sooooi excited to see her tomorrow.

I reach out, give him space, stay online for as long as I can in case he wants to talk (we're long-distance) but when he does, he's usually angry and tells me to go find someone better since being with him would not do me any good (his words). Then he starts pushing me away and saying really hurtful stuff to make me leave.

I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as I'd like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day.

11," 

These past few months have been hell for me, and I feel really guilty saying this because for the most part, my life should be a happy life and I feel like I take too many things for granted. I have a loving family and supportive friends, but it doesn't stop the suicidal thoughts. I feel like the root of my problems stem from school and the expectation to succeed that my Asian parents have placed onto me.

Going into my freshman year of college I had a plan to be a biology major and then attend med-school, but at the end of the year I was quick to realize that maybe something in the medical field wasn't for me. I didn't really know what else to do, so I decided to follow the footsteps of family and friends and attempt to pursue computer science. Unfortunately, my university has made it extremely difficult to switch into that major because so many students want to try to pursue computer science. During the fall quarter, I wasn't able to secure the classes that I needed to get myself on the track towards computer science, and I essentially just wasted my time by taking filler classes. What depressed me the most was the fact that I was wasting thousands of dollars that my dad(who is the sole provider of the family) had painstakingly worked for. I just felt so guilty wasting that money and I talked to him multiple times suggesting that maybe I should just withdraw and attempt to get the classes I needed at a later quarter to save the money, but he shot down the idea quickly. I know I am legally an adult now and that I should be able to make decisions for myself, but I really don't want to disappoint my dad as he's always been so loving and supportive towards me.

Fast forward to this quarter, I was finally able to get the intro computer science class that I needed and was finally on track to pursue computer science, but the class was significantly harder than I expected. I struggled immensely and for much of the quarter I thought that I wasn't going to pass the class. I felt like one of those losers who just sucked at everything they tried at. Those people who are always hopping from one interest to the other because they just aren't good enough at the previous one. I wanted my parents to be proud of me, but I had nothing to show them. I wish my academic struggles wouldn't cause them to stress and worry about me because that just makes me feel worse. To top it off, just when my grades were improving for this class and I felt like I would pass and be able to move on from it all, I was caught by my professor for working on a single project with people who weren't my partner, which is a form of academic dishonesty. I emailed her admitting that I had committed the act, and am still waiting for her response.

I feel absolutely terrible. I jeopardized my chance at passing at the class by cheating on an assignment that I didn't even have to do since I could've just had the score dropped(class policy). I know that I will probably be given a warning, but the fact that if I am ever caught committing academic dishonesty again, it will most likely result in significantly more severe consequences is gnawing at me. I used up my one free pass on an INTRO course for a field that will just continue to get more difficult in the future if I ever get to progress. I can't bear the thought of telling my parents that I might fail the class. I can't bear the thought of not knowing what to do with my life if I can't get into computer science. I've given it a lot of thought and I honestly don't know what else to pursue if this doesn't pan out the way I hope it does. I feel like i'd be better off dead, so I wouldn't have to stress my parents or worry about disappointing them. I feel pathetic. I haven't been able to get a good sleep in days as the guilt and thoughts of failure have just been eating at me. I wish I just didn't exist or that I could just go back to high school and do it all over knowing what I know now. I feel like I've just made mistake after mistake since coming to college, and my parents are just trying their best to be supportive, but are secretly extremely worried about the prospects of my future. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore...

16,"I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. He has always dealt with mental health issues, and they have been especially concerning when we first met. However, throughout our relationship, he's been doing great up until now.

He has been struggling with school and he deals with stress by smoking weed. Now the problem with this is that he was diagnosed with cannabis induced psychosis and he insists that smoking weed helps him. I keep urging him to stop smoking weed and he's been successful in not doing it, but he's gone back to it a couple of times and I think this might be one of the reasons why his mental health is declining again. He's been experiencing ""out of body"" moments and he feels like he isn't a real person. He experiences anxiety and panic attacks often to a point where he isn't fazed by these things anymore. Because of these things, he's come up with a plan to deal with everything.

As of recently, he's withdrawn from university and he plans on going to Mexico for one month for a teaching certification program (He has no teaching experience whatsoever, nor was he studying to become a teacher).He has already put the down payment for the program but he hasn't purchased the flight yet.  He is essentially planning on running away; He told me that he is going to write a letter to his parents and doctors, and send it to them right before he leaves. I tried to be supportive and understanding of his plan, but this is also something I am NOT okay with. He is also very adamant that doctors, the hospital and therapy does not work because he's been through it in the past. However I am trying to tell him that there are different forms of therapy and help that can be useful instead of what he has done before but his mind is completely set on leaving.

He told me the reason why he wants to go is:
- He is scared of being put in the hospital *again*
- If he tells his mom, he won't be allowed to go
- Relocating will give him mental clarity
- His problems will disappear
- The teaching program is a great opportunity

My reasons for him NOT to go is:
- If he chooses to run away without telling anyone, it will make his situation much worse
- Relocating won't resolve his mental health issues
- If he does not have the capacity to concentrate with his studies here, how will he have that capacity in Mexico?
- Going to Mexico is a short term stress reliever and once he comes back, it's going to be the same situation all over again

We had an argument about this last night and as I was leaving his house, his mom pulls up in the driveway. I was clearly upset and she asks me what's wrong. I didn't want to tell her because my boyfriend really didn't want me to but I felt it was the right thing to do. Next, we both go back instead of the house and his mom has a long talk with him about the situation.

After their talk, he is pissed at me and he tells me ""How can I trust you with things? I don't want to confide in you about my personal issues anymore. You ruined my trip."" 

I feel bad for telling his mom but at the same time, this trip is ultimately going to make things worse for him and my only intention was to prevent that from happening. I know how is mom is, and she WOULD put him in the hospital if he went without telling her. They already have a plan to improve his mental health but he is not going to try going through with it. I told him that this is not the right time to do the program because he needs to improve his mental health first. He isn't really talking to me at the moment and I am asking for advice on what I should do to fix this and if I was in the wrong...


TL;DR

My boyfriend, who struggles with long term mental health issues, planned on running away from home to Mexico for one month. I told his mom because things will be much worse for him if he did not tell them and now he is upset with me and doesn't feel like he can confide in me anymore. I need advice on what I should do, and if I was wrong.

25," 

My therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.

**The Power of Language: What is Cognitive Distortion?**

Cognitive distortion it is essentially a distorted, usually negative way of thinking. Also described as a “…biased perspective we take on ourselves and the world around us…irrational thoughts and beliefs that we unknowingly reinforce over time” ([https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cognitive-distortions/](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cognitive-distortions/)). There are several types of cognitive distortions, but they all have at least these three things in common: (1) it is a pervasive way of thinking of perceiving reality (2) it is always false or inaccurate, and (3) it can manifest into mental health issues. Interestingly, most people don’t even recognize cognitive distortions, I know I didn’t. I had been doing it for so long, it felt normal. And while cognitive distortions are never ideal, for obvious reasons, it’s probably hard to escape them for the entirety of one’s life. The real problem is when this way of thinking becomes persistent and chronic, not just periodic, which can manifest as depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. And cognitive distortion isn’t just a fancy psychology term. This type of thinking can inevitably rewire our brains, making it an interlocked facet of neuroanatomy (brain region) and neurobiology (important processes that occur within brain regions), two areas of neuroscience research I study intimately. In fact, rewiring of the brain is referred to as synaptic plasticity, or the strengthening or weakening of neuronal firing capacity, which largely underlies many psychological disorders. The point is, cognitive distortions can be potentially very dangerous and should not be ignored.   

Interestingly, there isn’t a lot of literature linking specific brain regions directly to cognitive distortions, and that’s probably because most research is focused rather on identifying circuits involved in the inevitable output of cognitive distortions: depression, anxiety, addiction, etc. That is to say, cognitive distortions aren’t a disorder, per se, but can underlie several disorders. My guess is that the brain regions underlying depression, anxiety, and addiction are the same regions that are rewired overtime by cognitive distortions. And, honestly, it makes sense that we don’t know a lot about the neurobiology underlying cognitive distortions. There are no preclinical models (i.e. animal research) that can accurately measure cognitive distortion. We have no way of knowing what animals are thinking, and it’s unlikely that most animals, I’d dare to say any animals, have the capacity to distort reality the way humans do. In other words, we can’t ask animals, “so, how are you feeling about yourself today?” This highlights a common problem in neuroscience: the limitation of using animals to accurately translate human behaviors. I digress on this point but will leave an open challenge for future generations to address this issue.

**There is No Shame in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy!**

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.

You know when you're so mad at someone or something that you want to hurt it? That's how i feel with my body. I fucking despise myself and it's like I'm hurting the thing that causes me to feel terrible. I didn't slit my wrist, but my legs. I felt a great deal of relief, but I felt such bad guilt. I dont want to do it again, but I'm afraid I will.
