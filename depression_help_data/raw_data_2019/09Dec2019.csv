0,"I've been afflicted with depression for going on 4 years, I've had my ups and downs just as anyone has. However, I've been feeling more and more inclined to give up my fight, I haven't reached a tipping point yet. I just want someone to talk to seriously about what's been hurting me these past few years. I'm not here to kill myself of to put my problems on another, simply put, I just need an open ear and I chance to connect with someone; anyone really. I can't lie, I'm drinking myself to sleep tonight, and i'm almost there already. I probably won't answer tonight, I just feel like now is the time to reach out before it becomes irreversible. I've anyone is open and willing to talk tomorrow I would appreciate it. I don't have anything to return for your time but gratitude. This is weird and I know it, I hope this works, because im out of ideas. Hopefully I can preface and say thank you Reddit? Idk, night Reddit folks, be assured I'll be here tomorrow.",09Dec2019,1
1,"I’m a 24 years old guy that’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was 14/15. I struggled hard in high school and suicide was on my mind a lot. College was a lot better, but I also discover alcohol for the first time. 
There was an instance when I almost killed myself drinking, cause I was mixing my meds and other pills. It would’ve been an accident, but it honestly would’ve looked like a suicide too.

I’ve been sober for 2.5yrs now, and I still think about drinking again a lot. It also doesn’t help that my irritation/agitation has increased in recent months. I get angry at myself and others for what seems like no reason and then the thoughts of anger turn into thoughts of depression and thinking of just ending. 

I’ve never lost my anger or control, but I just feel the need to lose something. Maybe I’m over stressed and just can’t find a way to relax.",09Dec2019,1
2,"For me every time the season changes I’m mood changes. When the cold weather comes in it effects my back pain from having 5 spinal surgeries but at the same point it effects My depression and anxiety. Today it was cold out and my make pain was worse than ever but I had a friend that I made a commitment to. To go hiking with. As we were hiking my depression and anxiety went away because of the positive feedback that the person I was hiking with kept saying you can do this. But at the same point she was trying to push me into going out to meet new people in life and that triggered my anxiety and depression more than ever. It triggered it to the point where I just kept shaking my head saying no I can’t! At this point in my life I can’t even look a person straight in the eye these days because I feel like I’m being judged. Depression and anxiety is always overlooked because so many people thing it’s just a faze but in reality it’s not. It’s mental illness that people can’t understand. I even told her I’m not the same person I was 7 years ago where I laughed, smiled and felt confident about my self. I’m a complete different person. Even going on the hike is the most biggest step in my life I’ve made I keep that to my self because I’m afraid that I am going to push people always that refuse to be pushed away. What I’ve learned today is that small steps means everything in life. Reconnecting with a old friend that you pushed away because of everything you have gone through means the world to your self respect. It’s a step to a new begging. Where it goes from their I don’t know not it feel good for one in my life! It’s a step to a new Begging in life!",09Dec2019,1
5,"I don't think I have a bad depression, but I am very unmotivated and lethargic. I don't do work for uni at all (I'm repeting the first year because I didn't study), I don't have any hobbies or the ones that I have I just don't do, I barely hang out with friends, I don't want to do things with my family... I'm in my room, make a mess, don't talk and just watch videos all day. Maybe it's more of an addiction than depression? But I was able to go without technology on vacations..

I really dont know where to start, i try asking my family for help but i feel bad because i already dont work and i dont leave the house all day. I apply to jobs but im in a constant struggle with my depression and its the reason i couldn't keep my last job. I struggled to get to my shifts and ended  up quitting. For me having a job was just a way to remain useful, i just told myself if i keep this job then im not as bad as i feel. But i never could keep it, and now even as i look to adopt dogs i feel im just prolonging the period before my eventual death. What would be the point of bringing a poor animal into this. Dogs are the only thing now that make me happy, i love them so much. Im not even a person anymore but ive been trying so hard to act like one and  now im just tired. I'm so sick of this sadness, its swallowed me whole and now i just live in it. I know you guys Will reccomend dog walking and volunteering so i wanna say ive tried those things.

21,"When I was 20 years old, I went to college aspiring to be a physical therapist. I was homeschooled and pretty socially awkward for most of my life up to this point, but I wanted to make something of myself despite being ridiculed most of my life, and having very little confidence in myself. I did very well in my first two years, despite fighting horrible depression my second year. I graduated from community college Cum Laude and transferred to a prestigious 4 year university. However, everything turned completely upside down after that. University work seemed to be exponentially more difficult than anything I’d ever done before, and it made my depression 10 times worse. I dropped out of school my first year and planned on returning the next year with a new perspective. However, they revoked my financial aid for dropping out my first year, and I was completely devastated. I worked for one year to pay off some debt and returned to community college to get good grades so I could appeal financial aid and return. I ended up with a 3.89 gpa, and they allowed me to return to the university under probation. If I failed or dropped any courses, they would take my financial aid away again. I did very well for the first year, and I was very close to graduation. However, I took one very rigorous course that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. My grades were pathetic, and my professor didn’t help me at all. Despite all of my efforts, I failed the class, and now all of my hopes becoming a physical therapist are completely over. I wasted 7 years of my life. I feel like a complete failure, and a total idiot. I couldn’t even finish my bachelors program, and now I have no job and massive amounts of debt. I can’t afford to see a counselor, and honestly I’m beginning to not even care anymore. Half of the time I just wish I was dead, and I have no motivation for anything in life at all. I apologize again for the long winded post, but I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do, and I feel like I’m stupid and a total failure.",09Dec2019,1

23,"Hello all, 

Let’s just start by saying this year has been a rollercoaster for me. 
I was in long term relationship, we got married, and not even 6 months in things changed drastically. The person I had loved so much just changed into someone I didn’t know anymore. He constantly threatened to leave because he said he would be better off alone, he would take off his ring and throw it on the ground when he was upset with me. He rarely let me leave the house to hang out with friends, and if I did he would guilt me to no end. Even though staying home consisted of me being in bed by myself while he played video games or did whatever he wanted to do. He called me a slut for going out to a bar one night, and that wasn’t the first or last night he called me names. He did like deny me affection, wouldn’t touch me or tell me anything good about myself. Eventually he started punching and breaking things, the doors and walls during arguments, and threw things at me. Even once threw a beer bottle at me in front of his parents, who didn’t stand up for me at all and just sat at watched it happen. I feel lucky that I saw what was happening early on before things got worse.

So I decided to leave. He begged for me to stay but I valued myself more than that. 

But I made a mistake. I let the dark thoughts creep in. I was heartbroken, this was someone I had been with since I was 18 and I thought there was something wrong with me. Was I unlovable? Did I do something to deserve what he did to me? 
I started distracting myself with drinking and partying for months on end. I had never physically been with anyone except for my ex until then, and suddenly I was having random hookups to make myself feel better, just to feel like someone wanted to touch me and make me feel like I was actually wanted. 
I had the opportunity from a family member to move away and start over, so decided to move 5 states away from the hometown I had lived in my whole life, away from all my friends and immediate family. 
Then with my stupidity, a drunken night with a guy I had been seeing for a few weeks led to a pregnancy. 
So here I am, about 11 weeks pregnant. All alone in a city that I don’t know, and don’t know anyone. 
The father moved away before I found out about the pregnancy, and even though I’ve thought about an abortion it really brings me so much sadness and guilt to think about following through with. 
I thought moving would help me get my thoughts together and figure out what I should do next, and help me heal, but all it’s brought is more pain that I don’t know how to deal with. Nobody in my life knows I’m pregnant besides my best friend back home, because I’m dealing with such shame having it happen so soon after getting divorced with a random dude. 
I have no energy or motivation. The joy in my life is gone. I spend my days barely getting out of bed, I don’t take care of myself like I used to because I just don’t care. Some days I cry but most of the time it’s just a deep empty feeling where no emotions come out. I was always such a happy person growing up and I feel like it’s all been stripped away from me these past few years. Something has changed in me and I don’t know how to get back to who I was. I’ve tried talking to my best friend about my feelings, but texting and phone calls only do so much. And even though she tries her best to listen and give good advice,  I can’t help but feel like I’m bothering her. I don’t even know why I’m here or what I’m looking for, if anything. I’m just hoping that typing this out and letting someone, anyone know how fucked up I feel will give me some relief. I know I should probably see a therapist but I’ve always dealt with anxiety and even thinking about calling and setting up an appointment much less talk to a stranger about my issues face to face makes me squirm. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post. For those that take the time to read it, I’m not in any crisis right now, I’m just reaching out to hopefully find some answers on how to deal with these things.",09Dec2019,1
24,"After visiting my family for a weekend Its obvious to me that I badly need therapy to deal with childhood trauma, destructive thought loops and severe episodic depression that have been building up since I was 7-8 (18y old currently) however I can't afford $250 therapy sessions every week on minimum wage. 

I have medical insurance thanks to my Dad so general GP consultations are partially covered but making phone calls is very distressing and while the idea of going to a GP to discuss my options seems like something I really want to do calling or going to an office and filling out forms and talking to a desk clerk are all things that trigger severe anxiety for me and I don't have anybody to come with me and support me so I'm here trying to figure out my next move.

25,"Hi all,

I’m a 25yo male that is recovering from a nasty burnout related to a toxic relationship, messy breakup, and toxic work environment. I pushed through my burnout for 6 months, piling more and more chronic stress on my system. Eventually it became unbearable. I could barely function. My memory, concentration, and decision making abilities took a plummet - I couldn’t do my work anymore, struggled to connect with others, started losing my sense of self, and mostly lost the ability to perform simple tasks. I became depressed and decided I needed to get out (my pride and ignorance of my health kept me from making that decision for those 6 months), so I quit my job and left the city I was living in.

I’ve been doing all the recommended things for recovering from burnout and have made some progress but still struggle with it daily (I’ve been away from the stressors for 2 months so far). I can’t help but slipping into depression any time my burnout hits and my mind shuts down - it’s hard to enjoy life or feel like I’m improving my situation when i can’t think clearly. My strategies so far have been: therapy, exercise, meditation, journaling, talking to friends and family, switching my environment, and rewiring negative thoughts patterns. I know I still have a lot of work to do for rewiring negative thought patterns but find it so difficult (sometimes more destructive than constructive) to try to rewire them when my mind is so agitated and scattered. 

The next thing I’m trying is spending a month with family, just sitting on the couch and watching tv. I hope that being in a safe environment with nothing for my mind to do will allow it to relax and recover from the chronic stress it’s been under. And once that relaxation is hit, I’ll be able to better rewire the thought patterns that contribute to the stress and poor moods. 

Another strategy I’d like to try is to commit myself to some kind of manual labor work for an extended period to achieve the same goal as above (give the mind little to think about to allow it to relax).

I’m wondering if anyone has gone through a similar bout of burnout/depression and if you tried anything beyond what I mentioned or have any advice on how to better handle my situation. This is the most challenging thing I’ve faced in my life, and I would deeply appreciate any support :)",09Dec2019,1

It's been going on for years. I've been messing with the idea that I might have chronic fatigue syndrome or MS or something like that because my doctor tested me for vitamin deficiency and I was only slightly deficient in D, everything else is fine.

(Mind you that she’s usually very talkative and always laughing or messing around) She finally goes to the break room for her break and I go back there to check up on her and she’s turned off the lights just staring at the wall and I asked her if she was okay and she just started crying, like bawling her eyes out and I asked her what’s wrong and she said that she doesn’t want this anymore she doesn’t like anything anymore and won’t say anything beyond that. She also has been put on Anti-Depressants by her therapist and when I asked her about them and if they were helping she said that they made her numb and she couldn’t feel any emotions.

They raised the dosage a month ago and I feel like shit, but I don't know if it's the raise that's making me feel like this. Maybe it's just stress.

I've had depression for the last 8 or so years and recently sought help after becoming suicidal.  
I've been taking antidepressants for just over a month now and the side effects haven't been too bad, however I've lost my appetite entirely and I'm losing weight pretty rapidly, in the last 4 weeks I've lost around 20lbs. (\~200lb &gt; 177lbs).  
I've been trying to make myself eat. I'm pretty good with making sure I have breakfast and a mid-morning snack, but as soon as it gets to around lunchtime I can hardly stomach eating anything for the rest of the day. Even if I feel hungry, I get a few bites into a meal and start feeling full and nauseous.

I feel like I may be getting into a bad cycle as I do have obsessive tendencies and have struggled to lose weight in the past which contributed to my depression. I've found that I'm unintentionally weighing myself now every day and continuously looking at myself in the mirror.  
I'm not necessarily worried about the weight loss itself, I'm more concerned about how to maintain the weight when my appetite starts to return to normal which is starting to make me anxious.  
I'm trying to get back into goo exercise habits in the hope that it will help keep me healthy.

My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just don't know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days I'm full of energy and (over) enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result.

I'm an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when I'm at the psych I forget a lot of stuff and/or forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story.

 Nothing I do really helps, even the things I normally love doing. Sometimes, even doing the smallest thing, like, for example getting out of bed, gives me an insane headache for the rest of the day.

43,"I don't love my mom n dad. They pretend but I don't get that love and affection either. This is since I am understanding things. Then I lost my sister, their ignorance was at there but I feel I couldn't understood her. This haunts me big time. So I came outta it or well trying to come out of it and getting these attacks in between. Now my dad is hooked to porn and a woman. Porn which is mostly into incest. Which troubles me a lot as I'm being married and having kids and we living together ( joint family, he watches porn of a kind father in law seducing his daughter in law). Though he respects my woman and my kid but deep inside it troubles me a lot. And it's again pushing me into very deep destructive mode. My wife's aware of my condition and supports me yet many of the times I hid it from her and sulk inside. Because we have a daughter now, I can't even finish of myself. This is the story of depression. And then sometimes I feel like I'm making a big fuss out of it and trying to gain the sympathy from those who know my problems and situation. It's driving me crazy to juggle on between these two conditions. Driving me maniac.",09Dec2019,1

45,"This will probably be all over the place, but Lately I don’t have the energy to do anything at all. My sleep schedule has been horrible and I don’t have the motivation I once had. 

I recently lost my girlfriend and stable job. It was my first relationship and I was in the relationship for a year. Shortly after losing her I lost my job. This all happened about 2 months ago, I thought I was over it but everything still hurts. 

I have very big dreams and goals in life but lately everything has just been so difficult. 

I also reconnected with a friend I met years ago and just recently told her that I liked her, and she told me she liked me back. But lately she hasn’t really been talking to me. I don’t know. 

I miss affection I miss being held I miss support.... I miss a lot of things.

46,"Hello, I am not sure what to do right now. This is my first year of college and the very beginning was great and I loved doing my work, but now I haven't cared for about two months and the semester ends Wednesday. Essentially I haven't done any of my work because it no longer matters. I am extremely unhappy because I can't get myself to care, so I question if this is something I even want to do at all.

I don't feel worthless, I just want to do something I feel I actually want to do. I felt before college I needed a break from schooling and now I feel dumb for not taking it. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I want to work towards something but this feels wrong now. College feels redundant and not an actual place of knowledge or improvement, simply a place where you regurgitate skills and info for the credibility for a field of work.

It sounds petty for a first year student to be this burnt out already, but I don't think it's because I don't care it just wasn't the right time. Lots of life changing events are popping up and I was already in need of a break from education. I feel I need to accomplish something else before I get into this or be in a better state of mind like I was at the beginning. I just need help",09Dec2019,1

48,"I am a 23 year old black male. I love singing, dancing, zoology/marine biology and other performing arts. My father was a radio host with an extremely deep, smooth voice and luckily that was passed on to me. I got my bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism, however, I am starting to regret it everyday. First things first, I have never liked myself. I was a very confident kind but after my dad died (he was my superhero who made me feel normal and that I was okay the way I am) everything went downhill and FAST. I lost all my faith, self-esteem and a year or two later after his death, I started struggling with my sexuality (I genuinely think I’m cursed). I never compliment myself on anything and am constantly nit-picking at myself. Especially over my appearance. Since I am a black male, I feel I should be this ripped, muscular, athletic freakazoid like 95% of other black men but I was cursed with this tall, lanky body and my athletic background is a joke. Growing up, I did not play football, basketball or baseball and I highly regret it. Since my dad made me feel so comfortable singing and being myself, I never thought to do it. I think if I would of played, it would have helped me tremendously in being confident, being myself and making other guy friends. I am 23 now and since I don’t play sports I don’t even remotely know how to make guy friends and since I’m black and not interested in athletics, I assume that they will think the worse or think I’m weird. I can’t stress enough how much I dislike my appearance and how much it bothers me. I constantly feel uneasy out in public and feel I’m being looked at by people. I am always told this is in my head. I know for a fact I am extremely clean, hygienic and well groomed but I think I’m so overboard with those things cause I feel like I have to do more since I am ugly. Everyone says I’m very handsome, attractive, etc but I don’t see it or believe it myself.  In high school, the “gay” rumor was thrown around me and it was honestly my worst fear since I was struggling. Now in adult life, I still feel it lingering over me. Luckily, after high school, I moved across the country to go to college and had a much better experience. I made friends who accepted me for me, had a great social life and was very active in my major. However, I still struggled with myself and my appearance.....

Fast forward, I graduated from college in May 2018. I decided I was gonna move back to my mother’s house, get a journalism job there and work for a while before moving where I really wanted to be...... majorly backfired. No journalism or radio jobs would even give me an interview. I went from one minimum wage job to the next while watching people I literally was in the same classes with, reporting the news on TV and doing all kinds of stuff behind the scenes. I wanted to do entertainment (red carpet, awards, etc) but it takes a long time to build up to that and needed a stepping stone reporting job. I decided enough was enough.... moved to NYC but I rushed into it..... you guessed it.... I am back at my mother’s house again. 

I am so unhappy with myself and my life. I wish I would have stuck with professional singing and marine biology, I’d be so much happier and probably have a career by now . I am trying to get back into performing but have developed stage fright since it’s been so long. I would like to make guy friends to go to the gym with cause I can’t afford a personal trainer but don’t know how to approach people for that reason and also don’t want to seem desperate or weird. I’m gonna be 24 in July, I have never been happy with myself since I was a small child. I hate where I live, I hate my body and I hate my lack of athleticism. I just need advice on how to tackle these demons I am dealing with. I am starting all over again from square one: trying to exercise, working on my voice by doing warm-ups, practicing and getting ready to perform again. I would love to get re-certified for scuba diving but can not due to not being able to secure a good job. 

More specifics on my body type: really, long skinny arms, big head, long neck, long torso, long legs. I look like I have an eating disorder (in my opinion). I think I look malnourished and disgusting for my age. I am 6”1, 175 pounds. I have extremely puffy under eyes with major lines/wrinkles. I have tried numerous creams/at home remedies to fix this and none of them work. I can not afford the under eye plastic surgery at the moment.

My senior year of  college is the happiest I think I’ve ever been in my life and I’ve been chasing it ever since. I don’t want to live in the past but my present is so unappealing. I feel like booboo the fool and a total failure. I worked my ass off just to be on my ass. Moving to NYC was such a bad move but I was so unhappy here that I left on a whim....now look at me, right back here again.

Any help would be appreciated...",09Dec2019,1
49,"I'm a 30 year old female with a strong family history of major depressive disorder, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I've always been an anxious person but I thanked my lucky stars as I got into my mid-twenties that I never developed major depression or bipolar disorder. 

Then, in late May when I was still 29, I woke up one morning unable to function. I felt empty and numb. I figured I would get over it. My life is good. I have a fulfilling career which I love, a supportive and healthy marriage, my own house, and I just got tenure. What more could I want? I kind of berated myself a little bit for feeling the way I did despite my many blessings. Anyway, this lasted for weeks and soon I stopped being able to eat. Even chewing and swallowing food was too much. I went from 115lbs to 103lbs fast. I couldn't even make it to the shower. I remember trying one day and it turned into a 2 hour nap on the bathmat instead. I was either staring into space or crying in my bedroom. All of my passions went out the window.   


Finally, in early June I sought medical help when my thoughts turned dark and I started to seriously consider and plan the unthinkable. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and put on 30mg of Celexa along with instructions to regulate my sleep times, eat healthy, and begin psychology consultations. In early August I finally started to stabilize on the medications and that's when classes began again so I went back to work.   


Prior to this, I had become VERY close with one of my colleagues. I considered her one of my best friends. I had tried to tell her in the spring before the depression began that I was feeling unusually anxious and she said something like ""everyone feels anxious because we are disconnected from each other and the earth"". I didn't think she understood what I meant so I let it go. In August, I confided with her about my diagnosis and treatment. She was very concerned about me taking psychiatric medication. She is very big on plant medicine and alternative healing. I told her that the medication was helping and she said that if ever I'm ready she knows a shaman who can help people kick addiction. Anyway, over the course of the next few weeks she'd comment on how much weight I had lost and ask if I really needed the medication. I was always kind about it. After that, we barely spoke for the semester and now the semester is almost over and every time we do talk it's super awkward and I feel judged.   


I have a VERY hard time coping with my diagnosis and my decision to take medication and this makes me feel so much worse.",09Dec2019,1
51,"So it turns out the bottom of the barrel that represents my life/depression/anxiety does go lower, I keep thinking I'm at the bottom and then things get worse. I'm desperately trying to fix my outlook on life but I feel like I'm spiraling out of control, I skipped work again today (PhD Chemical Engineering) and instead have just been sleeping and crying uncontrollably. I don't think I'm suicidal, I haven't seriously considered self-harm, though I do wish my problems or me would just disappear. The most I have done today so far was cry on my shower floor for an hour and a half, and watch some youtube videos while cocooning in bed. I had some coffee to avoid caffeine withdrawal symptoms and am eating some strawberry jello, I don't have the energy to find more food. So yeah that's my day so far, my BF of 5 years comes home in \~2 hours and I'd like to put myself together-ish before then. I also have 2 presentations on Wednesday for work that I need to start which is why I really need to get my shit together ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

I started Prozac 2.5 weeks ago at 10mg, my doctor told me to double the dose to 20mg since it doesn't seem to be working. My mother uses Prozac 80mg + Rexulti 2mg for Bipolar disorder, depression runs heavily in my family. This is my first time taking an antidepressant, I've had manageable anxiety/depression disorders for quite some time but it wasn't till I started PhD a year and a half ago that things really began to spiral. I have my weekly therapy tomorrow morning, Thursday an appointment with a university therapist to schedule with a psychiatrist, and two appointments with my regular doctor to discuss the Prozac. I also have an appointment Thursday to get my current hormonal IUD replaced with a higher hormonal dosage IUD. My Doctor, therapists, and I are pretty sure I have PMDD and I'm having a period every other week or more, hopefully the new IUD eliminates my period and fixes this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really sure what the source of my depression is anymore, I am miserable doing most things but I am particularly miserable doing anything for work. Running experiments, prepping presentations, TA grading, reading articles, even just being in the office with my coworkers. I don't want to be in PhD anymore but I don't think I could live with myself if I quit, I worked really hard to get here and I want the degree to land a quality industry job and make bank. But everything I do for my job I do badly, I have produced little to no results in the year I have been researching and I feel like I know just as much as when I started about my project. At this point I highly question the merit and viability of my project entirely. My peers have papers in the works or are/plan to attend conferences, and I have not done either. How can I find the motivation to research effectively when I can barely get out of bed to get strawberry jello from the fridge? Everyday I take a mental health day I just put myself more and more behind and feel worse about my situation. I can't make it through a regular 9-5 work day 5 days a week, how do I work the 10-12 hour days 6 days a week expected of a PhD student? I have two bosses (advisors), my primary adviser who actually pays me is very supportive and has been my personal cheerleader this whole time. My other adviser has very high expectations and is voicing my own concerns about the lack of data/results. I have not confided to either of them about my personal situation but I have been tempted to do so and potentially even ask for a medical leave of absence for a week or two, honestly embarrassed about the whole ordeal though.

52," I'm someone who loves people and human interaction but also is terrified of alienating people and being a bother. As far as I can tell, this isn't due to a self esteem issue, I personally am generally pleased with who I am, but I tend to assume that the only value people see in me is what I can do for them. As such, I tend to be over-involved in everything and have a very hard time saying no to things; I think I may have only once turned down volunteering for something this semester, and that is only after I had accepted and then realized I was in way over my head. I also tend to feel like if I ever go to talk to someone or ask for help I'm going to be perceived as a nuisance or a burden so I tend to deal with everything I am going through on my own.

I'm currently in university do a bachelors degree and have ended up leaving all my larger papers until the last minute; I have roughly 20 pages due in about 15 hours and by the end of the week I'll have to have written another 40. On top of that, I'm involved in the very large scale Christmas production at my church, which means I have to be there for all three dress rehearsals, which are probably going to be lasting from 6 pm to 12-1 am. On top of that, I feel completely isolated from people and have been on a downwards spiral for months, sinking deeper and deeper into a state of hopelessness and despair. I've reached the point where I'm simply in complete denial of all the work I have to do and spent the day wasting my time on the internet, unable to write a single word because that would mean admitting that I am staring down a mountain of work that I don't feel like I'll be able to complete in time.

I know I have people around me that care about me and that they are there for me, but as previously stated I don't feel like I can go to them because deep down I am convinced that I'll just be a pain/burden on them and that they don't actually care, they just feel obligated to. I'm someone who over-analyses just about everything, and my responses tend to be at least somewhat calculated, so I can't help but think that people will only fake interest and care for me while in reality they are just annoyed and will end up venting to others afterwards about how they had to deal with me.

I guess I'll stop venting now, I have mountains of assignments that I have to figure out a way to get through. Thanks for taking the time to listen/read.",09Dec2019,1

Oh and I have no grasp on the general flow of reddit's social hierarchies, whatever they may be. But today was monumental for me and sharing my story might help someone else.*

Pardon the F bombs.

It happened. It finally happened.

My hand helplessly flailing around in the darkness, grasping for anything to pull me out from beneath the heavy mass that’s been physically weighing me down and blinding me. It silently and discreetly passed by in the form of an unassuming sentence in “Organic Chemistry I for Dummies” that I finally opened and started reading this morning.

Here is my elaboration in the form of, ramble?

The sentence:
	“Just as many people want to be like the rich, popular person down the street who throws big parties every night (rather than being like the poor chemistry nerd pecking away at his keyboard).”

And all of a sudden I could allow myself to forgive myself for what feels like, everything. I am absolutely experiencing an overwhelming surge of positive emotions like my soul finally can breathe again, and I understand when I come down things will feel less intense (is this my disclaimer for future writings???).

I am actively trying to live an intentional life. In order to do so I need to be present in the moment as often as I can. And how else do I form a habit but practice? Being present allows me to begin to steer, NO... drive my life. If I’m driving, I choose the turns, the accelerations, the braking, everything. Detours, inevitable. Regardless, I do what is in my power (including accepting said detours and navigating them) to get myself wherever it is I’ve decided to go.

Now to tie into the sentence. If I’m driving, I know damn well why I’m doing what I’m doing, which also means that I made a choice to be there. Because of the experiences I’ve experienced in my (holy-fucking-shit-it’s-only-been-?!?!) 26 years, I know that I don’t want to be like the person down the street, but I can walk a mile in the wanting nerd’s shoes because I’ve worn them. I’ve also been able to get a peek at what it’s like to be the person down the street, despised the person down the street, and, in the current and thus most recent version of myself, I accept the person down the street as not only experiencing this reality in their own most complex, foreign-to-me ways, but also, as me. [enter the “we are all one” dialogue that, well that’s a different rabbit hole...]...and I feel myself starting down one now... 

BACK to the sentence. As I’m choosing to live now, I’m never the poor nerd because my mindset would squash the thought in an instant. But one of the past versions of me was the poor chemistry nerd. And what’s more, excluding cram sessions brought on by unparalleled procrastination skills, I chose not to be the poor nerd. I said fuck chemistry and I went to the party down the street. And for some reason, when I read that sentence this morning, I felt a flood of forgiveness. I could forgive that poor nerd because I knew what it was like to feel the desire to be like the person down the street. And I knew what it felt like to break free from that desire. And then I realized I only knew that freedom because I’d worked for it. I’ve read and studied and tried and failed, miserably and repeatedly failed and failed and failed, at being a better version of me. But along the way, wouldn’t you know it, I’ve grown. I just forgot. Because of my biggest, silent demon, I forgot that I’ve fucking fought, worked, and suffered, because I know I can be better. I can always improve.

So god damn it, me. If I can forgive this poor, theoretical nerd faster than I can blink, why the fuck would I not forgive myself too?

I forgive myself for saying fuck the chemistry and going to the party. I forgive myself for wanting to be someone else, someone that I convinced myself was better than me, or had it better, or whatever. I forgive myself for not driving my life for so long. And I forgive myself for my recent succumbing to the demon, and for when I inevitably succumb again in the future. I forgive myself for hating myself, being frustrated with myself, for beating myself up when I know that I’ve been sitting in darkness but haven’t been able to pull myself out by just relying on sheer willpower.

I forgive myself because I can’t do anything about what’s past. I can only fight to be better moving forward. My silent demon grows exponentially the longer it stays in the cold, in prolonged cloudy weather, inside. I’m not sick, but I’ve been losing my battle with the demon because I’ve been letting it grow. I just have to find what works best for me in finding a way to live peacefully with it. I forgive myself for ignoring the demon. For putting all of the pressure on my own consciousness and not accepting the weight and seriousness that is the demon.

I forgive myself because I am present. I forgive myself because the fresh burst of energy that accompanies these breakthroughs will help me pull myself to great things, and I know I get to ride that high myself. I get to enjoy things!
