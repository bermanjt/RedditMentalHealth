0,"~Sorry this is kinda long~
So I’ve gone more in-depth about my feelings in another post (link below), and think I may have depression. Along with symptoms mentioned there, I have moments where I suddenly feel sad, alone, close to tears. This tends to happen more often when I’m in crowded places (I tend to get anxious in very crowded places).

For example, at our school’s talent show (17f so still in high school), I sat with a couple of friends, not really talking just watching the performances, and I suddenly got really sad. I felt like crying but decided this wasn’t the time that I should just hold it in and be strong. So I did, and for the rest of the time I just felt miserable. Eventually my friend (I guess sensing something was off) asks if I’m okay. I give her a thumbs up (tears welling up but not visibly) and say I’m fine. 

I haven’t told anybody about this, (like my possible depression+anxiety disorder I don’t really know what it is yet). 

Something similar (to the talent-show-story) happened in class where I sat with a couple of friends and the teacher mentioned cancer. My grandmother died this summer from cancer, and I never really got over it, and am still very sensitive when people bring her up or cancer (like to the point where I’ll start to cry). 
Basically my friend (lets call her L) saw that I looked very sad and asked me “are you okay?” I looked at her tears welling up in my eyes, and said “I’m okay, I’m fine.” I told her I just thought of something sad that I’m okay, and she continued to ask what I thought of and I just kept saying I’m okay. 

A couple of weeks later I went with a couple of friends (L was one of them, let’s call the other A) to lunch, and my friend jokingly brought up how I tend to forget to mention important things, and mentions how I never told her about my grandma passing. 
Well something clicks and L asks if that’s what I was thinking of that time I got really sad; I said yes and explain I didn’t mention it because I didn’t want to talk about it because whenever I thought of it I’d cry. 

Later that day, I was talking to A, crying in the bathroom (previous incident not really relevant) and I explain to her how it’s okay to cry and how I almost cried when we went to lunch, and then started crying. 
Basically we told each other like “whenever you wanna talk about anything like I’m here for you.” At that moment I thought: “This is it, tell her, be honest.” We were going to have dinner soon so I never did, and still haven’t talked about it. 

I do joke about depression a lot (probably too much) trying to hide it, but now I wonder if it’s a) making people believe I am depressed, or b) making it abundantly clear that there’s nothing wrong (not the case at all).

I had some of the feelings I mentioned in my other post for a while, especially from 9-10th grade (basically worthless, fearful, fat, ugly, stupid, and anxiety through-the-roof)—(not super intense though, more occasional—but anxiety was constant.)

However this was all amplified this year (11th grade), especially after her death. Her passing made me extremely sad, possibly to the point where I became depressed. In addition to those amplified feelings I had (and still have) of random sadness. 

I’ve cried myself to sleep multiple nights, scared that I may be suffering from depression, scared to talk about it, especially since I tend to be very private (I don’t trust easily and when I do it still takes time for me to truly open up). 
I’ve thought about how I’m going to tell my friends (I don’t want to tell my family because I feel like they just won’t understand, and I want to be sure before I choose to tell them.) 

Also I have a friend that dealt with depression who has been open about it with us—my friend group—and everyone was so sweet and supportive, and I think she’s so brave to tell us, and I want to do the same. 
I keep having moments where I’m like okay I’m gonna do it, but then something happens, or it’s a bad time or place, or something else gets in the way. 

I’ve been bottling up my feelings for so long and sometimes I feel worse, like I just have to let it out. I’m thinking the next sleepover I can do it; my friends and I typically get into “deep talks” later in the night and I feel like this would be the best time to talk about it because everyone is being serious and it feels more private and personal. I’ve been trying to make this happen but something always gets in the way, and I’ve been pushing it back for so long. 

Also I’ve had thoughts of suicide, but I could never go through with it. For example I’d think: “What if I just jumped off a cliff, or just died? Would anyone notice? Or even care? Does anyone truly care about me?” I’ve thought about if I did do it like how, but always say: “No I can’t do that, I have to deal with my crap like everyone else, I have a life ahead of me and I don’t want to end it early.” ~So not suicidal~

Last month I came from school having abdominal pains, taking Advil, trying to just ignore it thinking it’s just hunger pain, eventually going to bed. Around 1 AM I feel it very intense, so I tell my mom, in tears, bent over, and we go to the hospital. 
Long story short I felt the worst physical pain I’ve ever dealt with (imagine bad period cramps x100~for guys a kick to the nuts x100~), and was hospitalized for about 3 days. 
In that time I was scared I could die (of course I didn’t show it but I was). 
I was also very sad since I couldn’t see any of my friends, but I got very sweet messages. One message L sent was, “are you okay? I love you I don’t want you to die.” 
Of course I received others too but she seemed the most concerned about me, asking every day how it was going, did they figure out what it was, am I okay, etc. 

I don’t think she realized how much that truly impacted me, because it made me feel so loved, something I really needed considering how lonely I’d been feeling. 

Although that helped, my feelings never completely went away, and I’m unsure what to about it. 
I’ve decided I have to tell my friends because I need support and reassurance, but I’m terrified and worried and thinking about it makes me so anxious, and after deciding that I’ll be open about it I have been obsessively thinking about it, like how’s it’s gonna go, how to say it, etc., and I feel like this further increases my anxiety.

1,"I am a very introverted person, and have suffered from severe depression all my life. I have isolated myself for so long that I now crave being around people. I am addicted to being around people but I wind up feeling just as empty as I did before I was with them. I know it isn’t healthy to feel this way. Being by myself doesn’t feel like as much of a sanctuary as it used to and being with people doesn’t make me feel better, so I’m confused. I will definitely be talking to a professional about it at some point in the next couple months, I was just wondering if anybody on here has been through this or is currently going through this.",12Oct2019,1
3,"Well, I've been suffering from depression for 4 years now, and it's not getting better. I've matured from the bad experiences I had, but scars are still the same. I've reached out to medications and advice but it just gets worse, since life isn't fair all the injustices, and isolation I faced were just ignored and disregarded and I still try to move on. At this point I have really no one to talk to and it has been months that I have talked to a person. Cause once when I was on medications where I was slightly getting better, but still had some side effects I tried to be social but was bullied again and I came back to my isolation phase again cause wearing a mask that you are happy is hard to continue. And when they slightly find out the real me always they turned to savage always in a mockery attitude which i really felt bad about myself. Lots of dreams and hopes I had when I was a kid to just to live a free life just went away. But since I'm now enjoying my alone time I really feel used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. I've got to this mess while doing absolutely nothing wrong in my life, just I'm in a bad society, with some bad people who'll never understand me who I am. I didn't do anything bad to regret about that's the only thing that makes me happy in my life. Was just abused, manipulated, looked down upon. I really love myself. I'm absolutely scared to be hurt again I had too much, people is what scares me, I hate people, I still wish for a better life, without these self centred people.",12Oct2019,1
5,"I have no idea how this is all going to turn out, but my Dad dying is just about the absolute worst thing for me to deal with right now. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with borderline personality disorder.  I feel like these past two weeks have been a blur where idk what to do. But at the same time, I cant cope. I couldn't sleep at all at first,  sleeping a total of 3 hours the whole first week. Then I couldn't get up the second week. Slept through 2 days of work and important doctors appointments.  Now idk what to expect. I'm falling apart. Anyone go through this?",12Oct2019,5
6,"For the past few years I’ve been dealing with mental health, and every once in a while, I have a day or two where I just don’t want to move from bed and just watch YouTube or a comedy show just to distract myself. These tend to go away faster than they came, but I’ve been stuck in a rut for months.

I know I’m not okay, and I’ve been battling depression for a while, but this just feels so different. A couple of times this month I have been on what felt like overdrive. I found the motivation to clean my room, so dishes, talk to friends, clear out my phone, play some games w/ family, and write a shit ton (one of my favourite things to do). Then, for the next week I go to try and do those things that I love, and find myself staring at the wall.

I just lay there, looking at the wall or window, and imagine all of the things I could be doing. Sometimes I’ll get a millisecond surge of inspiration, so I’ll start doing it, then pause, and stare at the wall until I give up and lay back down.

Does anyone have advice or tips to help myself get back into doing things I enjoy? I want with all of my heart to finish my WIP, but I just can’t bring myself to do it.",12Oct2019,1
9,"I'm terrified that I'm going to spend the whole of my life wanting to die. I'm scared of suicide and don't want to attempt it, but I'm also afraid of living. 

I'm so scared of failing the people around me but I feel like I'll do that no matter what. I haven't spoken to my best mate in days (a long time for us), and I'm both terrified of losing him and of letting him down by being a burden. I just..can't pretend to be happy with him right now, but I don't want to bring him down to my level either or worry him. Hopefully he'll forget about me.... holy fuck, what if he forgets about me?

I'm afraid of becoming overwhelmed by work, but I can't seem to get myself out of bed and get the work done. I'm too scared to face it.

I'm scared of leaving my room in case I see roommates. I don't want to talk to them or for them to see me like this. I need to eat but I'm afraid of going out to buy food.

I know I'm spiraling. I know the depression is taking over. I'm terrified of that happening, but at the same time I don't know if I WANT to be in control any more. I'm too scared of that too.

Fuck. I'm just afraid. Of everything.",12Oct2019,35
10,"I've never done anything like this, I've always struggled to open up about these issues. A year ago I had a really bad spell, It started spiralling out of control and it got pretty scary, but I was able to get on track and pick myself up and try and improve, now around 5 months ago, I told my partner that I was scared I felt like I was going back to that place. In the time since, we had a really rough break up, I lost most of my social life and my dad got the big C. I've been trying to remain positive around everyone but I feel like I'm falling apart, none of the things I enjoyed before bring happiness or peace now. At the moment it feels like theres no hope or light at the end, and it's just endlessly trudging through the shit. I know it will get better eventually,  I hope, but if anyone has any advice on how to get back on your feet or how to get over this weighted feeling, it'll be welcome",12Oct2019,1
11,"Hello everyone

So, a few months ago i made a post on r/selfimprovement asking advices to treat my depression, and in the following couple of months i had made great progress, i began doing workout routines and even started running, i was playing again, i was seeing a therapist, everything was getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

But things have changed now, a couple of weeks ago i started university in a new city and well, it's been very very rough on me.. the only close person i have went silent for almost a month now, my grades just keep going down compared to last year, im stressing more and more, just this week i didn't ate 3 days because i couldn't get up from bed, i learned that my grandma has cancer, im slowly losing my will to play video games again, and so on and so forth..

&amp;#x200B;

All that to say.. i liked how i was in the hollidays, making progress and all, but now with university and the stress of living in a new city and everything else.. i don't know, it's just so hard man.. so yeah, i figured i could ask for advices/support here, so idk, if you have any advices to give, im all ears

And thanks for reading",12Oct2019,2
13,"Hi everyone. I'm struggling with depression and PTSD, since the age of 15. I'm 29 now. Always been in full time work to support my kids. Any advice to prevent these episodes happening? Also dont get why I have -11 karma when all I do is try and help people. Please help me",12Oct2019,2
14,"This feeling of hopelessness been getting worse everyday. I  tried so many things and still not  able to rid of this shit, am on meds and it's not working. 

Worse thing is I lose my shit even on small petty matters especially at home, my family members are the victims. I can't stand the sounds of people crying, I get totally outta control when I hear babies cry. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, even I know my family is trying to help, I'd still shout at them. I feel like shit afterwards. And seeing them cry makes me feel like a piece of shit even more. Spiral continues. 

Looking closer, I  feel the worse feeling is feeling the hopelessness inside. Feels like checkmate, and you can't do anything to fix things. Totally hate that feeling. Feel like suicide many times but too chicken to do it eventhough I threaten my family I would do it. feel I am  turning violent recently, I  can't control myself when I'm angry, and I fucking lose my shit very frequently. It's pain for me, and for my family. 

I'm fatigue, I feel like a zombie everyday. I don't feel refreshed after my sleep, my sleep quality sucks too. 

Mother fucker I am losing it. I feel like I am drowning everyday. Is there any other way to solve this? I tried calling the suicide Hotline, but it's gets disconnect in my country.",12Oct2019,8
17,"I thought my depression decreases a bit since I I am in university and away from my family but god was I wrong. It’s reading week, I feel like dying because I have nothing to do right now and I had been so distracted by uni that I didn’t have time to listen to these thoughts.

Man it’s not gonna stop, it’s telling me to kill myself since the moment I opened my eyes. I wish I was dead so I didn’t had to deal with this. 

I don’t even have the energy to cry, my anorexia is literally also killing me right now and my damn anxiety (it just makes me want to puke because of overthinking). I don’t know what to do, I don’t think I can get help (I mean I could but I am afraid they’ll end up locking me up for which I don’t have time). Why is mental health not a priority for anyone?",12Oct2019,5
18,"I've dealt with social anxiety and depression for half my life, but I've never self-isolated as much as I have in the past 8 months or so. Hilariously enough, this is a result of me starting to recover from trauma bs. 

I'm terrified that anyone willing to be my friend just pities me, or will get sick of me and only stay out of pity, until I'm ""fine"" enough to leave. Both my sister and ex- best friend have done this to me last year, once I finally left a bad situation. The latter went further and basically blamed me for all the help that they offered, and said they've felt uncomfortable with me for over a year but pitied me too much to say anything. My sister, on the other hand, wants to speak to me again, but I don't know if I can trust her.

I worry that my trauma and depression is all people can see, but building more of an identity outside of that seems futile when its failed already. 

So I've stopped regularly talking w/ all friends except my girlfriend (who I live with). None of my other friends wished me happy birthday a few days ago, either bc they forgot or bc they thought I wouldn't want to be bothered. I'm disgusted at myself for being sad about that, when I'm the one who chooses to never talk. And I feel like it would be wrong of me to start. I don't feel like I deserve to talk to older friends or make new ones. 

Tl;dr: how do I make myself socialize again, when I feel disgusted for wanting that of others.",12Oct2019,3
19,"Okay, so let's start with the fact that I have a boyfriend who I've been with for 2.5 years and is very supportive through my depression although sometimes he gets frustrated that I don't really get better, in the end he's there for me. He has however a huge problem with making decisions and sometimes does make me more anxious because he can't choose between me and other things (activities, schoolwork etc.). I always try to be the best gf I can be even with my severe depression.
.
.
Next thing is, my dog died a week ago and a few days ago I started seriously blaming myself and feeling so depressed, I can't get up from the bed most of the day. 
.

So, the story. My boyfriend wanted to meet me today and later go to a party (I wasn't invited). When he said it yesterday, I was internally mad at him for partying while I'm having a rough time, but didn't say anything to not be egoistic. So we met today, it was nice, but when he was supposed to go I broke down and wanted him to stay. He didn't know what to do, and I, in my mental fuckupery decided to tell him I don't love him so he'd go and have fun, because I didn't want to mess up his day. In the end, I messed it up a lot, probably ruined our relationship and made everything worse. I feel kinda suicidal and don't know what to do. I called him and he says he is not mad and he understands, but I'm not so sure.

21,"Hi all- my (f29) roommate R (f27) and I moved in together with my partner and other roommate J 3 months ago. Roommate J and my partner and I were really close prior to moving in, neither of us knew R too well other than enough to know that we like her and get along with her. The first few weeks were great, R and I bonded a bunch, definitely saw some red flags. R lost her job and since then has changed dramatically. 

It’s been a week since I’ve seen her, she spends all day in her room crying - more like wailing? It’s been going on like this for almost 2 months. I reached out to some guys she has been seeing but they were less than helpful - I am wary of reaching out to people that might upset her. I tried to talk to her once but i was pretty much greeted with a blank stare. She did confide that, as I had suspected, she hadn’t eaten in a week. I made her food, I’ve tried to go into her room and talk to her but she is either always deeply asleep or pretending to be. I bought her food I hoped she would like but it just went to waste in the fridge. I texted her to tell her that I love her and I’m here for her, no answer and now her phone seems to be disconnected. 

Her public persona is super sassy, fun, bright and energetic. She’s a genius and people love to be around her. Prior to moving in together I thought she had a lot of close friends but I’m starting to think she doesn’t have any who actually know her. I only vaguely suspect that her family can be a source of stress for her. I basically don’t know who to reach out to or how to be there for her. I have struggled with depression but - I feel lucky to have a support system right now that wouldn’t let things get this far - I haven’t always had this but at least in my adult life I have. 

I feel like she doesn’t feel comfortable around me to confide in what’s going on, to be honest I don’t feel that I really know her. I’m super stressed about it - especially the wailing. I know she is on antidepressants and drinking. I know there is nothing I can say to “fix” what’s going on or make things better, but i want her to know that she can trust me. And also, I’m worried for her safety. 

People who have been in this situation before, too sad and in too much pain to leave your room and get out of bed for weeks, what’s something you wish a friend or someone would say to you or do for you? How can I tell if it’s serious enough that I should call on professional help? I’ve googled things but I’d love to hear from y’all thank you",12Oct2019,2

25,Here I find myself sitting in my dorm feeling dead inside not knowing what to do or how to help myself. I find talking about it is hard but I’ve decided to give it a go. I’ve never had depression or even felt depressed like this until 2 months ago when I came to college. I don’t like anyone seeing me like this and I find it hard to tell my friends or my parents or even reach out to a counselor. My grades are slipping I don’t have an energy I just wana stay in bed all day but it just makes things worse. I get lost in my thoughts of situations that can all go wrong if I were to tell someone how I feel. I don’t know what to do and Ive tried telling one person but I just feel as if there to far away to really help. I see everyone is always happy here but why can’t I. Why can’t I just be happy college is supposed to be the best time of your life right. I’ve given it time I’ve given it effort and everything I do just turns me away. I feel stuck and I feel like if I say anything I’d let down my friends and my family.ive  been wanting to say this for so long and it feels good to say it but idk how to keep moving forward. I don’t want to let anyone down anymore.I’ve been giving transferring a lot of thought but I still have so long before I could even do it and I don’t know how I’ll make it that long it’s been hard and I just want everyone not to be worried and help others while I can’t even help myself.
