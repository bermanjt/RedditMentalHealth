3,"I was at a party last night with many people I knew from my school (about 15 people were invited and only 13 stayed the night) and I hadn't been to any sort of party with people from my school since June of 2018. Throughout most of my time there, i was really anxious and hated being around that many people. One of my closest friends was there and he could tell that I wasn't doing all that great through the night and asked me every now and then how I was doing.

We were downstairs around 1:30 am playing some games (I was just watching) and I felt a little more comfortable than I was. But out of the blue, for no apparent reason, I REALLY badly wanted to cut again. I went into the host's upstairs bathroom and sat there for roughly 30-45 min alone. I was just breaking and I forced myself to text my friend who was at the party. I told them that I needed help and they came in and sat with me for an hour or so. We just started talking about random stories and it made me feel so much better. 

They're the only one that knows the full extent of my self-harm and metal issues so I almost always go to them for support. I hate doing it because (despite how many times they've told me the opposite) I feel like I'm such a burden and always talk about that stuff with them. Despite how many times they deny it I know its true. I always feel so bad immediately after I reach out to them. They shouldn't have to be there. It just really helps me when I talk to someone.

 I know tonight is going to be worse than last night because tonight I'm alone. And tonight I have things that I can use to do harm to myself. I can't reach out to them because I have so many times and I feel like im forcing my problems onto them.



EXTRA INFO:

I have a few friends who know but dont know how much this effects me

My parents dont know anything about it

I don't have any support besides my friends

I'm not telling my parents because they'll disregard it/not get me the proper help

I reach out to people because they're the only ones who can get everything off of my mind

Almost if not all of the old things I used to do to stop myself from self-harming dont work anymore and only talking to people about it does.

And when I say I talk to that friend a lot about mental health/harming myself I mean A LOT. I'm always going to them and I just feel so bad and I hate that I am. I feel awful for always doing this to them.

I just need to know what I should do in this situation. I don't feel like I'm going to be able to survive tonight.",18Mar2019,5
4,"I'm 30 years old, been single and alone for a year and a half and about a year ago I was first to arrive when my grandma called for help, I found her dead on her bathroom floor, she had fallen getting out of the shower. 

Since then I have had no interest in anything. I don't play video games anymore, I don't go out, I don't even talk to people anymore. My social interaction for the last year has been limited to people at work and the occasional trip to the store. I hate what I've become but I can't seem to do anything about it. 

I don't necessarily want to die, although I think about it a lot, because I have a kid and don't want to do that to him. But I can't help feeling like my current state is probably more detrimental to his health than me being gone. ",18Mar2019,1

6,"Hi guys, I am a recovered depressed person. I went through severe depression and anxiety for my whole life up until my recovery over the past few years. I went from being suicidal and self-harming to being the happiest I’ve ever been today. 

I started a blog telling my story and I have addressed some topics that I thought would be important. I’m reaching out to this community because I want to know what the hardest problems are for people who may already be on medication and are looking for natural, brain-based solutions to be happier. 

For example, I’ve previously written about how to fall asleep, how to handle stress and anxiety, etc. by using mental techniques leveraging how our brains function.

I want to write about what people like me want to read and I was hoping for other opinions besides my own.

7,"So let me explain, I (think) I’ve had anxiety for some time, and depression only in the last few years. 

Within the past 1-2 months it’s gotten bad, really bad. No suicidal thoughts, but constant relationship anxiety, sadness, bouts of sobbing, lethargy, lack of motivation, getting joy out of almost nothing, etc.... it feels like it’s been an exponential curve of growing depression. It’s definitely now the worst it’s ever been. I am seeking help, have a first doctors appointment for it next week. 

I just don’t understand anything anymore, have no control of my feelings anymore, and the slightest things trigger me at seemingly random times (sad music, small jokes I take the wrong way, etc..) 

There hasn’t been any recent events that I can think of that would’ve made it get this bad. The only thing that happened my life was that my mother in law (not married, but she was basically my MiL) passed away in Jan of 2018.

So it’s weird...it’s gotten real bad real quickly. Is this, I dunno, common? 
I guess I’ve always had this notion that depression was a slow burn that developed over time,  not something that bursts through the curtains and is like “hey I’m here to really fuck you up!” In a matter of a few weeks",18Mar2019,2

My girl is having dysthymia or light depression as she had said to me. I m not sure the differences between light or not light but surely has. The problem is that I am totally a positive person in my life who loves her very much and I want to do everything I can.I have already understand a lot of things for how to communicate or helping her in difficult periods. But in these periods except all her things that has in her mind and fell pessimistic the erotic in our life tends to zero. I don't have problem with that as I can understand that it is something else the reason that she does not want me and not that I have done something.But I am afraid that in these times maybe connects in her mind the feelings that she does not want it with the feeling that maybe she is not sure about me. Maybe she is not but really the other periods seems the exact opposite and also apart from that everything works very beautiful.I don't know a lot to these things we are young(about 25 years old) and our relatioship is only 8 months.

Kind of stupid since i consider myself someone really rude and intolerant in many ways, months passed and i had various reasons since many years ago that lead me wanted to commit suicide. By this time we were already dating. Even though it was a lomg distance relationship i felt i had a good time with her and i actually loved her. After my suicide attempt i went to a psychiatric ward because of my parents, i lost any kind of contact i had with her. And months after that i saw she was with someone from her city. It really broke my heart. I tried calling her and mesaaging for a long time and after many tries, she finally answered. She showed me many screenshots about she actually looked for me quite often in social media. This of course for some months after that i guess she decided to move on. I am not saying she was wrong. Is just.. Something felt odd about it. ",18Mar2019,9
12,"This is going to be a long one, so saddle up.

I've had mild depressive episodes, but nothing that major. This is my worst one yet. I have thought about the idea of suicide almost every night (not actually going to go through with it) but as something to escape what I'm feeling. My friends know that I have these episodes, but I usually just hide it from them. Whenever I bring it up, there is an awkward cloud hanging in the air.

My parents don't know about it. They think I'm a perfectly happy, 15 YO who is just slacking off in school. My parents expect the best of me because ""I'm a smart kid"", that is all I've ever been told when I'm struggling in school. My regular grades are fine, but homework is almost never handed in. I can't find the motivation. They have a weird thing about homework where I HAVE to get all of it done, otherwise I'm a failing student. I have not handed in all of my assignments this term and report cards come in on Thursday. It's too late to hand them in and I know they will be pissed. This is just adding to my anxiety.

My parents have no concept of what being insecure feels like, it seems. When they discovered my older half sister was cutting her wrists because of depression, their first thought was to yell at her. I remember that night clearly when I heard the yelling above my room. They don't understand how it feels to just bottle it up all inside until it bursts. I could never talk to them about it because they aren't that supportive. When I first tried to bring up the topic of how I was loosing weight, they yelled at me because I was ""perfectly healthy"", I was 80 pounds overweight. During one of these discussions/arguments, it led to me to getting my health card to go to the doctor to see if I'm malnourished. I never went. They hate the doctor for some reason. I haven't been in over 4-5 years, and same for the dentist. I have 2 other siblings and this is the same thing for them. The only form of doctor I've been to is when I almost broke my arm and the walk in clinic.

I guess the reason why I came here is to ask how I can get help. I have no money from a therapist and talking to them about it won't do me any good. They use it as some sort of weapon on me when I told them I was insecure about my weight. they said ""Do you need to go to a therapist? do you want to end up like your &lt;half sibling name here&gt;?"" Like I said earlier in the post, I will never go through with suicide currently, and when I do I hope I will seek out help. I'm really stressing about Thursday because last term they took away my PC when they found out that i was missing 7 assignments. I probably won't be able to respond because my wifi shuts off in an hour and I also have school tomorrow. I will try to respond in the morning but, no promises.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

so, I don't really have anyone to talk to. I feel like I am all alone and the friends I have at the moment will leave me soon enough like every other friend I had in my life.

I just want to talk about my life and I just want... support. I am crying nearly everyday and I just feel like dying. There is nothing for me that gives me some kind of purpose in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother was a single mom. I loved her so much as a child, but at the moment... I do love her, but not unconditianlly. 

I have two older half-brothers (two differen fathers). When I was one year old my mother ran away from my alcoholic father with my brothers and me. At least that is what she told me. She came to a little town where everybody knew everyone. We where polish living in Germany. My mother came to Germany when she was around 25 years old with her first husband (as well alcholic).

I hated going to pre-school as the first person do every bully me was my teacher. Yes, she shamed me in front of all the ohter children although I only remember one time. I drew with pencil on the table at 5years old. She came to me and said: ""If you can't delete that you will have to pay for the table."" In front of all the other children, loudly. Doesn't sound so bad, but to a sensitive little girl who cried easily? 

Of course all the other children started to act like the teacher because if the teacher does it they are allowed to act like that as well, right? Because a teacher is always right. (Fuck you Mrs. Veil) She even shamed me about my name, that it's written falsley which wasn't true at all because it was in my polish passport. Don't remember the things tho. But because of the size of the town every child went to the same school. After pre-school there are three possible schools a child can go to: Hauptschool, Realschool and Gymansium. The ""dumb"" ones go to Haupschool and the ""intelligent"" ones go to Gymnasium. Well, I went to Hauptschool. And the bullying from my first year in pre-school never really stopped. I was nearly drowned by a classmate when we were around 8 or 9 years old, they tried to inflict physical pain, wanted to shame my by putting stuff into my backpack and accusing me of stealing it. 

The thing is tho... up to my 14-16 year I don't remember much. Really, I don't. My life... it doesn't feel like a normal life. It's as if I am computer where so many things where deleted. 

And then there is my mother. My mother which I adored. I was so depended on her that it must have been unhealthy. I always wanted to be a good girl, to never make her mad. (I guess because I witnessed how she beat my brothers with a belt but I do not quite remember it. Just a tiny bit.) 

Turns out she is a toxic mother. She sent me to ballet and to piano lessons. Which is fine but... she constantly critizised me. At every fucking turn. Everything I did felt never good enough for her. My brothers? Never really helped me with the bullying. Yes, my mom went to the teachers to complain etc but it never held long until the bullying started again. 

When I was 13 I tried to kill myself. No one knows about it. I wanted to drown myself in my bathtub. At that time I didn't know I had depression. Heck, up to three-four years ago I didn't know I had depression. Never even knew that was a thing. I was around 22 at that time. I slept with a knife under my pillow just in case I wanted to kill myself. The only thing I remember from that time is crying. 

But with my mum it also got worse. When I was 22 I went to study for half a year in Great Britain. Sometimes I think it was the worst decision of my life... other times I think it was the greates. In GB the depression started and I realizied I would really kill myself if I stayed there longer. So I went on an Erasmus program for the second semester in Belgium. When I got back home after that one year... my mother was highly religious. Yes, she was religious before, me too, as we are from poland lol but... my God. She... She went crazy. 

We had a huge argument after I came back. Around two weeks after my arrivel I guess. It was so bad we screamed and I cryed and I hid in the bathroom. Somehow she opened it up and stupidly I though she would try to talk to me and we could hug it out, but what does she do? Sprinkles me with holy water because she thinks a demon took possession of me, or something like this. From then on her obsession with religion got only worse. She started to believe every world in the bible to be literally true. Evolution is just a scam for her. No, she is not a flatearther, nor is she a anti-vaccer. Still.... the believe is destroying her. 

I am a chaotic artistic person as well. I want to make my own money through art. My mom is very tidy and wants every room to look like a fucking IKEA catalogue. Which will never be possible while I still live with her. 

Now my depression got worse again through the last couple of months. I can't sleep good as well and suffer from Insomnia. An houer ago my mom came into my room at around 4 am in the morning and critzised me for not being able to sleep, that it's my own fault and that my chaotic room is responsible for my insomnia. Oh, and my Assassins Creed poster is as well responsible for my sleep behaviour because ""It looks demonic."". 

The worst of all which brought me over the edge and gave me a panic attack: ""Are you even human?!""

Yes, mum, I am a human. Just because I am not your ideal daughter doesn't mean that I am not human with feelings and needs. 

Sometimes I really wish she would finally die.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day... I just want someone to truly love me and be there for me. Like I would be there for that person. But... sometimes I don't have the feeling that I am capable of loving someone as I have never been able to fall in love, be in a relationship or hold any relationship I ever had in my life.

I got a call from the hospital last night - he was thinking about killing himself again and was very suicidal to the point of inpatient admission. We have not been getting along, in fact we argue about finances a lot. I try to move us forward - I want to buy a home... start our lives. I feel like he works against me.. taking out personal loans, credit cards without talking to me... one step forward two step back. While we still have to pay for this wedding. None the less of the stress of nursing school. I just don’t know what to do... I am not sure I want to stick around anymore. I know that’s terrible, but I feel like there is no communication. He has turned to other females... likes the attention. I assume. Usually sexual nature type conversations - has apologized but still hurts me a lot. I feel as if I am not good enough. I’m not sure how to cope with him... what am I doing wrong? I often wonder if I’m the reason this stuff continues to happen. I’m wondering if I should go my own way...

22,"So I am a nineteen years old dude from Germany. I have worsening depression since I was sixteen and in the last few months, it became so bad that I have suicidal thoughts daily. Don't worry, I am too afraid of dying and still have reasons to live. My problem is just that these thoughts just come and linger for hours and make me unable to do stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had cancer in 2001 (meaning I don't remember it) and had one kidney removed and the other one was 60% removed. You can imagine, that it is impossible to fully recover from that. Long story short, I had a transplantation in December 2018. I am now immunosurpressed, can get sick from everything and always have to wear a surgical mask, whenever I am outdoors. This of course sucks a lot. People in the streets look at me as if I am some sort of murderer (even though I always wear a suit and fitting coat) and I always have difficulty breathing, since I am also not the fittest guy (I am just very thin and light). 

My body too, looks even more hideous since that last operation. I already had a deformed ribcage since birth, have a big straight scar that I had from the operations when I had cancer and now another, big curved scar on my abdomen. Add two scars on my chest I had from the catheter I got for a few days of dialysis and the small scars for the tubes from when I was a baby, and well, my body looks ugly. 

Seeing this thing of course brings all the memories and feelings I have about the matter back, and they just have become too much for me. Since I was a child I knew that will never be able to live as long as other people, even if I live a perfectly healthy lifestyle. And this time definitely was shortened since the transplant. Add my dependency on a few pills I absolutely have to take on time, to surpress my immune system, and a normal person would probably already have depression. Well, I have other reasons separate from that too, which just makes it too much in the end. 

One half of my suicidal thoughts are related to my health and the body. So my question is, how can I shut these thoughts away? I just want to look into the mirror again and not have a breakdown when I stare at something that is not my face. ",18Mar2019,2

 I don't want to come off as attention seeking liar , but he's a real person at the other end of my phone. He's been getting some kind of help, but the hospital is not the greatest and they legally charged against him when he lost control (none harmed except furniture).

He writes songs, and I can see the rage and the loneliness. I have no idea how to help him, he did go over to a therapist but he gave up after a while. It wasn't working out. I have no idea how to help him out, I don't just want to give him support as a friend, but I want him to live and get help. 

I don't want him to give up, but he's enraged about how society is so judgemental. Is there any group that I can get in contact with him? I want to nudge him towards therapy. I want him to try even though everything feels awful and shitty.

Some days are good , some are very dark days. Should I give up? He's given up on trying. I don't want to let him give up. I want to someday visit him and say hey,let's go get pizza, and that he'd have something worth doing in his time, living his life. Honestly sometimes it ticks me off and makes me think he's lazy.

I suddenly turned off, I couldn’t talk, I felt sad, scared and alone. I live with an ex (but our relationship hasn’t changed a lot, he just wants me to get sober), he’s been supportive, but I pushed him away and then begged him to talk to me. He said he had to get out of the “depression house” (this was day 4), which I also called in sick. I asked if I could join him he had gone to watch hockey, I barely spoke and just sat trying not to cry. We went home and I picked a fight. I called in sick again today. I just lay here and think bad things.

I don’t do anything for myself, I don’t even know what I like. I go to aa and I just get so scared I can’t share. I am so scared to start again, I have someone who has tried everything and I know it’s me that needs to change and I don’t know how to like myself.",18Mar2019,4
33,"My spring break just ended and it was supposed to be a vacation. I spent the week with my grandma like I usually do for school breaks (I'm 18, senior in hs btw) but instead, I just felt like I was back at home with my father and my step mom and how they fight constantly. All the time. And who's the person they always go to whenever they need someone to hear them vent? Me of course. And my grandma did the same as they do. Which is fine, I don't mind listening if it makes them feel better. But, I don't know, I guess it would be nice if they could extent me the same courtesy sometimes. Instead, they just,,,well do they don't really do anything to be honest. I'm kind of the ignored one in the family. No one likes talking to me, I'm always brushed off during family gatherings no matter how hard I try to connect with people. It's the same with people at school, so I've just given up trying to make anyone like me. Instead, I drink myself into a coma (and I make it no secret, either). I'll get absolutely wasted right in front of my grandma. She never cares. I'll get wasted in front of my uncle. He never cares. I'll get wasted in front of my dad, in front of my step mom, in front of my step mom's family. No one ever cares. Even when I was still underage. Even when my dad found out about my self harm 2 years ago. He hasn't done or said a thing about it. I get away with so many messed up things that I shouldn't be doing. Alcohol? Fine. Cigarettes? Fine. Weed? Fine. Cutting? Fine. Acid? Fine. Starvation? Fine. I feel like I'm cycling through all these horrible addictions that start out as just experimentation because no one cares anyway, so why not? But then I just spiral down further and further until I can't even handle being sober anymore. I truly have turned into the worst version of myself possible and I wish that my parents could actually be my parents for once instead of forcing me into that role with their kids all the time. I wish they would stop brushing me off and blaming me for everything that's gone wrong in our family, accusing me of things that frankly are not my fault. My step mom especially. She and I got into a huge fight a few weeks ago, and during that fight, she made sure to bring up every one of my flaws and weaknesses and use them against me. I ended up winning the argument, but now I can't look her in the face. It sucks, too. Because she and I had a pretty good relationship before hand. 

I don't know. Maybe I'm just a brat, maybe I'm just over dramatic and just want attention. I don't know. I guess I just had to get this out there. ",18Mar2019,2
34,"I wake up and this instant dread comes over me. I feel mad and sad that I’m here another day. That I have to continue feeling this way. I saw a psychiatrist for the first time last month, she prescribed lexapro. I bought the meds but I never started taking them. I just don’t know if it would even help. 
I don’t know what to do or how to feel better, I just don’t want to do anything to even try. 
Please help me change my mind.. ",18Mar2019,2
35,"I recently shared some parts of my mental health with my family. So my question is this: what should I expect them to behave after sharing this with them? My experience telling them wasn't pleasant and I don't know if I'm at fault for sharing or if I'm at fault for expecting a certain behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's what happened:**

I am 24, female. I've had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because that's when I went to see what's wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I wan't expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why I'm always upset when they show up like that. (all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally).

&amp;#x200B;

I've told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house that's far from work. (my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places) I kept telling them I'm not ready and I just need more practice. (I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500$ learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous) So one day they said I'm a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I can't drive. They first said there's no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldn't diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldn't let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because it's a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help. I said it could take years to heal some never do beside I can't afford to see therapists at the moment. she sent me a link with affordable therapist to contact.

  
After going home my mom spoke to me about what she heard. She asked why I never shared this with anyone before. I said because you're my family and I rather not let you worry about me. She then asked about it and I told hear some symptoms not to scare her so much. (she's a doctor so I picked my words wisely) she then said that I shouldn't have shared this. I asked why? she said your brother in law heard. I said so what? are you ashamed of me now that I saw therapist once. That my mental health is not golden? That in your society I'm considered crazy now? I never got an answer... 

It's been couple of days now and nothing happened. Nobody talked to me about it. Nobody asked about it. nobody read about it to know what the hell I experience. it's nothing. Like I never shared anything like they just don't want to think about it or even acknowledge it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it my fault for sharing? is it my fault for expecting at least some interest in knowing what I have? they are my family after all and I feel that's the least I should expect. Is it because what I shared aren't considered as important as depression? (I can never share that with them)

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your thoughts and experiences or advices for how to handle this.

Sorry for the long read but I never share anything with anyone and this is a first for me. ",18Mar2019,5
36,"I'm a pretty solitary person. I rarely talk to anyone on or off this internet. I think I'm happy with this. I've tried the normal life for a couple years and have reverted back to my introverted, solitary ways regardless. I've rarely felt happy or enjoy many things. Most of the time I'm fairly blah. I'm perfectly fine with this and I usually am pretty bored unless I'm working on class work (university engineering student so I am not bored often lol). I find most things boring, even video games most of the time (which I'm sad about bc I loved games growing up). 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this, I'm fine with but one thing. That's feeling like I don't want to live anymore. It happens occasionally when I'm stressed out or extremely frustrated. It's pretty much always bc of all of the schoolwork I have to do or an upcoming exam. My life is completely consumed by schoolwork which would be fine if I were comfortable in it, but I'm constantly behind or don't understand stuff. So that just frustrates me more. The last time I wanted to die was about an hour ago. I was frustrated at having spent my 13th hour (non consecutive) on a homework assignment. I wasted two hours of my life sulking and looking up various ways to kill myself. (Finally found one that doesn't make me scared. It's the one where you put a bag over your head but pass out from innocuous gasses like helium).

&amp;#x200B;

So what are some ways you've found to counteract these random depressions. (I'm a very pessimistic person so when people say enjoy the flowers or life is so awesome, I think that's really dumb in my opinion. That logic doesn't work for me)",18Mar2019,58
37,"So basically, I'm still a piece of shit kid who's been depressed for almost 5 years now (getting worse at a compound rate), and no-one knows. I intend on keeping it that way.

38,"everyday i woke up always something has to fuck me up

everyone tells me that you should cry so you will let out your sadness but every time i cry in pain

my mom stops me and tells me to shut up and i am very selfish

you will ask why i cry well since the day i found out that my sister had paranoia i cant 

it makes me so sad seeing the person who raised me having this and being treated like a trash

i hope anyone at least help me here...",18Mar2019,9
39,"I’ve been working through depression for almost 5 years now. It wasn’t until this past year that I reached out for professional help but it made such a huge difference. Two months ago I moved to a new country to start an 8 month long internship. Things have been mostly good so far - the good days are incredible and the bad days have been few and far between for the most part, but these last couple weeks (and especially today) have been really difficult. I’m feeling especially down, homesick, and I can feel myself slipping back into a bad place. Just asking for some support ",18Mar2019,1

42,"I got fired from my job on Saturday. I was only there for less than two weeks. I hated it, but I needed to keep it because I need to pay rent. I don't know what i'm going to do now. I just feel so trapped and it's driving me crazy. Normally I'm a really nice person, try to be respectful, but I went off on my boss like I've never gone off on anyone before. 

It happened like this: 

First off, I'm on an SSRI that's really worked for me, but because I fell under full-time at my previous job, my health insurance ran out. (I know, that was an irresponsible thing to let happen. I know) anyway so I hoped I could somehow regain health insurance before my prescription ran out. Couldn't make that happen, so I've been steadily decreasing my dosage (so I don't go cold turkey) to where I'm at now, which is about a quarter of where I was about a month ago. I got hired at shit-job right as I was stepping down to the quarter dosage. My new manager (not the guy who hired me) decided that for whatever reason I didn't belong there, so he went out of his way to make me feel small and unwelcome. (watching me constantly to catch any mistakes, yet never encouraging me when I didn't make mistakes is one example) Mind you, this is my first week at new job. It's not complicated work, but in a new position some mistakes will be made. Just his overall attitude towards me felt really personal and unprofessional. I was stressed to begin with, but this guy seemed to be actively trying to make my job harder, which is the opposite of what HE'S THERE TO BE DOING.

 Drinking and depression have been a constant struggle in my life for a long time now. I realize that the two go hand in hand, so my plan was to not drink at all once I dropped down to this final dosage. I was doing good for a few days, started exercising again, stocked up on all of the supplements that I thought I might need, tried to sleep better etc.. Then Saturday night rolls through, and it's my first really busy shift (it's kinda like a shitty sports bar with food) PLUS people are out partying for st. Pattys day. This place attracts a reeeaaally classy crowd if you know what I mean. people falling off of stools, eating most of their meals and then demanding a refund for no good fucking reason, puking. that type of shit. But I knew that going in, I was expecting it. what I wasn't expecting for my manager to be worse than these shitty customers. Even when it's super busy he finds time to come over and stress me out more, which creates more mistakes, which gives him more ammunition to stress me out with. It was like this horrible downward spiral from hell. 

Towards the end of the night, I'm constantly fighting off panic attacks, I'm a fucking MESS. At this point, I don't give a shit about anything anymore and I pour myself a nice big glass of tequila. ahhhh, the relief that I felt instantly was kind of like slipping into a nice hot bath tub in a freezing climate. I start laughing and joking with people, feeling like maybe things are gonna be ok. In my head I'm plotting to wake up early tomorrow, find myself a better job, and make sure that big dumb fuck is managing while I flip the bird and walk out of that place. That doesn't really pan out. I drank a little bit more. 

Now we're closed and I am trying to get the F out there, but before I can do so dick-head manager says something to me, and I don't even remember what it was, but the tequila had loosened my lips just enough to let something slip out. He immediately jumped on it like a hawk, like he was just waiting for it. He instantly retorted ""OH YEAH WELL YOU CAN JUST GET YOUR SHIT AND LEAVE!!""

Knowing that it was over, and I had nothing else to lose, I let the levy break. I went into a fit of rage like I had never experienced before, blacked-out. I don't even remember what was said, but I remember feeling surprised that it was coming from me, and I remember the look of shock in his eyes. I remember him getting in my face and me hoping that he would touch me so that I had reason to physically hurt him. In my mind, he had won, and now I was fucked. the next thing I really remember, I'm at the end of the two hour walk to my house, it's past 3am, and I'm crying.  

I fucked up. It was really bad timing, an accumulation of shit and stress that pushed me over the edge. And alcohol. So now I'm here, feeling very low with about three days worth of meds left, no job, no money, no hope really. It honestly does feel good to write it out though. If anybody's reading this, well, hi.

43,"So ive been majorly depressed for about 5 months now and 1 month ago I started getting aches in my body mainly my legs and joints. The pain and ache wanders but is mostly in arms and legs. Pain meds dont really do much, benzos help a little bit. The aching is almost ruining my life on its own since its on my mind 24/7. Could this be because of my depression? Am I hypersensitive?

Has anyone else had this? How long did these aches last? Any tips?

Thank you and keep fighting.",18Mar2019,1
44,"Hey, new to this subreddit so sorry if this isn't a original post but I just want to talk to  people that can relate.

I've had depression for over two years now and I'm the type of person to bottle every single emotion up. Within the last month or so I've finally decided to get help... I've been placed into a group talking group (don't know how else to describe it) in my school and I've been attending it for over 5 weeks now. I have opened up significantly more than I expected but I just don't think it is for me; no one seems to understand me and I respect that as I'm going to be honest have no understanding myself. At the start of it all I knew what was getting me down and giving me suicidal thoughts but since then more issues built up, it got worse and now everything is a cocktail of uncertainty and misunderstanding. It frustrates me so much that I can't understand and explain it to others. I am numb to all emotions now and didn't realise I was happy for nearly a week until it got stripped from me again. People sometimes take being happy for granted and right now is the only thing I ever want...

Thanks for reading my partial rant and hope some people can relate. ",18Mar2019,6
