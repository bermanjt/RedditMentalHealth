0,"I'm a 16 year old college freshman and I'm confused if all this is just how I am and me overthinking or if I have a mental health issue.
I have to constantly search for a reason to get up from bed, I never have energy and have had a headache most days for over a year now, I get irritated easily and have a hard time remembering things from my daily life, I have no interest in any activities except watching videos online, reading online stories, surfing the net, listening to music and the idea of language learning. I try to avoid social interactions as much as possible, and only desire to eat &amp; sleep. I do try to participate in class but I can never concentrate and always feel like my contributions are useless. I hardly participate in group activities and do my part alone. I get apathetic and feel like ""sure whatever"" about everything. I have a very hard time making decisions and always go with the most familiar option on anything. I have no real passion and always feel like I'm on autopilot and just do what I have to, I get fidgety and restless whenever I'm in the presence of other people and sometimes can't breathe properly (but never enough to panic). I sometimes (rarely though) think about suicide and long to feel the sting of a blade but I don't act on that urge because I'm a coward and always feel too tired to care about actually doing any of it.
But I'm not sad all the time, I mostly feel neutral. I'm attached to alot of things and have people I don't mind seeing and chatting with (never actively seek them out but if we bump into each other, sure why not). I ALWAYS find something to do like sleep, watch videos, listen to music etc so that I have something to feel and react to and not have any spare time to get into my thoughts because they're rarely ever positive. I'm actually a teensy bit upbeat &amp; quite smiley if need be (i.e when I'm around ""friends"" -_-). There are things that make me laugh, cry, want to chuck my phone across the room &amp; feel happy, giddy, sad, angry etc but most of it is online stories and videos. I always have an automatic smile when I greet or talk to someone and sometimes it feels genuine. Even if I feel hopeless like I'm being useless and wasting my life and get real apathetic about school work, I still try to get good grades.",02Mar2019,3

2,"TLDR: Summarized my situation asking for advice on dealing with isolation in a middle-of-nowhere hick town in SE USA.

I've been doing this ""thing"" for about 6-8 years. The thing in question is being depressed. A lot of the time I was in denial. I hate terms like ""suggering from ___."" Even the phrase ""battling ___"" sounded to me like I was dueling some insurmountable encumbrance. I'm a rhetoric major so I split hairs onnthe meaning behind words.

I am putting myself through college. I'm graduating in May after 3 years. 2.5 of those years I worked 2 kitchen jobs in an emotionally abusive and manipulative corporate kitchen. But they were the best pay in town and I needed food and tuition. 

I've done a lot to fight my dark spells. I DM tabletops that I've written, I finally got a better job doing SEO. I'm even going to graduate if I manage to finish my thesis. But there are still times, sometimes evenings, sometimes days or weeks, where I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I'm not smart enough, not x enough, not y enough. If I listed it all I'd need a TL:DR for my TL:DR.

Basically I feel isolated. Always. I worked so much that I don't have many friends. The friends I do have are more circumstantial than true ride or dies. My family doesn't believe in mental health and they don't talk to me much since I left home for college. 

I feel like I'm barely managing, but I want to see it through. I guess I'm asking for advice? How do you feel less lonely? I've tried leaving youtube on auto but i usually get sucked in and revert back when my phone dies. Idk. Therapy hasn't helped and I guess now I'm looking for home remedies a la essential oils.

Any thoughts are appreciated. 

Thank you for your time.",02Mar2019,2

I desperately want to live but it’s turned to shit and there’s no way up I lost the fight.

5,"(I will not say my age, but i will say that i am in secondary school) For a while, people have started to notice how I've changed, at the beginning of the day I'm alone, I do have friends but choose not to be with them, then at school I'm happy and mess around with my bffs,after school I again choose to be alone.

Recently we had to write lyrics for a blues songs, and I did mine about deppresion, I think that was when my friends actually noticed, I don't have any problems at home, although my parents are strict. I don't want to tell my parents because they'll just say ""it's just hormones"", I'm not even sure which makes it even more difficult

My main problem is that I'm confused, I don't know if I have deppresion because of when in at school and happy. If you have any advice please tell me, I'm really confused

Sleep disturbance, described as insomnia or hypersomnia, is one of the primary symptoms of major depressive disorder.  


People struggling with depression are likely to have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.   


The tricky thing is that sleep deprivation (insufficient sleep) can also lead to depressed mood, moodiness, and irritability.   


It can be difficult to decipher which came first, the depression or the sleep disturbance.

14,"never fear world, in my inability to draw useful cards for the game of life, i have managed to draw worse ones.

i've often said that i got dealt not the most amazing starting cards for life (i don't excel at anything with real monetary compensation, i look like a potato, and i have a super slow metabolism). my life has decided to grant me very few friends where i am now frustrating one of my friends because they keep trying to set me up with people. i keep trying to explain to them that like i don't date for a few reasons mainly because eventually they realize that my depression isn't the beautiful pop culture depression where i'm a little sad sometimes, it's like i will just lay around and not leave my house for days. which is apparently inacceptable, which means that i've been dumped a lot in the past because of my depression. because of that i've just learned to preemptively avoid relationships (of any kind) deeper than surface level interactions.

i'm not sure if i want advice or just wanted to rant about this.",02Mar2019,11
18,"Throwaway account because I don't want my boyfriend reading this. (He doesn't stalk my account, just wanting to be safe.) This is also one of my first times posting so apologies for any formatting errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to begin. I'm 19 (F) and I feel like I have been suffering from depression. All my life I felt more sad than normal, specifically in high school I went to sleep every night feeling ""sad"" because I was going through a major existential crisis. When I met my boyfriend junior year I started to feel happy, like I had a life outside of my video game addiction and toxic friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have been in what feels like a steady decline, mostly over the last 8 months or so I want to say. I lost that toxic friend group. I started living on my own because my mom moved out with her boyfriend (only been dating 5 months) and my older brother has moved out to be with his boyfriend. This was all pretty sudden and I feel like it's feeding into my loneliness. I suffer from anxiety and this can make it hard to sleep some nights when I'm alone (I leave a light on with the T.V. when I sleep). I can only see my boyfriend once a week because we go to different schools. School has been killing me (in my 2nd year of college). I need perfect grades to get into this program. It has gotten to the point of being obsessed with perfection and I cry and get uncontrollably emotional/ angry when I get a B on an exam. The only way I can calm myself down is by running to the bathroom and crying because I have no outlet or hobby. It has become so toxic to my relationship because of this obsession, but I cannot control my anger. At the end of the day I feel worthless and that I'll never be good enough for anything/ anyone. I even get angry/ overly emotional if my boyfriend says the wrong thing to me. He's good to me a lot of the time, I just don't think he understands and I have an extremely hard time talking to him about this stuff. Now I feel sad a majority of the time, and numb other times. I can barely get out of bed. I only leave my room to go to school or to the bathroom. I have lost a lot of my appetite and I have absolutely no motivation for anything. What made me fully realize I needed help was that I told myself right before bed ""I wish I wouldn't wake up."" (I have not told anyone about this specific thought. It happened last week)

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have been pinpointing specific problems, but that's not all of it and I don't think it's an 'excuse'. I don't know. I just feel so fucked up in my head and I can't control myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already been seeing a school counselor, but I am having a hard time being honest with him. I don't know how you just talk to someone about this stuff. It feels like every teen under the sun is ""depressed"" so I'm afraid to say I am because I'm not faking how I'm feeling and I just need someone to take me seriously. I feel like I need to see an actual psychiatrist, but money is tight and I don't know how to talk to my mom about it. I already promised my boyfriend I would tell her and try to get help, and I want to tell her and get help. Just don't know how to.

20,"Hi everyone this is my first time posting on reddit.  First of all, I'm a student and graduation is almost here YAY!!! Anyway, Half of my 2018 was fun. I met new friends and built our everlasting friendship or so I thought. It was September 2018 when life started going downhill. I was brokenhearted for the rest of 2018. Basically, there were many misunderstanding in our relationship and ended up doing the best thing to do. I talked to my friends about it but they've grown tired of my drama. I ended up blaming myself for what happened to my first relationship. There were self-harm during the sad half of my 2018. I felt like nothing is going to make me happy. Everything was crumbling. I almost failed two of my courses. My situation was getting worse. I shut down everything as in everything. 2019 has come. I rarely talked to anyone and always wear a fake smile. The only instance that I'll talked to them when something is academic-related. As much as possible, I don't want to interact to them. It is not because I'm a shy person. I just don't really have the 'feeling'. They don't care anymore. Nothing good is happening to me rn. As day goes by, I feel like I'm getting worse and worse. This feeling of isolation is addicting. No one really knows what is happening to me not even my family. Two of my friends noticed what is happening and asked me but I rather not answer those. Nothing is going to change anyway. 

Sorry if there are any errors. 😭 I'm trying my best. ",02Mar2019,4

22,"I am a 27 year old man who has recently come to the conclusion that he is toxic. Here's why.

I cannot tell if I do not care about anybody else's feelings other than my own, and I only do things to get something for myself. If I've fucked up in a relationship or I've hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people.  I am always the nice guy in the relationships/friendships and I've started to think that I'm just some beta-male that should've been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep and/or get irritated with the company to the point where I don't want to be around them.

I just got a promotion in my job and didn't even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied 'yes' straight-faced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in self-pity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage.

Thus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything.

I never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom. I don't want to be this person.",02Mar2019,69

I’ve been having issues in my relationship with my bf whom I love more than anything. Last week we had problems with him not being responsive and making me feel annoying whenever I talk to him. Today I found myself sabotaging that relationship by being mean and short with him. We’ve talked about it and are okay but I’m worried I’ll do it again.

I’ve also been drinking a lot at random times of the day and I am someone who usually doesn’t drink much, maybe once every two weeks. I’ve been drunk the last three days with no plans of stopping.

I also withhold food from myself, not anorexia or anything, just some sort of self punishment from what my therapist and I have been able to tell. 

I’m currently a student right now and got back an exam in my biochemistry class with a poor grade. I studied so hard for days so this was a tough blow. I went to talk to my professor after the exam as he offers test corrections for better grades and started crying in front of him and had to run out. I skipped the class on Friday and I told myself it was because I didn’t want to face him (and he records his lectures and puts them online so it’s okay) but I’m unsure if that’s true.

I don’t want to talk to any friends or family about this because I feel like I’m annoying and a burden. I cant see my therapist until next week because it’s spring break for my university ughh now.

I'm a graphic design student now and I'm doing my degree project this year. I also really enjoy graphic design and have always been good at it. the problem is, we don't get to choose our supervisors in our university, so they got me a difficult one... 
he manipulate students and make them do whatever he wants, and I couldn't even get to choose my own project subject...
the funny thing is that he has a bad reputation in the department, yet he manages to get students to work with him and he probably gets away with his behaviour because he is the oldest professor in the department. and I was told by students and other professors to be patient and do as he says in order to graduate. so I was patient... sometimes he yells at me whenever I'd like to give my opinion in my project, other times he makes me feel stupid. It’s like he is the enemy instead of being on your side and I was really patient with him at class but whenever I get home I had to deal with several anxiety attacks and yes I'm already on medication... but it's still not enough to calm me down. Now he wants me to steal some other designer work that is posted on the internet and present it as my own work which is really bad and could risk my career if I get found out by the jury... and I really tried everything I could to make him change his mind... but he wouldn't even bother looking at my own work and order me to do as he says.

I started getting theraphy with the first serious suicidal consideration, and have been attending sessions also around 3 years ago. I didn't admit to myself that I had depression back then and only last year I couldn't deny it anymore, I wasn't feeling almost no joy, the pain was horrible, I felt distant and had no motivation to do anything. I just held on to my college routine and managed get through the year with a ton of improvement.

I started sincerely laughing again this year, my anxiety settled down and I understand myself well enough to make my panic attacks not crippling. Things are improving, and I'm proud of myself even if I can't feel this joy very well.

However there are some things that are making me lose hope, the fact that I rarely want to do anything still remains. I have to be dragged along by other people to do stuff or occupy my mind with either distractions or sometimes weird nonsensical projects that I never find the energy to carry through untill the end. At the end of the day I don't want to actualy do them.

And I feel that my daily life hasn't changed much as well, I'm kinda stuck-I feel stuck. I try to enjoy new experiences, but the payoff is rarely enough to keep me trying. I enjoy these new things, but never enough to compell me to go after them naturaly. And I only need one bad experience admist a night out to make me want to isolate myself, they hit hard as hell and it's becoming harder and harder to want to do new things on my own. Now whenever I wonder what I want to do with my day my head becomes this weird haze.

I'm confused on what's the next step with my life, and then I wondered if I should take the antidepressants. I pushed through without them because I denied them, I am scared of them. My therapist offered them twice, everytime I thought taking them would end up killing me inside and becoming contempt with everything like some ""happiness pacifier drugs."" I'm a proud idiot basically but as of now I already feel like a zombie sometimes with no desires and passions, I'm already emotionaly numb, I'm already meek as well. Even if these drugs did that, which I don't think they do, I wouldn't be losing much honestly.

But I'm still scared people, I'm very very scared and I want to ask what sould I do, can these things help me out of this eternal gloom? What have been your experiences with them? I'd like to know, please.",02Mar2019,11
