0,"I know, it sounds bad but I’ve been depressed since I was 8. I’ll be 17 in March. I’m self conscious and insecure, to the point that I dwell on everything wrong with me, all day everyday. I haven’t had a serious relationship ever, and I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll be lonely forever. People say things like “you’re young, you’ll find love” and yet some people don’t. It sends me into panic attack that I’m still single, and every girl turns me down like I have a disease. I wish I knew what was wrong so I could possibly change, im not the most attractive, I’m down right ugly, yet there’s others that are more that find relationships. Help.",03Nov2019,0
1,"I’m on a cocktail of drugs for a bunch of different mental disorders. I wish my brain would shut off, or the drugs would just make me numb. I had really bad mood swings yesterday; overly horney, crying hysterically, grinding my teeth, the whole 9 yards. I’m conscious during these episodes, I know what causes them. Then the episode passed, and the crying stayed. I texted some of my friends, my closer friends were supportive, but again I realized that I’m just a toy to most people. They really don’t care how I feel, just that I do things for them, pay for meals, put time in effort into things they enjoy. Atleast that’s how I think it is. I’m losing it, I think I’m too far gone. Last night was the worst suicidal episode I ever had. I thought of how I’d do it; pictured it in my mind. The knife in the kitchen, the gun in my dads closet, a belt in my drawer and the beam in the garage. I’m still there. I’m still lost in thought. I’m quiet, my family is worried, but that doesn’t matter. I just don’t want to be me. I hate me. I’m so alone. I tried to remember what a hug felt like. A real hug. I couldn’t, I just started crying. It doesn’t  feel hopeless, I know the way out. I just need the courage.",03Nov2019,1

3,"This is not as serious or important as others, so only focus on me if there is nobody else to talk to. A million and twelve other posts on here are significantly more urgent than this one.

I had a page long rant writeen before, but a summary is more effective.

I had a huge self-worth issue for a majority of my life where I viewed myself as nothing more than a stepping stone that only got worse after a very dark period of my life this past summer. My post history still has some details up, if you happen to be intruiged. Either way, I managed to get help and I spent a good few months somewhat happy with myself, but I feel myself slipping back.

Mainly, I've noticed that all of my friends only talk to me if they need or want help or advice. Nobody texts, calls, or invited me anywhere. If a friend is struggling with something, they come to me first, but once their problems are resolved, some of them even go so far as to ignore my attempts to reach out.

How am I supposed to think of myself as a person if everybody treats me like a stepping stone?

Sorry if its a long one. Dont worry about responding if you dont wanna.",03Nov2019,1

6,"I have a decently good life. I have 2 good parents who are still together, a loving brother, and a perfect girlfriend that I wouldn’t trade for the world. I’m going to my college of choice for my major of choice. Life is going for the most part, the way I want it. But even still, often I feel depressed, lonely. I don’t understand this. Is this common?

7,"I am done with all of this. I've never had any real friends, never been in a relationship, i'm not close with any family members, and the only texts I receive are from my parents, which usually just keep mocking me for not having a girlfriend and asking when i'm finally going to go on my first date. 

When I was in high school I was addicted to pills, and I also developed an eating disorder, and nearly died twice. I remember spending time in mental hospitals, spending time in intensive care, etc., and the only person who even came to visit was my mother, who came once after an overdose, and she just said she was disappointed in me and grilled me about why I did what I did. 

In the past 3 months I've lost 3 friends, one to suicide, one to a drug overdose, and one to cancer. I feel like i'm going to explode, and I don't know what to do, and I don't have anyone to turn to. 

I need advice on how to move forward, and how to get out of this situation, please. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this anymore.",03Nov2019,4

9,"My life wasn't bad nor was it good. Everyone has a story to tell and some are worse then others. Mine however, people will read it as a horror story or some source of entertainment. But in truth its happened. The best way for me to say this tale though is through a song style so brace yourselves for the truth behind mr.missunderstood....

Growing up was a stretch for me and it destroyed me mentally;

Making me think things that I shouldn't, having me want to do things that I knew I couldn't.

But I did and it killed me on the inside and the demons I deal with are not out but on the inside. Everyday has me feeling faded and weak and got me wasted an on my knees. Fighting to forget then black out into a trip, waking up the next day freaking out screaming hoping someone hears my ple

 I cant escape nor can I sleep without remembering and acknowledging the demon mistress succubuss sleeping next to me on my right while on my left is my soon to be wife.

 Fighting back trying to survive has me realizing I'm not okay and i need help but i cant tell because I have tried and they locked me up while I cried I was pleading and screaming for help since I was 9. I finally got false hope when I was 13 locked up in a room with my mind having me cry and wanting to die then screaming why! 

I knew what the doctors wanted to hear knew that the truth i had underneath would only make them feel fear so I knew what they wanted as a result and I gave it to them and lied while they pried and by the time I got out my brain was fried. Wasnt the same any more after the meds they shoved down my throat making me numb I wonder why.

Lets fast forward to me being 15, in highschool and I was the fat lonley teen, sitting at the stairwell while everyone went to lunch and I cried behind the scenes. I wasnt alone I had a familair face there next to me the demons in my mind who keep tormenting me; telling me that it was my fault, he died because I wasnt strong enough, my mom was raped because I wasnt brave enough, I was molested because I was to weak, and i couldnt lift off the ground fast enough. 

Thats just the beggining I smoked weed tried to forget, popped pills to get the high to stick; then washed it all down with a fucking 5th. I did this for 6 months and my mom knew what was going on but didnt say a thing because she was drinking too but she was everyday. I cant forget and I cant live with the strip of my life taken away.

I just want to stop being hated, doesnt seem to matter how hard I try everything seems to not be appreciated and while I'm dealing with a shattered mind thats decentergrated, i can smile and laugh and make it seem okay if we were evet associated.

Putting a mask on has been easier then I thought so i lived with it until I met someone who saw me for who I was not. She destroyed my mask and ripped it off of my face that it was glued throwing it away while cuping my face saying ""let me take a look at the real you."" She saw the demons in my eyes she say the fire I had inside and most importanlty she saw the deep pain ive beeing hiding and fighting shouting silently with my cries.

She held me close didnt let me go, told me, ""I will help you battle them you can't win this war alone."" And for the first damn time someone understood after 3 years of being friends I finally felt a weight lift off of my shoulders but it didnt last. She stopped talking to me because I was going around wearing my mask, 

I lost contact then I was alone again i pushed the only one who cared out of my life and it was my own damn fault the demons were right thats when I joined a cult, it wasnt the best for my humanity but I said fuck it because I didnt have much of a human psyche.

I broke, and I've bled, choked and then came  more tear shed; they threw me out for being to involved. Said fuck them because they couldnt evolve. I tried a different path but while walking on that cobbelstone to the checkered floor I saw the white flowers stained with red surrounded by gore.

Just like ken turning into sasiki, I forgot who I was I forgot my past me but i knew there was still a demon wrapped up deep,chained down inside of me. I heard its shackles I heard its pleas telling me its still here and that ""You cant do this alone you FUCKING NEED ME!"" 

The more I chose to ignore it the more it screeched then I broke and and my chest caved and I saw while laying on the black ground seeing my blood leak; covered into a sticky crimson puddle while having him stand over me, smiling with the red eyes and I knew his name, it was my own demon. My duplicate. My version of the broken centipede kanike.....

Hope you guys can relate... We all have demons.. We all are ghouls... 
We
Are

10,I’m almost 18 and I’ve never even been close to the experiencing the feeling of love. I’m so fucking lonely and depressed i just want someone to talk to always and stuff.

Loss my mom 3 months ago. 
I found her. 
After caring for her and seeing her struggle with stage 4 cancer that had spread. 
I watched her turn into someone I didn't recognize. 
I watched her leave me. 
No friends. 
Well I did have a friend but she asked if I would sleep with her and let her cross dressing husband watch. 
Altho they know I have a gf and don't cheat. 
I wouldn't otherwise. But still.  
My brother is moving 2hrs away from me soon. 
My sweet gf lives 3hrs away and I don't know when I'll see her again. 
She's fighting her way through a divorce and I'm in school. 
Which has me more stressed than I've ever been. I have 3 finals coming up. 
Or I've wasted $3000 and 3 months
And will prove my family right 
I feel my self sinking further downward 
I don't do dishes. Or put up laundry. 
Or pick up around the house. 
I do the basics. 
I care for my dogs more than myself 
Because I don't know how
Now that I feel this way. 
I feel forgotten about from my family. 
Insignificant. 
Besides my brother. He calls and invites me over. 
Until he moves that is. 
I don't feel as if anyone thinks of me  
There's no proof that they do
My gf does

12,"Similar experience in terms of depression. I’ve always been a very happy-go-lucky person(my mom said she never saw this, but my school friends all think so) but also have suffered with anxiety my whole life that sometimes caused panic attacks, but very rare depression episodes. Since my freshman year of college I have had some bigger depression episodes. It is now my third year of college and my depression has become so bad that I had to come home from school. And the depression keeps getting worse. I hope it wasn’t drugs that had caused this (that would mean it was my fault). I didn’t do any drugs until my freshman year of college and sophomore year I began smoking weed almost everyday.",03Nov2019,1
13,I’m extremely jealous of my sisters friendships. I had no friends in hs and I’m watching her with her multiple different groups of friends. The difference and what I think caused my problem is that I went to private hs whereas she goes to public. I’m having a hard time not regretting my hs experience. It was great for my education at THE TIME but it was bad for my social life and I got a lot of extra academic support that I don’t get in college so I was not prepared.,03Nov2019,1
14,"It’s just, nothing is fun anymore. I’ve fallen into a routine and it’s boring as hell. There’s nothing I want to do. I get my homework done, show up to work, interact with my housemates, and put on a happy face. I feel so lonely, but in many ways I kinda like it. I don’t want to have to go through the effort of talking about how I feel. 

I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years now. It’s not really doing much. The thing is, there are still things I want to do in the future. I can see my life ahead of me. I just don’t want to exist right now.

I’m laying in bed because I don’t have the energy to be outside. I’m so tired, but I can’t fall asleep. I don’t want to increase my antidepressants. I hate pills. I want to quit them but my psychiatrist doesn’t think it’s a good idea. I’m also diagnosed with ADHD and it sucks. I need a purpose and I don’t have one. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I just don’t have the energy to do anything anymore. I don’t feel anything anymore. I just want to fall asleep and dream, because at least my dreams provide an escape from the mundanity of everyday life.",03Nov2019,5
15,"Today I went to a photo gallery event by myself and talked with people. Mind you, I'm really bad with conversations and feel really awkward interacting with people. I kept pulling out my phone to avoid feeling a lone but I tried my best to avoid it which worked.. sometimes. This is a first step towards change and I know damn well I've made some awkward moments with people who I talked to today, but that's okay. I'm learning to accept,  move on, and hopefully be more relaxed when I'm around people rather than feeling overwhelmed on what I want to say. I was a very quiet kid growing and all through out high school I didn't really speak to a lot of people. It has gotten a bit better in college but I was such a loner with really no friends but one through out those years in high school. I mean even now in college I don't hang out with people as much or go to parties.  I've suffered from depression and social anxiety.  I remember during my depression episodes I would get so mad at myself. I started to question my own existence. I started to think hurting myself. I started to think what good I'm I here on this earth? I fuck up at everything so why try? Almost every job I had I wasn't good at. I tried to find a reason for living and my parents/ family came up. I don't want to hurt them if I did anything to myself that could permanently damage my family forever (I don't want to say the triggering ""s"" word).  Day by day I'm trying to fight and change myself. Slowly trying to stop the bad habits I do daily (procrastination, sleeping late, not eating as much, negative thoughts, overthinking, and etc).  Life is really challenging and nobody  promised that it was going to be easy. I'm not where I want to with myself be but day by day making these small steps I hope to see a better tomorrow. Just want to let you guys know as I don't have anyone to share this with. Hope someone can relate to this as well.

Have a great day every1 and stay strong",03Nov2019,15

Nothing would waste the air around it, or make my family have to pay for my dumb shit. I don’t know who is a friend anymore, I never could. I hate myself, not in the body hate way, although I really hate that too. No, I hate myself like you hate those rapist and serial killers you see on the news. Maybe I’m no better than them, just murdering the happiness of people around me and raping their better lives. I’m so pathetic, I know people have it worse but I such a weak coward that I flop over and piss myself when something doesn’t go my way. I wish I had someone to hug. I really miss hugs. Real hugs, the kind that feel nice. I don’t really even remember what they feel like, I know they’re just nice and warm. Nobody deserves that hell though. What’s a few months of Trevino compared to a lifetime of exposure to a devil of gloom. I can’t stop thinking about the gun in my dads closet. I go over and over where it is and how to load it. It’s in a green bag above my dads old uniform. The bag has my name on it, scrawled in black sharpie since my dad wanted me to do it. There’s a little green locker my dad keeps near the guns. I’m 19, so he never worries about locking it. He never thinks I’d do something like that. Maybe he’s wrong. I am a coward and I am an idiot, but I know that there’s always that gun, and I just need to find the confidence to stop all the pain I cause. I can’t, I’m always too scared. I can’t even be at my own birthday party, or hear my family tell me they love me. I’d never be able to, because I’m less than nothing, I’m not worth the bullet. I always thought about cutting myself. I did once. I took a box cutter from my work and dug a chunk of flesh out of my arm, just a small one. I felt the pain, but I felt satisfied to cut flesh like that. I’ve thought about it ever since. Maybe I’ll treat myself on my birthday. I have one last bastion. The pills are a never ending arms race, my brain is already too far gone, it just doesn’t know it yet. Sex doesn’t need brains. I could get fucked even if I’m not conscious. I could make someone happy, even if it doesn’t make me feel happy. That’s what I deserve. I’ll try and fuck my problems away, see if I can just give my body up as a sacrifice, or a peace offering. I’m still afraid, so very afraid.

Today I ended up making myself sadder by finally looking up my ex fiancee, my brain kept nagging me over and over to try to talk to her, to get her to come back even though she left me with a lie. So I cave, after days of wondering what she is up to I look her up to see her with someone new. My first feeling is obvious, sadness, my heart sinking, then instead of anger or pain my mind instantly attacks me. ""Good she deserves to be happy, you know fully that you couldn't give her that anymore, you can't leave your house because of anxiety, your losing hair and your sight due to stress and yet you think you are allowed to ruin others lives like this?"" Ofcourse I wanted to cry but I didn't. Instead the thought that I should just end it all came back. I go ""exist"" with family and friends while wondering what a burden I am on them. Sure I live with my grandmother to help take care of her, but my mind tells me "" you just make her waste money on you, waste time driving you to your appointments and make her stress about your worthless existence."" I go in later and try to play a game to forget and still I don't. My mind constantly mocking the fact that now I am fat yet I barely eat."" Everyone worries that you only eat a meal a day sometimes you even skip a day due to your sadness, you can't do anything right can you  fatass?"" Now here I lay on my bed thinking of all of this. Needing a place to yell and be heard, even though I have nothing to say. I know what I am, I know it won't get better anytime soon. But my mind reminds me still that ""The only person who loves you has a very limited number of years left in the world, will you get better before she dies?  Because if not we know that death is the last option on the table but when her time is up so is the room on the table for options. You will never leave a psych ward if you are placed in one and you know your mother will only have harsh feelings and words for you. You will have no one and nothing and you will go out in a whimper like the failure you are."" I haven't had a good night's sleep in years and I know I won't now but maybe writing this will help. Even though nothing has helped yet you gotta keep doing new things till you find what works right? But I swear if I do beat this, the depression, agoraphobia, post traumatic stress disorder, and high anxiety, I am going to write a book about the one thing that is out to get me. I'll be sure to name it my brain, the asshole.

29,"Young men like me were born to die. There is nothing in my life that gets me anywhere. Sometimes I'm convinced that I am this character for some people, but it's just the facade I put on in social spaces. None of these people mean much to me and I don't mean shit to them. I'm a white, American 21m; never been in a relationship, never had any skills. There is nothing keeping me alive, but here I am. 

I was going to do it yesterday. Small shit sends me off the edge. I was gonna leave out the back door at work without telling anyone, drive home, blend the rest of my pills and mix them into a glass of whiskey, call the police to tell them there is a dead body on my property and put a 12 gauge buckshot through my skull. But I didn't for some reason and I'm starting to regret it.

There's no cure for men like me. Pills make it worse and no matter what I do or try, my life never means anything. Even something as small or simple as a relationship won't work. Every girl my age is already taken and I'm way too antisocial and suicidal to be in one anyway. 

I've always been this way. I've always hated myself and wanted to die. I have never served a reasonable purpose, or so that's my opinion. Truth is, I'm just shallow. Nothing will ever be good enough for myself, but I also know that anything I can do isn't going to help either. Every day my thoughts get louder and I can't take much more of this. I live in constant pain for seemingly no reason. I am defective. I was born to kill myself.",03Nov2019,0
30,"Hi, I’m an Italian exchange student in the United States, I’m really into my friend who is an another exchange student too, we knew each other before coming here (we did all the preparations and courses together) and we casually got sent to the same location even here in the us.
In the past we had some divergences but we always came back together with absolutely no hard feeling and we became friends again, the problem is that I really like stying in her company, I don’t know if it’s that she’s the only one of my nationality here or that it’s actually that I want to stay near her in general but this thing is slowly destroying me. Last night I saw her stay hugged all night with another man and something in me snapped I didn’t to anything or said snitching but I can’t, I don’t want to risk to see it again, I can’t even imagine her being in the arms of someone else only the thought of it makes my blood boil. I want to get away from her but at the same time it’s the last thing that I want to do, I’m slowly convincing myself that I should and I will but I don’t know how, Doing a stupid thing that will make her angry at me might work and it’s probably the easiest way... but but even if it does seam easier I don’t know if I should tell her the truth about what I’m going through. Another thought that is invading my head is that if I do something stupid she might come back with time like she always did and I’d really like that but I don’t know if it will be good for me.

31,"Already posted this to r/mentalhealth but figured I'd post here too.

My friend/roommate (we'll call her S) broke down a couple of days ago due to a lot of school stressers. She had some wine with one of her other friends and then sat down with me afterwards and told me she was in a really dark place mentally right now and that she wants to hurt herself. Our school counselor knows her situation, and I told S I think she should go speak with our counselor and perhaps think about medication. She said maybe.  I sat with her until she fell asleep. Shes up and doing her usually day-to-day duties for the past couple of days, but I'm doing my best to keep her company, watching shows with her, cooking food for her, etc.

I myself am taking medication for my depression and anxiety. In the past, I've helped other friends that were suicidal and have had depression, so I know how to be there for S.....but the last few times I helped depressed friends I fell into a dark place myself. I've had a very hard year, to the point where I wasn't really contemplating suicide, but where I'd lay in bed just wanting to sleep forever. This is when I finally got on medication, but I'm a very empathetic person and others emotions seep into me easily.

So, how do I help S without my mental health taking a downwards turn as well? I already feel myself filling up with guilt that I'm not doing enough to help and anxiety about what S will do to herself if I'm not. I feel useless. Like nothing I can do will make any difference.

I’ve always hated myself, it started off as believing I was the worst daughter ever and that I didn’t deserve any of what I had. I felt selfish and still do. I got glasses in kindergarten and by the time I was in second grade I believed they were the root cause of having basically no friends—they made me too ugly to talk to. My self-hatred worsened as puberty hit in 6th grade and I felt incredibly alone. I began cutting myself in 7th grade and choking myself with my belts. So no, wanting to die is not just because I lost the most amazing person in my life. It is not because my boyfriend broke up with me after telling me he’d always be there for me. It’s not because of the pain he caused me by allowing me to love him and give my everything to him when he couldn’t care less about me. It’s not because the only one I ever let myself depend on basically told me I was a burden, or because I lost the only one who understood my depression, the only one I had to go to during it all. It is because I am tired. I have happy days but they always revert back to me feeling miserable. I haven’t been genuinely happy since May and I just want to be happy again. I’m tired of going to bed every night with thoughts that eat me away for hours before actually falling asleep. I lost that constant in my life that made everything ok when nothing was ok. When nothing was ok, at least there was that one thing. His hugs made everything feel fine and like I was safe. He gave me reason to live because I wouldn’t want to pain him by leaving, but now he has left me. I’ve never been able to  picture my life after high school and that is because I shall be gone. I have no purpose or motivation, no reason to keep on living. My life is miserable and why live to just keep on suffering. I’ve never been able to vanish this feeling, it’s always there, so why not finally gather up the courage to satisfy it, so that I can finally have my peace. But I have no materials to do it, and I get too scared to slit my wrists in case it goes wrong. OD is the way to go but I have nothing strong enough. How it sucks to be trapped like this.",03Nov2019,1
33,"I have been living closed for 5 years and i have always turned off my birthday because i really shy when it come to my birthday.People keep asking me what will i do but in reality it just like all my normal day. But this year i finally come out of my shell. Im trying my best for my goal. Today i left my birthsay turn on, but i waited all day not even a single happy birthday wish posted on my facebook,maybe they dont remember me at all. I'm really really sad. I just want to share my story here with you guys.",03Nov2019,87
34,"I cant do anything anymore, everyone tells me that im going to fail, ‘friends’, bullies, teachers, you name it

Everytime i have an idea that i believe will work, everytime i have a passion in something and want to make something out of it, everytime i just want to do something right, i get told that im going to fail

I just want to die, i dont want to be alive, i dont want to exist, whats the point in living if it feels like everyone else wouldnt care if you were dead

I cant do anything anymore

The clock is ticking and im getting closer to ending it all, i’d say goodbye but its not like anyone would miss me anyway",03Nov2019,3
35,"I'm lazy I will admit it. My room was a mess I will admit it. But taking a picture of ur daughters room and posting it is bull shit. And it's no like I sit around doing nothing, I take care of their kid, I clean their room, do their laundry and clean the rest of the house when told. So I dont have enough time to make my room spotless more when I have a screaming toddler in my hip. And after I want to sit and relax after doing things for everyone else.",03Nov2019,1
36,"If you look at my posts history in this subreddit you should understand better, my now ex girlfriend cheated on me and tomorrow I'mma say fuck you to her, my best friends are suicidal and i can't do anything to help them, my mother really don't understand why I want a therapist and I don't have a reason anymore to wake up in the morning to go to school, my life is so empty, it always been empty and will forever be, but I'm just 16, what can a teen understand about life? I'm so sick of adults, they think that I as a teen can't feel any pain and the only thing I can do is follow rules, if this is being a teen, if this is the good time one day I'll miss then why am i s mio unhappy? Why am I so sad? What's so good about being a sexualy confused teen living in a homophobic society where sexual identity it's taboo, with friends that need a help I can't give, with shitty sentimental life and no reason to be alive?  Just one question, What's so good about it?",03Nov2019,2
37,So my gf is going through a lot right now. She’s bisexual and that confused her and other shit. A of that summed up into depression. She told me but when I asked her why that is and how I can help here she only said she does not want to bother me with shit like that. I mean it’s kinda sweet but I really want to help her. Anybody know how I could help her/make her feel better?,03Nov2019,4
38,"About a year ago I nearly ended my life, I wrote a suicide note and went up to the roof of my building but on my way up a door that's usually unlocked was locked so I went back down and drank until I passed out. 

Im doing a little better now I'm looking after myself more but ever since that night I've felt like I don't belong but I'm just sort of in the way of everyone's lives. All of my friends are moving on with their lives getting married and having kids so every time I tall to them I have less and less in common with them and I hate it. They were the best thing in my life. I just feel frozen in place and there's nothing I can do about it. My family doesn't really understand mental illness, I've spoken to them a few times about it but as soon as I laugh at a joke or film they just assume everything's okay and I don't know how to not feel this way.",03Nov2019,1
39,"It's hard to choose the flair. I guess I'm requesting support, advice and ranting at the same time.

Sometimes, quite often actually, a thought creeps in that I'm not actually depressed. That I am just lazy and dumb. That this IS what life is supposed to be and I'm just weak because I can't cope with it. I try to remind myself that it's not normal to want to die, but on the other hand it would explain something.

It's said that it usually takes two or three attempts to find the meds that work for you. This is my fifth attempt.

Venlafaxine

Bupropion

Escitalopram

Vortioxetine

And now sertraline

It's been almost four weeks since I started taking Zoloft, five if I include the half-dose first week. And nothing so far. I know it takes two to six weeks to start working, so it can maybe start any day now, but I'm getting scared. I don't have time to experiment. The halfway point of this semester is getting closer and I'm not able to get any work done. If I don't want to drop out, I can't wait much longer.

Fuck, I almost dropped out already. I had to get a paper from my psychiatrist and negotiate an exception with the vice-dean. I still feel bad about it, like if I was abusing the diagnosis to get ""special treatment"".

Well, the bottom line is that I'm scared.",03Nov2019,1
40,I  feel like I'm a weight on my family like I drag them down when I'm in the same room. When I walk in they seem to change moods and when I do something wrong it's like a bomb went off. It's to the point the time when I try to join into a conversation I get ignored or told shut up. I feel like I can't do anything right and it's making me feel like crap. My depression is not doing me good and I have had bipolar problems because of it. I don't think that they mean to do it but I know that if I was to vent about how I feel I would just make it worse. Even when someone is in just a bad mood that has nothing to do with me they use me to make fun of to make them feel better. I feel like most of the time I deserve it sence I'm the only kid my mom has that is goin no we're in life. I still live with them and I'm an adult. I want to cry scream yell anything but I never get enough privacy to do so so I can't show emotion much on how I feel. Again I feel like I deserve it but I don't know how to stop feeling so usless.,03Nov2019,1
41,"My life is great on paper - I’m 31F, my family are loving, my husband is great, I have a professional job, I’m physically healthy but I have no motivation and feel like I’m pretending all the time. 

I’m home alone today and have not got out of bed. I’ve watched repeat shows on Netflix, cried a few times and can’t stop feeling pathetic. 

I have no reason to feel this way - nothing tragic has happened to me.

I do know my job is compounding this. I know I’m not performing at work, slightly in my defence is that there’s simply too much work for me to get done (they are trying to hire another person to assist) but I honestly anticipate that I may get fired since the owner of the company only sees unfinished and incorrect things coming  from me. I get overwhelmed and I can’t concentrate so I can understand why. I wish I could quit but we need my salary and also, my work visa is tied to my job so it’s not like I could get another one easily. We don’t have enough savings for me not to work either. The thought of going to work tomorrow makes me feel sick. 

I suffered from depression when I was a teenager (was hospitalized twice) and I think I have had waves of it since but this year, it’s definitely become worse. 

I understand depression is an illness but I can’t help feeling ungrateful for everything I have and for feeling like a lazy, whiney idiot. 

Can anyone relate or have any advice? I know medication is an option but it’s not going to help me anytime soon... like at work tomorrow",03Nov2019,11
42,I should be dead. I got out of the hospital today. 5 days of being comatose. I feel like a failure. I don’t know how to go about this. I’m lost. I don’t know how to feel. I don’t know if I should feel bad for not regretting it.,03Nov2019,4
43,"I got back on meds yesterday. This is my second day taking it. 

I know for sure this is because of my meds, because it happened to me before.

I’m feeling so much worse and I can’t feel happy or just feel normal at least.

I’ve been feeling terrible since. I don’t know what to do. I feel so hopeless.  I hate depression so much it’s just fucking me up",03Nov2019,1
