0,"Honestly I’ve had it. I need to start therapy I’ve actually gotten in touch with a therapist that has an opening. The thing is that I’ll have to talk to my mom about paying the co-pay. The thing is that she’s already stressed about finances and a possible health concern. 

I don’t know what to do I feel like dying but I currently don’t have any plans to go through with it, but I feel like shit. I hate myself. I truly don’t have friends. I honestly don’t know. I don’t know what else to say.",01Dec2019,1
1,How do I maintain my weight when I have no drive to eat at all?  I have no interest in food and taste means nothing. For reference I am 18 and have mdd episodes.  In the past the appetite problem was controlled with SSRIs but I’m not on one right now and I’m more depressed now than I think I’ve ever been.  Has anyone had this experience?  I’m afraid I’ll never get the appetite back again.,01Dec2019,1
2,"I’m in such a bad place lately, but my god, I’m trying so hard. I can’t be brief to save my life, so I apologize in advance. I’ll do a tl;dr at the bottom. 

Last week, I kept finding myself subconsciously drafting a note if I were to actually go through with it. 

But here’s the thing... I don’t want to die, I just can’t take being miserable anymore. 

I deal with an autoimmune disease, and travel/weather can be challenging, but I try. My family lives an hour &amp; a half away, so not terrible. 

I grew up hunting with my Dad, and he wanted me to go with him so bad, so I drove down Wednesday night to go with him Thursday morning before lunch. My nephew spent the night (which he almost never does since my Mon passed), because I was there &amp; he wanted to go to the woods with me. 

One night sleeping in my dad’s spare room, and I woke up with an ungodly pain in my hip (my autoimmune disease is connective-tissue related, so I am constantly screwing up my joints with minimal exertion). 

So I have to skip hunting, which makes me sad, because for me, it’s 100% about spending that time with my Dad &amp; nephew. My Dad always wanted boys, and it’s always meant a lot to him that his girls made that effort for him to do the “boy” things. 

We ended up going to a buffet for lunch, just my Dad, grandma, stepmom &amp; I. My grandma has dementia and it’s too hard to do the traditional thing with her, because she gets mad that she can’t help. This was already a sore spot for me, because the holidays just haven’t been the same since my Mom died and my Dad remarried. 

My sister does her thing with my Mom’s family, and my Dad tries to balance time with me, his Mom &amp; his wife. He can’t handle holidays with their family since Mom passed, and I can’t do holidays without my Dad. 

I had planned to stay at my Dad’s till Friday, but after hurting myself, I thought it’d be best for body to come home to my bed &amp; my weed. 

I was supposed to go to a Cirque show tonight with an old friend of mine that I haven’t seen in years. Instead, I’m in bed in tears, because I’m in so much pain (physical &amp; emotional). My apartment is a disaster thanks to severe anemia that has required iron transfusions to make me functional again. I had planned to clean this weekend. Not happening. 

The holidays are hard enough and I’ve been so down and I was actually excited about my plans for once, but my body had other plans. It’s so frustrating &amp; disheartening and makes me not even want to try anymore.... because what’s the point? 

TL;DR: Holidays suck because my Mom’s dead, and things just aren’t the same &amp; never will be. I have a connective tissue disease that ruined my plans with my Dad &amp; nephew Thanksgiving morning. I was supposed to have plans with an old friend tonight, which was the first social activity I’ve had in months, and was super excited about, but body said no to that one too, so I’m stuck in bed, in tears, crying because I’m miserable both emotionally &amp; physically.",01Dec2019,1

Abandoned

Lost in this world with no light in the darkness,

Not knowing if there will ever be happiness,

That moment stabbed my heart as I heard my dad say…

Mama is gone.

My head spun as I replayed my dad’s words over and over again,

That was over 2 years ago…

Life has changed significantly since then,

I have changed and my family changed,

Prayers, prayers, and prayers to God,

Hoping that he will hear me,

Praying for my mom to be healed,

My mom is fully recovered now but is disabled,

I guess praying doesn’t work,

I shouldn’t feel like this… 

But, I feel that we were abandoned by God,

Life will never be the same,

6 months is how long it was,

6 months in the hospital,

All that I can say is that Sepsis sucks,

All it took was 6 months to change our family,

I was hoping that God would be there when we needed him,

But, my views on God has changed since then,

Does God even still care for us?

Years and years of ministry and worshipping him,

It hurts more when I trusted God throughout my life,

I myself won’t be the same,

I am not ready to be Baptized,

How I see things are on perspective I could be thankful for God keeping my mom alive,

But I could feel that God wasn’t there for our family during that time,

Overall I feel abandoned by God.

I hope that I will turn back to God again,

4,"I’m in college nearing the end of my semester and have been struggling with depression for over a year. I live far from friends and family with my boyfriend. Yesterday, my boyfriend essentially implied his life would be so much easier if it weren’t for me. I’ve already been struggling with finishing my end of semester assignments and I don’t want to throw it all away. What he said came like a blow since he has been my constant support and I have nobody to go to.  My REQUEST is for someone to give me techniques to manage my assignments (all of which are due within the week) and actually do them instead of spending my day crying and obsessing over the time I wasted thinking about his words. Worst part is, I’ve been crying all day and he clearly doesn’t seem to care. I have also been thinking about suicide a lot every now and then and it’s all too much today; however, like I said before I don’t want to throw my semesters worth of work away. Please help me finish my assignments by giving me coping techniques !",01Dec2019,1

I know that my family will be sad, and I know that people will miss me, but i can't keep living this life just for other people especially when, when I am alive I might as well not be there.

I just miss our old life but we're doing pretty good. It just hurts me seeing my mom struggle doing the simplest things. Disability and sickness changed my mom's and my family's life. It's not the same life that we used to have. I'm still looking for answers on what God wants to happen for our family. The whole experience was a lot to cope with. I was there when everything happened and it's hard to believe that we ended up like this. I have so many memories just going to hospitals and just seeing my mom struggle is hard. For a while, my family had to depend on others since my mom didn't have a job and my dad had to stay with our mom. Before we didn't have to worry about money but now we do. I wish I could have appreciated the life I had before everything happened.  I was young when it happened and I wished we made more memories before my mom became disabled. But overall mom is still mom after everything. Disability doesn't change who she is.",01Dec2019,1
7,"I’m done.

I don’t know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good in-laws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. 

I’m an adult. What could I possibly be sad about?

I tell people around me I don’t feel right, like how I’m abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like “hey man we all feel that way sometimes.” My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself.

My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But it’s not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But it’s not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends.  But it’s not enough. 

I still feel sad.

I reach out on forums for depression and ask “do I have a problem?” “Is it normal to feel this way?” And not even the masses have comments for me. I don’t want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I don’t think I would fight it much. I feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. It makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. Posting this is the best I can do. I’m not sure if anyone will read this, but if you do, thank you.",01Dec2019,1
8,"Hello, before I give any background information on the situation, I just wanted to let the person reading this post to know that you matter. The person that I love who is suffering from extreme depression matters a lot to me, but they don't know how amazing they are. They refuse to understand that they influence my life crazy to the point where I often fall asleep to the thought of them, and there probably are plenty people on this feed that don't know there is someone falling asleep to the thought of them. You matter.  

Okay, now diving into the situation -- I met this person around 4 months ago. I quickly took a liking to them, they had the sweetest smile, they were kind, honest, and an all-around goofball. However, they were dealing with extreme depression and another handful of problems. They have fought depression for 4 years, and heard all the ""you are strong,"" and ""things will get better"" phrases. They dubbed these phrases ""bullshit"" and despite the fact that I use these phrases on them too, they are still generous enough to lend me a pass. 

I have dug into other options (textlines to find advice on how to help them + counseling) but my hands are still empty. How can I help them when they are going through horrible moments? They matter sincerely to me, and I have embarrassingly cried over them. Can I really tell them how I feel about them without scaring them? I always hold off telling them how much I love and think about them because I don't want to come off as ""creepy"" or ""scary.."" 

I am asking advice on how to save them. I do not want to lose them. They make me feel like I'm on cloud 9 but it hurts me to see them hurting. They always downgrade themselves but gosh I wanna shake them and tell them how much they mean to me. Any advice is appreciated, and thank you so much.",01Dec2019,1

10,"I’m having a hard time reaching for help from my online friends because whenever I tell someone my problem I always feel like it’s gonna make our relationship awkward, they’ll judge me, I shouldn’t tell a friend a problem because friends are supposed to be happy. So I always ended up deleting all my messages sent so they won’t see it if they haven’t yet. I won’t delete them if they reply before I could but I feel guilty when our chat ends. I don’t have real life friends for 5 years since my mom and I moved out of the country I also can’t depend on my relatives, I tried to before but all of them gave me the same crap like “you’ll be ok god will help you” who the heck say that to an atheist. Aside from being very shy there’s also a language barrier so I never made a friend here. My mom used to beat me at our first year living here for stupid reasons like me waking up earlier than her, coughing, playing online games (even tho she knew the reason I’m playing is because it’s the only place I have friends), beating me in front of our neighbors, pointing knife at me, etc. but it only stopped when I started fighting back like grabbing the broom from her or kicking her to stay away from me. Now it’s mostly verbal. It irritates me whenever I see or hear her. After a year or two I realized I developed social anxiety, can’t speak straight in front of someone, only going outside when going to school, whole body gets very itchy whenever around a group of people. I’m planning to move out but don’t have the courage because I have no where to go and can’t speak the language here fluently plus my anxiety makes me forget everything I was about to say when in front of a stranger. I’m 19 now but haven’t finished 2nd year senior hs yet since I get depressed which makes me ended up not attending school anymore so I had no choice but to stop. Now I always worry about my future. This might sounds stupid and cringy but whenever I see students having fun it makes me cry probably because I feel like my teenage years are wasted and there’s no way to get it back. I want help and don’t want it at the same time, or maybe it’s just I don’t know who could help me. I’m tired can’t find a reason to keep living but can’t suicide because I made a promised to my self before that I shouldn’t unless I reached a week feeling the same then changed it to a month, after my brother suicide this year. I never reached more than a day feeling suicidal but today is already my 3’rd day and I’m afraid now. If only there’s a way to die without a pain and not causing anyone trouble.

I miss my son. He lives with his mother who I've been awful to. I took her for granted and she moved on in a shitty way and it kills me it's been 9 months. I'm so far from him I ran away from my job as a dad.

The reason why is because I can't help but feel that nothing has purpose and that I'm just existing till I cease to exist and that life is a cycle I wish not to take part in which sparks this irrational idea.

But the odd thing is, I'm not experiencing and feeling ""sadness"" or ""happiness"" in the same way I did 2 years ago.

17,"We've been together for 7 months and they have been great.  Before me, he hasn't met anyone with mental illnesses.  I am bipolar type 2 with social anxiety/generalized anxiety disorder and have it under control thanks to finally being in the correct medicine. 

I switched medicine a while back and it was a rough period, but he stood by me through it with patience.  He's learned how to intervene when I start it have an anxiety attack, and he was willing to learn what I need during an episode. 

One of my darker fears in life is that I am unlovable, that everyone will leave me when they see the dark and ugly parts of me. This fear is magnified by the fact that I have had friends and romantic relationships do that exact thing--they left because my demons were affecting them.  For a while my relationship with my mom and brother suffered greatly (with my mom we've built it back and have a good relationship. I'm still working on winning back my brother.)  I'm not mad at those people, depression makes me not an easy person to love.

My boyfriend has always been so reassuring when my brain is mean to me and says, ""I chose you, and I continue to choose you"". Finally I have stopped being afraid if this. I finally found the person who sees me through the haze when it returns. 

I am in love with him and have been for a while. At first he didn't like when I told him that I loved him because he felt bad he wasn't there yet.  It stopped making him uncomfortable months ago, but he still hasn't said it back.  I think he loves me or is at least very close. He shows me that through his actions every day. 

Last night I asked him if he was afraid to say ""I love you"".   
He said yes.  Since I'm his first serious relationship as adults I figured it was because he's never said it before. He said he had and that wasn't it. 

He took a long moment to collect his thoughts and told me that is was afraid my brain will tell me something that will make me push him away and leave him.

I did everything I could to reassure him. Honestly he's the ONE person in my life that doesn't make episodes worse. Even when he says the wrong thing or I'm upset with him, I never push him away.  

I asked him if he's seen me push anyone away like that. (Isolating myself isn't something I do as a coping mechanism. I tend to pull people closer and lean on them.  Which has been problematic when I'm at my worst.  Like I said. I'm much more even now.)
He said no, but that he's seen me try.  

The examples he had we're moments where I was beating myself up and needed a moment to myself.  In these instances he's come and sit with me after giving me the moment I needed.  This is exactly what I wanted in that situation. 

Him being afraid of my depression cut me to my core.  This feels like my fear of being unlovable due to my depression back into my mind).  I honestly believe he could be the one to love me despite the ugly parts.  Before this, I was pretty sure he was my person and that he would be my family.  

Part of me still thinks that he will get through this fear and be able to love me. Part of me is terrified he won't let himself. 

What do I do?  How can I help him?  What if he never comes around?

He goes through bouts of depression every once in awhile, he doesn't know what triggers an episode, he latches onto something to feel bad about, and runs with it. I have depression too, but I learned some coping mechanisms and I feel more optimistic than him. Nothing is THAT bad. What's he going to do when something happens, like the death of a loved one? What if he got diagnosed with a serious illness or experienced a serious injury? Those are traumatic experiences, and even then, most people don't just give up.

He's been like this for weeks. Its the longest episode thus far. I try to be encouraging, I try to make him laugh, I let him know he's loved, I give advice on how to cope. Nothing works. I told him I would always be there but his reply was, ""You say that now."" How can I be there for someone who won't accept love? I feel like he's pushing everyone away. 

He won't take more medication, which I understand, but his therapist and psychiatrist aren't trying different programs to help him get better. I think that makes him feel like he's not worth saving. I love him so much but its too much for me to handle. What do I do?",01Dec2019,1

I was in IOP when I was 20, over a decade ago, when I attempted suicide. It was through a major hospital and not a religious organization. It was all group and there was no individual therapy. It was 5 days a week from 9-3. I was there for 6 weeks and saw a psychiatrist 3 or 4 times. 

I felt like no one there trusted what I said. I was in college and had engaged in some binge drinking so they put me in dual diagnosis. No one believed me that I'm not an alcoholic. I had to go to a group where we said the AA serenity prayer while holding hands like in a 12 step meeting. Some people there were kinda gross as in not hygienic and I felt really uncomfortable being forced to touch others.

One social worker told me I should be glad I didnt have bipolar depression because that's worse than unipolar depression. Um I was there bc I tried to die?

Our coping skills group was a joke. We learned coping skills like going for a walk, calling a friend, or window shopping. How was that supposed to help not want to die? At this point I was a college drop out with no job experience and there was no support to help me reintegrate back into the world. 

On fridays we had a weekend planning group. One day I was so down and unmotivated I couldn't fill out my sheet. No one noticed. 

In another group about med management I talked about being suicidal. No one did anything. 

When asked what I did to work on myself to start feeling better I said I finally got on the right meds. This apparently was the wrong answer. Apparently that was the wrong answer. They thought I was being adversarial. They thought that talking about my problems alone would solve my depression. 

No one believed that I had not suffered a major trauma and it was like they kept expecting me to come clean. In group I had to listen to terrible terrible horror stories of abuse others had suffered through. I won't go into detail because it can be very triggering. 

It wasn't all bad. The best part was throwing shade at staff at smoke breaks and being around people. (Although one old lady coming off of oxy ate part of my sandwich so I had to go without lunch that day).

I can now identify most of these high standard situations and I am mostly able do adjust my thinking. But now I have a situation, where I couldn't live up to my own expectations and I now feel lost in self loathing. 
For context: I was at a concert and got pretty drunk, like black out drunk. (I wasn't alone and I was safe)
I kinda stopped drinking alcohol half a year ago because I know it will make me depressed the next morning and wouldn't go well with my medication.  And I know I am really bad at controlling how much I drink when going out, so I thought I just don't drink anything.

So now I feel like I really fucked up, I got drunk and can't remember much from the evening. I can't stand anything that has anything to do with the evening like the clothes I wore. I can't stand listening to their music or any music at all. I feel like that one time drinking threw me really off course on my way to a better life and that makes that feeling even worse. 
I know that it doesn't make too much sense to feel that way but I just cannot get over this horrible feeling in my gut that makes me so mad at myself and paralyzes me at the same time. 

Has anyone advice how I can overcome this? 
I just want some healthy distance to these feelings for now so I can move on and get better again.",01Dec2019,1
25,"Just like it says. I can’t even kill myself properly now, because I’m so far from myself.  There’s a really nice song lyric, ""There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking, I’m dead""  In all the ways that matter, I’m already dead. And I’m so tired of being this empty husk

What’s the point of me being alive physically, if I’m already dead emotionally. I remember how I was and I miss it. I was passionate and creative, people thought I was interesting and I loved to be around them. And then one day I died, but my body kept moving.",01Dec2019,1
27,"I’m wondering if the bupropion is what’s making me feel so sleepy during the day? I decided to try and take it right before I went to bed and I didn’t sleep a wink all night, so I’m not trying that again. I’m thinking about going back down to 150 mg. Does anyone have experience with this?",01Dec2019,1
28,"This Thanksgiving weekend we had four days off and we will probably have no school on Monday because of snow. I had plans to sew all weekend and draw too. 




But so far I’ve had a large loss of energy and I’ve been sleeping a lot and I hate myself so much right now. We went over to our cousins on Thanksgiving, and I also went to a birthday party. It should’ve been a great weekend. But no. I was sad the whole time.  I feel like crying but I don’t even have enough energy to shed a tear. I want to tell my parents but I’m afraid they won’t help or care. It’s not there fault, my dads really busy and my mom has work to do. 



I’ve been thinking about the future a lot lately. I want to be an artist but I feel very discouraged  because I mainly draw anime/manga, and in the art world it’s not accepted. I also want to open an Etsy shop and sell what I sew, but I can’t right now because of reasons to complicated to explain. I’ve done absolutely nothing over this weekend and I feel like crap. I have a headache and I don’t know if this is possible but I think it’s from sadness. My room is a mess and I want to clean it with my dad, but he hasn’t been home and I miss him. Stupid Black Friday. It may be a miracle for some people but it’s a curse for others. My dad wasn’t home for thanksgiving, and I haven’t seen him most of the weekend. I’ve hardly got to talk to him. 




I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Im trying to get through. I’m just so sad.",01Dec2019,1
29,"Every day when I wake up, I feel fine, then as the day progresses, it’s like there’s this bottomless pit in my chest and stomach and it just keeps getting worse and worse, until I break and I end up cutting myself. I can’t cry either, as most of the time I find it difficult to cry no matter how bad I’m feeling. But it’s like whenever I cut, it gets really easy to cry. And when I’m done crying, for a few hours I’m just completely numb. An hour or two or even three after I’ve cried, I start to feel normal again,like how I did when I first woke up, but really tired. Then I just keep swinging between depressed and happy for the rest of the day. Sometimes I just get these waves of emotion out of nowhere and I feel like I’m going to die. Sometimes I have panic attacks. I don’t know what to do or what’s wrong with me. Everyone in my family and all my friends are dealing with their own problems and I don’t want to burden them with mine. I don’t even have anything to be sad about. I got to a good school,I live in a good home, I have wonderful parents and sister. Is this normal? Do I have a problem? I’m just asking if anyone can give me any advice.",01Dec2019,1
30,"I put the rant flair on this because I don’t really know what to call this. My, diagnosed by the way, depression, anxiety and PTSD (holy trinity, I know) have been amped up to 11 recently. Nobody around me gets it which has made things feel a lot worse. Literally as I’m writing this my dog seems to be the only one concerned. I really should see a therapist again. Not to mention, college is a huge damper on my mood. So many huge winter assignments. It’s been so hard to spend time on them too, I’ve had to go through the process of moving out with my family so I’ve had little time to work. And then, there’s the days where I miss my ex, which a lot of people no doubt relate to, but it hurts to remember how happy I was.

And I know this bit is going to sound really childish, but I guess that’s the point. Halo Reach is being released on PC, which was really great news. With all this going on I was going to be happy playing one of my childhood favourites, honestly couldn’t wait for the 3rd. Then, the day I was going to preorder it, my entire PC dies beyond repair. So I won’t be able to go on reach this week with all my friends, which makes me feel really bad. I think my sadness from that comes from how I’ve not been as excited for anything in a long time. Really. Excitement is a really finite material with me, I don’t really feel excitement often now. But this had me excited, and it got crushed. I spent three days on that piece of shit PC, trying to get it fixed before someone came long (qualified to say this by the way) saying there’s not much that can be done, and jokingly to kill it with fire.

It’s all getting too much again, basically. Feel like everyone who’s near me is judging me, I’m having trouble socialising in classes. I dunno. Everything sucks. Just needed to say somewhere. And I didn’t even get started on the PTSD. It just fucks everything up at any time.",01Dec2019,1
31,"I'm going to try to keep this short. A female friend of mine who I thought I knew and I was very close to, cheated on another friend of mine. I am very dissapointed in her. I (and clearly her boyfriend) thought she was nothing less then perfect. Boyfriend said he was planning on marrying her, he was in love. Now he's suffering for her actions. I can't let him fall into depression. I need to help him somehow. He thinks he is a fool and all the usual. Give me an advice",01Dec2019,1
32,"anyone have family members that feel like you're ""blaming depression""? like it isnt my fault im doing my best to get medicated asap. and then they get mad when you say youre depressed and it makes you even more depressed. and throw everything youve ever done that wasn't tip top shape when youre not in tip top shape.",01Dec2019,1
33,"ill start off first by saying i’m a 17 year old girl hello.. lots of shit on my mind but i’m gonna start here so i can see where i started if i ever do eventually find the happiness i deserve. as of now i’m feeling completely alone although i know i have a few people but when u mentally feel alone it’s hard to come up from that. i feel like i no longer feel tru emotions like i used to, i don’t get excited not even to see the boy i love anymore i’m just here. i say it can’t get worse and it just always gets worse 2019 has just completely ruined me and i just feel like there’s no coming back from it. from being sexually assaulted to that boy i love dating me for a month and breaking up with me to watching my pap die to getting fucked over and dropped and harassed by all of my friends i just feel there’s nothing i can do anymore. ugh i know this outlook on life isn’t helping me either it’s just really hard i feel like there’s just nothing i can do and my life is just kinda... done? i feel like i don’t serve a purpose here anymore like there’s nothing left for me to do. idk i’m empty. i am getting help i’ve been talking to a therapist but like that only can do so much i just go home right after and lay and do nothing. parents don’t want me on medication. it’s just a big mess i’m a big mess i need help but idk what help if that makes sense.",01Dec2019,1
35,"Feeling really depressed lately.. I don't care about anyone, or their feelings. And I hate myself too. I feel like nobody reaches out to me, and I'm too shy to make new friends because I find it difficult to find anything in common with new people, or I just end up feeling judged/judge them. I feel overwhelmed with work and college, not to mention travelling on the TTC for approx 12h per week... I want to work out and eat healthy, but I just feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish everything I desire. And I end up just aimlessly staring at my phone. I really don't know what wrong with me anymore, and I'm not the same happy people attracting person I was 4 years ago.. I've become a boring lonely nobody.",01Dec2019,1
36,"I made this reddit because I do not know where else to go. I have not been the man that I used to be and it is tearing me apart. I have been tired all the time, lack of a will to eat (I would previously binge eat but now I don't want to eat anything), I don't wanna talk to anyone and I stay secluded in my room all day, I am irrationally anxious (especially around intimacy),  I lash out at people, and finally I don't have any motivation whatsoever to do my schoolwork or job. I come from a traditional Hispanic household and I can't really bring up these things because I have to be ""more of a man"". 

Yesterday I blew up at my girlfriend of a year and I was so mean that we nearly broke up. This is not normal and I never used to be this way, I mentioned how I might be depressed and honestly that's the only thing that has held us together, but she does not want to talk to me, rightfully so, and I have zero desire to do anything especially with the amount of guilt I have for mistreating her the way that I did. 

Reddit, am I overreacting or is there something wrong with me? If there is, what do I do?",01Dec2019,1
37,"I'm not sure what to do. I believe I am depressed, although I have not been able to see a doctor/therapist because my parents havent allowed me to. I want to be happy again, but I don't know how. I seem like a happy and bubbly person on the outside, but whenever I'm home I'm a completely different person. A person i wish didnt exist. I've been staying in my room more than usual, nothing seems to make me genuinely happy anymore, I wont eat sometimes,  I push everyone away. I hate myself for acting this way. I just dont know how to fix myself. There are so many things I wish I could talk to someone about, but I'd rather keep this short.",01Dec2019,1
