0,"Hey All, I’m pretty new here so I hope I’m at the right place to ask for help. I’m 20 (F) from the netherlands And  have a 30 year old cousin (30) from australia whos depressed. Ive been trying to keep contact with him lately for support etc. He really appreciates the fact that I take my time to talk to him. I openly talked about my own experience w depression as a teen so he could feel comfortable enough to open up about his struggles. We went from barely having any contact w each other to having this really emotional conversation through text. It was a rollercoaster of a conversation And Ive never had such a personal talk with any family ever. Thankfully Ive overcome my depression a couple years ago and I’m trying to help my cousin but he keeps saying he barely got time to even focus on himself or you know, take care of himself a lil more, even If Its Just a Tiny little bit. He keeps saying he doesnt got time to even scratch his back. I used to be the Same, making excuses And refuse to get help. But I really wanna help him. I’m so worried I Can barely sleep these days. How do I convince him to get help without sounding like an overprotective Or overly worried mom?",30Jun2019,1
1,"My partner and I split up a couple months back, forcing me to find my own place and start all over. We were together for three years and I thought we were going to spend our life together when he came home from work and just said it was over. 

It’s Pride now and I’ve seen a few photos of him with people that used to be our mutual friends and they’re all happy smiling photos.

It kills me. It’s killing me inside. Why does he get to be happy and have his life and I’m stuck in this hate-filled cycle? I pretend it’s fine and I’ve told the few friends I managed to keep that I’ve moved on because I don’t want to be that person consumed by this whenever I go out but I sit home alone most of the time to avoid people.

How do I get past this? When will this feeling go away?",30Jun2019,8
2,"I went off lexapro 2 years ago because I met my first serious girlfriend and the meds killed my sex drive. After I got off the meds my depression came back harder than ever so I started going to therapy. I’ve been going for almost 2 years, we’ve discussed my childhood trauma, the relationships in my life, all the things I’m ashamed of and all the “cognitive errors” I’m prone to. I have a good life on paper but I still have a lot of suicidal thoughts and am moderately depressed. I feel ungrateful and stupid. 

Has anyone else felt ashamed of using antidepressants? Like they’re taking the easy way out or not being true to themselves? My pain feels like a part of my unique world view. What if I’m suppose to feel this pain and then come out the other side stronger? I plan on becoming a therapist when I grow up so I want to test my limits. On the other hand life feels empty futile and grey. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow. 

Just for some back story my dad committed suicide and my mom has attempted so I grew up around this type of stuff. Things will probably get better but I feel exhausted. I’d love to hear some your guys struggles depression and if anyone can relate with me. I know some you got it way worse but thanks for reading.",30Jun2019,1
3,"Hi. I've been struggling with depression for about 3 years now, mostly alone, although there was usually a person in my life who I could turn to over the years for support (currently it is my boyfriend). The past few months I experienced once again a severe depressive episode which was really hard for me but also for my boyfriend as well. During the episode I had decided that I wanted to talk to my parents when I went back home (I am a student). I have been home for a few days now, but usually when I come back home (summer and xmas vacations) I feel a lot better and manage to convince myself that I can go through this alone. However, realistically I don't think I can. My main reasons for not telling them yet is that my grandfather is quite ill and will possibly not make it through the summer, I don't want to add my depression to their existing problems, and I don't really know what to say to them. I want to try medication and therapy but I don't want to start the medication without them knowing as I've read there are a lot of side effects etc so I don't think it will be that easy to hide, and I don't think I can do therapy secretly since they are the ones paying for my health insurance etc. Anyway in any case hiding it for 3 years has definitely made it worse so I really need to do something about it.

So any advice on how to start and what to say during this conversation?",30Jun2019,3

My dad, brother and sister will be out of town for the next week so it will just be my mom and I home. I want to go to the hospital or er this week and tell them that I’ve been thinking about suicide. I don’t want to worry the rest of my family so I thought this would be a good time to go.

8,"Hello there!

 2 of my closest friends suffer from depression.

I love them greatly and make time to visit or call each of them at least twice a week. I try to always make them laugh at least once and tend push them a bit to move in some way either to eat,wash, go outside etc. They're awesome people! Smart,creative and caring.

But recently one of my friends has been worrying me a bit more. They have resorted to constantly downgrading themselves and passing that off as jokes, most of my calls and visits become engulfed by them telling me just how much they hate themselves, how everything sucks, and even saying how they have no friends...with me being right in front of them. 

I would like to talk this out with them but I don't know how without them twisting it back on themselves negatively. I honestly don't know what to do, please help? Any advice would be appreciated",30Jun2019,1
9,"So, this is sort of a rant but I really don't know what the hell is happening right now with me. A couple months back I started dating a girl I liked for a while. Honestly, it was the happiest I'd been in a while. It seemed like the days of wanting to end it all were over for me and I could move on. But, after a brief 10 days, we broke up. She's Asexual and doesn't feel the same way, I'm all good with that. But, for a month or so, I was breaking. I felt so many things, regret, sadness, anger at myself for feeling like this, and an overwhelming urge to hide it all. She also suffers from depression and anxiety, so I don't want to make it worse for her by making her think it's her fault. We continued being friends and are still good friends now. At some point, I just kinda killed those emotions and carried on with my life like I did before, going back to wanting to die 24/7. 

But, recently, two of my friends got together. They are legitimately the most adorable thing in the world together and I am really happy for them, but something about the situation made me remember what I tried to kill. I started to break down for a few hours. I was with some friends at the time, luckily, so I didn't do anything, but my mind just kept being overwhelmed with what ifs and I couldn't stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what the hell is going on and what should I do? I honestly just want to somehow completely kill of these emotions and go on with my life until I inevitably break down forever, but part of me won't let me.",30Jun2019,8

11,"Two years ago I moved across the country from a small town to a big city in the middle of the fucking desert. I spent two years wasting my time trying to make friends and utterly failing to the MAX, eventually moving without a single friend. I spent two years alone in a crowd of people, never being able to get close to anyone. I moved again recently, across the country again to an even bigger city. Im starting my junior year but I doubt I can even make friends. Everyone already has friends and I will spend my last two years of high school alone. Ive grown so much as a person but it doesnt feel like its enough. I want to stop being lonely and I want to stop having my only social interactions be with my fucking family. Im begging everywhere for help but no one responds to me, no one cares. I want to be understood, I want to understand myself. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. Im not a bad person I know that but it feels like I am  because no one seems to want to stick by me. Maybe its because I want it too bad. I just want someone to talk to.",30Jun2019,12

You may feel like nobody cares about you but that isn’t true whatsoever. You’ve helped me immensely. If y’all weren’t here some off us would be worse off than we are now. You may not see the will in fighting or pushing on. But I’m telling you, there will be something in your future that will push everything away. I believe in you. So I want you to believe and love yourself. Because if a random person off the internet can love you, you can love yourself as well.",30Jun2019,86
13,"Like nothing this year has gone right and I'm really losing hope. I've had depression for 4 years (undiagnosed until november) and I keep having long, consistent episodes. Like I can have maybe a 2 month long period when I doing ok, maybe even good and then a solid 4 month period of being depressed, rinse and repeat.  I find I fetishize my sadness which is something I recently found out is pretty common too so 👌

This last year has been shit tbh. Firstly I've had some issues with my friends. I was in this amazing group of 4 people and we were all super close. We could make plans whenever and just have fun and support each other. Then some shit went down and we all kinda drifted a part and now my friend group (that includes my old friends too) is like 20 people, most of which I'm not close to and we make huge plans that are stressful to organize. I just want my old group back. Also me and my best friend of 6 years have been getting distant which terrifies me. She's the best person I know but after she got a boyfriend she stopped talking to be and others and I just miss he friendship. We have a time earlier this year where I don't think we interacted for a month. She's also the only person who knows literally everything about me and my only support system. Now I'm all alone it seems. I'm finding my other friends are also texting me less and hung out without me which sucks. I feel like it was less of a malicious thing and more of them just forgetting to invite me. I sense a trend in me just being replaced too and it makes me feel like utter shit. 

Plus all my friends are going to college or university but me since I got rejected this year. So I'm stuck another year in my town while my friends are moving very far away to live on campus. There is no chance in us meeting up, essentially since that very close friend of mine is going to be 8(?) Hours away. So basically this year I'm going to be spending another year stressing over making a portfolio for college, having no friends and (hopefully) working a minimum wage job all while I'm very depressed. Sounds great. 

Like idk where I'm going with this but I find making a big vent post from time to time helps. 

I dont enjoy my life and I just want something to go my way. I wanna maybe meet a boyfriend and get some love my way. Maybe I'll at least get a support system again. Who knows but it seems like this is gonna be another year of suicidal thoughts , depression, stress and loneliness which sounds great to me.

14,"One of my friends is feeling incredibly depressed and suicidal, she’s had a recent break up with someone and it hasn’t made any of that better, she isn’t eating much and I’m really worried for her. I’ve tried to help her by saying what she should do but she doesn’t seem to be listening to me, do any of you know what I should do? I’m thinking of telling the school again.

15,"Sought medical help for anxiety and depression 5 years ago. Today I am in a happy place, my husband and I have a wonderful relationship, and I find myself attractive. But my meds have killed my sex drive. I can barely orgasm anymore and hardly masturbate. I can get in the mood once we get rolling, but not like before when I had a raging sex drive. Now I have anxiety about having sex. I have spoken to my doctor about this multiple times, but each one has said it's one of the medications with  the lowest side effects. It also don't help we have a 10 and 12 year old sons AND my mother lives with us.  Not sure if I should keep plugging along and accept this reality or try another medication.

17,"Hello all, I hope eveveryone is having a good day. Writing has become a tremendous chore, so please forgive me.

By the time I was 20, I had seen more then 20 of my pets pass away. We lived in the country, so dogs and cats were not hard to come by, and we loved them dearly. I grew up with many dogs and cats by my side, and created deeper bonds with them than any human I can think of, other than family, of course.

When I was 21, my very last 3 dogs passed away. They were old, and I saw it coming for a long time. We were always the type to house strays, so please don't think we were ever neglecting. They were LITERALLY my world. They each happened about 6 months apart, consecutively. So by the time I was 'back', another had passed. It ultimately crippled me, psychologically, in the sense that I didn't really believe humans could bring me comfort anymore because I craved something completely different.

A few years have passed, I have not left home for more then a 2month duration of time which I spent in studies. I currently am raising two rescue cats who I have been blessed with, they gave me life in the darkest of times.

During the time without any pets, I developed many bad habits. I now understand I was carrying these qualities throughout my life, but they have only amplified with loss. I always smoked weed, I will not say it is a cure but it can help in moderation with certain health issues I have, that are not important but knowing I smoke heavily, daily now, is. I gravitated to alcohol for a long period of time, but have recently taken a huge step back, as my health is starting to take a toll. However, I am currently drunk.

I guess I'm just here for comfort, maybe guidance. I go on binges, because I have trouble connecting with humans and it feels hopeless, then incredibly bored. I never picked up my license because I was too busy lost, and now I fear getting one, that for one second I maybe get tunnel vision or become lost and again, causing harm to someone.. 

My parents currently suffer from similar feelings, as well as my siblings, so turning to them is almost heartbreaking because they are depressed and it's more damage than repair. I have a big family, more siblings than one hand.

I don't expect anybody to feel sorry for me, everybody loses pets, and it is never a good thing. In my world, I never really had anyone that I felt wanted me.. I spent many, many years alone as a teenager and child, because there simply was not time for me, my parents and siblings had to focus and I was essentially left to my own, through nobody's faults, just the nature of the game. I only hung out with friends to find substance to numb what I didn't even know existed. There are many factors that play into this, such as relationships, sex, and even abusing others.. which I now feel so much remorse for, because I did not know I was so hurtful at the time..

Briefly, as a 5'7 male today, I was molested once by a close individual when I was 5. I also grew up believing that person to be my guide, only to find out he was crazy and deeply abusive, as well as sick mentally. I developed his addictive personality, and turn to alcohol, and weed for comfort. 

I don't know how to bond with people anymore. Everyone I have known personally has confused me psychologically, and driven me into a dark place, unintentionally, usually by my own delusions and mentality.

My question is, how do I get out of this? I live in the desert, and I want to move to a more lively place, as that is where I grew up in. I miss the trees, I miss so many things, but I don't ever miss people. How do I become close to others again? Should I, or should I take this lonesome island routine as a blessing and use it for my benefit? I know I need to stop with alcohol and abusing weed, but how do you guys find comfort in others after isolation and grief? 

I'm only 23, and that is ultimately what scares me. I shouldn't be this down, not now, not yet anyway. Thank you, to anyone who reads this. I appreciate your time, even I just spit nonsense. God Bless",30Jun2019,1

19,So a couple of weeks ago I met this guy and I really like him. We went on a few dates and we had really good chemistry. Today I was talking to him on Snapchat and he seemed to be pissed off. I asked him if something was wrong and he said he was just having a bad day but that was it. Then later today he blocked me out of the blue. I feel really heartbroken. I really liked him and I don’t have a lot of friends and he made me feel less lonely. I’ve also gained some weight that I’ve been trying to lose and feel unattractive right now and this just makes me feel worse. I’m really worried this is going to make my depression worse. I have hardly any friends and for the last couple of weeks I’ve been talking to and hanging out with him a lot which made me happier and made me feel less alone. Now I’m back to having no one to hangout with or to talk to and I feel lonely. I’m really mad at myself for ever talking to him or getting close to him. I feel terrible.,30Jun2019,4

22,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to go for this but I have no one in my personal life I can go to for this... I also apologize for any typos as I’m still in the midst of a breakdown 

I’ve had issues with depression ever since I was a little kid from ages 6-18 I was in and out of therapy my most recent bout was because of an overdose. Since then I’ve failed out of college, tried the whole online school thing am couldn’t cut it and dropped out. Not too too long after I tried to attend a community college as a last ditch attempt to be somehow useful
to this society. At the time I had a job where to get the position I really wanted I had to go to the community college and they dropped me before I could even start because I wasn’t able to come up with the money I needed to start. Because of this a lot of tension came up at work that’s not worth going into that led me to quit. 

Money. Money has always been the issue. I started a new job in the hopes I could make more but at this point I’m only 21 and I’m drowning in debt ever since getting dropped from school I can’t get the thought of ending it all out of my head. The stress has gotten to me so much I’m constantly taking it out at home I feel like my girlfriend will leave me at any second bc I already have such a bad temper and it’s only getting worse with all this stress. I’m so stressed I can’t even remember what happened all I can remember is throwing a coffee mug at the wall and storming off in my car I’m at some park now. I know what I did was wrong and there’s no excuse for it. 

Stress, money, the thought of my girlfriend leaving me because I’m such a bitch. For weeks I haven’t been able to get these thoughts out of my head and I just want it all to end",30Jun2019,13
23,"For about a year now I’ve felt like nobody truly cares about me, and life is just the same, day after day. People may say “i love you” or “you mean so much to me”, but its never true, its just a way for them to feel like they have a connection with me. Too many girls just lose interest after a few weeks of “liking” me, going to college in a year is scaring me because I’ll feel more alone then ever there, and I just feel like the end goal in life for everyone is just pointless. I’m holding on and want to find more purpose in life other than trying to find someone who cares about me as much as I do for them. Getting a job and having a family sound cool, but thats what everyone else does... I’ve gotten into self harm a bit but not enough to be noticeable. I’ve talked about it with my ex but she didn’t even seem to care for my feelings. She only wanted to make me feel like I’m crazy so more attention was on her. The sadness got worse when I lost her because she was exactly like me and we were perfect for each-other, at least it seemed... I’ve been going through all of this for about a year now and every-time I feel like it’s getting better, I just fall back into it again. I’m not crazy because I know a lot of people deal with worse situations than me, but why is nobody deep anymore?! None of my “friends” ever want to talk about anything with any purpose, none of them ever look past how many likes they get or if some guy/girl saw their picture, etc. Nobody understands and it sucks. I can’t talk to anyone about it because they’ll all think something is wrong with me, and they’ll blame it on the breakup; but it’s been going on much longer than that. I just don’t want to feel like life is so bland and worthless.",30Jun2019,3

I'm so unbelievably inconfident and depressed that nothing, nothing gets through to me. Not a single compliment, not a single word of positivity gets through into my mind. And I feel so utterly lost, I keep losing friends and I keep having to get dumped by my partners. I've frankly had enough of this nightmare and I wish I could just escape. I tried repeating a positive affirmation to myself, for a month, hundreds of times a day, but nothing changed. I tried being more productive, and I still am, but it's still just complete and utter misery. What am I supposed to do? I've got no therapist to help me for another 2 months or so, and I doubt they'll be able to help, not a single therapist in my life has.

26,"Hello, I just found this sub as I'm really struggling to deal with my depression at the moment and would really appreciate some support/advice. 

Things have been bad for awhile but it was manageable as I was working full time, but stuff that was going on at work started making my mental health so much worse to the point that I was regularly self harming and suicidal. I got myself out at the encouragement of two relatively new friends, and have moved and it has definitely helped (apart from the one time thinking about the past situation triggered a re-lapse into that mindset!). My problem now is that I'm feeling really isolated, I have so much time to myself but whenever I'm alone my brain goes to dark and negative places (feelings of being worthless, unloved, everyone hates me, etc. I'm really good at convincing myself all my friends/aquatiances are annoyed/pissed/hate me). I tried to reach out to one of my friends a few times, and sometimes we had good chats and sometimes they kind of give off annoyed/I dont want to deal with this vibes - and I know there were also dealing with one of their best friends who was suicidal for awhile too so I kinda tried to not overload them, and its been kinda weird (and I'm afraid its ruined/altered that friendship for the worse?). My other friend also struggles with mental health so I'm not about ask burden him too much with my stuff either, so that kinda leaves me no one to reach out to. Even then I just find reaching out really hard because it always seems to scare people away, the few times I've opened up about my mental health have always been where things go awry in friendships/relationships. So that makes me really hesitant to do so. Plus, when I'm in a dark place I just word things really weirdly/messed up/etc. and thats probably why thats the case. I'm also anxious and insecure and have no confidence...but still I'm trying to get myself out there to make friends, slowly but surely, but obviously that kinda thing takes time. But I also struggle to see a future for myself, because its been years and nothing ever seems to get better like everyone says. Objectively speaking, I have more support than I ever have before but it just doesnt feel like I have any at all. And I know its partly just that I'm really craving some kind of genuine and deep human connection, but thats so hard for me to find/get when I'm in this place because it gets so hard to hold a conversation about much of anyhting.

Meanwhile, I'm finding myself turning to all my unhealthy coping mechanisms: disassociating, not eating much, not sleeping enough, self-harm, increasingly alcohol etc. I'm trying to work through my emotions more with my art, but I've been too unmotivated to do that the two or so weeks and just sit there and stare at my sketchbook.

I'm trying to get proper help too but I'm unemployed and cant afford much, theres only one place that offers temporary counselling for free - I may be able to get help from them for a bit but thanks to being anxious about phone calls, I haven't talked to them yet.

Does anyone have any advice on getting yourself to open up, finding healthier coping mechanisms, etc? Or really just anything. I've spent most of the last few days sitting in my room not doing much of anything and trying to shut my brain off.",30Jun2019,1

28,"Hey, so this is my first reddit account and I'm still fairly new with how it all works so sorry if I mess something up.

Anyway, this story takes place earlier today. So I went on a date with a girl I've met online trough some friends back in February, and I was pretty excited and also pretty anxious about it the days leading up to the date. Well, today we met and all seemed fine. We had a nice time talking, drawing and goofing off. But a few minutes into us talking about mental health stuff she said she was Asexual, (meaning she isn't attracted to people of any Gender). That came to a total surprise to me and obviously I asked her about it a little more. Turns out she's perfectly happy living her live without ever have fallen in love and having a relationship. That made me kind of sad to be honest with you guys. I mean there is nothing wrong with being Asexual, but I actually was kind of into her leading up to our date and it hit me out of nowhere. Also she actually thought me asking her out was meant as a joke and to not make it more awkward then it already was I kept her thinking that maybe I was serious, but maybe not.

On the way back home, my head started to spiral and I began asking myself ""how can she be happy without ever knowing what love feels like? And how come I'm slowly dying inside everyday I'm separated from the warmth of love.?""

I'm not really sure to be honest but I know it hurts like hell, feeling like no one is there to really show you real genuine affection and makes you feel loved and appreciated. (Family isn't much of a help on that either).

So my question is:

What should I do.? It feels terrible like a gaping hole inside your chest poring out sadness and loneliness. How can I stop this feeling, what should I do?

P. S I'm not sure if this fits in this thread, but I don't know where else to put this. I really need your help guys and thats why I'm reaching out to you here.",30Jun2019,3

30,I’m planning on going to the hospital/ER today and asking to be put under suicide watch. Problem is is that the hospital near me doesn’t have that institution there but the next city over. If I go there should I ask to be transported there?,30Jun2019,1
31,"Part of my depression complex is a life long story of subdueing dreams and potential. I am probably a classic underachiever in many regards. It started as an external fact of life (my upbringing was emotionally and economically deprived) but I probably internalised it deeply later on. I can no longer tell myself apart from that “it’s just not for me” feeling. 

I have now lived with a chronic depression/dysthymia for almost 20 years. All this time I always thought that I would one day catch up on this old plan or that, finally do something about A or B...particularly regarding a career I have always dreamed of. This kind of keeps me from fully accepting that I must live according to my depressive patterns, for some of those goals are not possible if you are filed as depressed and/or medicated. 

This kind of puts me in a cycle - I profoundly feel I owe myself fulfilment and believe that deprivation in this department is part of my dysthymia and frustration. OTOH it seems I am stuck as long as I dont live according to my condition - but doing so will restrict my options over again. Ultimately I think that in order to accept myself as a chronically depressed person, I would have to surrender, let go of my old dreams and accept that I will remain somebody who never lived their fullest.

I have however come to the point where that even seems viable. I would like to ask you: did you have a point in life where you understood that depression or related conditions, would be a major influence in what you will be able to do, and accepted it? What happened then? Did it kind of fade out and get better, or do you still miss what you had to surrender?",30Jun2019,1
32,"Im tired of living, ive had depression since i was like 12 years old. I pretend to be normal for so many years just because of my family and relatives that see depression as something wrong and won’t accept it. Pretending to be normal pretending to be straight while you don’t really know your identity is something that I cannot handle anymore. When you’re family waiting and forcing you to get married and don’t take no for an answer is tragic. I had the chance to live in the US for few years away from people who won’t accept your real identity is something that gave my life a lil hope but the reality is coming and it’s literally the opposite. I don’t know what im writing expect that im crying writing this ive seen couple of psychologists and it gave me some temporary hope but will i make it going back to the society that won’t accept 90% of me? I needed to write this cause my chest can’t keep it anymore and im losing it. I became antisocial for like 4 months the reason is that im done with being someone that im not living a lie for so many years is just something i cant do anymore.. i have no idea who im writing this for i just needed to say it",30Jun2019,1
33,"My parents are trying to pressure me into getting a job after my first year of college. I came out of my first year with a 3.091 GPA, coming from a 2.583 GPA after my first semester. Now, I am taking two courses over the summer (7 units) in order to increase my GPA even more. But now my parents are pressuring me to earn 'A's in both of my courses this semester or else they will force me to get a job during my Fall Semester, where I am taking 15 units worth of courses. They tell me that my grades won't get me a real job in the real world. But I am passionate to get good grades. I want to get good grades.

&amp;#x200B;

But their pressure for me to get a job is starting to make me really depressed again. I've been slowly recovering from depression since January and now its getting worse. 

I've started picking skin off of my fingers again too.....",30Jun2019,1

Anyway, i just need a friend. See my girlfriend broke up with me a couple days ago, and me being the 14 y/o i am, i am not relly doing so well. My two best friends are there for me but, i feel like I've annoyed them enough with it. So i don't have anyone to talk to, idk it may be stupid but yea lol.",30Jun2019,2
37,"While I am badly depressed, that is not the depression talking-- Other than the basement and the parents I meet the exact stereotypical requirements of a loser. While I have my reasons for the way I turned out-- I won't invoke them here so as to render them excuses. The fact is-- I have a personality like a moldy sponge-- covered in cooling diahria. That's not all that's holding me back though-- aside from a badly wrenched spine and triple hernias-- two of which are inguinal, the third one in my navel has never been patched-- my asthma has somehow gotten so bad that they briefly identified it as COPD. I don't think I'm quite staring down the barrel of that last depressive step yet-- but I'm at the stage where I see things for what they are and I feel them closing in. I live off of supplemental income-- I'm being thrown out of the room of the house I'm renting tomorrow to-- if not the street, than a rundown motel for a few days-- then the street. I have applications through for apartments-- that I had to rely on a ""friend"" that I basically leech off of to make for me-- because I just can't mentally handle having to do stuff like that for myself. I don't drive. I have no actual family-- most who meet me hate me straight off and the rest always do eventually-- so maybe that's ironically for the best. Bottom line; I'm waking up to myself, and realizing that I just can't ""me"" anymore. I'm not suicidal yet-- but I can hear it out there on the wind out there. Yet nor do I particularly care about self improvement. I just wanna be able to hack a passably comfortable life on my own merits-- with some real friends I'm not bleeding of their energy and resources-- who can honestly say they'd come to my funeral and actually mourn. In a nutshell: I want the misery to stop. I have no actual skills in much of anything, nor the basic knowledge of even how to obtain them-- while these things may not have been my fault to start with-- it seems the blame has-- in my thirties-- at least partially shifted to me. I don't like that, I don't like ME-- I just need this shit to end. Something's just gotta give, you know?",30Jun2019,6
38,"I have been on escitalopram for about 18 months now, but have been dealing with depression since I was young. I was officially diagnosed with clinical depression and general anxiety at 20 and began taking medication at 22. 

I was suicidal in high school and I've felt suicidal again lately, though I describe it as more ""passive"" than active, because I don't have a plan or really intend to act on it. I just think about how nice it would be to be dead and not have this emotional and mental burden to carry anymore. 

I can't tell if the medication is working? I'm going through a little right now, a breakup, some family health issues, financial struggles and job instability. So things are certainly more stressful and I think that's why my feelings have been so elevated the past month. My therapist also called me ""extremely high functioning"" in that I'm able to go to work and work on my masters while suppressing these feelings from coworkers and friends. But I've always been highly functioning because I've always needed to support myself and help my family- there wasn't any time for me to stop and feel bad for myself.

I'm just curious as to what made some of you decide to switch medications and if there was any improvement on the feelings of constant apathy, hopelessness and anxiety. Part of me wants it to be as simple as a new medication, but I doubt it's that easy of a fix.",30Jun2019,1
39,"Not sure how many are into reading or listening to lectures. But listening to and reading things by Alan Watts has made me realize &amp; feel better about a lot &amp; it’s only been a couple days. Not saying this will help anyone with their mental health, but it sure has helped me. 💙 try and remember feeling deeply is all part of the human experience.",30Jun2019,3
40,"Tomorrow I try to go back to work. The last week was really rough and exhausting for me. I fought every day with myself, especially in the evening and in the morning it continued. I ended taking my AD a few weeks ago. I'm not sure if I hit reality again or if it's withdrawal symptoms(which I can't really image since I lowered the dosis over months)

Well, the thought behind quitting my medication was to see if I can live without it, a ""normal"" life. I got the feeling that it won't really work for me anymore, like I'm immune. I started taking my medicine back in 2017, took it for 2 years. At the same time I went to therapy from 2016 until 2018. This time really helped me to get myself in a better place. By now I feel like I hit rock bottom again. My depression is worse than ever. I had suicidal thoughts in the last 10 years, but was never able to prepare it until now. 

I started to write a suicide note, but my fucking head is empty. I can't really think of anything to write, but the thought of not leaving a note seems unfair to me. I can't really hold conversations anymore, I have no power. It's so fucking hard for me to write down this post, and I don't think I can finish this. The only thing I want to finish is my life. I don't want to feel this pressure anymore. No more headaches, no more breakouts, no anger. The worst thing is to explain it, but nobody really understands. I don't see any future. 

I can't go to work tomorrow. It already drives me crazy to think of working with my colleagues who will ask ""what's wrong? Why are you crying?"" . The latest advice I got from one of my colleagues was to ""calm down"" . I only feel like this because of Planet constellation. I can't stand these fucking mindless people and their stupid questions, advices, their ignorant world view.

On Friday I went to the doctor and told her about my state. (luckily?) she had not much time for me and my problems, so she gave me my pills and said goodbye. Thanks to this mindless lady I got 7900mg of fluoxetine. Dunno if this is enough, but I will thank her in my note.",30Jun2019,1
41,"Not sure if this is where I’d put this, but here it goes. So I don’t know whenever my best friend and I hang out we have so much fun together and I love them very much. We talk everyday and hang out on the weekends when we can. But when either of us has to go home after the weekend is over I feel very sad about it. 

Almost to the point where I don’t know I feel so overwhelmed with how sad I get. I’m not sure if anyone has ever felt like this. 

Is this normal? I’m hoping I’m not just being some whiny baby about the situation.",30Jun2019,1
42,My mother fell in love with someone I felt very depressed for most ofthe relationship. My best friend in college found her husband I got depressed every time I saw them together. Now a close friend and his girlfriend had a baby. I loved going to visit them and seeing the new baby but on the drive home I got very depressed. It seems subconscious. Sure I would love to be in love with a new baby but Im only 28 and its nothing Im ready for right now. I want to figure out why this is happening and how to fix it.,30Jun2019,1

44,"
I've been struggling with self-hate and feeling like I'm a terrible person for a long time. Through the help of therapy, I've connected the feeling to my relationship with my father and his unexpected and untimely death two years ago. I was in the worst state I have ever been about a year following his death, so bad that my long term boyfriend and I split because of my depression. It was a really painful breakup.

My ex-boyfriend and I were in a distance relationship and stopped talking for a long time following the breakup. He moved to a new city and I wasn't aware of it. I committed to a master's program at a very good school in that same city, unaware that he would be there. We reconnected briefly for a different reason, and discovered we'd be in the same city shortly (for the first time since we first started dating). We also have several mutual friends in the same city, including one of my best friends from childhood, who I learned that my ex hands out with very regularly.

My ex has been nothing but nice and excited for me about the grad school opportunity, and has even suggested we catch up after I move there. Our mutual friends have also reached out to me and have told me they're so excited for me to move there.

And I can't help but feel like I'm a total piece of shit for moving there. I feel evil, creeping up from his past, reopening the old wounds of our painful breakup, and stealing his friends and ruining the community he's built down there. I feel like his friends and family probably hate me and they don't want to see me anywhere near him. I feel like the best thing I could do would be to leave them all alone, but then I feel like I'd be so rude just ghosting them all. And I do genuinely want to hang with the mutual friends. I'm not opposed to catching up with my ex either, we really care about each other still and while I don't think we can hang out casually (I think we were too serious while we were dating to easily transition to casual friendship), it would be nice to see him. Logically I know, nothing has been said that should make me feel like this. But I can't shake the feeling, and it's crippling me. My excitement about the grad school opportunity is wanting because of the waves of self hate. I feel like the worst person. I feel like the villian in this story. I've been in therapy for so long but this feeling is not going away. Why am I having such an extreme reaction to this? And what can I do to listen to what everyone has been telling me, and shake the feeling?",30Jun2019,2
