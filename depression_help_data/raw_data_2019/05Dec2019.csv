0,"Anytime i have a good day at school or anything, I can always expect to come out and be yelled at for being selfish or for my grades. I try to make good grades, but being fussed at and punished for them all the time doesn’t help that at all. It mainly just distracts me and makes we want to try less. It’s pretty much just a circle of disappointment and i cant escape it. 

And just to top it off, depression runs in my family. My brother was diagnosed with it. But becuase of this, my parents over look me and dont even think that maybe i might too. They just always say that I have an attitude or im too sassy. I am rarely allowed to leave my house and have been punished from my phone and video games since about 2nd grade. I have never done anything that bad. The worst thing ive ever been caught for was probably “disrespecting a teacher”. 

I am also very skinny and it is one of my biggest insecurities. I am 5’8” and only 125 lb. Ive gotten bullied alot for it. If i wanna go to the gym. I have to do it secretly becuase I font want my parents to know that I dont like being skinny. It will always end up something like, “ You should be grateful and nobody bullies you. You should be happy, some people wish to be like you”

Anyways, I just dont know what to do. At this point, Im just waiting untill i either die or finish school and move out for collage.",05Dec2019,1
1,"2 Months ago i dropped out College (I wrote about that a while back) and i tried going somewhere else because the situation i was in over there was a repeat cycle of insanity i didn't want to go through again (I went through all through Middle School and High School) and over that time i felt like i didn't have much choice in terms of schooling but out of state or online (Majority of the colleges in my state function the same way since they're under the same system most of them)  

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to do online school because i didn't know anything else to do and it was more affordable than physically going. After filling out the required paper work  i needed to get my high school and college transcripts out (The High School one is still going through issues while the college one they have) I recently checked on my application status  and to my horror they required that i take a English/Math Placement which put me in a panic (I understand most colleges do it these things do nothing but traumatize me)  

I need to schedule it before the second semester arrives (January) and i know for a fact that i'm going to fail it then have to retake remedial classes again which is just going to push me into having another episodes of chest pains",05Dec2019,1

How do I know she’s ok now So much is going through my head idk what to think about first.,05Dec2019,1
3,"I used to love cooking and did it all the time, but these days I can just barely get by eating a bowl of cereal or a PB&amp;J.  Any more effort than that and I just can't be bothered.

I'm very overweight, obese, and I just found out that I'm pre-diabetic.  I'm scared as shit - I know people who have diabetes and not only does it suck major balls, but there's no getting rid of it once you've got it.

I'm trying to come up with a grocery list of relatively healthy things to pick up at the store, but I'm completely drawing a blank.  What do normal people even eat everyday anyways??

I've managed to start making eggs, which is a good source of protein for me.  Most meat takes too much time and effort to make and just leaves me with a big mess I have to clean up after, and I really don't have the energy for that.

I've also started getting some bagged broccoli that you can just stick in the microwave and it steams.  This is helping get a little bit if greens in me.  I like potatoes and corn, which are also easy to make, but they're not the healthiest options for me so I've been avoiding them thus far.

Fruits are relatively simple to eat, usually, but I honestly never found them to be filling or enjoyable.  Plus, they have a lot of natural sugars - something I REALLY need to be avoiding right now.

I LOVE carbs - namely bread, rice, cereal, and pasta.  I could happily eat just that for the rest of my life and be content.  You know, minus the obesity and impending diabetes and other health problems.  So, yeah...

What should I eat?  What's relatively simple to make?  I'm not too terribly picky (unless we're talking seafood, which I seriously can't handle) and I live in Los Angeles, so I have quite the wide variety of options to choose from.  I'm sure I could find almost any food I wanted if I just tried.  I just have no idea what I should get...

Any variations of eggs would be greatly appreciated - right now I usually just eat them scrambled or poached, and I have been trying to toss a few things, such as peppers and onions, in there with 'em when I can.

So if you guys can think of anything, from meals to just snacks, I'd really appreciate if you shared with me!  Thank you!",05Dec2019,1

15,"Heyo,
When I started to post on this sub a while back I was in a very dark spot and the people of this sub actually convinced me to seek medical help and go for a therapy.
I suffer from schizophrenia and I tend to hallucinate when my head starts to overload with voices that just mess with me and insult me.
My last session my therapist actually figured a way for me to kind of reset my head (which doesnt work always) but it does make my life alot easier to be honest so I thought I might just share it here because it also helps me to kind of stop circling in bad thoughts.
So basically what I do is this:
I have a rubber on my left hand and when I notice my head goes rampage I just say stop loud and clearly and snap the rubber.
This kind of just stops all trains of thoughts that happen.
And then I figured out a thinking routine to immediatly switch to which consists of positive thoughts about my self that I figured out together with my therapist.
I must say it really helps me cope alot lately and makes my life so much easier because I feel like I have a way to fight against the voices in my head and I just thought Id put it out here and I hope someone besides me will find it useful.
Stay positive guys this community really is a great one.",05Dec2019,1
16,"3years ago I was happy and having the best days of my life.

I wasted a shit ton of money on meds only to find out its incurable at least in ma case I have universalis version ( most fucked up ). Yeah so here I am now suicidal, sad and just tired of everybody telling me about acceptance. Although I believe I have kind of learnt to deal with it but things are never gonna be same anymore. I have constant anxiety episodes, my grades are somehow fine but I have lost all my confidence. My 2yr relationship broke, my friends don’t understand me. I am better than before am finally getting normal around things but its just that I can never accept this, I never wanted this, neither did I do anything to cause it and I just won’t ever be the same again. I am scarred for idk forever. I sometimes get super motivated to get better get back in shape, have hope but I still dream if not every but most nights what If they come back how crazy I could be its silly to be obsessed with something so you know related to physical appearance but I just can’t get rid of the fact that I just won’t see things the way that I earlier did I would always be this scary little hairless prick that people stare at, and isolation is the only solution.

20,"(First post)

I have been struggling with depression for a long time (ups and extreme downs) and when I'm stressed I can't cope. I had been to speak to a doc at 17yrs but was told I ""didn't look depressed"" and from then on I felt like I had to deal with it by myself. I was always putting on a big smile with others and my partner was one of the only people that saw me in my most depressed states. But then it spilled in to work and I was crying all the time and feeling exhausted. I had paid for private CBT, started meditation, mindfulness, journalling which has all helped but I still couldn't get out of that deep, low feeling.

I went to the doctor but I couldn't tell her that I needed help. I told her I had blacked out and been feeling really stressed. And I don't know why I had to add that I had collapsed, I have been feeling more clear headed now and just dont knw why I did that, and now I have been referred to hospital and told I can't drive until I have been checked out and I just went along with it (5 weeks ago). I felt really detached from reality. So I was signed off work for stress and exhaustion but I knew that I still wanted to tell a doctor about how I had been feeling for a long time. 

I felt like i was going crazy and just wanted to tell a doctor how I had been feeling and finally did it and she was a great help and very supportive and has prescribed medication and created a plan, but I now feel extremely stressed about not being able to drive and the fact that i told the doctor something that didnt happen and now im paying for it. 

I really don't know what to do, I dont want to waste time or money or resources. I want to be able to drive to get me out of my house (live rural). I don't want to get in to trouble (I am a 28yr old adult and I feel scared). I feel like an idiot for not being able to just say I wasn't coping the first time I spoke to a doctor. I had to get this off my chest and I just don't know what to do about it....",05Dec2019,1

For context, we were very close but lost contact for some months. We recently reconnected, apart from ""how are you"" etc., we haven't really talked ""deep"". We used to talk deep, the ""Even my therapist doesn't know"" deep. We know eachother really well. She's been through a lot and suffered from depression for a long time.

Her status updates are worrying me, they're sad, depressing &amp; self-deprecating. I know her well enough that I know this isn't for attention. I'm pretty sure these are cries for help. I don't know if she is seeing a therapist at the moment, I also don't think it's a good idea to ask. Because we haven't talked too deep yet, I don't know if she has gone through some trauma when we weren't in contact.

I've been offering my attention and time, asking how shes doing, I've been actively trying to chat her up. I've told her how much she means to me, made her uplifting memes, played a song she likes on the guitar for her.

I'm writing this for some release and try to deal with recent events. Past 3 years have been downhill. Have to move with my in laws due to wife's pregnancy, i promise my mother in law to bring her with us once we get our own place. Get verbally attacked day and night by them for any single thing i do differently from them, or stuff i don't know or get wrong. 

Found my wife was being unfaithful or at least said that to one of her friends as a ""joke"", confronted her, she dismissed it as a Joke. Laws in my country are bad for the male in terms of who gets custody of our 2 yr old girl so i try to make it work first. Get fired from my job due to ""slowing down the team's work"" claims from the company's lazy guy. 

Manage to get some work at home freelancing gigs through a platform to keep the lights on. Move out thanks to a credit my wife gets, the mother in law moves in with us due to my previous promise. Verbal attacks keep coming daily. 

Wife occasionally buys clothes for our girl but doesn't give a cent for food or diapers, arguing she is paying the house so she keeps more than half her income for herself, I pay the same amount she earns for stuff she wants plus that same amount for my credit cards filled by her plus the same amount for her credit cards plus freelancing software, food, utilities and daycare (So my wife gets 70% my salary, 20% for my kid, food, utilities and daycare, 10% software needs for job, 0% for myself)

Freelancing gigs start closing with no new ones opening up, stress keeps piling. Look for jobs but i'm always overqualified or too expensive. Last  gig closes up and the customer complains his expectations were not fulfilled, the platform bans me in response.

28,"TW mentions of self harm; TL;DR at the bottom 

Sorry for my english, it's not my first language and it's hard to find the right words for this

So I've had depression for over 7 years now, I was hospitalized in 2013 when I was extremely suicidal (17 at the time) and after that therapy I carried on with my life and managed to finish school etc.
Now I'm in my 2nd year of uni and suffer from severe OCD, depression and anxiety
I started self harming again and it's the only thing that makes me actually FEEL anything again, I feel so numb and dead inside.
I've talked to a professor of mine about the whole situation and she knows my story and she's so understanding and kind, I feel better immediately when she's around. She's a doctor btw and she gives psychology lectures so she knows a lot about mental illnesses.
I had a panic attack due to intense flashbacks the other day and I was (or rather am) having suicidal thoughts. A friend brought me into a relaxation room and I had a bad breakdown and like 30 seconds later said professor came in and they managed to calm me down.
And then she said one thing that makes me feel strange, she said that she can like calm me down and stuff now but she isn't trained enough to pull me out of this.
I've talked to my parents and boyfriend and none of them really understands how I feel and they can't really reach me in the darkness I am in, they're worried and they care but they just can't get an idea of what it looks like inside my mind.

I want to talk to her again so badly but I feel like I'm a burden and I don't want to annoy her so I guess I'll just be falling apart by myself :(

TL;DR my professor is the only one I feel understood by and I'm afraid of talking to her again because she said she's not trained enough for that kind of stuff

Teen, introverted, depressed af, in school, from Germany, stressed 24/7 about tests and exams, living with my parents and my niece. 
Don't really know my dad, in a way. He's either at work (bus driver) or at home, drunk of off beer. He's not abusive, but certainly not himself. Told my sister about my depression, didn't believe me, even though she had depression prior to me and is 19y/o. Told mom about my depressed self, didn't bother helping, told me I don't understand what it is. Tried twice. Same response. My mom gives me no right to speak my opinion, or id get punished (grounded, no phone, etc.) . Called the ""Nummer gegen Kummer"" (Number against grief) and the lady who answered gave me tips and suggestions on how I could try to get help. Can't do any of the things she said. Mom tried to sell my cat, Kupa, behind our backs and yell us he ran away, but I caught on and got her to tell me, and now he's most likely dead. That also really hurt. Still dream and cry about him to this day. Now I tried texting my brother who lives with his wife and 2 kids, asking if I could stay at his place and look for a solution. He agreed, and asked to clarify, I did, he told me he could get me this weekend, nervous af. No one else in my direct family believed me, let's try him next. My niece, who I mentioned, bullies me in a way that destroys me inside (No privacy, no respect, no care) . Tried retaliating a few times, and got myself in trouble instead, because mom always believes the younger lil shit. She's a hellspawn, as well as her own siblings. Currently also planning on running tf away from here and not look back, I have a target where I'd go, but it'll take a while.
