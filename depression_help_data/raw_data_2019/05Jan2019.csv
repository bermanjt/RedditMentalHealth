 do that to my two kids. Anybody else feel this way?",05Jan2019,1
1," 

I'm in my mid 20's moved back in with my family. Thinking of hanging myself everyday or overdosing and had a few shitty attempts in the past. Not working and I have no money so i'm making everyone's life around me worse by the day. I used to be decently normal not too long ago. I've slept around a lot and now i get cold sores(herpes) every few weeks which makes me want to kill myself even more. I've also used anabolic steroids not too long ago. I want to be a normal person again. I feel like a combination of my hormones being fucked and underlying STD's are possibly causing my mental health problems. I don't have/have never insurance in my life or a doctor. I don't have any money right now and couldn't get any from my family if I tried and they have no family insurance I could try to get on.

Can I go to an Emergency room and get a hormone test,STD test, herpes medication, and antidepressants?",05Jan2019,1
3,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so drained. I've been feeling terrible for so long. Been depressed four or five years. I got really sick a couple years ago, missed four months of school, and I never really recovered. Since then I catch a cold every other week, I've never felt nearly as energetic as I used to, and basically everyone but my dad thinks I'm faking it. Christmas is the only thing I would count on to be consistently good but this year it wasn't and it really messed me up. The last couple weeks I've barely eaten, I've barely slept, and I only use the bathroom late at night when everyone is asleep. I hate having to see and talk to my family so much, with the exception of my dad. I can't stand them anymore, being around them makes me feel violent. Now school is starting back up and my dad has to go back to work and I won't be able to stay in my room anymore and I'm so so stressed about it. I don't have the motivation to take care of myself in the most basic ways, I don't enjoy any of the things I used to like anymore, I'm just so tired and drained and I'm really having trouble coming up with a reason to keep going. 

Due to living in a super rural area and some various other factors there's essentially nothing to go do, can't even just enjoy being outside since it's so cold all the time, and getting fresh produce in the winter is basically impossible. Most of my life it's been just me and my dad, but money got tight for us and some extended family so we all decided to move in together for a while. Living with my family has been torture as they're ridiculously loud at all hours of the day, inconsiderate, directly hostile to me and passive aggressive to my dad, and they force my dog to live in the garage. All us who are still in school are homeschooled, so there's rarely any escape from them. There's just constant tension and it feels like nobody here likes each other. I feel a lot worse here than I normally would but I wasn't happy before, either.

To top it all off, I finally had the guts to tell my dad how I've been feeling and essentially he said there's nothing we can do about any of this stuff and I just have to tough it out. For how long though? Until summer? Until I graduate? Forever? My chest hurts, my head hurts, my stomach hurts, I don't feel like I'm even going to make it until tomorrow, much less some vague far off light at the end of the tunnel. I really need help. People keep telling me to just suck it up but I'm not sure how. If I could have a reaction to any of this stuff other than to be depressed, angry, or apathetic to everything I would do that, but it's not that easy. Please help.",05Jan2019,1

5,"please help. i very recently started cutting and i want to stop but i also don't. i see why people say it's addicting. i can't stop thinking about it. i just want to cut to not feel numb, but at the same time i know how horrible it is and feel so shameful about it. i've tried snapping a rubber band against myself to resist the urge but it doesn't do it for me and still can't stop thinking about cutting.

6,Hello everyone i just made a 12 Days of Chronic Illness Awareness Series and I was on my anxiety &amp; Depression day and thought I‚Äôd ask if anyone was interested in wanting to see it?,05Jan2019,1
7,"Hey all. Fellow sad human here.

We were talking about some beauty pageant and I made the (standard) self deprecating remark about how it's great living in a rural state because comparatively if you're young and healthy you're a step above the rest.

It was a joke made in poor taste and only said for the laughs.


My boyfriend went on to say I'm a solid 7/10 for my state and genuinely meant it as a compliment. 


Ok. Like. I hate myself. A lot. I'd for myself a 5/10. But I'm tan. Thin. Fit. My face isn't ugly by any means. And I did not fucking ask for that??

I didn't break down in front of him but I am dying inside. Who says that???? I understand that very few people are a 10/10 but when the subject has (somehow) come up in the past in relationships I always say 10/10 bc if I'm being 100% honest, if I'm into the person, that's how I fucking see them. I do. It's not bullshit. If im in love and hyped up on someone, that's how they look in my eyes.


I can't. Handel it. Is it vain? Probably. But my brain perceived it as basically an admission : ""there's better out there. But I can't have it so I'm settling for you!""


I cannot recover from this. I am so goddamn insecure. I don't feel comfortable. I want to find someone who sees me as their ten. 


Really just looking for some help as I'm up festering like an idiot. ",05Jan2019,1
9,"Hey y‚Äôall! 
I have been struggling to get motivated and then stay focused on whatever the task I started. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety as well as depression so that also plays a bit of a factor. As well as that I love to procrastinate but I am also a pretty big perfectionist. To try &amp; counteract what I have going against me{or at least trying too}. I will try and make a to do list, because I love a nice &amp; pretty to do list. But, I will either make the to do list over and over again until it meets my perfectionist standards or I will make it pretty intensive &amp; it will becomes way to overwhelming.

It will get so overwhelming that my anxiety will then begin to tell me ‚ÄúThere is no way you can complete this whole list and to the standards that you have set, so why when complete any of them? You will just disappoint yourself and others.‚Äù 

I have tried a variety of things to combat all of this &amp; accomplish whatever task I need to get done, but I haven‚Äôt found anything that really works. 

I am looking for any tips or ideas that y‚Äôall would be willing to give me to help me! 

Thank y‚Äôall. I hope everyone had a good New Yearsüíûü•∞",05Jan2019,1
10,"Firstly, just want to say I can‚Äôt promise I can give everyone time, though most likely will only get up to 5 or so at most, but just is a precursor in case, as nothing would be more horrible than reaching out and getting no response!

But basically, if you just want to rant, or would like some advice, or maybe just want to talk, I‚Äôll be available for a few hours before I go to sleep. 

I‚Äôve been there myself, and am still struggling with mental health issues. But I find it helpful to myself to consider other peoples issues from my perspective, because often they are similar to my own issues in many ways and it gives me a healthy, fresh, and more objective view of the things that get us down.

Also helps me feel good too. Which is nice. I‚Äôm all about dat dopamine.

So feel free to pm me, or if you are an open book even post here. Anyone please feel welcome to join in any discussion that may happen (or not, but at least I tried lel)

11,"Okay, so I guess I've had this problem for about a decade, and it's really gotten bad over the past couple years. I don't really have anyone in my life I can talk about this problem so here I am. I'll try to explain:

I stopped believing in god when I was pretty young, and I've been exposed to a fair amount of death in my life. I'm not talking just funerals, I'm talking taking care of people I cared about and watching them basically just.. expire. I feel like everyone does what they do in their every day lives to distract themselves from the fact that we are going to die. I try my hardest to distract myself too. It's difficult, especially when I'm alone.

The thing is, this didn't become a huge problem until recently and I'm not sure what triggered it. The ""click,"" you know, like a switch in your brain that once it's on it's never turning off. And it triggers this feeling unlike anything else. I'd mix it with the cold liquid in the chest heartbreak feeling along with a pure adrenaline feeling you get when you come inches from dying (another thing worth mentioning is for 5 years up until this Christmas I had a very dangerous job) but if i were to sum up this feeling, it feels like I'm dying. Is this a panic attack?

Anyway when it finally passes and i try to get back to daily life everything else starts falling down like dominoes. ""We're finite. Nothing matters. No matter what we do with our lives, we will be forgotten, our very planet will someday no longer exist. The only meaning life has ever had is whatever meaning people have decided to give it, and it doesn't even matter."" I know this probably sounds silly and yes, most people are ""aware"" of their situation but for me it's like I've seen something I can never unsee and I can never let go of, or rather, it will never let go of me. 

This isn't a problem that can be solved. I do what I can do distract myself. Currently I've started a new job that gives me time to pursue programming in the hopes that i can eventually get a career in that field, so I've got plenty of distractions. But lately these things have been bubbling up more frequently and I'm having trouble containing myself.

If you're out there and you have this problem, I'll take any advice you can give me.",05Jan2019,1
13,"At the end of November, i was talking about issues I was having with one of my closest friends. I had been talking about it a lot over the past six months before that and it just seemed to reach a boiling point, not that I always spoke about it, I did still talk about positive things, things that aren't my issues etc, but they then asked me for space. Not knowing what they meant I wound up texting them a lot, and speaking to them in person apologising (as in a full responsibility accepting type apology, I'm not too certain it was good though.) and they tehn asld me for space again, but appreciated the apology. The following Monday I wound up in hospital from overdosing on pills, and from then on my other friends all stopped speaking to me as well, but this time with no word. They pretend I dont exist and whenever I go near the group the ones that aren't speaking to me leave with the one wanting space (I don't approach intending to speak to the one person, I know they'll leave with the others and at least won't be speaking to them) , and I'm very certain the one who wants space didn't turn them against me, but I'm not too sure anymore. I have the reminder of the groiup but I don't... mix well with them. I can't get very close to them at all, and now I'm lost and all on my own, and I don't know if my friends will want to speak to me again. I'm not even very good at making friends in the first place so losing them is even harder. 

What happened? What should I do?

(Also, in case it's asked, 15M

tl;dr Close, caring friend wants space. I took it badly and tried to end it all, word must have gotten out and now my other friends aren't speaking to me either. ",05Jan2019,1
