1,"Hey everyone, I feel stuck in a downward spiral, and I really just don't know what to do at this point. I've gotten to a point where I don't have suicidal thoughts, because I don't believe that I deserve to have such an easy escape. 

I believe that my issues with mental health stem from issues with my physical health, as I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, in conjunction with a disability at 8 (I'm 18 now), which has had a pretty large impact on my life. 

It may also be hereditary, as many of my family members have also suffered with depression, anxiety etc. This also makes me feel that I can't discuss my issues with them, because I don't want to add to their struggles.

Doctors have refused to give me medication, which is pretty strange as other people I know who are suffering have been given it, so I don't think it's related to my age, or put me on waiting lists for counselling. They just tell me to ""come back if it gets worse"". I can't afford to go private at the moment, which means I'm just suffering in silence, essentially.

I've been told that I give pretty good advice, including from friends who also have mental health problems, but I'm just telling them what I so desperately hear. I suppose the purpose of my post is just to ask whether it really does get better, because at this point, I can't remember an extensive period of time in which I've been consistently happy in the last 5 years.

Thanks.",10Jul2019,2
2,"I've been on so many meds. I dont know what to do. I've had some bad experiences with psychiatrists and I'm nervous about basically just picking one outta the phone book. I once had one ask me to chose my own treatment plan and I was thinking about coming up with some ideas and just asking my GP to rx it. 

My GP offered ketamine but a full course would run me about 1200 bucks out of pocket (which I know is super reasonable but I'm having some money issues rn). 

Have any of you relapsed while on an antipsychotic? I've already fiddled with the doses and cannot tolerate more than 5mg of abilify.",10Jul2019,1

To clarify im 16 M and i have depression for no reason.
I habe suicidal thought close to all the time and when i am walking on a bridge/high place or near a train track etc. i get an impulse or jearing to jump of/walk infront of the train.
Usually what helps me not do or plan my own desth is reasons /""excuses"" which usually seem sound.
Ones like :""i will habe been even more of a reccource waste than i already am""
""the parents/close family will be sad"",""i could maybe hurt people""(which i usually dont belive because im pretty sure basically everyone hates me)
""my dog wouldnt understand why im gone and why im not coming back""

5,"This is not exactly depression related but i need advice and don’t know where else to go.I have  been suffering from depression for the last 5 years.Basically,there’s one person i got to know about two months ago(family) and who genuinely cares and has tried many times face to face and in text to get me to open up about my feelings because she thinks something’s up.I hate that’s how i come across now from the outside and feel guilty that i might not be showing the same care in return and that she thinks I don’t want to share stuff with her by avoiding talking about myself.I was/am in a particularly nasty phase of my depression and hate I couldn’t at least pretend to put on a smile when i went to visit as i normally would.Basically,i am a very private person and want to make it clear that its not like that but i can’t find the right words.Im working to get back on the pretending everything is great part but want to clear this up as I would hate it if she thinks that I don’t want anything to do with her.how do i do that?This person has shown me so much support and love that it touches my heart and i have thanked her for it but I refuse to open up to anybody(reasons) and don’t want her to take it personal...Thanks for any advice...",10Jul2019,1
6,"Basically title. Both have diagnosed depression and anxiety. I want to be as helpful as possible, but I know that I am obviously not the same as professional help. Mostly I've been very open with them that I am here to listen, but might not know the right things to say. However, I feel like I've had to be more distant with my sister because sometimes she asks what my opinion is on people or problems that don't affect me fully (ex: what did you think of when mom said ""x"" thing to me) and it makes me uncomfortable because I think she is looking for an answer that agrees with her perspective. I totally understand that depression, anxiety and mental illness are different experiences for everyone and that if you're experiencing this you deserve support. I text each one frequently to let them know that I'm always here for them if they need to vent or need to be distracted. Otherwise I feel like I don't have much to offer other than helping them do research on mental health providers. Any advice is appreciated, I'm very open to any feedback on what I have been doing as well. Thank you :)",10Jul2019,1
7,"I lost a good woman in my life all because I wanted her to feel how I felt. She never understood how hurtful it was to compare me to her ex, mentioning her ex, reminiscing about her ex. On top of that she wouldnt cut ties with a coworker that she wound attractive. I wanted reassurance and I felt myself drifting apart from her because she wasn't giving me comfort when it came to feeling secure. 

Some people say it's not someone else's job to make you happy and secure. You should already be happy and secure with yourself, and a significant other should just be a bonus to your life.

But I the beginning my significant other accepted me for the broken person I was and understood what I've been through. But instead of reassuring me that she wont act in the same way that hurt me on the past multiple times, she did the exact thing o told her to stay clear of.

I thought having her understand how being cheated on feels like was a good idea. But now were no longer together. I miss her. I love her. And I regret doing anything like that.and now her family and friends dont like me anymore and no longer talk to me.

I cant stop thinking about her.

How can I move on from this? Part of me still has hope that maybe in 5 or 10 years we can still be together. But I know that's not realistic and I want to be able to move on with my life. She seems to be doing just fine as I saw from her sisters snapchat and one mutual friends snapchat but I'm now blocked from that mutual friend. Shes always smiling and shes happier than ever.

I feel that I'll never find anyone like her again... she was special to me. I sacrificed alot of my Hope's and dreams to be with her and I find myself STILL sacrificing my Hope's and dreams because I have false hope that we can be together again...

I feel so depressed and sometimes I just want everything to end already. I feel I'll never be as happy as j was with her even though we would constantly argue...

13,"I’m F(15) and I have a problem with my image. I don’t like what I look like, even when people tell me positive things.

For a little bit of imagery, I have shoulder ginger hair, freckles, pale skin, brown eyes, full lips and a smaller nose. I wear glasses and have braces. I have a petite body with bigger thighs and I get called “thick” near my bottom, every so often ever since I’ve started working out, and a chest thats hardly existent. I do deal with an ED, and currently trying to recover. 

I guess my issue is finding something to truly like about myself. I love my stretch marks, so whenever I feel bad about myself, I remind myself that my “tiger stripes” are there. My boyfriend tells me he loves me for who I am, which I respect, but whenever I tell him about my insecurities he gets fairly frustrated with the way I talk about myself, which is typically a negative way.

I do get random sparks of happiness about my body. Just a couple of days ago, ever since I’ve been working out (targeting the lower half of my body), I noticed my thighs have come back from being so skinny (from my ED), and my bottom is getting bigger, too, as my friends are starting to call me “thick.” I’ve always wanted to have a bottom so knowing that I’m slowly getting there, is really a booster. 

I just need a little bit of help on how to improve my self image, besides being disgusted with what I see, besides those little happy moments.

14,"Disclaimers: Never posted on reddit before, but I don't know who else to talk to.   
The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. 

  
Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

  
I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session won't be for another 2 weeks.",10Jul2019,30

16,"Hi, 
This is my first post on this subreddit. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life. I recently stopped medication (about a year ago) because I became a lot stronger and more able to handle my depression by myself. My life started picking up, I got my dream job and everything was going great. Me and my girlfriend were having a great time. Then I got kidney stones, and my dream job fell through. I tried for months to get back into it however nothing worked out and I guess I slowly started to fall back into the void. My gf ended up leaving me for another guy. For months she’d been the only stable/assured thing in my life. I was so scared of loosing her I was too protective and controlling of her. In my attempt to keep her close I ended up pushing her away. Two weeks after that one of my friends who I play online with killed himself and not even a week after that my two best friends died in a car crash. On top of this I’d just been diagnosed with a thyroid gland issue, shining a bit of light on my sudden weight gain and subsequent fitness and health issues. All of my opportunities I had fell through and now my final best friend became a shut in and has descended into his own depression. I am finding it very difficult to find any motivation at the moment to do anything. Part of me wants to just disappear off the map, go somewhere and be forgotten about, and another part wants me to fight. However each and everyday I continue I feel more and more lonely and empty. I miss my girlfriend, I miss my mates. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like everything bad that could have happened to me did in the span of 6 months and I’m starting to find it difficult to even find hope in the little things. Some of my passions I had, things I did in my free time have become boring and meaningless. 6 months ago I had a plan, a future envisioned. But basically overnight everything fell apart and disappeared with me being able to do nothing about it. I still haven’t taken my meds since I stopped taking them last year. I want to be able to prove I can get through this without them. I feel if I take them again I’ll throwing all my progress away. For the first time I was happy without them, and I want that back, but I don’t feel like I ever will.
I guess I’m just scared, and need a bit of support.",10Jul2019,1

Hi all, I am a \[21/M\]. I am studying mechanical engineer at my university. I have always watched Reddit videos on Youtube and figured I'd give it a chance. I don't even know if I am posting this on the correct thread because of being new to reddit. I hope I am able to find an answer in these comments, because I personally believe everyone deserves support. Well, grab a drink because this is going to be a long read. I have changed the names of the countries, states, cities and people's names to their protect privacy. Sorry for all the grammar mistakes.

\-The first part of my depression really starts from my sad childhood. It started when I got old enough to realize that sometimes your not even able to trust people you call family. When I was younger my family brought my Uncle (We'll call him Miho) and his family over to the US to stay for the first time. They were nice to us at the beginning when my family was doing well, but when my dad got sick and we got poorer, they began to treat us like we were beneath them. Miho began to tear my family apart trying to get my dad to take all the money from our family and give it to him. Luckily this could not happen because my mother's name was on all the legal documents. This stopped Miho from being able to take any money from us. Miho began to tell all my other extended family members that we were monsters, making us out to be terrible people. This caused my uncles and aunts to visit less, and not allow their children to visit us. It was essentially like we were a branch getting cut from the family tree and the last piece that held us on that tree was my dad. When he passed they did not pay a single penny for the funeral. We hosted the funeral and found him a resting place. Miho and his family did not even have the respect to dress in funeral clothing. Coming in name brand clothing and flip flops.

\-The second part of it would be my low self esteem. I constantly tell others that they should not judge themselves or be hard on themselves when they are feeling down even when I do this behind closed doors. I judge my progress by comparing myself to others who are currently getting rich and getting great grades. Making me feel like everything I do is never enough. I constantly feel like I hold back everyone, even my closest friends and family. I always help others and give my 100% all in their problems, but whenever the problem involves myself I freeze. I shut down. I laugh and I tell my friends and family that it's okay, that I'm fine. When I am really dying inside. I have a lot of emotions and you know as a male especially in a Asian family, you are expected to no show/feel anything. Bottling up all these feelings over time has really taken a toll on me.

\-The third reason would most likely be guilt. I have low self esteem because of my guilt, guilt that I was never that star child that every tiger parent wanted. I did not win a single medal until after my dad pass away. I was god awful at school and almost never made the honor roll. This ate me up inside, made me feel useless. What made this worse that I never really got to spend time with him because as a child because he worked hard, always in the back cutting veggies. As we both got older, I became the normal angsty rebellious teen who wanted to do nothing, but play video games. I did not notice my dad getting old until it was way to late. We did have a lot of moments in the small amount of time we did hang out together, some of my best memories in my messed up childhood, like; going to the arcade to play Pac Man, watching old Asian movies/dramas, and going on errands with him for the store we use to own. I wish I had more time with him.

\-The fourth reason would be fear. The fear I'll be a failure forever. The fear that I am going to be broke and homeless. The fear of being left behind and alone. The fear of being less than the expectations for myself or my family. The fear of not being able to amount to anything. I have a fear that I'll lose control and fall and never be able to dig my way out. The thing I fear most is completely losing all hope because I am the type of person to always make hope when there is none. At least that was the person who I use to be.

\-The fifth reason would be my current college career. I am currently a upcoming Junior on a 5 year program in Mechanical Engineering. I did decent enough my first 3 semesters of college. I had a 2.89 GPA at the time and was feeling like I could bring my grades back up. The classes began to get harder and I did all I could to study for them. I tried to go tutoring, had friends teach me, went to office hours, and attending supplemental instruction. This did helped my grades some what, but did not help me get to where I wanted. I was doing decent until Miho, my uncle, began to get my other extended family members to turn on us saying we were the ones trying to kill my dad so we could take his money. I couldn't take it, getting calls everyday all different numbers from Miho's birth country saying I am a disgrace and that I should be ashamed to be \[my last name\]. There were even calls from the uncles, aunts, cousins, and even my godparents. My cousins stopped hanging out with my family and threw big parties without us and posted them on Facebook to I guess mock us. My GPA dropped to a 2.72 that following semester and all the feelings that I held in began to let loose. My depression began to leak out and I kept freezing and becoming emotionless. I saw this in my mom as well, she began too become depress because we use to have a lot of family to hang around, but now it was if we were nothing to them from the start. I was losing myself more and more after this. I started to let my classes slip. I began to sink into a endless self pity pit and my GPA finally dropped to a 2.09. I thought about giving up so many times. This utterly crushed my will, hope, and happiness.

I guess my question would be, how does one move on when they are so broken on the inside, is it possible to pull myself out and actually get a job with how my GPA has fluctuated and how do I move forward with all this? Thank you all for your time.

TLDR: Family problems and Depression crushed my will to move forward.",10Jul2019,1
21,"New to Reddit. I (26, female) have been suffering from depression since 18, when I started college. I’ve also recently developed anxiety disorder within the year. My depression is crippling and I don’t remember that last time I’ve actually felt happiness. I’m always stressed and anxious. I can’t focus. I feel anxiety around my lifelong friends and boyfriend.  I feel unloved. I’ve failed in my career. I’ve gained weight. I just don’t love myself. Though I’ve suffered for a long time with what I would say is SEVERE anxiety, I have not seeked help yet.

I can still go about my normal day and act normal but I'm just so done at all times. I feel like I'm walking around wearing a mask.

24,"Just another sob story so scroll past it if you like.

I honestly don't even know where to begin. I'm ready to see a psychiatrist about my issues because it's reoccurring and I'm afraid of what I might do to myself if I don't act. I'm doing my best to avoid talking directly about how I feel towards myself to other people because I don't want them to worry about me or to think I'm just asking for attention. I'm not expecting anybody to have any advice or anything, but I need a place to write and get my thoughts out without harming my friends or my family.

There are many times in my life where everything seems to be going well and suddenly a wrench is thrown into my current state of being. I eat healthy, I exercise, I'm in the program of my choice at the university of my choice, I have a part-time job with great coworkers, and volunteer the rest of the time. I have fantastic family and friends and I love them to the most profound reaches of my being. Hell, I'm even going to graduate university debt free in a profession that allows me to go virtually anywhere and make decent amounts of money. But I get depressed for the stupidest reasons when I shouldn't.

Everything was going well until I met a guy I was into. He's smart, outgoing, and nice to everyone which I thought would make a great foil to my personality. I thought we were going places, but I was completely mistaken. I fantasized about all the little things we could do should we have ever gone into a relationship. Unfortunately, he's aromantic and heterosexual, which is almost the opposite of me. On the level of our personalities we just don't match. I expected too much with too little information which put me in the position I'm in and I hate myself for it. I'm so upset with how things turned out, I've even contemplated killing myself. Honestly, that's a lot further than I'd want to go, but this isn't the first time I think of doing something so serious when I should just be able to brush it off. Even small things like getting a low grade on an essay make me believe I just don't deserve what I've been given and I get really depressed over it. The closest I've ever come to killing myself was when I took DMT a while back and it made me consider all the mistakes I've made throughout my life. I was so numb and ready to kill myself. The only thing that really kept me alive was the thought of my friends and family. 

I just don't have confidence in anything I do and I hate myself. I see people who are just naturally happy all the time and I wish I were more like them, but honestly I don't know how to choose to be happy the way they do. It's like every mistake is crushing me, even small ones that occur in everyday social situations. I just have a feeling that one day, things will fall down all at once and I'll actually jump off a bridge.",10Jul2019,1
25,"Hi everyone so I am just done. I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.

More than anything in the world I want to feel love. I want to fall deeply in love with a girl and care about her more than anything. I feel as if I finally took a stand to this cold world and was pushed down farther than I was before. I was once full of hope for the future and excited for what could be and now I am completely hopeless. This girl is going to the same community college as me next year and I just hope that I will get another chance then to make up for what I should have done in the past. I care about her so much it makes me sick. I just feel like I will never find something like this again in my life or will have able to have the same happiness from it.",10Jul2019,6

27,"I know a lot of people who feel alone and are terrified of being lonely all the time. But I truly havent seen anyone who is overwhelmed by the number of people in their lives.

I'm so tired of trying to meet expectations or please everyone else. I'm so tired of small talk and societal pressure to smile and nod. And honestly I'm tired of people asking me what's wrong or what they could do to help me when I answer that all I want to be is alone. I feel like I'm not even allowed to have my own thoughts private anymore. 

I'm told its unnatural. I'm supposed to have close friends. I'm supposed to be loving and open to my family about my issues. I'm supposed to tell my therapist what's going on a promise that I won't kill myself for another week. And honestly it's this ""support"" that's driving me towards suicide because I cant think of another way to silence all those people. I know it's odd and maybe hypocritical for me to be searching for someone like me when I say I want to be alone, but please if anyone has been through something like this, let me know.",10Jul2019,8

There’s this one server I’m on ran by a stream, so many types of people come and go over weeks and months. There’s this one person in the server who started showing signs of being depressed, and it turns out they were. I’ve been sending personal messages to them, but none of it seems to have done too much since they say they’ve harmed themselves today. I’ve tried telling a others in pms about if they can help, but I’m not constantly bothering them because I don’t want to drag and force a problem upon them. I figured this place would be better since it *is* somewhere people can go for help and it’s on a more voluntary basis. 

I have no idea where they live at, not even the country so I can’t send medical help to them or a personal psychiatrist by surprise, which I’m not even sure is a good idea anyways. They don’t seems to fond about talking to their parents about it either, and they say they can’t access professional help. Most responses I get are either “...” or the 😅 emoji. I tried to cheer them up by sending them a code for $10 on the Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo Switch, which is their main console. That helped them a bit, but things like that can only go so far. Since it’s summer they’re now away from school, so it’s harder for them to get outside and see close friends. 

On Discord it is possible to call people similar to using Skype or a normal phone. They once tried to call me, but canceled it immediately, saying that they did it on accident, yet they put the 😅 emoji with that response too, so I’m not sure if it really was an accident or if they wanted to call me, but are too nervous to do it. I’m not sure how things would be if they did call me since I’m pretty self conscious about my voice and I’m a big introvert. It’s easy to talk over text since I don’t have to worry about my tone or volume or anything, but talking with someone is harder since those things do come into play.

I know it’s just some random person on the Internet who I’ve never heard talk, let alone seen, but I know deep down they’re really struggling and since we’ve had a common interest for a while I could get through to them and help them. I feel like if I abandon them it will only make things worse since we have created some kind of bond by talking so much. I’d really appreciate any advice from someone over the Internet, on how I can help someone else over the Internet. Thank you for your time. My DMs are also open if you’d like to talk about it there.",10Jul2019,1

It is a page for people struggling with mental illness to share their stories either anonymously or not!  I think it can be really helpful to write your experiences sometimes and you never know if you could be helping someone else with your stories! Feel free to share photography, poems, or any other stories that you think are applicable to an experience with mental illness! Stay well :)",10Jul2019,1
