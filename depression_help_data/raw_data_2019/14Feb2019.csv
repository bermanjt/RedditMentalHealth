0,"Hi,

I am in need of mental health resources in my area. I had 2 very close people die very suddenly 2 weeks apart in January, and shortly after, my fiance of many years decided she wanted to break up. I am spiraling down really quickly, and I need serious help as soon as I can. 

I have tried searching the internet and I have called a few places, but I haven't been able to find any help I can afford. I have no insurance, and can't afford it right now. If someone could please please please just point me in the right direction of a website or a phone number that I can use to find help, I would be eternally grateful. I live in the north bay area in California.",14Feb2019,1
1,"This all probably seems kinda silly.. But I've been without a job for a year now and i need a job. I have needed a job for a year, but not having a job has made me close myself off from my friends. I've been on the job sites daily but i can't seem to work up the nerve to actually send my resume in anywhere. I realize I just need to do it and stick with it but I'm unsure if I'll follow through. All of this stresses me to no end. How did you end up working up the nerve to actually do it? ",14Feb2019,1
2,"I just got around to what I thought would be adjusting my meds perfectly. I take 250mg of effexor for ocd and anxiety and 1mg of Abilify for depression and everything was going fine until My boyfriend broke up with me bc i was being manipulative and now I feel the most broken I have ever felt. I feel like my meds are not working, I self harmed again, I am slacking in college and at my jobs and I feel like I’m pushing everyone away by going to people for help and I’m always paranoid that I am manipulating people. I just feel like a big big waste of space and a burden to everyone. I don’t want to exist at all. I started looking up how many pills it would take to overdose but then I realized that suicide would make me even more of a burden and would be manipulative bc it would make people feel bad for no reason. I’m just spiraling and I need help. I’ve already tried the suicide hotline and it was good but only helped for one evening.",14Feb2019,1

How do you know when you need to switch meds?  Also, how hard is it generally to to switch meds, as far as how it affects your mental state?

4,"My wife and I are a couple of poor university students living an hour away at different colleges. Before we met and probably for the first 6 months of our relationship she used sex to make guys like her. Now, she regrets it a lot. We aren't intimate as much as we used to be and certainly not as much as I'd prefer. She says that she feels like she associates sex with this tool for seeking validation (my words). Because of this and our stable relationship, she doesn't feel like she needs to have sex anymore; it's not a desire that she possesses. Obviously this is very problematic for our relationship.

She also suffers from pretty severe depression. When she calls me it's also a crap shoot as to whether I will speak to happy wife or souless wife. It breaks my heart to see her struggling so much but I don't know how I can help her. She says it feels like each day is harder and harder to put on a smile. It's like she's a prisoner to daily life. She says she tries to be positive and do normal healthy things but she simply ""can't"". Please give me any advice or medical help you can, thank you so much.",14Feb2019,1

Where to start? I don't have a fucking clue.Maybe some little back story will help.

i'm a student at a history college currently in my 4th year. With 2 hours of class per week  the other day are currently for working on an essay that we have to provide at the end of year. I moved from my parents house 3years ago leaving in a cosy litlle appartment alone. I enjoyed it i pass my three years with succsess. Had a pretty girlfriend, all my friends including childhood friends are leaving nearby. Everything was fine then comes this 4th year.

My great grand mother died (102 yo and she truly rest in peace ) i had very close bounds with her she was the real grand mother figure, wise, a little old fashion and still kicking ass at chess and scrabble (nobody in the family defeated her and we got some quite skilled armateurs in my family). Don't missunderstood the words i say it's just that my grand parents are ""young"" they just hit their 70's and stopped working 5 years ago (i'm 22 btw). And unfortunatly the same she died we decided with my GF to broke up (i insist that we are still in very good terms she helps me currently ). 

At first i was just sad not cuz of the breakup but cuz of my great grandmother death. Even tho she died in her sleep in the most peaceful way that death can provide. It hits everybody hard as a family member death can do but still, we were expecting it so we still missed her but we moved on reminding all the good times we passed with her etc... One month everything was okay comes Christmas we had a drink in his honour. New year party comes next me and all my friends finished completly wasted as usual. 

Then it comes, i'm not a maniac but i love having my place clean. It started to be a mess, i smoke but no more than 3-4 cigarettes per day , it becomes 3 packs of 25 per week. I'm not the type to be up late i started to have sleepless nigth. I stopped cooking and i usually love that, just preparing some food to not be hungry and i started to skip meals, i stopped having physical exercice. This was the first half of january 
On the second half i started to have panic attack, crying crisis, my place became utter shit, and all of that begun to reverbarate on my college work. I cannot think, having proper reflexion.  even on games i started to downgrade playing like shit and i begin to be a toxic shitbag. And i notice this all along it comes but i did nothing to get out of that, it's like i'm totally apathetic like sitting on a chair and just watching me downfall. 

And i didn't want anybody i know knowing what was happening so i started to wear like a mask saying everything was fine but inside i just wanted to let it all out but no. And my mom came at my place because she was feeling something as she said. She has the keys and she came in while i was trying working but just having a moment of absence. She had to get closed to me and telling my name to notice her. And a that moment everything goes out i cried maybe half an hour  in her arms. I tell her everything i was writing before. Then she clean all the place with me fixed the thing i had to.

I'm currently in a phase where it's ""okay"" but i still having sleepless nigth and a brain that can't stop as well for the feels. People i know are helping me but the main job is in my hand and i know i can go in that circle again. It's tough i'm still crying when i try to get my shits done, and it feels like it's consuming me just going out get's me tired, even reading a book is hard. I'm trying to fucking get out of this but it's really like i can't, it's the first time it's happening to me. I need your help i want to get out of this cuz this is not me, that's what i'm saying to me everyday.

just give me some clues or tell me how did you get through. Because rigth now i don't know how to get through it feels like it will always be here.

He’s never physically hurt me but he’s often violent around me and will break things with little to no warning. I have a part time job but my mothers the manager and won’t give me enough shifts to save any money. This is all just background to basically say I want to kill myself? I don’t know what to do anymore I was doing better and then last year it all went up in flames and dropped out of school and lost my only means of paying for classes, and now all I do is sit at home and hope my parents aren’t in a bad mood when they come home.

11,"It's too much. Right now, I'm an artist who can't draw, a student who can't focus, a friend who can't talk and a daughter who can't call. I'm too tired to do anything beyond what it takes to stay alive and go to class. Too bored and uninspired to create anything of value. Too flat and dull to experience any of the various perks of being alive. I can tell that others are starting to perceive this as laziness, lack of interest, and coldness on my part - and I don't know how to correct them without being vulnerable and open about what's really going on. The truth is that I'm trying as hard as I can. It's like I'm running in sand, desperately pushing myself to the limit as I try to chase the sun over the horizon, but tiring well before I get where I'm trying to go. In the end, I can only collapse and let the night wash over me, watching as those around me slip into the sunset with ease.

12,"Hey all, I don't know if I'm in the right place but I just feel empty and lost. I've struggled with depression most of my life, and even attempted suicide in high school, and I've been feeling myself slip back into those thoughts more and more. Here's what's bothering me (TLDR at the bottom):

- My professor has taken a leave of absence, and has not been heard from since. I go to a state University and I am studying Recording Arts, which is a very small program which is/was ran by one professor. He is extremely intelligent, hardworking, and talented, with teaching a whole program and running a business out of his house. He is also extremely analytical, and can push you to your limits. I've worked with him multiple times last semester, and at the beginning of this semester. He pushes everyone to be their best, and is a mentor to me and many in the program. However, he cancelled all of his gigs indefinitely and has taken a leave of absence from the school. All the Grad assistants don't know what's happening in his life, as he is extremely private and plays his cards close to the chest. The substitutes also do not know, and they are former students and current friends of his.



- I am failing Spanish due to a lack of studying and practicing. I lost motivation to do the homework (it's an online only class), and with it the motivation to do most anything. Or maybe the loss of motivation to do anything has led to that. I don't know. My girlfriend is minoring in Spanish and has offered her help to me, but I don't want to bother her with it and we don't have a lot of time together, so I'd rather spend it doing something that makes us happy. 

- I feel useless and stupid, and I honestly hope every day that the apocalypse is coming soon, because then I don't have to worry about taking care of myself for another day. I have a loving girlfriend who knows I'm struggling and is urging me to talk to a therapist, which I know I should, but I just don't have the energy to. 

The worst part of all of this is that I know what this path leads to, I know I'm thinking unhealthy thoughts, and I know I should talk to someone, but I don't. I've lost motivation to take care of myself. I've thought about turning the steering wheel off the road, and I can tell that I need help, but I just don't want to disappoint my family by telling them that I'm having issues again. I don't want my problems to be the problems of those I care about, I wish they would all forget about me or hate me so I wouldn't have to worry about any impact I leave, but my family, my friends, my girlfriend, they're all there for me, and I just don't want them to be.


There's a lot there, if you made it this far, thanks. It's almost midnight, my Spanish homework (that I didn't start) is due in 33 minutes, and there's no way I'm doing it. 


TLDR: I'm looking for some advice and help for getting back on the proverbial saddle. I am currently failing Spanish because I don't study because I don't have motivation to do something I'm bad at, my professor/mentor is gone and I don't know if he's coming back or okay, and I am having a harder time every day to find the motivation to clean, shower, get a haircut, and eat meals.

So I'm 24 and I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and my family doesn't understand it. I currently live with my mom, aunt, and uncle (by marriage) and they treat my emotions as wanting attention or being dramatic whenever I have a suicidal episode. Just this week alone I've been called a ret*rd, annoying, useless and a whole lot of other things.  I'm constantly threatened I'll be kicked out on the street on a daily basis... I can't open up to anyone cause I'm scared they'll treat me like this too. I honestly have been contemplating suicide but I know I'll be seen as a coward in their eyes.

My depression is getting to rhe point it's been effecting me physically, my heart rate is constantly too fast and my bones ache.

Walk on Water

LYRICS

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because


*Why are expectations so high? I guess this line is pretty self explanatory. I've always been a victim of high expectations. I'm not a bright kid mind you, but I've always been at the forefront to help someone. I've never abandoned someone who needed my help. And even if i had ignored someone, i went forward later and apologized for that. For me, I can't stand sadness. I've had to face enough sadness throughout my life... And i can't watch anyone else suffer. Ik this is like a far fetched example. You can't truly end suffering and sadness. But i believe you can damn well make it a little bearable. And in that short moment, thats all you need. To bear the sadness.*
*I've always done that. Stood there for people who needed my help even though i was a sad mess myself. I wasn't able to function properly but i remember days where i stood beside someone and helped them. That sounds pretty god complex of me i understand, but I'm not typing this from that view.*
*And people just expected me to be there all the time. I was surrounded, 24x7 by problems. And i wasn't able to tackle all of them at once. So people left. Generalized that I hold other people at a much higher priority cause i rushed to help them first. Thats not true. And no matter what bars i set, people always look down and say; you weren't there... I can't be there for everyone, I understand. But you need to understand this too... I'm no Jesus.*

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a God, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so


*I wonder these days if helping people is even worth it... This happened to me in real life; my closest friend was really unhappy the other day and i decided to help her. One of my friends (also a girl) came up to me and said she wants to talk. I wasn't able to do that since my closest friend was crying and was on the verge of breaking apart. I wasn't able to help that other friend. Later, i went up to her and said I was sorry i wasn't there. But ofcourse she assumed I've feelings for my closest friend and helped her cause of that reason. Which isn't the truth... Now one can say that she was wrong in assuming that and all... That she was being selfish... Ofcourse she was. I understand that now. But it begs the question, how many times has this happened?*
*And ofcourse people look to me for advice. And i just want to give the best advice/help that is possible from my part. Sometimes i don't know how to respond, but i give advice regardless. And i go home, and have a sleepless night thinking; I shouldn't have said that. That's not helpful at all.*
*Everyone looks to me as that intelligent kid who's caring and doesn't have a problem in his life but thats wrong. I've been a mess for as long as i can remember... And unfortunately, i haven't been able to fix myself. How can someone, who's so understanding and caring and gives such a good advice and help, be a broken piece of shell? That's impossible! He's looking for attention that's all... That's the stereotype I've to face... Even after everything... Now ofcourse I've people in my life who I'm grateful for. I love them. Infact, if you're reading this, i love you man. Thanks for being there for me. I just hate to be misjudged. I'm not that person...*
*People gossip about me. I wasn't the one to listen to gossip, but hey... I'm a human and it does affect me. A lot. Especially these days when I don't even know what the fuck is going on. I try to talk, to express, to cry... But I can't. Its as if I'm cockblocked... Lmao to that analogy. This post might be the closest I've come to sharing my problems in a long time.*



'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

*As i said, people have often misjudged me. More often than not, I'm called to be a free spirit. I like to joke. I like to jest. I like to act like an idiot if it makes someone laugh. I've never quite had a personality of my own... So I'm always like learning and adapting Myself to other people. Ofcourse people say stuff like ""he doesn't give a shit about other people. He's caught up in his own world. The only reason he helps is cause wants attention. He doesn't care. Doesn't do his assignments. Doesn't study."" I've always been a victim to these allegations. And even now, people misjudge me. I'm not like that. I'm really not like that. I try my best at everything.*
*Ofcourse i haven't opened up to anybody, but thats cause no one gave me a chance. I have a bad day, i meet the people i love. They say; ""why do you have a sad face? Its rotten!"" And before I can explain myself, they walk away. I put on a happy face. I try to distract myself with all the 'stupidness' and then, I'm a victim of ""look how he's doing nothing. He's doesn't give a fuck.""*
*I just wish people would give me a chance. Like look at my assignments. Look at my studies. Ask me about my future. Ask me what i want to be. Ask me if I'm ok today! Ask me how my day was... Ask me... Please. Maybe I'm being selfish. And paranoid. And both...*
*Another reason why i never shared was because i always think I'm being selfish. And no one said otherwise. I always put others before myself. Even if it meant I'm going in a huge loss. But no one saw that... Everyone gossips behind me... And no matter how good I'm, i just... Can't seem to change that. I don't want to be misjudged.*
*As time moves on, people drift away. They stop talking to me. Cause of all these gossips and the talks. I am alone. Even after everything i did. But i still stay here... Cause I don't wanna walk alone. I don't wanna be alone.*
*I have told this to just one person, but these days, I'm suffocating from lack of human touch. Yep. That's a thing. I just want someone to hug me. I just want to like stay close to someone and just stay in silence. Just holding hands. I don't care who that person is... I just want to feel human touch. A friendly touch.*
*No matter how many times i keep on rushing and proving Myself, i always seem to fall short. And then, boom! I've just lost a person. And that feeling hurts me so much...*
*But I won't ever approach that person who hurt me and tell him stuff thats hurting me. I'd never show I'm weak. I'm desperate yes... I'm really fuckin desperate. But there's a shred in me that says ""you're feeling fuckin fantastic dude. Don't worry. Don't go to them. Let them walk away...""*
*And even though i know that i should make all the toxicity go away, i wonder how many people I'd be left with at the end... If i let them go, what if i end up all alone?*

*PS: i know Eminem didn't write this song the way i picture it. I understand his intentions. Its just my take on it cause its so dayum relatable to my situation.*

17,"I went to one in July last year. He was not good. Within half an hour he said I need to be on lithium. He also smirked when I said I want kids in the future and told me to ""be careful not to pass down mental health issues"" like it was decided I was going to fuck them up already. I refused to go back.

The next one I saw 3 or 4 times. My mood had dropped super bad. He upped the dosage of efexor and lithium. Just after new year I decided it wasnt working so I stopped them cold turkey. I saw him again at the end of January and he suggested I try Mirtrazepine to help me sleep but I said no. He wouldn't listen to my reasons. Just assumed I dont want help. Even asked me why I was there and suggested I go back when I want help. I'm not going back.

20,"I’m a university student and recently things have become really tough. There are several problems that I’ve got no idea how to solve:

1. Social anxiety: it’s insanely stressful for me to interact with people. My classmates are girls and I’m the only guy in the group so it makes interactions even harder cause I try to be nice with them. Sometimes I get random panic attacks (dizziness, increased heartbeat, sweaty and trembling palms) that make it impossible to talk to anyone or even to keep up with what the teacher is saying during lectures. Moreover, I cannot even approach my crush, cause this girl is very cute and adorable
2. Irritated bowel syndrome: this thing makes my life like ten times harder. I have to endure extreme pain all the time and I also often get late for classes. Recently one of my teachers (he’s not aware of this problem) has told me that he won’t let me in for the class if I get even a minute late ever again. IBS + panic attacks also make things like public speaking extremely difficult
3. Conscription: the main reason I study at university is to avoid it. For me conscription is constant beating, humiliation, shitty food, life without sleep and weekends and being in a tough environment 24/7. My health is not good enough to endure conscription, I just won’t stand it. Also if I’m gonna have a girlfriend, she is not gonna wait for me to return. Most girls here break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted.

There are several other problems like studying in the faculty that I don’t like but cannot change faculty because here it’s almost impossible. Psychological help is also very expensive and mostly useless here so for me it’s not an option.

What am I supposed to do to solve it? How can I make this life better?",14Feb2019,1
21,"Hey all. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression and BDD about 7 years ago. I was going through an eating disorder at the time. I think they had me on Prozac.

The med worked great, as far as what it was supposed to do. After a couple months on the drug, opened up, became more social. Wasn’t locking myself in my room, or having self hating or self harming thoughts. But it essentially eliminated my anxiety - so in tandem, my grades in college at the time started slipping, I put on all the weight I lost with my disorder (which I needed) but I didn’t do it healthily. So the meds didn’t really make me happy, or even content. They took away the hot fire under my ass that is anxiety, which is unfortunately what drives me to get shit done.

I’ve lived (relatively) depression free since then. I stopped the drug after about 7 months. Had my bouts here and there, but handled life pretty well, up until about a year ago. 

It hit me so suddenly today that I can’t remember the last time I went a week without drinking. I’ve somehow gotten myself addicted to nicotine, and chain smoke a vaporizer chasing a nicotine high. All my mind thinks about is how can I alter my mentality, how can I feel good right now. So it’s sex, alcohol, nicotine. I’ve been buried in my passions with my free time, which one might see as good. But everything else is completely unattended. Family relationships, excelling at work, fitness, self care, are all getting set aside. I try to motivate myself to engage in these activities, but I become so instantly sad, bored and drained by them. My mind always says “why am I wasting my time doing something miserable”. Like I can’t cope with life straight up. I need it with some kind of twist to keep me sane. 

I’m afraid to start meds again because I don’t want to be this lazy, unmotivated but complacent human. I don’t really know where to go from here.",14Feb2019,1
22,"What is something that can help you focus naturally, without great effort or forceful redirection? What is something that you do or watch or read or play that focuses you even when everything else can’t? What is your focus or focuses, the things you can always go back to?

The reason I don’t mention or use the word “hobby” here is I feel it can be misleading. I have hobbies, many of which I’ve spent considerable resources on, but I’m never focused or feeling happy or having fun while doing them. I feel the focus I’m talking about can be an element of a hobby, but is more similar to the definition of the word “Ikigai” is this case. I feel as if, sometimes, they can be two separate things, as in my case.

The reason I ask is one of the issues I face with the depressive symptoms I have is that I cannot focus. Not in an ADD like way where my focus is snapped from something I intend to focus on to something irrelevant, but more like I’m out of focus of everything, like a radio that’s a little tuned out, so you can hear the station playing music, but it’s often drowned by static. I was just wondering if this feeling is shared by other people, and how they deal with it.

Thank you for your time in reading this, I really appreciate it",14Feb2019,1
23,"You see, I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, borderline personality, bipolar disorder, and anorexia for almost a decade. I'm tired. So, so tired. I'm a newly-wed, this should be the best time of my life. But, it's not. It's the worst. I want to get better for my husband, but i'm afraid i'm a lost cause. I've already caused him so much pain. A horrendous 2018 resulted in my acting on the suicidal thoughts i'd been having through those years, attempting twice in December.

The first time, I downed 150 Seroquel pills with a bottle of red wine. I woke up two days later, extremely high and swearing to the doctors that it was an accident. They let me go home a few hours later. Apparently, the ambulance officer had found the packaging which allowed the doctors to treat me more easily.

I learnt from my mistake, a few days later taking a cocktail of over countless medications - Anxiety meds, Anti-Depressants, Mood Stabilisers, Codeine, Anti-Psychotics, Ecstasy, Cocaine, the list goes on. This time, I ended up in a coma for a month. But again, I woke up. Without a voice, or a choice, I was taught to walk, talk, eat, sleep, sit and stand again over the course of a month. ""Recovered"", I was sent home.

Throughout January, I stopped eating entirely. Something I hadn't done since I suffered from a serious eating disorder in my teens. Last week, my heart stopped when I went for my morning run. When I woke up in ICU, they told me I was extremely lucky to be alive. I tend to disagree. I'm angry, and I don't want to be here anymore. No-matter what I do I just keep bouncing back. I tried to leave today, after I was taken off the heart monitor and told that I was physically stable - only to be referred to the psych team and forced to stay under the mental health act due to my history... So now i'm trapped here for who knows how long, with nothing to do other then sit in bed and stare at a wall, imagining what my next attempt may look like. All i've been thinking of since seeing the psychiatrist is where/how I could find a sufficiently sharp object to jab into my throat.

My husband's overseas working, my mother's undoubtably insane, and I could never open up to my friends about my troubles...

I really don't know why i'm telling you all of this.. I guess, deep down I think there's a reason I haven't died yet, and maybe talking to someone could help... I just don't see the point in living anymore. Life sucks, people leave you, in the end we all die anyways.",14Feb2019,1
24,"I was asked a question the other day and I didn't have an answer and it hit me like a sack of rocks. I've always felt depressed since my dad passed away in 2006 but it's hit me hard lately and I don't know why. I'm recently married, just had my son, have a great paying job that's just like every other job, and a loving family, and I still feel unaccomplished, lonely, and not awake in the world. My future is a dim lit room full of doors I can't see and quite frankly, im afraid to open them. I need help...",14Feb2019,1
25,"I am a high school student and this time of my educational life i need to make a life changing decision whether i will stay as an IB student or a normal student and i can feel the pressure it gives me. I feel very depressed because of the pressure and fear of chosing the wrong one for me. I can't say that this feeling is only caused by this, but somethings in my life piled up and this was the last drop to make it flood all over the place. I feel like my life has come to a dead end and i can't control myself but my emotions does. My free times were full of fun, but now i just cry and can't escape that mood. Nothing around me now has a color, just white and black. Without any joy in it.",14Feb2019,1
26,"I made a decision 6 months ago that I would end my life on July 10 if I did not see any improvement in my life. In that time I had discovered a passion I had in history, I finally restrung and enjoy playing my guitar and I got a new car. However, 6 months after my decision I still intend to keep it. No matter how many steps forward I take, I keep getting dragged back. I just want to collapse and give up. After all the good things that should have made me happy I find myself making plans to die and plans in case those original ones fail. And everyone always says “Live! It gets better! Trust me it did for me and it will for you!” Except its been 8 years of feeling this way and its only ever gotten worse. I feel like it never does. I just wish time would hurry up and get to July 10th already",14Feb2019,1
27,I recently quit my job because it was getting so stressful and demoralizing i just daydreamed of driving off the bridge everyday after a while. But now i'm so depressed and scared of getting another job. I'm 28 and have been working shit jobs forever i'm tired of being treated like crap while barely being able to afford my damn rent. Idk at this point idk why I am fighting to stay around other than to pay bills for the rich. I can't get through a job application right now without freaking out and wanting to end it. I just feel so lost and tired. I know I need to get help but guys I can't fucking afford it. I just feel stuck in this loop and I gotta say I really want to get out of it and I'm not feeling that picky anymore.  ,14Feb2019,1
28,"I'm such a loser in life and seems like it gets worse every day. I'm 26, still live with my mother, no girlfriend, no friends and no social life, poor and unemployed. Yes I know I should stop feeling sorry for myself but it's almost impossible not to when things are like this. I never had a ""normal"" family, my father was a drug addict since I was a baby and never cared about me and my brother, not even after he got clean, and died without ever looking for us. My mother isn't much better, was a failure all her life as well, and we don't have a relationship, just fights, all day, every day. Went to college to get a shitty degree (almost everyone goes to college in my country as it is accessible to everyone, even without financial resources because government pays for that) and seems like I'll never get a qualified job in my field of studies, and to be honest I feel like I've got no skills to get it either, even with the degree I've been unemployed for 6 months now and all the jobs I've had either required almost no skills or were temporary, without the possibility of becoming financially independent in the long term. Either way, it's just difficult to find a job that allows me to move and live alone, without a partner, because the minimum wage is so low that it's almost impossible to pay rent, bills, food etc by myself. I've been replying to job ads almost every day for some time now, without success. I had a beautiful girlfriend who I miss to death for 6 years (18-24) who left once she realized I was going to be a loser all my life and I can't blame her. Since then my social life got even worse, the few acquaintances I had back then were mainly her friends who of course left when she left. I was never popular or had many friends and definitely no real ones. Nowadays I've got nobody, literally nobody who to call for a simple coffee or to spend some time with, mainly because of my social anxiety and lack of social skills. When I make a friend i usually ruin everything by staying at home for days and not reaching for them, either for not having money to do nothing or because I do not feel like leaving home, and they eventually move on, can't blame them either, and as far as girls, who would ever want a loser like me? I've got no problems with my looks but the social anxiety and the current state of my life make me feel I'll never date again. I spend my days at home without seeing the sun for weeks sometimes. I went trough some phases now, times where I woke up and went to bed crying like a baby, times where I didn't get out of bed for days except going to bathroom, and now I don't even know, isn't just sadness, it's the lack of emotions, the sense of emptiness.. Sometimes I get out of the house to go for a walk by myself or to visit my grandparents, I'm just fed up with all this, same shit every day but at the same time I've got no will to change things, once again, it's such a sense of emptiness. I can't kill myself, the only thing that stops me is the lack of courage, it would be different if I had access to a gun. I wish to die during my sleep, maybe some family members would feel sad at first but at least all this shit would end. I'm just a worthless piece of shit, I'll be miserable all my life and will end up alone, I'm sure. If you're reading this thank you for your time and sorry for any English mistakes.",14Feb2019,1
31,"I've never posted anything on Reddit before, but I guess I needed some place to vent out how I'm feeling and how to go about it...
 I've been rejected by my peers since kindergarten. My parents were always working and some neighbors would take care of me until I was around 6. After that they would leave me alone at home and I had to take care of myself, barely saw them. Around this age I would listen to my mom's problems with my dad when I had some time with her and since first grade I would be severely beaten up by older peers with rocks and the sort. I started gaining a lot of weight and things escalated in 5th grade. I had to go to my parents work (a Caffe) after school only to be ridiculed by my dad and drunkards who came later at night for their enjoyment. I wanted to die and tried it my first time in sixth grade. It escalated to the point I would be so badly beaten I would be unconscious and I almost died 2 times. At 14, I lost all my weight because I couldn't get out of bed. I was mentally broken. Around that time my dad and his friends forced me into a strip club where I got locked with an older women who forced sexual relations on me. I could only cry when I got home. I became a bulimic and obsessed with my image. I had a hard time in high school, I wanted to learn and I studied a lot, and was bashed for it by my classmates on social media and at school all the time. Ever since I started dating all my relationships were mentally abusive and I got into a lot of trouble while trying to help my girlfriends, and I always left burning on my own in the end. My dad recently gained a gambling addiction and spent all our savings and the money I worked to have. I was poor when I was little and hunger wasn't that unusual, but right now I'm in the same place but it's so much harder to deal with all of this. My mom started working two jobs and started to be gravely sick. She collapsed on the floor and almost died due to exhaustion when I was young, and I'm really afraid things will go the same route again. I have no one to talk to, no friends, no family and at college my reputation took a turn when I rejected some girls and they spread rumours on how I forced myself on them... Ever since barely anyone speaks a word to me, I feel like I'm not even there, I'm just observing my surroundings...
 I don't know what to do, I asked for professional help but my country has a terrible service when it comes to psychology and psychiatry. Too many people and not even close to enough doctors. In a year I only went there 3 times and could only speak to them for 30 minutes. Then they'd just give me meds and I would see them again in 4-6 months...
 I just don't know what to do.",14Feb2019,1
32,"I have been through depression before, I am not suicidal but I need help. I really can't find a purpose to anything at all. I tried helping people get past their problems and being their friend and I become good friends with them and they just don't listen and try to take advantage of me. I have gone through many many friend groups and I just really don't know what is next. Everytime I am friends with someone I always wonder how are they going to screw me over",14Feb2019,1
