0,"Hey all, I'm new to the sub and I've been on reddit for a while, but made a new account to not have friends see my posts. As many of the people on this sub, I struggle with dark and sad thoughts that hinder me in improving myself. I'm a 21 y/o college student that is slightly overweight and quiet most of the time. I'm not always melancholic, I do have fun with friends, go out and I do enjoy myself from time to time doing it. My main problem is my inability to move past points of regret or embarrassment in the past and I often think to myself ""Someone just shoot me"" even though I don't consider myself suicidal or anything it's always the same thought whenever I start to feel bad or think about the past. I would never kill myself because I know I have a lot more to live for and I could never do something like that to those around me. 

Though I seem to handle my depression well, it doesn't seem go away or prevent me from falling back in the cycle of being happy then depressed for periods. I know the best thing for me to do is workout and be physical, read and do things I enjoy, but I seem to always do all that during the summer when I have free time, but no matter what I always fail when it comes to doing something stressful like school. I overload myself during semesters and never leave time for myself and when I have time I end up wasting it with friends or convincing myself that I'm too tired. 

I feel exhausted doing work that I unnecessarily put on myself and stress about it to a point of anxiety about doing well, then to match the extreme stress I eat, smoke cigarettes (I quit 3 months ago), drink (not as much anymore), and smoke weed to help cope with it and relax. It does help me sometimes as certain strains make me want to work harder and not feel bad, but once I start to smoke I often don't do anything productive with it, partially because my friends end up doing nothing or I get distracted with thoughts. I should probably regulate it better as I smoke almost daily (not when I'm home from school), but my problems were there before I even did any drugs. I'm working on quitting all the habits that I recognize aren't helping my situation and just aren't beneficial at all. 

I just want to be happy and be proud of my body again. I was heading a good way when I was entering college, going to the gym 5 days a week reading books, rarely drinking and no smoking at all. Maybe it was stoner crowd I got myself wrapped up in, the stress from classes, or the pressure I put on myself to try to be great. Probably it's the combination of all of those things, but now I'm in my senior year with me still feeling like I've got nothing to show and am soon going to have a degree with my original goal forgotten.

All of my current circumstances are all I can think about and the cause of them. I know I look too much into the past and put too much stress on myself for my future, but I can't seem to find my footing to live in the moment for longer than a couple weeks. I have to be stronger to overcome my depression and I know what to do, but I just can't get myself to actually push myself to change. I feel so close to being able to break through and feel like myself again, but I'm just missing the discipline to actually get to that sort of state again.

I know it's a long post, but I just felt the need to express my current situation and hopefully get some advice or just talk to someone. I'm going to see a psychiatrist when spring semester starts and want to not feel as alone and disappointed as I am with myself.

TL;DR: Depressed and trying to change things, but just feel like I'm falling short in actually getting to a happier and fulfilling state again because I can't get out of my head about the past/future.",23Dec2019,1

I am not confident swimming in deep water, and to make matters more difficult, I have weights around my ankles, which are too clouded by depth to see.

7,"So in the last 7 months I have been dealing with divorce, my wife of 8 years has been cheating on me and when I found out I told her to leave. She did but she got the bright idea a month afterwards claim dv.

 the kids were removed from me ( I had full custody) and given to her, through the course of the investigation they know that she lied and I'm getting my kids back at the end of January. Upon the last time I visited them on Friday and was told that their mother and her bf are being investigated for abuse.

 Now the kids are in jeopardy of being put in foster care until court. Ive spoken with my lawyer and he states that we have to wait. 

I've been seeing another woman that has been a source of strength and has brought me peace throughout this ordeal until suddenly she tells me that she wants to be free of a relationship.

 So I am heartbroken, missing my kids and my now exgf. I have positives like Ive been making great strides at work and was promoted but it feels like I'm working so hard for everything in my life to leave me or be taken from me. 

Idk what to do, I've been struggling to get out of my head but I cant. I know I'm doing my best with the legal side but it doesn't help that if theyre taken from her before I get them I will then have to fight the state which is a much harder and almost impossible task here in NYC. 

I miss my exgirl, I don't have family to talk to, I don't have friends, I am alone. And losing hope.",23Dec2019,1

I'm not sure if this is the right subeditor to post this, if it isn't I apologize.

I recently saw a therapist for help with depression and PTSD from an abusive experience at a workplace with a narcissistic boss. The first therapist was okay and seemed to understand me more, but then she had to leave for a new job, so she introduced me to ""grand canyon licensed marriage therapist"", named so for reasons i'll explain below. So I started to see the new therapist, which at first seemed promising, and the first couple of sessions weren't that bad. I thought I might get somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

But the more I saw her the most questions I would have, because I felt like nothing was being resolved or explained...and there was no real structure to the sessions. At first I thought it was me, so I stayed in the sessions thinking maybe I wasn't doing or saying something right. Although she was nice enough on the surface, I eventually began to feel ""stuck"" in the sessions like I was afraid to be honest about what I felt because I felt like she didn't want to handle the ""dirty"" emotions that would make her job tougher. Like it became my job to make her feel like a good therapist and I had to go there and pretend to be happy to make her feel like she was doing a good job.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, where it seemed that either she was bored or uninterested in what I was saying, which I was still talking about, because she'd never give me any answers or insight into the abusive person that I was talking about. She'd ask me the same question over, and over again ""how would that help you?"" but never asked me how I felt about it, never seemed interested in helping me process any of my emotions regarding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know therapists are supposed to ask questions to help you self-reflect, and that would be fine if she hadn't said and done what she had said and done. Until I finally said ""I don't know how it would help me.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'd go home not feeling any better and would come back to sessions kind of confused like ""maybe I'll explain it BETTER this time and she'll understand"", but I saw her for a hour for about 8 sessions. I kept expecting validation and guidance on SOMETHING I said but I never got it. Sometimes when I am anxious I do this thing where maybe i'll crack a sarcastic joke about the person i'm talking about, which in my former therapist would elicit at least a chuckle. Not so for stone-faced therapist, which I know boundaries and professionalism are good and all but, she seemed more annoyed if I wasn't just blindly answering her questions so she could finally get me out of her office.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happened was in one of our last sessions I was talking about the anger I felt towards the abusive experience I had, which had been for three years. I had explained this over and over the course of our sessions and I had explained that I could not let the anger go towards this person and I would ask why they would do this, and that and she never had any answers for me.

&amp;#x200B;

She pauses the session, says ""i'll be right back"" and then comes back with a 6 pound rock, and then says ""This is your homework"". It was the summer, and she wanted me to carry this 6lb rock home in 90 degree weather and I found it kind of ridiculous but I was committed to trying things so I took it home. Didn't really have any intention of carrying it around with me wherever I went, because why would I do that. Realized eventually that this ""excercise"" of ""baggage"" symbolism wasn't working for me, and somehow this felt like my therapist wasn't really trying to validate my feelings or help me work through them, but instead patronizingly telling me I should just let them go, much like this rock, which I ended up chucking in my backyard after I stopped seeing her. Just felt really super lazy, like she didn't know what else to say or do at this point, so let's try and see what sticks. I get the point of letting things go, letting things go is good thing eventually, but she wasn't really great at helping me do that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came back for one last session, and rock therapist asked me where my rock was, and I said ""I didn't bring it, it was kind of annoying to carry around"" ... her face lit up and she nodded, like ""Oh really?"" as if she was patting herself on the back for thinking of such a clever lesson to teach me. Good idea in theory, not so much in practice. Strangely enough, in all my darkest moments, I never thought ""wow. I wish I had a rock right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then, she told me something that to this day, I still can't figure out. She said there and told me ""the world does not deserve your anger."" She actually said that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was confused because one, i'm generally a really quiet, non-confrontational person. I keep a lot inside because I don't often feel safe expressing myself. I'm not outwardly angry or an aggressive person of any sort. But when she said that, I felt really betrayed that someone I had told my experiences to would tell me something like that. Firstly -- I was/am, still angry at ONE person that treated me badly, NOT the world, and secondly, it was as if she was shaming me for having anger towards this person and didn't really seem to have, even after our 8 sessions that she probably wasn't even paying attention to, any empathy or guidance for me. Like I was talking to a brick wall who just sits in a chair, asks a few non-nonsensical questions while she waits for the session to be over, gives me a rock and I still go home feeling like i'm lost.

&amp;#x200B;

So I felt even more angry after this experience, I did not feel as though anything had been resolved, even though I had tried my best to make it to all sessions and I had tried to be open minded until I finally realized it wasn't working for me. Maybe this one sub par therapist would not have been such a big deal if it were only her - but at this point I've seen a handful of poor therapists (like 4-5 in the last 6 years, and let me tell you, psychology today has some GREAT dollar store therapists that really don't care) and it's just really hard to find one that is right for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a weird, arrogant therapist in 2013 that was arrested on stolen valor charges (he's actually all over the internet on stolen valor websites) and asked me if my abusive ex was ""cute"", a therapist who told me to watch relaxing youtube videos to cure my depression and now this one.  I don't feel like I am being heard or taken seriously, and so I think that's all for me for the time being with therapists.  I know therapists are ""human too"", and prone to making mistakes, but so am I, i'm not any less human because I don't have a fancy title next to my name. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like if you're a therapist there is a REALLY small margin of error,  because you're dealing with someone's mental health and overall well being, you can't just say whatever you want and expect that to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lost faith in the ""therapy"" process, I know it works for people who have good therapists. But for me it feels like a waste of time and I feel like they don't really care. I complained to the owner of the therapy practice and spoke with them and they said they would ""process"" this situation with the grand canyon therapist, but I have no idea what that even meant. At this point I probably \*could\* get better advice from a youtube video, for free.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my experience is not the worst therapist experience out there, that people have had far worse experiences than me, but I am upset with the quality of ""therapy"" I received and I feel like i'd want to lodge a formal complaint of some sort but I am not sure where or how. I don't feel like I was helped at all and I am surprisingly, still angry.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried ""getting help"" from therapists like everyone says, but there is no real ""help"" to be found anywhere.

10,"I started burning out in may and pushed through it at 100mph for another 6 months. I fried my brain and became depressed. I’ve been recovering for the last 2 months but am frustrated with my progress and confused about what I should do. 

To my understanding: the best thing for depression is to force yourself to do things &amp; the best thing for burnout is to not do things. 

I’m willing to work hard to get better but I sometimes feel that whatever I do is counterproductive because of the above conflict between treatment methods.  

I understand the above is an oversimplification, but I think it holds true for a good portion of the healing process for each condition. 

Does anyone see how I may be wrong or have any suggestions on how to deal with this? The best I have now is to try to balance all things: force myself to do things that are good for me (I have to force myself because I’m so fatigued and unmotivated most days) and relax in adequate doses every day. But I feel like my progress is much slower than it should be, given how much I’m doing for myself. 

Thank you in advance. My motivation is slowly fading, which scares me.",23Dec2019,1

Whenever I see the people who've hurt me in the past become happy or whenever I here good news about them I am deeply saddened. I feel like they don't deserve happiness. 

I figured out I haven't forgiven them fully yet and all I need is to learn to let go. It's exhausting to be in pain for so long and holding on to the painful memories may make me more bitter in life. 

Nobody's life is perfect, we have our different types of struggles and yet I continue to believe that other people are more happy, successful and rich, when I see the whole picture blindly, that just like me, they do not have perfect lives.",23Dec2019,1
12,"Food is my best friend. I love eating and cooking and being gluttonous. I’ve recently realized that it is a bit of a coping mechanism for me I eat when nervous, sad, happy, depressed, anxious... you name it, I’m eating. But due to a fast metabolism and growing up active and on the move I’ve been able to keep any major weight off. 
Right now I am a lot less active aside from catching the bus. I’m also going through an incredible depressive state that I’m trying to climb out of. I have left any limits and find myself eating ridiculous amounts of food and it’s so unhealthy. The weight of depression has been heavy and I’m literally adding to it. I’m lazy and sluggish, I feel heavier trying to move my body making me want to stay dormant. 
The thing is because of how small I am the weight gain is seen as normal and even welcomed so when I complain or ask for help it’s kind of brushed off. Has anyone experienced weight gain and have any advice. It’s hard to motivate myself to do anything besides than the bare minimum but I want to be better  and I think getting in shape or trying to eat better at least will give me more energy or something like that.",23Dec2019,1
13,"Hello! I am looking for some help? ((I don't even know if this is the right place to ask but I'm just gonna try))

I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and clinical depression for years now. When I started college three years ago, I decided to stop taking my meds (lexapro). I know that was such a stupid thing to do, but I was so overwhelmed with the transition of suddenly living away from my family and home life that my meds were making it hard to distinguish what I was even feeling and overwhelming me more. As stupid as a decision that was, it ended up helping me so much more because it gave me the ability to actually feel my instincts and have better judgment in a completely new environment. Before this happened, I already had problems with my meds, so I weened myself off and have been off since. ((btw my doctor is aware of this and knows I no longer take them))

Very recently, I have started to get very deeply depressed again. To the point where my friends and family have noticed. I thought it was school or the holidays because both are very difficult for me, but now that it is winter break and I am back home not much has changed. I knew something was off I am very aware of my mental health and was waiting for winter break to come to take a hard reset. well being home has just about made things worse cause I don't have routine or work to keep me busy or people to constantly be around. 

I am trying to be proactive and try to pull myself out of this, but I am wondering if anyone has or have any advice on ways they do this? The easiest option I can think of is going back on my meds. I have hesitations with this though because when I originally took it I did not like the way it made me feel/act. Just the actual way this med worked for me was not something I liked. Before lexapo, I was on zoloft and it did not do anything for me. I cannot change my lexapro prescription because of insurance issues, so that would be my only option. After thinking this through, I do not really want to become dependant on meds again (which I know sounds stupid because they really do help) I really want to try to do this naturally. So I am here to ask if anyone has any good tips/advice/things that worked for them/etc? I know the basics like exercising, journaling and setting good sleep/eating/routine patterns.  I was just curious if anyone had any of the other things that worked for them in this way? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and helping out!",23Dec2019,1

My symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were before I went on the medication, but they're still significant. I plan on talking to my doctor about this when I see her.

18,"Every time my elderly mom gets a little down, usually if I get a bit busy at work and miss a visit to see her (I see her VERY frequently), she starts taking something that makes her become borderline psychotic. Has anyone ever seen people react like this to antidepressants? Last time it was Zoloft that made her go off. This time the doctor gave her Prozac on top of the Klonopin she was already on. We have been through this about 5 times over the years. It takes me months to wean her off. She's an 86 year old widow (my dad died several years ago) and living independently in a nice senior apartment close to me. I call her every day, and visit her several times a week. She has lots of friends, still drives, has money in the bank, and lives a pretty decent life for 86. I KNOW it's the pills. She only gets this way when she's taking antidepressants, and I can't believe this is happening again, after several years of doing well. She becomes confused, repeats the same phrases over and over about how nobody understands her, has a weird, pained expression all the time, acts histrionic and entitled. I try to be gentle and not get mad but it's like she's turned into another person. It's a very identifiable thing that ONLY happens when she starts taking antidepressants. Once a therapist told me that she's probably undiagnosed Bipolar, and treating only depression symptoms is sending her into mania.

This is not dementia, either. This started about 5 or 6 years ago, it got so bad I had to move her in with me for awhile. I had to stage an intervention - she was going to different doctors, the emergency room, everywhere, crying and carrying on and doctors just kept giving her more meds. I had to get her off of everything except a low dose of a benzodiazapine (she's been on them for years and can't seem to completely stop them) and she was fine for like 2 years. It was so bad that I had to move back home to her her home town to be near her because she was such a mess. 

She was doing great, after lowering her dose of Klonopin about 6 months ago. I have been working closely with her and her doctor. I explained to him 5 years ago that she reacts strangely to these meds and he has been working with me to get her off, then inexplicably he starts prescribing all kinds of psychoactive meds again.

22,"Hi I’m 38 and male.  I had a divorce 6 months ago.  The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I don’t see the point of staying with someone who doesn’t want to be with you.  But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship.

Since then I’ve gotten more and more depressed.  I’m originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful .  When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better work-life balance.  In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isn’t really that challenging for me.  Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now I’m divorced, we didn’t have kids ( a big part of the break-up despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying ) , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path.  I’m turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s.  

I’m having a really hard time planning for the future , I just don’t have any goals anymore and feel like I can’t get excited for anything . 

If I think about things objectively I know I have options .   I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce .

But I have no energy or motivation , maybe I’m just afraid of trying and failing again.  Part of me just wants to give - up.  Don’t know what to do , I feel stuck .",23Dec2019,1
23,"I've gone into a deep depression. My personality is extremely competitive, and I kill myself to be the best at every single little thing. Even in volunteer organizations I get angry when I am not the best at a task or if there's someone else other than me doing it. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I hate most fun/social activities and can only talk if I consider it to be a talk about productivity- not small talk. People think I am arrogant due to this, and I am struggling to make any solid friendships. I am going on sudden mood swings lately when I feel I am not in charge of a situation/task and feel ostracized. These mood swings are becoming depressive now, and I really can't figure out the source of this.

Here's some introspect as it has recently turned into depression.

* When I feel I am not in charge of a situation or someone is telling me what to do, I feel ostracized.
* I get triggered when I am not the best at a task or someone else is doing it other than me. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I am obsessed with productivity. I can't do small talks or fun/social activities- only productive talks. This leads people to think I am arrogant. I am struggling to make solid friendships now.
* I am worried that I'll start losing friends or maybe my personality has already changed due to these depressive mood swings and I can't notice it.
* I hate to admit it and I try to bury it, but I may have some sort of jealously as well because one of my triggers is seeing my friends/family hanging out with people laughing and doing goofy things. I'll think/fear they like them more than me because I'll never have that personality
* Ex. There's a family member that's coming to visit for the first time in a while and that's already irritating me somehow. That he is going to get more attention/interactions than me; and I know it's completely wrong to feel that, but I can't help it.
* And now even if I succeed in every single thing on my to-do list and excel in everything and accomplish my goals of being the best, I still feel completely empty.

 I think my issue might be that I've always been just me against the world and braved through any hardships with just my high drive for success alone; But, I've never actually had a sense of family apart from just my parents. I think that now for once I actually feel as if I am close to some people and there's actually something more important than my drive and I fear losing that. I don't know if that is it. I already feel further apart due to depression from the only people I did have in my life for a bit.",23Dec2019,1
24,"I’m new to this so I apologise if I’m doing it wrong. 

So, these past couple of months have been so hard for me, nothing I do ever seems to be good enough anymore. I have a boyfriend who claims he ‘loves me’ but has never actually told me, his family are always making me feel unwelcome and unwanted, I have no friends here and my family live hours away. I’m just so done with everything, but it’s only been today that I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again.. Like the world would be better off without me, my family would be better off without me, so would my boyfriend and so would my 10 month old daughter. 

I can’t help but feel awful for wishing death upon myself when I have a child who probably loves me and definitely needs me, but I don’t know what else I can think about. I’ve had just about enough of this cruel world now and I think it’s had enough of me too. I know I need help and I’ll obviously get it once Christmas is over, but what do I do and think about in the meantime?",23Dec2019,1

27,"Hopefully this is the right place for this, but for some reason I can't talk about this with anyone so I'm hoping typing it will allow me to get this out. 

Only thing to know before the story is that I'm 25 and a male

I have an amazing boyfriend I've been dating for over a year and living together with for 6 months and it's been perfect. We don't fight, we're both very encouraging and understanding, etc. We have a plan and we've been talking openly and honestly about everything (except one thing I'll talk about in a sec) and we wanna get married, I always had a dream of proposing and my boyfriend wanted to be proposed to so that worked out well. We have plans of moving across country and wanna get married before we move, so that would mean the proposal would have to happen in the next month or two.

This whole plan has felt good to me and I've been going along with it. But I just bought a ring and it's time to really start making moves and it's all starting to hit home and get real, and through all this I've realized there's one thing I haven't been honest about. I've been really open about my depression and anxiety with my boyfriend and he's been amazing about it all. Never made me feel bad, never made me feel anything but loved. For some reason though , I can't talk about suicide with him.

I've been so depressed for so long and all that, I'm sure y'all heard it a hundred times. I'm exhausted, and just want life's belligerent symphonies to finally cease. Usually it's just this looming desire, it occasionally gets more serous, but it's just been so constant lately and I can't shake it. I have come to acknowledge and accept the fact that I will likely be my own cause of death and that I likely don't have another decade in me. But I just can't tell my boyfriend this. He's so strong and loving and caring if he knew I felt this way he would be crushed. I can't do that to him. That's why I'm really reconsidering this proposal. I don't think it's fair to commit to someone when I don't plan on being around much longer. 

It's just shitty, I can't imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I can imagine my boyfriend without me. I know it'll hurt him a lot, but I feel like after a few months he'd be back and could probably find someone better and stronger than me like he deserves. I feel so guilty for everything I think and just have no idea what to do. 

I also have a nice therapist who helps quite a bit but I can't bring this up with her either, I don't know why. I guess I feel like prime who throw around suicide are seen as attention seekers. I don't want attention, of nobody could notice I'm gone that would be preferred. So I just keep it to myself and wake up every morning thinking ""is today the day? Do I finally end it today?"" And since days I say it hopeful, some days not, but the thought it almost always there. I can't put my boyfriend through all that. I love him too much and feel so bad that he picked my pathetic ass of all people. 

If anyone has anything to say I could really use it.",23Dec2019,1

29,"I've fallen into a deep depression. My personality is extremely competitive, and I kill myself to be the best at every single little thing. Even in volunteer organizations I get angry when I am not the best at a task or if there's someone else other than me doing it. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I hate most fun/social activities and can only talk if I consider it to be a talk about productivity- not small talk. People think I am arrogant due to this, and I am struggling to make any solid friendships. I am worried these traits and drive is to cover something up. I am going on sudden mood swings lately when I feel I am not in charge of a situation/task and feel ostracized. These mood swings are becoming depressive now, and I really can't figure out the source of this.

Here's some introspect as it has recently turned into depression.

* When I feel I am not in charge of a situation or someone is telling me what to do, I feel ostracized.
* I get triggered when I am not the best a task or someone else is doing it other than me. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I am obsessed with productivity. I can't do small talks or fun/social activities- only productive talks. This leads people to think I am arrogant. I am struggling to make solid friendships now.

* And now even if I succeed in every single thing on my to-do list and excel in everything and accomplish my goals of being the best, I still feel completely empty
*  I am so paranoid about losing friends that talking to people drains me because I over analyze each and everything they say. I hate it. I am so depressed. I usually resort to just overwhelming my self with work and trying to achieve goals and a ""no craps given"" attitude to cover it up.  But, this time it's eating at me

30,"I had a fake friend who crushed my self esteem (though I didn't have that much) and since the I've had a depression. I'm almost 15 and at high-school. I'm depressed almost all of the time and I can't really fit in. My ex best friend is in the same school as me and his live is way better than me - he's got new friends and he's texting girls, while I'm over here with depression, almost no friends, shy, socially awkward and the only girl that messages me is a annoying insta girl with the body of a wooden  plank. The only reasons I'm still here are video games and my friends. I just wanna have self esteem, have friends, have confidence and have a girlfriend.

35,"Sry I'm not really sure which sub I should put this on. I'm not sure if I'm depressed but what I do know is that I don't like my life right now and don't know what to do. I am a college student and my routine for the past 3 years has been basically the same wake up, go to college, come home, go to bed. I am a really silent sort of guy often times people call me invisible in a few cases which is fine like... whatever but I'm really alone and got 1 friend ( this friend is great but there are very few things we do irl mostly online) hell I'm probably Gona be spending Christmas and New year's alone at home or in bed and it gets me that I have no one. My siblings honestly think I am useless cause I don't have a part time job and not someone who helps even though I try alot but most of the time but makes mistakes more often. My dad honestly likes his fishes ( it's his hobby) more than me and even talks to them more. I don't particularly like him either cause growing up there was so much abuse to everyone else that it fucked me up good. I was the youngest when it all happened and I think it permanently made me think in a un-helpful way. I just dont know anymore. Please give me any help or advice.",23Dec2019,1
36,"I have had depression from the past 5 years. I’ve never had a week go by with a stable sleep pattern. Nobody knows this about me and everyone thinks I’m on top of my game and am perfectly fine. I’ve done well in my graduate entrance exams and am hopeful of getting an admit into a reputed college next year. Everyone thinks it’s all good and they’re excited for me. But I internally feel so empty, so miserable. It’s 3am here and I’m up just crying and feeling so empty. 
My biggest fear is depression eating away my life.
I sleep for long hours and I get such vivid dreams I never want to wake up and face reality.
Some days are better, today isn’t one of them. 
I really don’t know what to do. I have nobody to tell this to. Added to this my best friend of 4 years stopped talking to me because I had one of my phases where I stopped talking to people and she took it personally despite knowing I go through those phases... that has added to the loneliness. 
I really want to have a normal life. I envy people who have stable sleep patterns, who wake up early, who are able to perform so called simple tasks like that which are so hard for me.
It sucks that I feel this way. It sucks that I am not able to put in my best efforts into the thing I do because there are so many days where the depression takes over and I don’t even want to get out of bed.
Im 23 right now but I feel depression is just gonna make my life worse as it progresses. 
Most of all I feel I let myself down. That hurts the most. I imagine my younger 18 year old self, full of energy and ambitions and now despite having goals in life I still feel empty and lifeless and that tears me apart.

38,"Hello, I am a 17 year old boy, who's very desperate to help his father. It's just him and I. We've been living together at least 10 years now.  He would do anything for me, so now it's my turn to seek help from my fellow redditors.

Lately he's fallen pretty deep into depression (approximately the last 6 months) 
The main reason would be loneliness and financial problems. I am very supportive though, I talk to him pretty often about it, but i feel like it's not enough. He's a little stubborn..
It doesn't help that he's trying to drown his problems with alcohol.

Is there anything I can do? I could take some job offers after school but he quickly shut that idea down and told me we're fine. Or perhaps I should suggest him to see a therapist?",23Dec2019,1
