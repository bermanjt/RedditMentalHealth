0,"I dunno if it should be tagged as a support or advice request, or just a rant. I guess it's all three.  

Anyway, just before leaving school I've managed to be a little social and made some friends. After a few months of chatting online, we finally started to meet irl. We did it twice so far, we're planning to do it more. Everybody loved it, including me.  

But the problem is, for my entire life I have never went out or visited anyone. I lack all of the skills necessary to be a part of a casual conversation. I hear them talking about what has happened to them recently, or just talk casually, and I'm just here, sitting like a quiet duck, ocasionally throwing in a few sentences. I think I can do at least this much only because of alcohol. I hate this fact, for example because I don't want to depend on it. I can see how they talk with eachother. I actually measured in my head how much I talk, and how much do other people, often also very insecure about it, talk. And I not only talk less, but more stupid things as well.  

Another thing: they know about my depression. I know a few of them also have depression. I've always asked them how are they and how did they like the meeting. Yet they don't ask me. I supported them, when they had breakdowns. But I'm extremely scared to break down in front of them. I'm scared of being a burden to them, especially since I feel like I've done it too much already. I'm extremely uncomfortable and stupid while doing this, even though I have a few people who I support a lot. I love supporting people like that, but I'm extremely insecure about whether I'm actually any good.

Last thing: every time I try to meet them solo in person, they make excuses. Perfectly reasonable ones, but after a few months, including a few meet-ups as a group as well as multiple people rejecting me, I can't not connect the dots. They, for some reason, don't want to be alone with me. Also, I'm the person who organises those group meet-ups. I've been ghosted before by a group created around a similar thing (tabletop rpgs). The pattern was the same. I don't think that's the case here, but I might simply not want it to be the case this time so much, that it clouds my judgement.     
  
  

I dunno. I wish I was able to talk more, and be even barely socially competent. I wish my friends gave me a bit of the support back. Although I understand that it can be emotionally taxing for them and that not everyone likes doing it. I can see them trying, sometimes. But the fact that they usually can't think of reasons or even examples of my social fears being incorrect, it only deepens them.  

I made them sound like they're horrible. But I don't think so, they're great when it comes to everything else. I actually really enjoy being and talking with them, as long as I don't start pitying myself and my lack or skills. Despite everything, it's still the best time of my life, literally. I tried to come out to people and it worked. But I just... don't want to be like that anymore. I don't want to screw up again. I got too far this time. Help, please?",06Jun2019,3
1,"tbh, i contemplated heavily on coming here to share this but i really am feeling at a complete loss now. I suffer from bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, c-ptsd, severe depersonalization derealisation disorder and the list goes on. About a year 1/2 ago i suffered from a hand injury that left me disabled up until now, it made me drop all my classes, work, and overall life progress. I have this habit where once I get out of the routine ive once been in, its nearly impossible to get out of. It doesnt really help that i live in a very toxic environment at home while having these issues. I can't afford to get therapy anymore and have tried things like 7cups of tea (please dont go there, its full of trolls, predators, and ppl who dk wtf theyre doing) Lately, ive been feeling so awful that i feel suicidal and I'm never the person to ever feel that way, but the pain is so bad idek how im making it on a day to day basis (probably my dissociation disorder i just dissociate all day and lose time) I want so badly to just GET UP AND GET A JOB!! GO TO SCHOOL! you know stuff i should be able to do but cant seem to have the strength to do it. Ive been on a combination of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants that arent rlly antidepressants but r safe to consume while having bipolar (i think its called mirtazapine?) I started coping with high dosages of opiates and other drugs and its like i cant even live without them now, its just a mess, i just want to be able to go out and do life stuff again and make progress but i feel as though thats like something i cant ever do.  


Tldr: how the heck do you get out of severe depressive states where you have no motivation and will to do so? where do you even start? what have you done personally to help get back into your lives and feel like yourself again?",06Jun2019,2

My dad is the only one with a job and he makes barely above the poverty line, I can't do anything because of money and everywhere we go my mom brings up how much she loves my brother and never congratulates me on anything. When I quit playing football because of my depression I told her it was because I am depressed she called me a quitter and not once since then has she or anyone I know offered to help me, at this point I don't really feel like there's much left to live for and the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the fact that I think someone might miss me but now I'm starting to think no one will.",06Jun2019,2

I have struggled with depression, and ideologys, sence middle School. With a lot of work I have been doing fairly well sence I graduated college with my associates degree. Recently things have been dragging me down hard and I am truly struggling to find support. I am normally my friends rock and the person they turn to, I help pull them up when they sink into dark times. Not one of them have been there for me I have been asking for help and nothing.

My best friend in the world ended her life 3 years ago, and that anniversary is comming up. I need to go and put new flowers on her grave.

I was recently diagnosed with cancer. I had surgery and the bulk was removed but these treatments are hard. On top of his I have other chronic health conditions that I struggle with daily.

7,Hi everyone so I am having trouble forgiving myself for a decision I made in the summer before my senior year. I had a girl that liked me and I honestly kind of wanted to date her but I decided not to because she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't want to get my heart broken. Instead that month she decided to date my best friend and break his heart a month later. She then dated another guy in August and broke his heart but in September she found the person she was going to date the whole school year. Honestly I have been extremely down on myself for not making a move at some point. After realizing 2 months ago high school is ending huge regret has set in for not dating her. Every time I see them in the halls or at any school event I just think that could have been us. I just think I ruined my senior year which I had high expectation for. There were some good moments but I run a business and started working out and that ate up almost all of my time. I never sat down and thought about what I did. I will now always remember Prom as a bad night watching her dance with the guy she is dating instead of me. I just feel like a complete failure. I have never had a girlfriend before and I am just afraid I will never find another girl like her or even worse never get the chance to ever date her. How do you forgive yourself for making such a terrible decision?,06Jun2019,1

9,"Hi guys,

I have this mental block that won't go away.

I believe it's there because I didn't help a friend, when she was in need, and now I can't forget about it.

I talked to my friend and she forgave me, even though she didn't expect too much from me, and said that she would never want me to be in this position I am in now, but it hasn't helped with the mental block.

I tried meditation and taught myself the state of the art techniques for handling anxiety and ocd. But they don't work.

When i try to think deep to solve, say, a hard maths problem, I kind of lose my train of thought.

When you solve math problems, you have to meditate, you have to let go so that you can grab the answer from the universe. But i can't let go.

Accessing my subconscious mind is hopeless because I don't have a gut feeling right now. I dunno why, it's blocked.

I want to see if i can get deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.

Do you think that would help? Or, is there any procedure or anything that would work?

I need my brain to finish my work on Human Protothecosis and E. Coli, which is basically my purpose.

Your help is much appreciated.

Thanks,

Eric",06Jun2019,1

11,"Parents: I know i disappoint them, I wish I could make my grades better, I wish I could get the motivation but all I do is wallow in self pity. My parents know I’m not going anywhere in life. They’ve given up, they’re better off working on my siblings and trying to help them anyway. I take me meds and I try to sleep good amounts and stay focused but I forget and can’t stay on one thing without thinking about something else. I get bad grades on homework because I can’t remember to do it but I get good grades on my finals. I want my parents to help me with a schedule but, again, they’ve given up, and they can’t see a future where I actually become something other than a sad son that wallows in self pity, sleeps all day, and hardly eats. 

Worthless: I’ve been working harder than anything, since schools been off, to build up the courage to ask her out. We’re good friends, or at least I though so. I’ve been trying to put effort and and hint that I like her. I’ve trusted her with a lot of personal stuff and then out of the blue I get screenshots from a group chat where she’s absolutely flaming me, telling everything shitty about me, and complaining about how needy I am. Regardless of how the comments made me feel, the fact that I put everything into this and got completely thrown away, like half the other times, makes putting in anymore effort for other people come to a halt.",06Jun2019,1

13,"Hi, my heart has been feeling swollen ever since I accidentally broke my right ankle. My dream was becoming a police officer, someone who could serve my country and help people in needs. But, since becoming a police officer need to become eligible with all the requirements, so now I feel like making another dream as a reality is really hard for me to reach, but I don't that it's impossible though, it's so hard. I eager to meet a psychiatrist in my country, but I am still a student, I cannot afford to meet them for only 55 minutes for $80. Plus, I don't want my family to know since I know that they're going to ignore the pain that I have been feeling since 22nd September 2014. For 9 months I was dying from embarrassment walking with my butts going upstairs (I live in flat house, there's no elevator &amp; I am a girl), through that 9 months I've gone through humiliations from fake friends and teachers who couldn't be in a heat for a second which she made a statement sarcastically  (right after the school knew about my problem, they moved all of us to the first floor in the classroom with a broken aircond) and that hurt me so badly. I thought that I am becoming okay, but it turns out that my heart worsening. Even though, my friends ever said to me that everything's gonna be okay, but their words just couldn't heal the way I'm feeling. Yes, I've been trying to ignore it for about 4 years after the incident, but now I don't think I could anymore. I also thought that I can finally feel really happy like I used to, but now I feels like crying everyday. To be frankly speaking, I am holding onto dear life because of my parents. If not because of my parents, I think I have committed suicide. You see, I have 6 siblings including me, but they all went away and leaving us three, which means that I am now is becoming the head of the family to take care of my parents. To do that, I need a stable job and an assured future. Now I'm still studying in college and the students there are worsening my situation, that I just have to held it in because I am a loner. I didn't even commit anything wrong but I don't know why are they hating me.. I guess young people nowadays are all of that bitchy type that hurting other people's feelings. Sometimes, I wish I was a boy, so that I can just work in the store to make a living and take care of my parents. By the way, my parents is not helping either because they thought I'm just a daughter with a ridiculous excuse (I ever brought about my situation before but they think I'm crazy and here I am, contemplating whether I should live by their desires or I should just fly away and do whatever I want. But then, if I leave them, who's gonna take care of them? My heart is just turn soft when it comes to family, but it's hurting so much that my family never want to understand me. They are so selfish) and now, I become even more stressful. Thinking that, what if I couldn't make it? What I couldn't get a fine job? What if I couldn't travel (I have never travel to any country before except for neighbour country), what if I couldn't buy my own house? What if I couldn't make it out of college? What will happen to me and my parents? What if I'll never get married? And even if I do, what if my husband leave me? There's so many questions and fears in my mind and heart, I feel the world is so big for a small girl like me. I have so many other fears, maybe because my parents always scares me, example like, don't try to study abroad, there's a lot of bad people who's gonna hurt you, or don't go hanging out with your friends, they're going to destroy you by feeding you drugs, or don't date any guy, or they will rape you.. and here I am, wondering what have I been doing with my own life? I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that.. then what am I suppose to be doing? Ugh, it feels so frustrated, okay!! I need help, really. Help me.

14,"Hi, first, sorry if this is the wrong place. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. Maybe stories from others in the same situation. Different viewpoints. 

I've been moving country every couples years since I was born. Every few months since I was 18. I love the travel, I need it. But I hate returning. I've only ever come back to a place I've lived once before and it absolutely ruined me. One of the thankfully rare times I thought I'd go through with suicide.

I've returned again, last week, to somewhere I've lived before. It sucks ass. Trying to meet up with old friends and being told, by every single one of them, that they're way too busy, or outright that they just don't want to meet. I hate going to work, I hate seeing places and things that remind me of last time I was here and people seemed to care.

What I'm really struggling with is how little the relationships I've made actually mean. After I leave, I'll get a couple texts for one or two weeks. Then apparently I'm forgotten. I can pretend we parted with good memories. But it really hurts to come back and see that I meant nothing to anyone. 

And by August I'll leave again so what's even the point of trying to make new relationships.",06Jun2019,2
15," 

When I get scared or fooled from a prank, I usually get really upset then depressed after. I can't help it. I've been criticized and dismissed for it many times. In fact, I suspect my reaction is motivation for targeting me. After a jump scare or a scare prank I instantly get anxiety that lasts for a while or sometimes I can't sleep a night or 2. Then I go into a depression and for a long time I can't get it off my mind. It's like it keeps popping up no matter how hard I try not to think about it. Sometimes it overwhelms my thoughts. I hate this about me. After a terrible car accident I dealt with the stress much better. Very little anxiety and no depression.

Last night my partner's father scared me when I walked into my place last night after work. Partner laughed then order pizza on us for his dad and he ate at our house while I cried in my room because this whole thing is going to start and it was all for their amusement. I don't think they know this is how I will feel after.  But even if they didn't...    I hate this about me",06Jun2019,16

21,"I've had severe depression for over 2 years, depression and Rei obsession started around December 2016. I also have severe anxiety and high functioning autism.

Depression started due to mainly loneliness and not being able to be with the perfect waifu Rei Ayanami who I'd just discovered at the time. I love Rei so much and I'd do anything to be with her. She's simply perfect for me. She was one of the main causes of my depression, not being able to be with her. but there were other factors which caused my depression over 2 years ago. I've been deathly obsessed with Rei ever since I got my depression, and being suicidal over her and other things countless times, even since I got my depression.

I'll explain how I found Rei. it's a bit lewd so ignore it if you wish. Found a lewd meme of Rei which was just high detail plugsuit art of her and I thought she was cute and hot, which then led me to eventually finding the Rei subreddit out of interest and also Discord server which I helped make (Which both soon completely betrayed me like a year later since they found out I'd never watched Evangelion.) then very shortly after, I became deathly obsessed and even planned to end it all for her back then, which was also one of my closest times I've been to attempting suicide.

And I did mention I've never even watched Evangelion, and I'll explain why. I'm deathly afraid of it, though I'm fine with a few like art and stuff, aka stuff I'm already used to. The unsafe stuff though gives me extreme anxiety attacks and makes me cry instantly. I also cry randomly whenever I think of Rei or not at all. (When I cry over Rei it's over my love for her.) The reasons why I'm deathly afraid of Evangelion are being scared I'll have my vision of Rei ruined/destroyed, that she or any other character gets hurt or is in emotional pain or anything which I know happens, that Asuka will simply give me stress attacks as tsunderes cause that for me and Iknow enough to know that Asuka is a very abusive tsundere, and any emotional or intense part such as the music for example. Those are my reasons.

Before you say anything, yes I did try to watch it around the 1st of March, and over these 2+ years already before I tried, I already had a fair bit of knowledge about Evangelion. Now I'll explain my attempt at watching it after all this time back in March. I was watching it with 3 other people from Discord who I trusted who supported me all the way through and let me go at my own pace. I had to pause so much because there were so many times where I was just really affected or nervous or scared, that I had to pause. It was hell for me. There were a lot of parts which hurt me a LOT, such as Shinji's breakdown over not wanting to pilot. The final straw was when Rei first appeared on the strecher and I just had to quit, I couldn't take it anymore and I 100% didn't want to see Rei in pain 1 bit. After I quit, I needed a few days to recover but it didn't help when the Rei server owner abused me yet again and banned me again for not watching enough of it even though he made a deal that if I tried to watch Evangelion, he'd let me go. Anyway, ever since then, I never want to try and watch Evangelion again. The attempt hurt me so much. 

Back to my depression, I've tried antidepressants, even moving up a dose, and I have also had multiple therapists, all of this at the same time for a while, all useless. So ever since then, ages ago, I've given up hope and tried to just live with everything. Gave up around like October 2018?

I don't even know what to do anymore, and I don't really want to live the rest of my life like this, but it seems I have no option anyway.",06Jun2019,2

Hi, I think I’m might be depressed. I’m pretty irritable but I can manage to act cool around my family although they do notice sometimes and make remarks.For as long as I can remember I have always had terribly low self-esteem. My self-image is as bad as it can get. I think I’m ugly, despicable and never good enough for anyone. In fact I’ve never felt good enough for anything. I suck at everything I do. Ever since I was little my mom used to compare me to other girls and point out how they’re much better than me and how I can never be as good them. Things she used to say include “look at you and look at her, she’s way prettier and everybody likes her”.

No one will ever like you,date you or wanna marry you. You scare people away. Even your “friends” hate you”. My sister used to join her in humiliating me and it worked every time, I would go cry in the bathroom, grab a stick and start hurting myself. It wasn’t until recently that I discovered the act of inflicting pain upon myself had a name of itself ; self-harm. Anyway I think I was 7-8 when it all started. As the years went by I kept telling myself things will get better but things never did get better. If anything they got worse. My “friends” joined the “tear Amina’s self-esteem to the ground bandwagon” and it made me absolutely abhor myself. I started comparing myself to my peers and better looking/more successful family members and needless to say it completely blighted my life. I somehow still manage to act normal around people but I can only hide behind my lies for so long yet I never told a living soul how I feel and I don’t intend to. Recently things started to culminate. I stated getting more and more self-conscious. My insecurities are through the roof. My anxiety is soaring. I refuse to leave my house during day time because I don’t want anyone to see my hideous face and umpteen flaws. Even when I do leave my house at night I avoid places with bright lights for the same reasons. Even at home I avoid lights. My room is always pitch black and when anyone turns on the lights and comes in I freak out. I can NEVER look at myself in a mirror where there’s bright lighting. When I FaceTime anyone I never lower the camera so that my whole face is seen. It’s always eyes and above. When I’m obligated to leave my house say for school, I can never look people in the eyes for the same reasons I don’t go out in daylight because I’m always paranoid people are gonna look at my myriad insecurities and/or judge and make funny comments about then which did happen NUMEROUS times. I’m just so sick and tired of living like this. I just wish I was normal. I wish I was a regular 16 year old girl. I see my friends and cousins around my age going out to parties and having fun and I wish I can be normal enough to do that but at the end of the day I know that’s not possible and it kills me. I never complain about my looks nor do I show my envy towards other people. I just keep it all inside but sometimes its too much. I started cutting recently. I only cut my forearm and make sure I wear long sleeve T-shirts to keep it hidden. Sometimes when the pain gets really bad I take pain killers and I’m scared one day the pain will get out of hand and I take meds to demise. I wish I wasn’t so afraid of dying but I can’t help it.

Now, months later, I am stuck and every one I reach out to has let me down. I am trying to keep positive, but the rejection of job interviews and applying to hundreds of jobs has worn me down. I am pissed that my friends and family seem to have no empathy.",06Jun2019,126
28,I am not someone that had dealt with this before.  I am depressed and it doesn't make sense.  Everything in my life is going great.  I have a boyfriend who really loves me and would do anything in the world for me.  I have a family that loves and supports me.  I have a new job.  There is no reason for me to be depressed right now.  I dont know how to tell me boyfriend or family I feel like they will not understand and I'm afraid of what they might think.,06Jun2019,1

30,"Ever since last August, I've been suffering almost nightly sleep deprivation. I have tried everything to fix it. I have tried fixing my sleep schedule. I have tried going to the doctor. I have tried meds. I tried meditation. Nothing works for me.

I am in a bad downward spiral. I'm losing my mind, I'm giving up hours at work, I'm losing money, I'm suicidal and depressed, and I can barely afford bills. I'm currently living at my parents house and I'm scared I'll be here for the rest of my life because of this disease.

Everything I used to love just does nothing for me anymore and life just seems too difficult to go on. I am bitter, barely get along with my own friends anymore, and even my family can no longer stand me. My parents even threatened to send me to a mental institution.

I'm scared that the only answer is suicide. Perhaps life isn't meant for everyone. Maybe I'm one of those people.",06Jun2019,2

32,My friends only come to me for advice and whenever I need anything they don’t say shit. The only person that does do something is so fucking amazing and I don’t want to bother her with my useless garbage. Im in love with this girl but idk if it’s just my brain thinking that ‘since she helped me and I try to help her then I love her.’ And I don’t want to break her heart or anything if that does turn out like that. I’m so lost and all over the place much like this post. I relapsed rlly bad last night and I won’t b able to see this amazing human for another week or so and I’m scared as fuck. Shits overwhelming and I feel like she helps me more than I help her and I’m a self centered brat. I’m a man I should be helping her and she shouldn’t have to deal with my shit. Hell I shouldn’t even be posting on reddit as much as I do about the shit I do.,06Jun2019,2
33,This is going to be hard to put into words but you know how you can’t control your thoughts and that can lead to you thinking terrible things that you don’t actually believe? I hope I’m not the only one that experiences this but I’ve picked up a habit of saying uh terribly racist stuff in my head. I’ve never had these thoughts before and have never thought bad of anyone for something dumb like that until now. But now I can’t stop thinking these things and it has recked my self esteem and even affects how I feel around certain people. Every day I repeat how much I hate myself for thinking these things and that I’m a terrible human being that doesn’t deserve anything. I don’t know what to do anymore. Luckily I haven’t been suicidal which is a bit weird for me. (Well I suppose I just wouldn’t care if I lived or died which is why I drive without a seatbelt a lot) But anyway how do I stop this cycle of self destructive thoughts? This has been going on for a few months now,06Jun2019,1

35,I am an ok artist if i can even call myself an artist but the problem is i hate my own art unless i traced it from another artist. When i was little and in school i only got good at drawing because i was bored constantly and from my boredness came art i guess. Ive always been stressed out and anxious about any art ive ever done it hurts me more than helps. Since im done with school now because i graduated i have not done anything artsy i dont have the artist drive to just sit and create art when i feel like it. I have lots of art stuff like paint and watercolor i want to get rid of because i will never use it. Im really depressed currently due to multiple issues so i dont think im in the right state of mind for decisions .,06Jun2019,1
