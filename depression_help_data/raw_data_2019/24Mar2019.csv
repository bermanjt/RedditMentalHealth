I get up, shower and get dressed, I keep my clothes washed, my bed washed and keep the bills paid, but other than that, if it requires motivation, I just can't seem to do it. I live alone, I'm disabled with chronic abdominal pain. I'm so drained of any energy and my body aches all over. I'm always tired and just don't want to do anyrhing. I'm lonely and the people I used to talk to have all abandoned me. I'm angry at myself, Life and God for letting my life become this way. I can't come out of it. I don't care about life anymore. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I've been to the mental hospital 3 times for about a week each time. I hate being alone and spend most of my time at my parent's house. I'm lost in life. I just want it all to end. I'm tired of feeling useless, helpless and hopeless! I have a therapist and a psychiatrist. Nothing helps, I hate my life and just want to die. I'm spiraling deeper into despair, I don't know how to get through this anymore. This all started when I became ill. I'm capable of so much more, my mood just stops me in my tracks. I'm so tired of disappointment and hatred for myself and life, I just don't care about anything anymore. I need help, I'm going nowhere fast, I feel like an old man just waiting to die.

So without college how do I get a job that pays reasonably but isn't terrible? Currently I work at Chick-fil-A and it's been great. Surprisingly a majority of the people there deal with mental illness and are open about it. I feel comfortable there but I make $9 an hour right now.

Now, I don’t feel like I’ll ever want to be in another relationship again because I’m afraid some stupid bullshit like that will happen again, but I just can't get over him. Anyways, over the course of the last month, I have attempted to commit suicide 2 times. I failed both times. I clearly couldn’t handle a relationship, at least according to my ex-boyfriend. But I also couldn’t even kill myself right, So my already low self esteem was completely crushed, It's gotten so bad that I legitimately hate myself. I now feel like I’m worthless, and can't do anything right. I don’t get any joy or satisfaction or pleasure from things that I used to love doing. I only have a few people who I can really talk to about this, because the rest of my friends had a massive falling out with each other, and have gone their separate ways, the few friends I am still in contact with, take days to respond. I am also failing in school, so at this point, I have no fucking future. No school will take me if they see that in my freshman year of High School, I had a D or an F in almost all of my classes. The short amount of time that I have left to bring my grades back up before summer is just not enough. I have also been getting bullied all year, I have reported it several times, and nothing has been done about it. I suffer from sever anxiety, stress, depression, and I think I might be bipolar, but I haven't had it diagnosed yet. I almost never want to eat anything anymore, And I feel like I was already somewhat malnutritioned because of eating disorders. And my parents keep telling me to just pretend that I am happy until I actually am happy, so I've had to try to keep all of this bottled up for over a month now. So everyone that I know thinks that I have recovered and that I’m completely fine, so now if I start showing how I actually feel, they’ll probably just say that I’m faking it and trying to get attention.

14,"When I first conceived the idea of Gratitude Bridge just over two years ago, it had one simple goal.

Walk over the Harbour Bridge every day at sunrise and give one message of gratitude, one message of hope.

today,

I am grateful for a message of hope.

It took me two years to actually kick of Gratitude Bridge and to do that I had to go through a huge period of dark depression, suicide, therapists, trying to get my mental health in check before I could do the project.

Yesterday I found it interesting when I posted a daily video on the Australia subreddit, that a lot of people commented negatively that it was some sort of promotion of an App, you're out there to make money or whatever it was they were thinking.

It doesn't really matter about the haters, this vlog is really about dealing with recovery of mental health issues, especially that around depression and to give other people a little bit of hope in the idea of gratitude techniques that they can use to deal with their depression.

Anything that can spread a bit of kindness in this world that's so fucking jaded all the time.

My names David and this is Gratitude Bridge.

today,

I'm grateful for this project for my own (and others) mental health

I’ve been looking for a new role for several months now. I’ve had multiple interviews over this period but am yet to receive an offer. Historically, a rejection would leave me feeling so dejected that I’d stop applying for months. I’ve kept going on this occasion and am pleased - in fact, I’m almost proud - of this.

In spite of my progress, I’m still incredibly anxious before interviews and this can lead to procrastination, speaking too quickly, becoming muddled etc.

20,"i have been diagnosed for two years now with bipolar disorder. before that, i had been diagnosed for several years with suicidal depression. i have had three therapists since college (about five years ago) since one by one they seem to “lose interest” in my problems and tell me it’s because i should focus on a.) my religion or b.) my career. living in a third world country with very traditional values that usually think people should not be sad or stressed unless they are financially or religiously strained, this isn’t that hard to believe.

my current therapist was good for a while, and we could talk about all sorts of things in my daily life that gave me stress, or i would feel comfortable admitting to panic attacks. lately though, when we talk it seems she has become more and more disinterested when i talk to her, beginning with times when i would tell her things like how i quit my previous job because the bullying there was affecting me so much i lost all interest in everything else in my life and spent all day crying. even after i explained to her i was having more fun and earning much much more through freelancing, she always “forgot” i had told her i quit my old job and would chastise me for leaving it.

since then, when i tell her something negative about my working life (yes i got another job) she seems to stare off somewhere else or busy herself just writing my usual prescriptions.

last time i told her i was suffering from stress migraines so painful i could not eat or sleep, and she just said “hmm” and “u-huh” until the end of the session. i noticed nothing in my anxiety meds dosage changed, so to sort of treat myself i just stopped talking to people and now spend 10-12 hours daily at my desk (less social interaction relaxes me maybe?)

but now i am slipping into another depressive episode. because i cut everyone off i feel lonely, or i get lonely now and then and cut even more people out as a sort of reaction. 

i do not know how to explain this to her anymore. moreover, i feel scared of going to another session and have just been hoping my lack of prescription refills aren’t hitting me too hard. i don’t want to end up talking again and feel like i’m being ignored or being chastised. my next appointment is in two days.

if anyone has a good way of talking about their depressive episodes without relation to work to their therapists, please do comment with some advice or examples.



further notes: i cannot leave this therapist as right now, my life schedule is kind of full to the brim and i am too exhausted to find another therapist who works farther away, or costs more than i can afford at the moment.",24Mar2019,2

27," I 'm unsure if this is a rant or cry for support or both. I just know I need to do something and hear anybody else instead of letting everything circle in my head while the hours pass.

Throughout my teenage years I was in and out of mental institutions and different schools due to some severe mental health issues. Both sides of my family are riddled with bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, the whole package. I remember believing I would not make it to 25. Five days before my 18th birthday, I was given an incredible gift. There was an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in my brain, an entanglement of arteries and veins the size of a golf ball. Doctors said that this \*might\* be contributing to poor mental state as it disrupts healthy blood flow patterns in the brain.

&amp;#x200B;

""Might"" was enough for me. Knowing that there was possibly a reason for the madness gave me so much hope. I underwent a series of 6 surgeries and left for college two weeks after my last surgery. Call it placebo (it's literally all in your head anyway right?) or call it a cure, after my AVM was cleared up it felt like my depresso years were in a past life. I had a positive college experience and made wonderful friends. I still suffered with anxiety but it was manageable compared to years past.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated college 2 years ago, and things have just been steadily declining. I have feelings of hopelessness that send me in a fit of hyperventilation and tears for hours. These feelings are so familiar and it makes it all the more terrifying. I'm going back to it and I don't know how to stop it. I have altogether stopped doing the things that I enjoy doing. I can't enjoy them anymore. All I can do is stare into space or at my phone and do nothing for hours, until I get fed up with myself and cry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no reason to be like this. I have a well-paying job, I'm on an organized sports team that plays once a week, I have an extremely understanding and supportive boyfriend, I have friends at work. I know it's ridiculous but all of this just makes me feel guilty for how depressed I feel when I'm alone. I cancel plans that people make with me just so I can be miserable by myself, I think I tell myself it's self care to stay home when I'm feeling depressed, but it makes things infinitely worse.  I'm just *like this* now and I have no idea why. This weekend has been particularly bad. I haven't left my apartment since coming home from work on Friday (It's Sunday afternoon where I am now). I've been out of food. I've got 2 hours of sleep between the last two days. I am desperately trying to get myself to do something but I just won't let myself. I try to focus on the things that make me feel fulfilled like my pet rabbit or my sports team. But I feel doomed again like I did when I was 16. I'm locked into a fate of being deeply miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I'm not looking for advice. I know I need to seek help, I know I just need to *do* before thinking instead of thinking before doing. I just can't for whatever reason. My head won't let me. And it feels real bad. I wish I still believed that getting my brain fixed was going to fix me, that was such a wonderful feeling. 

Sorry for long post

Until a couple days ago, i dont know what happened. I just felt all this sadness at once and i just felt so alone . I told my cousin, who has dealt with these thoughts before herself. She said its ok and that i just need to get help and keep trying. She was very supportive. Around this time my siblings got home from work so we had a sort of family sit down. Ive never really been ok with talking about myself and i had never said it out loud before but i told them that for a long time now i wanted to die. I cried alot that day and it was so strange because once the tears started i couldn't stop them. I never cry over anything. But as soon as i sat down with my cousin to the moment we ended our family talk i cried all the way through. I was just so frustrated with myself and who id become. I was this broken person who just wanted someone to know how i felt. They were all really supportive and have been since. Today my brother showed me local clinics for counseling and therapy. I have been considering therapy for a very long time but its so expensive. The thing is, I don't know why i told them how i was feeling. I just threw these feelings at them and they want me to get help but i dont know if i want that. Ive been feeling lost for so long. I dont go to school i only work once a week. I basically have become a shut in. So for them to all of a sudden see me and not just the me i show them but the me that has been hiding in my room all this time . The sad person who has wanted to die for so long. I just feel so ashamed. How could i hurt them in this way. Throw this on to them and then tell them i dont even want help. My brother offered to help me pay for therapy but i cant do that too him. I have failed so much in my life, and i just feel like i know that this is gonna be so hard. Its so expensive and emotionally draining. The counselor/therapist will make it real. They're gonna make me actually try. And im scared i cant do it. I'm afraid that it's gonna be exactly what i know it is. How can i change, When ive seen the world in such a terrible and dark way for so long. When for so many years i told myself that i had really lived all i could and that this was it. 6 years of telling myself that im not ok and i never will be and some people just suffer and i cant change it. Ive just always told myself that this is it. I accepted it.  That this was never gonna get better. I never wanted this attention. I want to keep being bitter because it means i dont have to admit that i could get better. How could i have let it come to this. Why couldn't i just keep it to myself.  Why do i feel so conflicted.

32,"So many losses...I'm tired. Hurting. And feel alone.

The past 7-8 months have been hard. I've experienced a lot of losses and they keep coming.
First..I ended a long term relationship in September. We lived in another state; I left and returned to our home state. I left him, our home and my job. Eventually..I lost my car and cat. 
All of that was hard. My ego hurt because he reconnected with a former ex shortly after I departed (within weeks) and they are still together. He still attempts to contact me and in moments of loneliness and weakness I have seen him, despite knowing about his relationship. 
When I returned to my home state I moved in with my sister. She just informed me that her lease is not being renewed and I have to move in two months. My anxiety is thru the roof as I don't know if I'll be able to get the money to move with such short notice. I am working, but its a seasonal position that ends in June. I am looking for permanent work.
Lastly, a close friend died over the weekend. She had cancer; was diagnosed in December. She had been a big support to me over the years. We talked daily when I lived out of state and every day since I returned. When she received her cancer diagnosis, I was a big help to her.
I feel hurt, lonely and alone. My circle of friends has always been small and it continues to get smaller.
Right now I feel like I don't have anyone. 
I'd like to see a therapist, but most don't accept my insurance. Besides that will also expire in May.
I also feel hopeless.
I'm in my 50s so starting all over again feels daunting.
I'd appreciate any words of encouragement.

34,"I've been through a lot in the last couple of years. I got with a guy who I thought was maybe the one and then it turns out he was just using me for what he thought he could get out of me. We split up, more like he dumped me when he realized that he couldn't use me for money. I went six months in between relationships and then I met somebody else who turned out to be abusive and every way possible. He was also an alcoholic.

I did a lot for him including getting him back on his meds for bipolar disorder, cleaning his house, cooking his meals, doing his laundry and sorting his meds and providing emotional support every day. The way he repaid me was to cheat on me and beat the crap out of me every day. Now I'm learning that I need to be careful with who I show my good heart too because not everyone has good intentions but I'm just seriously getting fed up.

Also I have a physical disability so I guess people seem to think I'm dumb and think they can try to use me and scam me. I guess they think that because I'm physically disabled that also means I'm dumb enough to believe whatever they want to tell me. I honestly think that the ex who tried to use me for money was only mad because I saw through him and when he realized he couldn't pull the wool over my eyes it pissed him off.

But my disability is something that's just going to keep getting worse and worse over time and on top of that I just kind of feel like what's the point of living if all people are going to do is keep taking the proverbial shit on my head and then I have to deal with chronic pain and the fact that this disability is one day going to kill me anyway. I feel like why put myself through any more suffering? I'm considering just ending it all. I've even made a plan for how I'm going to do it. I'm going to go to the doctor and get strong sleeping pills and then just take them all.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm just tired of being alone and watching everybody else I know get to be happy including my own siblings. I'm the oldest so I felt like I should have been married before any of them. Sometimes I feel like there's something wrong with me. Like maybe I would just be better off dead and I would be doing everyone a favor by just going away. I don't know any other way to feel anymore.
