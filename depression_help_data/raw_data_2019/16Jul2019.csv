0,"I apologise for my English (if there's some errors) but the English isn't my first language.

Well as the tittle says, every time I do or try to do something my family never gave me support or even try their best just to make me fail and if I fail they make worst my depression and when I get really angry and yell about my depression they just laugh at me saying that I'm just an useless person and they would do better on my place. I'm an programming student, I'm not the best of my school, but also I'm far to be the worst, I'm just an regular student so it's normal that something's were complicated for me, my general score is around 80 of 100 but even so all my family just critics me saying that I should leave my school and enter at other more easier (its also remarcable to say that my school is one if not the best of the region). Also I wanted to try the airsoft but all them just says that it's an childish thing and I even will be bad at it. When I learned to drive (around 3-4 years ago) everyone make fun of me. When I enter on an robotic competition (which I nearly won) everyone also make fun of me saying that I went so far just to get disqualified at the quarters of final and my robot was an pice of junk with a bunch of luck. And the final thing (on this post) it is that my dad just over filled the antifreeze of his own car with water (making it useless both the car and the antifreeze) this morning knowing that I would use it today just to make me stay on the road practically all the noon, I'm not requesting help to overcome my depression because I'm keep going forward just to prove them wrong, I'm just want to know if there's something that I'm doing wrong, maybe my motivations are just wrong, maybe them are just right and I'm no more than an guy that tries their best to do the things that he likes and never do an single thing right, maybe I'm just giving them so much importance around my life choices, maybe I'm just paranoic about all this, I'm not asking for an cry of help I'm asking for and advice (I would wanted an advise of an truly friend but I don't have one of those) just to know if this is alright, because I know it's not a normal thing",16Jul2019,1
1,"Hi everybody. I'll try to keep it short, but I need a place to rant.

I'm currently working as an intern on a project completely unrelated to my field. I was really excited about this internship because I've felt so useless the past three years in college. All the insecurity and self doubt that goes with being in a competitive major really got to me, so getting this internship was really cool even though it isn't super relevant to my interests. I saw this as my summer of redeeming myself and maybe finding some confidence.

I just found out that the work that I've been doing all summer is totally useless and they're pretty much going to scrap it as soon as I leave for school in August. I feel like a waste of space, and I feel like I've been led on because they saw how dumb I was and gave me busy work out of pity.

So here we are again at square one with the insecurity and lack of confidence. I don't even know what I'm asking for here, but any decent note to end the day on would be nice.

Thanks.",16Jul2019,7

I was talking to my friend today and he is really, really struggling with depression but can't afford therapy since he doesn't have health insurance. I'm worried as hell about him and I was wondering if anyone has any resources for low cost or free therapy either online or in California. I've been trying to google but honestly I'm having a hard time telling what is legitimate and what is fake internet psychology crap.

5,"I need help. I’ve been battling depression for 2 years after the worst breakup (fiancé got someone else pregnant). Within those 2 years, i moved to a new state, I lost friends, family, and 2 jobs. I have secluded myself beyond belief. I can’t even recognize myself when I look in the mirror. I’m not myself. I’ve put on 70lbs and there are days I don’t even go outside or get out of bed. This then triggers my depression more and has made me more and more of a recluse. I’m embarrassed of even being me. Currently, I’m struggling financially and I would love to get a trainer to help me but I can’t afford one. Im intimidated by the gym. This is the biggest I’ve ever been, nothing fits so I hate being seen in public. I was not like this before 2 years ago. I used to love socializing and being outdoors. I loved my life. I’m ashamed that I’ve let myself get to this point but I’m in need of help. There were days I didn’t even brush my teeth or hair, my mental state was bad.

Im at a point that I want to take advantage of how I am feeling more optimistic. I want to let go of the negativity, depression, and the weight. I want to be better than I was before my heart broke. But I need help because truly, this is my rock bottom but I need someone to help throw me a ladder to help me find my way out of the hole I’ve been in. I just need a little push and encouragement to navigate through a gym and workout for weight loss. I want to love myself and workout as an investment for my life. Please, someone out there, help me.",16Jul2019,1

I just want a hug I want to feel like I mean something to someone even just for a moment. But I am giving up it will never happen. I am sorry for bugging any of you. Just need to say what I was thinking. I'm sorry..",16Jul2019,2
8,"I don’t really know where to start. I’m having a horrible time with my depression/anxiety and I genuinely feel like there aren’t solutions to my problems at this point. I’ve spent the last 10 years telling myself to keep going, ‘gets better’ and trying different techniques to treat myself: therapy, meds, eating better/exercising, sleeping better, self-help books, self-care, etc, and nothing works. I can’t see a therapist anymore (I only got a year in therapy before finding out my insurance won’t cover it) and I’ve been on different meds on and off, and each time it’s ended in a train wreck. 

I used to love things and be ambitious, despite everything going on in my head, mostly because I hoped it would get better. But now I’m older and things have only gotten worse. I feel like the further into life I go, the worse off it will always be. I keep making decisions based on trying to make myself get better, or try to stop myself getting worse, and because of that I’ve destroyed any chance at happiness, ironically.

At the moment, my anxiety (ocd) is so bad I can’t really move or do more than anything for a few minutes. I feel like my brain is melting because of how severe it is, and I don’t know of anything that will help. I learned some techniques in therapy a few years ago but I can’t do them myself; they work best when someone who knows what they’re doing is helping me. I’ve been dealing with anxiety like this for a decade and I don’t know how much longer I can feel like this. It is torture. 

I moved away from all my friends and family, like far away. I can only go back, reasonably, by plane. I have such intense social anxiety that I thought I had been managing, but now that there’s pressure to make friends so I won’t be alone anymore, I am terrified of people again. That’s when I get the chance to meet them because I hate leaving the house. It scares me and makes me irritable, and I just can’t do it unless it’s something like work. My husband left for 3 days on a business trip and I left a bag of garbage in the kitchen because I kept forgetting to take it outside when I had to leave, and I couldn’t force myself to go back outside just to get it in the dumpster. Also on why I’m having a hard time making friends-

-I found a job when I moved here and quit after a month because my boss was an asshole. She was hyper fixated on my looks and from the first interview, made comments on my hair, weight, and general looks, and on my second day, pulled me aside to tell me I had to start wearing makeup to work. She was grieving a sister who was dying of cancer, and used this as an excuse to treat me (and everyone else around her) like shit, putting us down, getting irritated, and snapping. She hired me on her previous assistant’s last day, left for a week and a half and told me to find other people in the office to train me, but didn’t tell me what to ask them to train me on- so when she got back and I didn’t know everything about the job, she’d berate me and tell me I needed more training. Anyway, after a month I couldn’t take it, and I quit. In the past, I can usually get hired in about a week at another job, but this time it’s taken 5 weeks. I just got hired today for a position, and I found out that I won’t get paid in time for rent, even though my check will cover it. So for the past 5 weeks I’ve been scrounging money, borrowing it from my husband who doesn’t make that much, and even putting some things on a credit card. I barely made rent last month by doing odd jobs- now I have a great job and I’ll have to do that one and odd-jobs at the same time to get rent in, which I’m not sure how I can manage when I can barely make food for myself. The point to that is that even if I wanted to go out and meet people, I’ve been confined indoors by 1) the weight of my impending bankruptcy and 2) the fact that I can’t even afford the bus ticket to go out and meet someone or the $2.50 for a beer at the bars around here. 

I’ve also been suffering from sexual dysfunction caused by years of social anxiety, and then antidepressants. I used to have this crazy sex drive and could get myself off in like 10 minutes- after taking antidepressants, it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2.5 hours. I only ever started  getting involved sexually with other people after I started the meds (I didn’t know they caused sexual dysfunction when I started them) so I went through this phase of having sex with people to try to force myself to feel something, and then being afraid of sex because all my first experiences were me not enjoying it and I didn’t know why, which was all built around a foundation of casually ‘dating’ guys in high school but never letting them get emotionally or physically close to me because I was so afraid of them. Now I’ve stopped the meds and the sexual side effects still linger. My husband (who is so supportive and has been so understanding about everything since I met him) says Prozac did the same thing to him, but he was able to get his sexuality back eventually; I don’t know if I will. At this point I’ve never known a healthy, enjoyable sexual relationship with anyone and I don’t think I ever will. I can’t help but feel like I’ve been robbed of one of the best (if not the best, then the only real perk) of life. I love my husband and he loves me and swears that it’s fine that our sex life is in shambles, but I’m afraid one day it will get to him and will cause problems for us. He’s so sweet, he deserves someone who wants him like he wants me.

Lastly, I don’t love the things that I used to anymore, the things that would get me through the day when I felt like this. I don’t love anything but one thing, (singing) but because I have no money and I live in an apartment, I can’t ever practice- I have a space but can’t afford the gas to drive there and any amount of sound coming from our apartment causes the neighbors to go nuts. And now even when I think of practicing, I just feel like ‘what’s the point?’. I wanted a career in music/music industry when I was younger but I don’t have the people skills to make connections in the industry, and I’m too depressed to force myself to practice any skills that might lead to a career in music, music journalism, photography, tour managing, etc. So I’m kind of giving up. My backup was to be a psychologist, and I love psychology and helping people, but now there are so many obstacles in the way of my degree (I don’t even have an undergrad) that it seems impossible; I’ll probably give up on that halfway too. And I’m not even sure it would make me happy anyway. I don’t think anything in the world would feel right. The things that (used to) make me feel fulfilled are things like learning languages, playing music, researching psychology, but no one is going to pay some random person who can’t get out of bed for any of that. I feel like I wasn’t born to live to make money, and now that’s the biggest issue in my life. I’m literally living to make money for someone else, I get a share too-little to do anything but eat modestly and put just enough gas in my car to get to work, not enough for healthcare that includes mental health, not enough to find anything productive or save for school or anything; yet I sit in an office and do menial busy work, using all of my limited resources on bull shit. I can’t do it anymore. I couldn’t do it when I was in high school, couldn’t do it when I was in college the first time, can’t do it now. How many times can I try and fail at life before someone will just euthanize me? I don’t get any pleasure from any part of this, I can’t feel good anymore. The only emotions I’ve felt for the last however many years have been bad, I feel like I’ve just been going through the motions so I can go to sleep at the end of the day, or worse. I don’t think I could leave my cats behind because I don’t trust anyone but me to take care of them, but other than that I have no reason to live that’s bigger than my suffering. 

Tl;dr: I am broke, lonely, directionless, nothing makes me feel good, I’ve lost all my former interests and I don’t have access to anything that might help make me feel good, in literally any sense of the word. 

I don’t need advice and I don’t really expect anyone to read this whole thing. I just thought it might be better to type it out than keep it inside.  My husband is so supportive but I feel guilty telling him too much. I don’t want him to worry and I don’t want him stress over things he can’t control.",16Jul2019,1

12,"so a little back sorry. my mom was with this guy for 13 years (since i was three) they broke up but when he lived here (let's call him j) so when j lived here he was super abusive he tried drowning me bc i didn't wash my hair (i was like 5) j never had a job all he did was sleep i had to clean up after him and do everything. after they broke up my mom got with a different guy let's call him m. and m has multiple warrents out for his arrest for putting a gun to j's head and m does meth i'm also pretty sure my mom does also. 

ok so last night we'll it was around 3 that she got home and she yelled at me for not cleaning (i haven't been home in awhile so it was all her and m's mess) she started yelling at me. her and m went to go do something so i called her and i asked if i could have a fire she yelled at me again. then a few hours later it was like 6 i asked her when she was gonna be home and she said in an hour and by 8 she still was not here and i was super hungry (we never have food here) and she yelled at me for asking for food. when she got home she was talking shit on me to m saying ""she's mad bc i wouldn't let her have a fire she's a spoiled ass little bitch"" ( i was mad bc i was getting yelled at for no reason all day). so i went out of my room and told her that she was wrong and stuff like that then went back into my room. a few mins later she comes stoning into my room flings my door open so hard it dented the wood by the  hinges and she broke everything that was behind my door. ( candles these 3d puzzles that are super hard to put together a forever lasting rose my boyfriend got me etc.) then she got in my face and said she was gonna hit me. i didn't say anything she went back out of my room still yelling at me. then she was like ""i'm tired of you living here rent free"" (mind you i've had a job since i was 12 paied for everything i own she's never helped me with anything she won't even give me rides places but refuses to sign for me to get my permit) so after she said that it kinda just pushes me over the edge i got in the bath and called my grandma to see if i could come over, so i had a friend come pick me up bc i was not staying there. now today i got called into work when i was not supposed to go and i was at the mall with my cousin so i called my mom and asked her to bring me my work cloths. the whole ride there she was throwing a fit bc i asked for a ride. she came and got me from work and was yelling at me the whole way home. when i got home i had no door, everything in my room was broken there was cat litter everywhere (she took my kitty from me) and my fan was on the other side of my room (there's only ac in the living room and my rooms at the back of the house so it gets super hot). then she continued to yell at me saying it's all my fault, and i just really don't know what to do she treats me like i'm a waste of space for no reason i do everything she asks and i try to be a good kid idek.",16Jul2019,1
13,"For some backstory,i’ve had depression for about 5 years now but only got diagnosed recently when things started to hit the fan and had to go see a therapist which i don’t go to anymore.Anyway,since i was a kid my depression felt like just emptiness most of the time obviously along with all the other symptoms that come with it(including suicidal thoughts )but then about two months ago i was hit with overwhelming sadness and now its just gone...Im back to feeling empty and i feel indifferent now about all my negative experiences/memories i had that used to make me cry.Only thing that has stayed with me is the will to die.When i am not feeling empty i feel a flood of overwhelming sadness and then i go back to living like a robot making it impossible to cry now.I rather feel something than nothing at all.",16Jul2019,1
14,"I'm at peace now.

I was at denial first. I wanted to blame others for my situation, my problems. I blamed my dad for it, mostly. Still do, at least partially. 

I was angry, too. Made a lot of mistakes, hurt lots of people. Lost many friends. Got into mandatory therapy sessions because of that. Did things I'm not proud of. This was since 4th grade, when I was barely 11. Always had problems with anger and violence. 

I tried to bargain my way out. ""Maybe if I do this, things will get better. What if that happened?"" But it was all in vain. Nothing ever worked out. I was a fool for expecting others to actually care, understand me, and to help. No one bats an eye, and no one ever will.

I went through a nasty depression. Clinic said it was Bipolar depression. Still am, anyways. Mental breakdowns weren't common, but when it happened, it hit hard. I fucked my life up. 2 attempts, and it hit my health real bad. I may not make it to 30. I have no one beside me, I'm absolutely alone in this world. I have no one.

Now, I've accepted the whole situation. And when I did, it was... As if I've cut loose sand bags off my back. I've been sleeping good, knowing that I'm the one to blame and no one loves me, but in the end, nothing matters. Once I die, I won't feel anything, I won't need to, and I won't be able to. I'll be forgotten in 5, 6 years.

I tried my whole life. Short, maybe, but it's all I've got. I've fought, survived, lied, cheated, stole. But I never truely lived, looking back. I've studied so much, read so much philosophy, trying to figure out what does it mean to be human; just to realize that to society, it doesn't treat me like one. They ostracize me for being different. They despised me. They hated me. They feared me. And so did I. I hated everyone, but most importantly, I hated myself more than any living soul that has ever existed. I still do.

I used to like someone, I don't know about love. Never received much. Have much to give, but no one to accept it. I used to trust someone, but I learnt the hard way to never trust anyone, especially the ones close to you. And they don't want to associate themselves with me, in any way. My parents, grandparents, uncles, cousins, teachers, classmates... They are all ashamed to admit that they are involved with me somehow. They treat me like a lazy bastard when I'm the one who has poured more effort than anyone else. I'm the one who had to battle social isolation, mental instabilities, diabetes, traumas, a dysfunctional family, and still keeping an excellent academic performance despite being on a special schedule, which gives me a massive disadvantage. They invalidate my efforts because they fear I might surpass them someday. 

But once I admitted that I was essentially worthless, I was relieved. I'm an experiment gone wrong, an anomaly. I was never meant to be. I was never meant to be loved. And so, my desire for love subsided, and I don't cry myself to sleep anymore, wondering why no one likes me. I sleep in relative peace, hoping to never wake up. Wondering if anyone would care. I bet I could count people that cared with five fingers, maybe ten.

I also know that I'm dying faster than usual. I've got a rapidly deteriorating health, and my lifestyle accelerated my death. My eyes are failing, liver and kidneys are severly damaged, and another DKA might actually kill me. All I can say is, let it be. Que será, será.

I just stopped caring. And that made everything so much easier. Gave me peace. Let me sleep. No one cares for me. No one that matters, at least. Maybe some unknown strangers on the internet. But what importance do those interactions carry? It's not like the relationship will be longlasting. Couple of days, and they all go cold. As if they never existed.

If you are still reading, I want to thank you. I appreciate you for reading a dying 17 year old's rant/story. But just because I'm 17 doesn't mean I don't know anything. I've experienced a lot, traveled quite the bit too. Flew nearly 40 times in total, and went around the globe 6 times, distance wise. Seen my fair share of shit. Life threatening situations too. I don't need the ""you have a lot to live for"" speech, because I know I don't. I have 15 years at most on my clock. I've basically lived half my life, experienced twice as much as kids my age. Been through lots of tough shit too. I'm just tired of fighting at this point. I want to go wherever the current takes me to.

And it took me 12 years of carelessness with diabetes, 3 years of depression, 4 years of sleeplessness and a lifetime of social isolation to reach this conclusion. It's most probably biased. But it's the best I could do. Sorry if it's underwhelming and disappointing that it's basically a more complex ""world sucks, life sucks"", but so far, that's all I've seen, all I've felt.",16Jul2019,1

17,"So for about 3yrs during school I had a girl lead me on, now in those 3yrs we had great moments together I know 100% she loved me and I know 1000000% I loved the shit out of her, we always talked after school for hrs most times she loved it when I would complement her after school on what she was wearing that day I'd always do it when she would not wear makeup because I was entranced by her she was perfect in every way. at some point during those years she started making me bracelets out of something similar to yarn and I wore them everyday. I wore them for most of those years and now I wear them every now and again because it's hurts cause that's the only thing I have left other than the memories I have. Many nights I can't sleep because I lay in bed and all I can see when I close my eyes is her. Not being with her hurts the worst I have worked hard to keep myself up and not let the sadness ruin me but some days or when the right song comes on I crumble. At some point my parents found out that I had loved her after she finally told me we couldn't be together and I never had the guts to really them how I felt and how much it hurt so at any random time they would try and talk about her or she would come up in a random conversation they would have I would have to leave the room I couldn't take it I hurt to hear her name. I've never told them how much it affected me and I probably never will. She took something from me I can never get back, I'm cold and dead inside because of her and I don't know how to deal with it. I'm always angry anything can set me off and I don't even notice it when it happens. So now as of July 15th 2019 she is married and is pregnant with a man I hate, not because I know him but because he has the love of my life and I know that I will never have her. This is the second time I've ever told anyone this so I hope you can help me in anyway possible. In total it's been 4 to about 4yrs I've had this inside me everyday looming in my mind making me a person I'm not. I'll never forget her and will never stop loving her.

I'm low key over that now (it's been like what 1 month) and the girl I like started talking to me again, although there's this impassable distance between us for some fucking reason which I don't know. I really have given up all hope of us being together, and in trying to get on with my life without her. Problem is, I've been relying on her for emotional and mental support for a little bit more than 2 years now, and quite frankly her not talking to me has left me really fucking broken.

22,"Yesterday was not the best. Therapy appointment (that I admittedly didn't want to go to) ended up not happening because my therapist forgot to record our appointment over a month ago when I last saw her. Lots of conflicted feelings that were mostly centered around not feeling important enough. Then, two of my ""friends"" who have basically cut off communication with my roommate and I because they're busy and they feel bad about our situation decided that not talking to us was a better solution than just telling us what was going on. So again, felt unimportant enough to maintain even the most basic relationship. All this cued up a night full of nightmares that my pets were going to die because I failed to take care of them and someone killed them. 

Today, I haven't been in a good headspace at all so when I showed up to work a few minutes late, proceeded to get yelled at for spending too much company money that I'd gotten prior approval for and yelled at for a bunch of other things, I cracked. I retreated to the bathroom to cry silently as I ruminated over my past couple days and listened to everyone come in and out. I am exceedingly insignificant in the grand scheme of life and im really struggling today.

I have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and I feel like it's deteriorating my normal level of function. I have considered myself high-functioning for a long time. I've been in and out of therapy (currently out) for years, but it's never been helpful. 

Therapists have told me I seem very self-aware, but that I'm closed off. It's a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if it's negative. So this is really hard for me, to post like this. I'm hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.

24,"Your life matters, everything you’ve been through is for a reason, all that you are is here to serve a purpose.

You might not believe me, you may have no idea what your purpose is. You might want to argue against me but the fact is something greater than all of us created this world and the fact you are here, reading this, is not an accident.

I care that you’re hurting. I care that you’re in pain. I care that you don’t feel good about yourself. It matters to me.

Whatever you’re going through, I’m sorry. Whatever’s happening around you that’s causing you pain, I’m sorry. Whatever you’re struggling with, I’m sorry. 

You matter to me.",16Jul2019,9

26,"I have a literature review due in on Friday and I cannot do it. I'm completely paralysed and can't work. I've moved countries and can't find an appointment with a psychiatrist (I take ritalin) before the deadline. I feel like I'm drowning and if I don't hand this in on time, I'm going to be kicked out of my university. If anyone out there can help, I'd really like for you to reach out. I can't afford the essay writing services, I only have $100 to give. I know it's stupid to feel like you want to die over not being able to give in an assignment but I have so much riding on it and I just can't do it and I need this anxiety to be over.",16Jul2019,4
27,"I was depressed for the past 8 years. Not eating or sleeping. C student in highschool. Recently I have been working really hard on figuring out why I'm like this and how to fix it. Therapy has helped tremendously. And even though this summer has been a train wreck I can handle problems better. Problem is I feel bland still. I wanna do medicine but because of my abysmal fuck ups my science grades are Cs. Medicine requires a lot of sacrifice and mental strength. I'm worried I'm not cut out for it. My psychologist said I bounced back super fast from being so horribly depressed. I'm tired of working on myself. I have just been burying myself in other peoples problems this summer because I'm tired of mine. My therapist is on a leave of absence, dont know if I'm able to go back to school because I couldnt get a cosigner so I dont know when I can see my mentor/psychologist. I really dont know what to do with myself. I have no motivation to work on myself. Before it was life or death and also potentially losing my boyfriend. Now I have nothing to motivate me. I have no clue how to motive myself to where i actually make progress with my life. I'm worried about going back to chemistry class and only getting a C again. I feel stale. Big ick i cant get off my back. I think maybe because it's so manageable now. I kinda feel bored but also still too stressed to move forward. Anxiety hasnt really been dealt with yet and it just requires me to do shit I dont wanna do because I'm scared of it. Maybe I will go back to fixing myself once August comes. I'm tired of myself. If anyone has advice or any thoughts that be cool. No idea what I want out of this. I miss my mentor and therapist.",16Jul2019,1
28,"After hard work I'm finally settled in university, being functional and passing exams...but I feel rather insecure and so lowly.. When I was little I wouldn't imagine that now I haven't taken already my life. The hole inside myself is growing and nothing could stop it from devoiring all me",16Jul2019,1
