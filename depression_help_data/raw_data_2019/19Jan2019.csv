0,"The month of September I was feeling great! Working out I was at my lowest weight, once October came along I started eating bad again. Everything I do feels like a chore like I have to get it over with and lately I just want to be in bed watching tv or on YouTube. I don’t feel sad and I’m not a lazy person I’m so confused on what’s going on with me. I miss hanging out with my friends but I started gaining weight and I’m too embarrassed to go out for drinks. I want to but too shameful of my weight gain. 

Idk what’s going on I hate feeling sluggish but I’m having a hard time getting over the feeling. ",19Jan2019,1
1,"I’ve spent all my time alone my whole life emotionally and even though i know my parents love me, they love themselves a lot more since they’re narcissistic. I’ve had therapy since i was little but i believe you cant pay someone to care for you. I had an episode at school today i almost burst out crying in class but i managed to hold it. I feel like no one would really care if im gone, I literally have no friends no one to hang out with, and the few friends i have theyre 90% of the time busy or just straight up ignore me or live miles away. I dont know what to do anymore",19Jan2019,1
2,"i’ve been manic depressed since i was in middle school, i remember almost every other day having to leave class with a teared up face. that went on all through highschool, as well as a suicide attempt my freshman year. i graduated last may and since then it’s only gotten worse. i went to college for a few months but dropped out under the shear weight of the pressure. when i returned home my dad ended up moving out of state and i had to move in with a friend because i don’t have any other family that wanted to have me. i’ve been trying to move out but i’m from a small town and there isn’t too much available, especially since i can’t find any roommates. i used to have friends but after we all graduated they went off and now i feel quite alone. the friend i live with is great, and his family is too, but i can’t help but feel like a nuisance and a bum. i pay them rent each month but still. i’ve been considering another suicide attempt but i don’t want it to work out like the last one. i feel very lost, lonely, i’m barely average at my hobbies, and i’m in debt 10k for the college. i’m losing hope, especially since i don’t have anyone i can really turn to with these feelings i have.",19Jan2019,1

5,"Depression is a normal and common function for human beings, however the duration and depth is something that can grow out of control.

Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance.  It's place in the grieving process is the final step, before we let go and release the negative energy we are carrying.  The trouble is, there are many times we do not have any idea what it is that we need to let go.  We get stuck, cannot see a way out, do not even realize that there is an option.

I have dedicated my life to showing others how to identify the exact thing or set of things, that is keeping us stuck in Depression.  I am offering one free session and it is very possible it will be the only session you will ever need.  I want nothing from you but to see you feel better and if you decide to continue your progress, I will help you find support that matches your budget.

The session does require that you dedicate your time to the discussion and needs to take place in real time.  I am available on several platforms and we will find the one that suits our needs.

6,"My  depression is not a chemical imbalance. It's from constantly struggling with the basics in life, especially work and money and trusting the wrong people. 

Let's talk about work - I freelanced for a long time, decided to give it up years ago for more financial stability so started to look for full-time work. I tried every means possible - cold calls, applying to job listings, asking friends and acquaintances and contacts for help. I have been working for about 20 years now and even tried applying for entry level work. I sent out HUNDREDS of CVs and did not get a single job. I surive on maybe ONE freelance assignment per year now and I'm deep in debt (this means I cannot afford therapy - and the point here is that I DO know that I would feel much better when I have a job). 


I tried. I am not sitting on my ass not doing anything. But when this has been your life DESPITE trying your damned hardest, isn't this something to become even more depressed about? There's nothing else I haven't tried. It's not a ""be positive/ look on the brighter side/ mind over matter"" mentality thing at all. 

I'm at the end of the road here.",19Jan2019,1
7,"I have typed this, deleted, retyped and deleted a few times. I feel alone. I'm not alone but in an emotional sense I am. I feel lost but at the same time I know my core values and who I am. I'm just afraid of expressing myself because things always seem to turn out worse when I do. I wonder if it is just me, that I don't know how to talk or express myself in a clear way. 
I've struggled with this most of my life. I have abandonment issues and combat generalized anxiety often. I'm able to recognize my negative thinking and I do try to reframe and over come but some of the way I feel is based on how others treat me.
A few years ago things were going great. I had a great job and I wasn't struggling. My kids were old enough that I didn't have to worry about a sitter after school and the costs associated with it. I felt accomplished finally after years of struggling working doubles and barely being home with my kids. I ended up taking two younger family members whom I never met before after feeling pressured and guilt tripped into helping. It was just supposed to be for a weekend to prevent them from going into the system. This turns into a month. I grew attached to the youngest one who was under a year at that time. They eventually went back home; financially that month hurt me even though I was assured and promised that I would have support financially and physically from other family members (my mother being the main one and who pressured and guilted me into helping to begin with) . fast forward 2 months after they go back home and once again they were removed placed in foster care and the foster parents not being able to handle the eldest of the two. They were facing being split up. Once again my conscious and empathy was the deciding factor in taking them back in. I talked with my family expressed my concerns and how if I was to do this I needed help! Once again I was assured I would get it and it would be 4 months tops. Fast forward 3.5 years later... No help unless I begged and bribed them to do so. Had to pay them to help with child care and told their time was valuable and it wasn't their responsiblity. My brother making excuses for why he couldn't support his kids or why he didn't meet any of the requirements to get his kids back, the mother another long fucked up story itself. I ended up adopting the boys. But in the process I lost all of my family which in my head is pretty messed up considering one of the reasons i took them in was so they would still be with family!! It's been over 3 years my mother has not talked to me, i have missed out on my other family events to avoid drama, even my most beloved uncles memorial. I've found distractions to avoid these emotions but lately those are no longer working. My amendment issues are in full force. I'm pushing people away and not letting them in because they are just going to leave me anyway. And those that are already in I'm smothering because I'm afraid they are going to leave me to",19Jan2019,1
8,"Me (22F) and my partner (22M) are only a month away till our 2-year anniversary. He is a kindhearted person and the best thing that ever happened to me. I truly want our relationship to last but lately my mental illnesses have been getting in the way.

A bit backstory: I first showed signs of self-depreciation and did harm to my body at the age of 13. I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety when I was 16. I got treated with medication and therapy for a while, but then I stopped taking anti-depressants as I was being badly influenced by the side effects. 

It’s been a fluctuating ride for me and my pal Depression. But I have made peace with it and learned to stay on the bright side as much as I could.

However, in the recent 4 months, my mental health’s been getting a lot worse. I figure that it’s because I’ve been under a lot of stress lately: (1) I’m going through a very important examination that’ll determine my future career, (2) my best friends and my partner are all working or studying in different countries as I am and I feel so lonely for that, (3) I’m starting to respond with bad coping methods like relying on alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana; not getting out of bed for days; procrastinating; binging series; not eating enough and (4) I’m stressed out over stressing out! 

My partner has been trying his best to cheer me up even though we’re in a long distance relationship. He bought me self-care goodies and sent it to me, he put his personal matters on hold to listen to me talking and showing his comfort. He adjusted his schedule to make time zone diffence wouldn’t be a big deal. 

While I’m grateful for his being, I cannot help but letting my dilemma get in between us. The fear of abandonment and the guilt trips grew bigger and bigger. I felt like I was being a burden to him. I picked up even the faintest signs of him showing disinterest and blamed myself for making him bored, even when it was not his intention. I tormented myself. I know that negative thinking is destructive but the ugliest part is that I cannot shake it off. 

So I kinda pushed him away... I no longer talk about how my day went nor share my feelings. We fight more often. And I cry more often.

For example, 3.00 am today I woke up from a sleep paralysis (SP). Struggling back to sleep just to get another SP at 6.30. I should mention that I get SP quite often, but this one was pretty intense. I reached out to him (it’s 12.30pm in his zone) and said that I just wanted to call him and feel his presence, that I didn’t need him to pause whatever he was doing to talk to me. 

So we did and the call was okay for the first few minutes. He was just casually working on his paper, while I was having an anxiety attack. I bursted into tears and he asked what happened. I was frustrated and could barely talk as I felt like I was choking from the mental breakdown. So I said ‘nevermind’ and hung up on him. 

So we started fighting. The problem is, whenever I fight with anybody, I have the tendency to push them away, retreat, cry my eyes out, refresh and apologize. Meanwhile, my partner is more ... confrontational. Don’t take this the wrong way, he would never abuse me verbally nor physically. But his way of dealing with the person he is having a problem with is to talk until a solution is proposed. He would call me over and over again and I would turn off my phone to stay isolated, which only get on his nerves more quickly.

While I know I’m more to blame in such situations, boy do I wish, for ONCE, he would let me have my time to “digest”. When I have an episode I normally cry for hours without the capability of restraining myself. It is something that I feel disgusted of. I do not love that trait one bit. Then everytime we fight, it always ends up with me feeling more depressed because he just HAD to communicate with me during my breakdown hours and I do not like that. I don’t want him to see me fight back with my reasons while ugly crying lol. I surely don’t want him to think that I have to bring up my mental illnesses to have a leverage on him.

In short, I hope that I could get some advice from someone to improve myself, even if you’re just basically telling me that “it’ll be okay”. I want to avoid this trail of self-destructive thoughts. And that I do hope to find someone with the same experience to share their feelings with me and how you overcome it. 

Thanks guys, it felt really good to let this off my chest.

9,"Title kinda says it all.

I think most of my life I’ve been insecure about my physical appearance, but I always felt I was intelligent and still had potential.

Over the last couple years - and especially the last couple months - I’ve felt like just the worst person in the world in all aspects of my life. I’ve become very panicked about my future because I feel like I don’t have one, and all I want to do is sleep.

I’ve spoken to a friend about a lot of this stuff and he’s provided me with plenty of good suggestions (I.e therapy, excercise, meditation) but I can’t build up the motivation to do any of it. Some of these things make me extremely anxious to start and I just feel like I’m making excuses and complaining all the time. 
At this point I feel like I don’t care enough to get better and I don’t know how to find that motivation.

TLDR; I’ve been feeling sad and panicked about my life and although I know ways to fix things, I can’t seem to bring myself to implement them",19Jan2019,1
10,"I've self-diagnosed myself with depression (or just general mental illness) since I was probably 13 (I'm nearly 20 now). The thing is, every time I get within sight distance of any form of help, I just tell myself that I'm being dramatic and I'm fine. My pediatrician would give depression screenings at annual check ups and I would always lie. I went to the counseling center at my school last semester and I lied to her, too. I don't know why. I went because I have a lot of sleeping problems (issues falling asleep and recurring sleep paralysis). I also said that I'd been feeling really anxious (I'd recently broke down in the middle of rugby practice because I was feeling so overwhelmed, and I'm known by my friends back home as literally never crying). But when she asked other questions (do you have depression, do you have an eating disorder) I just lied (i dont have an eating disorder but i have body image issues and will once every year or two stop eating more than a couple hundred calories a day for a few weeks, ever since i was 13). 

I was supposed to make a follow up appointment, but I was just like ""I'm fine this is dumb you don't need this"" and didn't (a few weeks later started feeling badly and stopped doing anything except for school and work, but I'm feeling better the past couple weeks). 

Since I was a kid, we always had really crappy health insurance, but a few months ago, my family got, like, /real/ health insurance, so I can't even use that as an excuse anymore. 2 of my friends have told me to see a therapist in the past couple days. I know they're probably right but I just feel like I'm overreacting and I have no idea how I'd talk to my parents about this (it's their insurance). Any advice? ",19Jan2019,1
11,"I'm a 30yo mom of two 5&amp;9. My husband and I both have mental illness and it makes me sick worrying about how they are growing up.

14,"Several years ago I was diagnosed with depression. I was prescribed escitalopram. I had been taking it for several years. I thought I had been feeling a lot better and had been asking my primary care doctor to slowly reduce the dose of the medication so I could eventually get off it. I was taking a really low dose for a while and everything was good. But well 3-4 months ago. I lost my insurance and I could no longer see my doctor. So I could no longer get the medication. I have been off the depression medication for 3-4 months. But just recently. Maybe for one month. Things have been hitting me full force. Every single day I feel a sense of dread, depression, and anxiety. I break down crying everyday. Things from my past almost 2 years ago are really impacting me right now. Killing me inside. Things out of my control impact me deeply as well.

Could this all be because I stopped taking the medication? Is my body just adjusting without it? Or should I try and go back on the medication? Thanks",19Jan2019,1
15,"A little rundown of recent events.
I got to a place where I couldn’t stop crying to the point I’d be wailing while also having a panic attack, I didn’t want anyone to touch me, I was always so annoyed and on edge and it even got to a point of psychosis where I was hearing voices. I was pushing people away because of this. 
I saw my doctor yesterday and I told her everything, especially the voices and ketamine treatment. While she didn’t agree or disagree with the KT, we decided that I should go to Lamictal 2x daily instead of 3 or completely wean off in sessions of three weeks if I don’t feel better. She also suggested that my quality of life, which is currently very poor, is more important than my tremors and even though she understand the feeling of failure that I’m having of not being able to get off my clonazepam that going back to taking my .5mg twice a day is more important because I will have more control over my body/speech again and it should help with my anxiety a little. She also prescribed me Hydroxyzine for immediate relief for anxiety and panic attacks, she wanted to do Ativan or Xanax but I’m already on a benzodiazepine so we will do this first, if it doesn’t help we will look into the other two. I also got a cheek swab for genetic testing on what medications my body will metabolize better to isolate medications that, genetically, are more fit for me. If insurance doesn’t pay for it, they will email me with the $$ based on income and I can decide if I want to pay for it or not, if I can’t they with charge me. 
I got a hair cut, eyelash extensions done so I’m feeling good. 
I’m going to go to therapy next month at some point after payday and just pay the $175 for the assessment and be over the grief of money. 

I’m trying really hard to not feel like a failure for not being able to get off my clonazepam but I don’t want kids biologically at all with the combination of my mental and physical health. 

Has anyone taken any Hydroxyzine for anxiety? ",19Jan2019,1
16,"Hey guys, new account, like to stay anonymous. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I started seeing a girl. I spent a lot of time calling with her and we really fell in love. We are currently in a (now one week) relationship and we both love eachother a lot. However. I stopped enjoying anything else in my life. I feel really down when I can not see or speak with my girlfriend and I feel like she is the only thing I can enjoy anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 17 years old and since I am still in school it is really hard for us to see eachother multiple times a week. This would not really be a problem, but since being with her is the only thing that makes me happy nowadays I am actually feeling really depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried improving things. But it is really hard. I stopped gaming and truely don't enjoy it anymore. The only thing that kind of makes me happy is going to the gym.

Does anyone have advice? How can I enjoy the things I used to enjoy? Is this just a phase of being in love? ",19Jan2019,1
17,"I've always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say I'm going to kill myself every once in awhile. I've always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, I'm 23 now, I'm on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. 

However, that doesn't stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself it'd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I don't have any dependents, I've pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because that's how much no one matters to me.

A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I don't feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. 

I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and that's it. Imagine playing a game that's in the first person. That's my life, I just see stuff, I don't feel anything. 

Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. 

This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, I'm not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and she's kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. 

I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me. 

I only see two options: Kill myself or live in the prison that life is.",19Jan2019,1
18,"I've been on and off anti-depressants for more than 20 years and I've never been diagnosed with bipolar. I've seen psychiatrists and they've never suggested it. I've been diagnosed with depression and dysthymia. I don't have grandiose manic episodes but I do seem to have moments where I spend excessively and get a thrill out of it. But I'm beginning to wonder if because my moods are constantly up and down. Or is this just part of depression?

For people who have bipolar II, can you describe your symptoms? What does a manic episode look like for you?
