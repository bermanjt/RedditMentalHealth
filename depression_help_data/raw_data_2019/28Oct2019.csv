0," I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for many years, and was recently diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. For weeks, I've been used to self-medicating on sugar and video games to deal with the sadness. Now, I actually want to let those unpleasant feelings go, but even though I feel like crying, I can't get any tears to come out. It's like my mind's build some sort of barrier that's been built over the years of hiding it with addictive behaviors. 

What should I do? Should I make myself cry, or should I let it happen naturally? I feel like I've been holding onto this pain for a long time, and I want to finally get it out of me. On the other hand, I don't want it to take so long that I'll just get distracted with something that'll make me bury those emotions again.",28Oct2019,1

2,"I don’t know why I’m typing here.  I guess I just have no other way to get my words out.  I feel like I’m stuck in this black hole.  
Been crying for the past hour and just feel so helpless.  

I’m not close to my family because of toxic environment but that’s left me to be alone.  I have some friends but all are in serious committed relationships so I don’t bother them because I know I’m a lot. 

I’ve tried to improve myself for the past 5 years.  I’ve gotten a better job.  I live on my own.  I have a dog. But I feel like such a waste of space.  I feel like I’m useless because no one needs me.  I’m not sure how to change that mindset because it’s something that’s played on repeat for most of my life.  

I’m just tired of being a waste of space.",28Oct2019,3

4,"Hi I have depression/anxiety and it's just bad as always and I just had a non weight bearing surgery last week and it has mad it even worse.  I do online school  and recently been thinking about not doing it anymore because I dont see the point in working so hard for something I dont even want I don't know what my plans are for the future I think about not even wanting a future, so it's very hard for me.  My parents dont care if I just stop school because my dad thinks that some of the thing they teach you is kinda pointless and my mom thinks it a waist of childhood she said if school is not worth stressing over and just being homeschooled I have learned a lot, like my dad owns his own restaurant and he teaches me so many thing about running a business etc. They said if I stop they will help me with my GED I mean I know how to read, write, spell, do math, etc. Like any jobs I'm interested  in all take four years of college and Idk if I can go to college if i dont do public school.  I'm just lost and idk what to do anymore I'm so stressed out and just  physically/emotionally exhausted.  Right now I just dont see a future 




Sorry none of this makes sense I just dont know what to do.",28Oct2019,1
5,"I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I don't really have a 'routine' which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult.  Sometimes I'll have a fleeting moment that I've forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if it's not important.  I don't really know how to explain it.  Deep down I know how important it is that I take them, but something stops me from caring.  Thus starting the cycle of being chemically imbalanced and feeling 'unworthy' of being mentally well. I essentially need to ingrain it into a routine somehow so I just don't think about it and just take them.  

Long story short, I'm just seeking some tips with building a healthy routine so I can make this work.  There's plenty of advice out there for people who work the 9 to 5 grind, but I'm struggling to get some decent advice for someone who sometimes works nights, sometimes works days, weekends etc.  I've tried using phone apps, but they're mostly catered to 9-5 workers.",28Oct2019,5
6,"Hi, 

I need help. I don't know what's going on but I cant stop crying. I've been depressed for a few years at this point but it's gotten worse and worse. I find myself crying almost everyday and it usually stems from extreme loneliness and insecurities. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I often feel like I'm a very extroverted person living in an isolated bubble. I feel overwhelmed from a very rigorous medical school program and I feel so much guilt. I come from a religious (christian- extremely conservative) family but I am secretly not religious myself and I feel enormous guilt for it. I feel horrible for hiding so much from them. I'm a 24 year old girl in a stable long term relationship with a boy I love but I can't even share it with my family because I would be disowned due to the cultural and religious differences. I've tried talking to them but they threatened me when I tried. I'm keeping things a secret because I need my family's support in a financial sense as I would be homeless and broke without them. The feeling of being so reliant on them makes me feel guilty and useless. So many people my age can provide for themselves but I couldn't get a well-paying job with my major and the only way to a decent salary is through school. I still have 3.5 years left and I'm not doing well. I was always a good student but my depression has put in this dark unmotivated hole that I can't get out of and it's affecting my grades and I'm terrified I wont even pass. I need help. I just want to be myself again. I feel constant impending doom and I feel like my life is falling apart with every waking second. I've been through a lot physically and mentally and it seems like life just isn't giving me a break. I just don't know how to fix myself. Any advice would be helpful.",28Oct2019,1
7,I see no reason to keep going. The pain inside of me is too much to bear. The loneliness of my life is pathetic and sad. I am a pathetic and sad individual. I’m going to die alone if I don’t do something about my living now. No one understands me and I receive no empathy from friends,28Oct2019,1
8,"Things were fine when I was younger, under let's say the age of 10 years old. Once I hit the double digits, it's like things just slowly eroded into a hellhole. I'm now 14, turning 15 in just a few days here. I live in what could be considered to be a hostile household. My parents now just complain, drink, fight, repeat. But this year, though, they have been fighting more than they ever have in my life. My mom goes off on my father constantly, accusing him of this and that. It went from maybe once or twice a year to an everyday thing. I've always loved my father. He's the most laid back, chill, and overall awesome dad I could possibly have. Me and him always get along, if we ever have a disagreement then we talk it out. My mom, though, she's a different story. I've never gotten along with her, even when I was younger. She doesn't make sense to me, and I can never put myself in her shoes. With every small thing she resorts to anger and yelling. 

With my parents fighting, I have developed depression that I feel is only gradually worsening. But not long ago, I overheard them talking about divorcing. They were surprisingly calm at first, but my mother began screaming, throwing things, shouting accusations, and stormed away. The walls here are extremely thin, and there's likely no insulation either. Because of that, it's like they feel like they could yell at each other as much as they want and me and my twin brother would never hear them. Ever since that incident, I've been shaky, and just lost in thought. I almost just don't know what to think anymore.

This situation is really weird to me because I've been thinking about how much I just wanted them to divorce so that I wouldn't have to hear them fight anymore. I just want peace and quiet. I just want to live with a happy family. I've felt as if if they were to actually divorce, I would be happy. But now I don't know how to feel. It's like I want to be happy, but then thoughts pop up like, ""How much money will be spent during this process?"" Because we're already practically poor, and, ""How will this affect the rest of my life?"" It's just hard to know what to do right now. I don't feel like moving. I don't feel like going to school anymore. I just feel like laying here, and I don't know why.

More than anything I think I just want some advice, some words of encouragement or something. I'm really confused right now. I apologize for the essay, I just felt like I needed to rant.",28Oct2019,8
9,"I’m 23 years old, currently studying to become a counsellor. 
This year has by far been the worst year of my life. I’m experienced so much rejection this year by just being myself. It feels like my lecturers (who are all psychologists) are trying to force me into a box and by not doing what they want to, they are being so horrible towards me. I found myself in a dark hole, self harming and feeling worthless. 
I only had one lecturer that challenged me and liked me for me and he committed suicide the other day. 

Now I wonder, is there any place in this world for people like me? People who are a bit weird or different?
It feels like the world will always reject us.",28Oct2019,1
10,"i’m a teen expat, forced to move across the globe by my parents and after 13 months here things don’t seem to be getting better. i don’t know what to do anymore. i no longer have the motivation to do homeschool work to get my qualifications, been on several different meds after my attempt and therapy doesn’t help. i’ve tried exercising but i still feel like this. i’m so lonely i just want to fade away.",28Oct2019,1
11,"Sadness and anger are extremely pleasant emotions to me. I listen to [music like that](https://youtu.be/_AbC-OWaURs) all day, every day. I've felt like this for longer than my illness. Coincidentally, I started listening to Hollywood Undead right before my illness, and I think it stressed me out, but I loved every minute of it.

People tell me they feel bad, even physical pain, due to sadness, but I think they're describing depression and anxiety. Most people don't know what they're talking about, when they talk about feelings. They use the wrong words.

I don't know if this is okay. Can I let it continue? I feel good, so it has to be good. It's not a drug, it's not an addiction, it's just a feeling I like. I don't like what people call happiness, but maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. I've never felt good about positivity, because those people are foolish to me.

Is there anything I can do knowing this?",28Oct2019,1
12,"I've been struggling with life recently, and I guess this is just my way of venting. I'm not too sure what I'm going to do, but I've been struggling with my sexuality (still am but this isn't what I'm too sad about). Then to top it all off my friend group of 3 years has been getting sick of each other and splitting up. About 2 weeks ago a couple of words just broke me, I ended up going home 'sick'. Then that night I decided to cut myself, multiple times. I actually kinda enjoyed it and want to do it again, just not to my wrist, maybe my leg where no one can see? Then today I was told straight to my face that I wasn't liked, and I've gotten to the point where I'm kinda used to this. Now I've just got to survive the rest of the year with no friends and constant thoughts of abusing myself, I don't really want to kill myself because I don't want to put that on my family. So I've just kinda wanted to cut myself, I haven't done it since that night as I'm waiting for them to heal. But I think I might actually start cutting the top of my leg where I can do it repeatedly and not get caught. But yeah, I just don't know what to do.",28Oct2019,1
13,"Recently I posted about my fiancé and we were taking a break. I was told things by someone who liked me and I was hurt so I was easily manipulated. And I was made to believe she was seeing another guy. I was just so heartbroken. I was showed pictures of them. But they were just friends. I'm trying to beg her for a chance, to show her I'm worth it. She said she wants to drop it all because of Ellie (the one who did it). And I'm just so hurt. She posts pictures of her and Jacob (the dude she was friends with) so she can hurt me. I sent her a message and she opened it. But hasn't responded yet but I don't want to spam her and her get annoyed, the pain physically hurts. It's so bad. God I want to end this all. End the suffering.",28Oct2019,2
14,"I’m really struggling and need some support right now.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I’m constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

It’s really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",28Oct2019,48

20,"I am undecided on if I'm going to cider fest. Honestly not sure if anything is worthwhile, I have no real plans for the future and every time i socialize outside of work i end up doing something i regret and overthinking it for hours  preventing myself from sleeping. I think  I will go, I already have tickets plane and hotel  organized and have for 2 months. I have decided to see how ciderfest goes and maybe die there, after I get the company life insurance tomorrow. But if I do decide to die I'll come home to wipe the hdds and burn all the things I want to not be associated with me, some final lies to portray  myself in the best light. Never worked before but hopefully  I  have kept enough secrets to hide most of what I want to. My parents never even suspected i drank in high school or had sex or was bi ish back then. As far as bi ish goes I'm still not sure and don't think I ever will be. Some times for months I'll be gay or for months  I'll be straight or both or be switching between  only one or the other. Maybe I should start  therapy I have thought  about it for years but have never  done it. I don't really  know why I do anything  anymore I have never made many plans and been impulsive but I'm starting to see how adverse that has been even  when I was on adderall I was still impulsive just more focused on single task at a time. I am wondering if the main benefit  of therapy is just unloading  and talking  about everything  and looking closer at the problems similar  to journaling. Now I also wonder if that is just another thought to avoid therapy. It probably  is because  I might think more about what I have written  but I never go back to re read this disorganized mess. Plus therapy allows the outside perspective to hopefully  help. These so called  experts have never diagnosed me with anything  beyond  ADHD despite the fact that I first thought  about suicide  in elementary school or first wanted my parents to get a divorce  when I was 8. What kind of perfectly same person would have those thoughts? Wow its almost  5:30 now and I work tomorrow, recently I've been staying up too late like this pretending I'll sleep until 2 and knowing that I'll wake up around 10-12 from sunlight it feels like I don't want to succeed and somehow I always screw up everything I try to start to fix some of the  problems  I have or set up long term  success  like dropping out of college, my sporadic journaling, not starting  journaling for years and years, never pursuing  the navy after college, not moving out, isolating myself to  minimize  my own embarrassment and attempt to sever all ties to minimize the emotional damage  if I do kill myself (I now see that will never fully  happen my family cares to much). Or smaller thing like never cleaning my room, making my bed, or meditating for 10 minutes for the minuscule  confidence boost that just consistently handling small problems should give me hoeing to develop that into a better lifestyle but never managing any of it. Now to attempt to sleep and despite knowing many thing to change to help myself I'll never end up fixing any of the thousands of things i know of, let alone all the things I dont. Well I still want to die but now I'm more unsure of what I will do before even those plans and being questioned until I dont want to and I become a passive observer in my own story. I feel like I'm just a npc reacting with pre programmed responses and barely  able  to handle anything outside what is expected. Now there is no way I'm going to sleep soon I might  call in sick for the first time at the casino. I dont have any aspirations I haven't dated in almost a year in the last month I've only gone out to socialize twice i barely keep connections with anyone. If I dont regularly interact everyone falls  out of my life no matter how good of a friend they were and most family members. I haven't  really kept  any connections with anyone  for more then a month after not physically seeing them despite being  my best friend for years only talking and visiting when they reached out.

Almost 6 now and my demons are shifting again to maximize misery. Now I tell people I'm listening to classic rock or pop but now I only listen to and songs despite knowing that doesn't help at all, I'm starting to lose interest in video games and no longer wish to watch YouTube despite having regularly doing both in some for for as long as I can remember even in pre school there were games I enjoyed more than the other kids or just browsing the internet mindlessly knowing that it's the largest collection of human knowledge and trying to master its use. And now even these are losing interest to me, without friends playing video games I don't think I would anymore but for the most part its one of the only places I get any real social interaction beyond the casino's business and what I get there is a lot less than most others at table games become most people can talk to customers for more than an hour if the customer stays at a table, selling sportsbets never last for more than 5 minutes  and the few that last that long mostly are just about the sale. I'm so alone and become of how many social skills I am lacking I find it hard to gain enough  experience or time to develop new social skills so I fear the rest of my life will be equally isolated. There is no real solution not even  suicide is good enough despite being encouraged as one of the smartest my life makes me feel so stupid  about how much I can't figure out about anything.

One of the worst things is that many times while contemplating suicide I think that it is to easy of a solution and that I deserve to endure the pain until I die, so I just passively wait for death not ever improving anything like how my dad just drinks to forget his problems and never fixed anything or how both of my parents never really  do anything  outside of work and house chores. I think I might be finally opening to this journal like this because I know that if I do die no one will read this everything is set up so as far as online accounts go access to everything is wiped If I choose and between dBan nuke and blow torching the ssd, flash drives phones and tablet memory chip and burning all my journals and papers that I haven destroyed yet I should be able to wipe the vast majority of myself away beyond what is already lost to time, and if I take the time to selectively request and get everything I can removed from internet searches and the websites they find with my name attached I should vanish from history within 100 years. no second life until the name is forgotten for me.

Wow 6:20 now, anyway recently I have been fantasizing about faking amnesia or just getting transported to when I was young to not fix everything just something's, for the amnesia I know I could never pull it off as a lie and despite being well versed enough in physics to know 7 different  ways to theoretically travel in time all are far beyond what I believe humanity could do in 1000 years if everyone started collaborating on it and only focused on that goal, and it's my suspicion that traveling backwards in time is impossible, even with wormholes  it's only possible after the wormholes are first created so I can never really fix a lot of the mistakes I make. I only get one life and have to make the most of it but I never do, not only is maximize life much to ambiguous a goal but I just keep thinking and never really do anything positive even now typing away to avoid any real change. Well just writing this has been a rollercoaster or maybe this is the normal dynamic  of emotions I feel so disconnected I can even tell that anymore.

6:33 am. I am really felling tired now and I still want to stay up later but if I do and call in sick tomorrow I'll feel guilty, I have 5 days off in 2 days from now that its after midnight. If I go to work tomorrow at this point I'll do more things I regret and despite being the most stressful job I have ever had I have also enjoyed it more than any other job and it pays better, honestly most of the stress is from worrying over mistakes because I want to keep this job. Despite likening this most of my family is giving me pressure to go to college or the military just something that is a better use of my mind.I did get a very high score on the asvab so out of a few hundred thousand or million Americans I am in the top # percent for intelligence but using my intellect has rarely brought the same joy that talking with my co workers and rarely customers brings me. Sure I can figure out how to solve the software of 4d rubik's cube alone or enough to find a flaw in every security system I have tested myself against but it's always been alone and in my intellectual pursuits every one I have found is way beyond myself or can't keep  pace in conversation about whatever our interests is at that time or even more rare they can keep an even pace but when the third option happens their social skills and general abilities are so far beyond mine in other area I isolate myself from them so they can find someone more worth their time than I am. after that they never really come back. So far there has been the only exception he has been outpacing me in code and security (I have lost interest in such things a while ago but still) but he has reconnected with me multiple times and convinced me to get my current job at the casino, when I first meet him though we were pretty close in technical ability and knowledge of computers but he was more socially adept and for whatever reason brought me along sometimes, helped me for a few years but now I wonder why he tries.6:58 am. Sun should rise soon so I should sleep soon or I won't at all, but just by writing that I know I won't. Maybe journaling is helping I dont know if I more sleep deprived than suicidal but I might be better now but I know just realizing this fact will also mean I won't be doing it again soon. Why can't I just get help. Well at least for drugs I have been against their overuse in America especially because for things like depression psychology can't fully explain let alone how antidepressants ""fix it"" or maybe I have never really trusted authority figures because as a kid I would find better solutions and be told off because I was too young now I lack the motivation to do anything unless someone gives me the problem, I have a lot other problems with authority but my minds racing way faster than I can type.

been doing so research to have everything worked out just in case, so i am on the organ doner list and if I do decide to die ill first make a ice bath and call 911 right before i die and have in my last request to be either fully donated to science or cremated if the donations are full I dont even know why i continue to write this",28Oct2019,1

30,"  A short(ish) guide on showering. I have marked this post as not safe for work because I talk about my ass a lot. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read.

Ah yes, personal hygiene, the bane and all consuming nightmare for anyone who cannot bring themselves out of bed. We as people try to bribe ourselves, if you get up and have a shower then you will feel better, but that bed is so comfortable, and its not like you’re going anywhere, why should you have to shower? The biggest reason I can think of is because its very very very simple. 

Because it makes YOU feel better.

We still get up to pee, what’s so hard about having a shower? Well when I say ""everything"" people usually laugh. The idea of taking off the pyjamas you haven’t washed or changed in give or take a week is like peeling back the layers of your failure onion, looking at your matted crusty greasy hair is like looking straight into your birdnest of shame. Trying to even attempt to trim the hair on your face, or armpits, or where have you feels like you’re battling a particularly stinky yeti that tells you that you suck. Noticing you still have mascara goop in your eye from that one day you put in effort is like a glaring unhygienic reminder of how completely worthless you feel. You feel vulnerable, naked, figuratively and literally. 

And then there’s the smell, as someone who has gone for weeks without showering I can tell you that the human body is not a garden, it’s a waste disposal centre of epic proportions. You smell from everywhere, and your butt cheeks feel like they’re kind of glued to each other. And when you finally get to that point where you are ready to turn on the shower and you step under, it’s like you’re a snake, shedding your own skin. And the water washing off you is definitely not the right colour. So why the gruesome picture you may ask? Because it’s a reality for so many people, and it perfectly illustrates why depression isn’t a simple quick fix, it’s a years long battle. The idea of your ass smelling and your sheets having a skin imprint on them is so completely unpleasant, even to me as someone who has been there. it perfectly illustrates just how strong the hold is on people who are fundamentally good people. How strong the shackles on our minds can be. 

So what about this guide, you’ve personally illustrated very well what its like to not shower, how can I get to showering? The answer is hard to do in the real world but its so simple to write down: do the minimal effort and get the maximal pay off. You start small, ridiculously small. Pick a body part, even if its washing your hands after you pee instead of walking to your fridge and then crashing back into bed. If that’s too much then trim your finger nails, hell, trim one finger nail,. Every single goddamn day. When that doesn’t feel like a gargantuan task of epic proportions that makes you want to cry at the thought of it, then add a finger nail, or fuck, do one and a half if two feels too much. I started, by washing my genitals. For smell related reasons, obviously. I didn’t shave, I didn’t do anything fancy, just some ph neutral soap and a bidet, that’s all, the main reason I did this was because I went to the bathroom every day and that involved putting my pants down, it seemed like an easy place to start. And I did it, for about a week, and then I stopped doing it for a day and it made me cry because look at you, you layered dirty onion of shame and disgust why cant you even wash your own ass, what are you? A fucking baby, cant even do that one fucking thing, you piece of shit. 

That’s what happens, and I’m sure it might happen to you, and you’ll crash into bed and resume whatever you were mindlessly watching as you hope your over rested, creaky, aching body will just fall asleep again even though you slept for 16 hours. It will happen, and my advice is:

Tell yourself to that what you didnt do is okay. Dont excuse yourself, but realise that failure is not a curse word, its a reality of life. That’s how depression is combatted and it is a fight, but instead of you murdering the crazy 88s like the badass you are, you’re in a room with yourself, no lucy liu, no gogo. Just you and your head. And instead of a hanzo sword you have to fight your own brain that is biologically programmed to tell you you’re a piece of shit. And its hard, its hard to fight that voice in your head. But you know what wasnt hard for me? washing my ass, I made it as easy as i could for myself, and after that one time i kept doing it, because i told myself that it was okay to fail, to strive to be better.

I know the follow up is “I’m so depressed I don’t even care if I smell, I don’t care if people see me like this, I don’t care if I die from ass stank induced shock”. I’ve been there myself. And these depression guides seem to gloss over the fact that even the simple act of caring can seem like an impossibility. Here’s what I found out: caring as a depressed person isn’t there, it has to be created. A lot of the times people will ask a depressed individual to choose something they care about and then “do it for them” comes out. But it doesn’t work like that. You have to do it, and the caring will come later. You have to in a sense rewire your brain. I don’t wash my ass because I love my parents and don’t want them to be disappointed. I wash my ass because I like my ass to be clean, and smell decent, I didn’t care what it smelled like when I started, but I started caring because when I went to pee, I wasn’t greeted by a horrible smell and a constant reminder of my failure as a human being, because hey you know what brain, its okay, I cleaned my ass, and even though I did nothing else, I still cleaned my ass and that’s more than I did before. And I can say I am proud of it.

Consider for a moment that your brain, or rather the imbalance within them are trying to make you do all these things you don’t really like, and on top of that this imbalance is also making you not care about the inability of doing these things. That’s the part you have to say fuck you to.

Wash your ass, start with something small (or in my case big, get it, I’m saying my ass is big haha, I’m so funny). And the caring will come, and after the ass, you can move on to washing your hair, or brushing your teeth, or even just trimming a fingernail, or drinking one single cup of water, the caring will come later. And when you do wash your ass, be nice to yourself. 

Here I will help you, for when you have done the one hygienic thing:

An achievement to ….:

Hereby I wish to say that …………………………. Partook in an act of personal hygiene, an achievement that should not be overlooked, a wondrous day for mankind. She or he took the time to perform this task, even though it probably sucked and no one is more proud of her or him than I. It is with great pride and pleasure that I say that this act of personal hygiene is something we collectively, as a society should be proud of and no one should be more proud than the person reading this, who took the time to perform this task.

That probably came off as sarcastic and petulant, but the message is there, Don’t punish yourself for doing something, that in my experience is the best way to break your cycle. Because its so easy to go “yeah you did one thing, but look at all these other things you suck at, look at this bed, look at this house, why is the pizza box moving, because of you, asshole”. You have to stop it. I’m not saying you need to build a parade every time you wash your hair, but you also shouldn’t be tearing yourself down for it, you did something that feels so big and so difficult that you cant do it every day, and that is an achievement.

Take the time to feel pride for your smallest accomplishments, allow yourself to feel okay about something. And even if you cant bring yourself to say good job to you, be neutral. Its okay to just say okay and try again. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it was way more ass talk than I intended and isnt exactly short, but I hope it got my point across. I hope you have an okay day.",28Oct2019,140

I don't know what to do its worsening day after day I'm so tired",28Oct2019,2

Why do I feel they need to be sad even though I don’t really feel much anymore? Am I actually sad? or have I become too numb for to long to actually know or remember what it feels like to be able to feel. Maybe this self destruction is an attempt to find those feelings again because when things go wrong in someone’s life there supposed to feel something right? Or maybe I’m so used to this idea of having things go wrong in my life that I have become comfortable staying in that mindset. Or is it because I’m scared that if I try to fix things for the better I’ll end up giving my hopes up yet again for when the next bad thing occurs. I realize in life that things don’t always go your way but what’s the point to life if the majority of that time is suffering rather than happiness. People may say that the joy you get in life outweighs the suffering but that idea is starting to feel foreign to me. What is happiness? What is sadness? I’m stuck in the middle of this spectrum where it’s no longer negative or positive and I don’t know how to escape. It’s come to the point where I would rather end up on the negative side of the spectrum just so I can feel something. Am I really a live if I’m stuck in the middle of this spectrum unable to experience basic human emotions that we all are supposed to be born with. I never truly understood why people used drugs as an outlet to escape their problems because on the outside looking in it just exacerbates the issue. However, when you haven’t felt anything in a while it seems like it’s the only option to escape that feeling of nothingness. It’s weird because you hear a lot of people using drugs to numb the pain however, I’m using it to feel rather than numbing. Or maybe the pain that there numbing is the pain of being numb? The pain of going through the motions everyday without feeling connected to anything. Or is this feeling of numbness actually a product of feeling something but it’s just been created as an illusion overtime to further feed my hunger for self destruction, pity and suffering? I guess the big questioned left unanswered is am I actually numb or is it all just an illusion?",28Oct2019,1
34,"Alright first post here we go. So first thing, I know that title might sound weird but hear me out: I’ve never seen actual depression in my life so I don’t really know what it looks or sounds like. But lately I’ve just been feeling different. I’ve been getting thoughts about just giving up on life (some suicidal but very little) and just working at an entry level job for the rest of my life. I’ve wanted to be a Veterinarian for as long as I can remember, but I’ve had no work ethic or drive lately. I’ve just been sitting in my room, struggling to do homework (writing this post with homework right in front of me) and overall just in a sad mood. All of the things I used to have a blast doing, like playing Xbox with my friends or drawing, just seem like so much work and I’ve just been so bored or something (i don’t really know)

I’m scared to ask any of my friends or peers because I’m a scrawny white boy early in to teenage years and I don’t wanna be labeled as a “attention seeking insensitive jerk” or whatever and told “you don’t even know what depression is!”. All I want is to know if I need to get help, cause that part I can deal with. If I’m being too vague, I can be more specific about how I’ve been feeling or my recent activities or whatever. Thanks for any feedback or support, it means a lot.",28Oct2019,1
