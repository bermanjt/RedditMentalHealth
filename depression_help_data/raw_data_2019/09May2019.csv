He texted me an hour later, was completely understanding, and said I should call if I needed to talk. 

He said “pay me by taking care of yourself tonight.”

2,"I keep trying so hard...but no matter what I do I continue to fail.
The past 6 days have been some of the worst days of my life....

I had to have my 17 year old dog put to sleep, my BF got hurt at work, and on Monday morning I hit a deer and caused over 2k in damages to our only car. Now I've missed 2 days of work at my new job, and I'm probably going to get fired.
(I have no way there, and can't afford a taxi/Uber daily. And don't know anyone to give me a ride)
Thankfully my BF is okay, and he is really trying to be supportive, but I feel myself pushing him away cause I don't want to drag him down any more than I feel I already have.

I don't want to eat or do anything besides just stare at my phone...I want to just sleep forever, but I can barely sleep at all because I'm constantly in pain from a previous back injury. 

I feel empty and overwhelmed...I don't know if anyone here cares. Maybe I'm just shouting into the void. I'm sorry for complaining. I just didn't know what else to do.",09May2019,1
3,"I'm sick. And not in a *cough cough* ""I have a cold."" kind of sick but ""I'm dying."" kind of sick. As weird as it is to say, having been passively suicidal for the past 20 years, I'm disappointed. Not necessarily that I'm dying, but because it's preventable? I guess I'd want my death to have more meaning. My life expectancy as a 25 year old is limited to about the next five years. 

I spent my childhood being abused and harassed for being ""fat."" When the depression kicked in, I distinctly being about 4/5 and thinking, ""Well, if everyone says I'm fat, then I'll be fat. I will just eat until I die."" because to the extremely rational mind of a child, eating yourself to death was the easiest option to accomplish that goal. (Un) fortunately, I've managed to make that wish come true. I'm now severely morbidly obese and I have 6 comorbidies, including 3 chronic illnesses, that have officially put me on the fast track to the grave. 

I mentioned it's preventable. Well, it sort of is. If I can lose my excess weight, I could probably add a couple decades before I finally croak. However, after years of supervised diet, personal trainers, tests, medicines, and Lord knows what else, Ive failed to lose a significant amount. I had a chance at bariatric surgery but I lost the insurance that covered it. My new insurance doesn't cover it and I have no way to pay out of pocket. 

My best friend just had the vertical sleeve done. Watching her go through the process that could literally save my life and not having a way to access it for myself is absolute torture. I'm doing everything I can to be happy, peppy, present, and supportive of her but I'm literally dying inside. She came home from the hospital today and I thought I'd be able to handle it better than her being in the hospital with constant reminders about how I'll never be in the bed....but her being home is so much worse. Don't get me wrong. I'm so fucking proud of her but I can't help but be absolutely crushed. 

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. Watching her reach her milestones ...I don't think I can do it. It being watch her get everything I want so fucking badly. I'm sick and tired. Ive rarely passed into actively suicidal and I've never been religious but damn am I praying not to wake up tomorrow morning. I don't think I can do this.",09May2019,2
4,"I’ve recently started seeing a therapist and I’m only two sessions in. I know it’s not much but he did advise me to start making decisions for myself and not make them to seek approval from others. 


I didn’t think breaking the habit would be hard but I start getting an anxiety attack just thinking about making any sort of decision now. Something that should be so simple and I can’t seem to do it. 


A lot of other events in my life that I’ve suppressed have started to resurface. I’m a mess and I know I didn’t give a lot of context or background.",09May2019,1
5,"I feel myself slipping back into that place. But worse. I can’t stop crying and I have a full day of work ahead of me. My anxiety is screaming at me that I WANT to be depressed and miserable and scared and alone because it gets me attention and the thought of it is making me feel sick. I don’t want this at all but it’s fine a good job of convincing me that this is true and I’m a fake and a phoney and an attention seeker. For that reason I’ve stopped reaching out.

I just want to curl up and cry. I can’t sleep. I’m having panic attacks and my body image is just crap. I don’t know how I’m going to get through the day ahead but because I’m hiding how I’m feeling I won’t get any support. I just don’t want to think or feel. I really really can’t cope and I feel so alone. I think I’ve driven everyone away who ever cared because I’m consistently depressed and anxious and they’re sick of my crap. I’m just so low and don’t want to think anymore.",09May2019,1
6,"I don't know why i'm posting here or if it even matters, But I was told it helps to just get shit off your chest. I'm 18 years old I felt this weird sadness since i was a kid. I'm not sure how to describe it but i always saw the world as this horrible place and it always upset me. Cause of this i didn't try in school after grade 5, i didn't try and make friends as i saw no point since we all die alone, no one truly understands what you go through or can truly relate to everything you experienced cause of that you'll always truly be alone and thats how i thought since i was maybe 5 years old. I always felt empty inside as i grew older death came into my life I lost my cousin who was like my sister she raised me when my dad was in jail and my mother was working so many jobs i hardly saw her, she got killed by a drunk driver I don't remember how old i was when she died but it really hurt me i didn't know how to react i didn't cry or really feel anything I just remember the world felt a whole lot darker.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up my parents weren't the best but they tried. My father was 17 and my moms was 22. My dad was laid back super cool dude, I don't really remember anything about my childhood when both my parents were there, The only memories i have are of me crying wondering why no one believes me about anything.. I was abused alot growing up my dad use to hit me if i would fuck up on something, or if i felt too sick to go to school, My older brother use to beat me till i was bloody or pissed my pants he would always tell me to clean myself up and make sure not to tell anyone. He was abused in ways worse than me growing up so i don't blame him. My Cousin who took care of me would always stick up and defend me, she always believed me, she was always there for me. i don't know I could write more about it but i don't see a reason too

  
Anyways i'm 18 now I feel worse than i have at any point in my life I don't know what to do i tried to self harm last week but the razor would puncture my skin i don't understand that still, i was pushing so hard but it wouldn't go in, blood would come up but it wouldn't go in i just gave up and went to bed I don't plan to try and self harm again, now my arm just has this big red mark that looks like cat scratches haha... Should I ask my mother if i can get a therapist? I hate feeling this way I felt this way my whole life, i met this girl and she took it all away but things happend and well she isn't in my life currently but being with her i saw the world in such beauty and it felt like everything finally made sense it felt like things weren't gonna be hard forever. I really want that feeling again I don't know how to achieve it on my own I think if i got a therapist i'd be able to talk more in depth about the things that bother me, and they'd push me to do more with my life right? I just don't know how to bring it up to my moms, she doesn't really understand depression or anything. She always just told me what i felt was because i'm weak in the mind and its my fault i'll grow out of it. I'm super fuking  scared man I just want to get rid of this.

7,"Or maybe they do care. But maybe they just get tired of listening to how you feel.. and they are going through their own problems that it’s annoying to listen to yours.. I say this all the time to myself before I decide to vent to someone “everyone has problems no one wants to hear yours”
Lately it’s been harder to get out of bed, to eat, to wash the dishes... 
I’ve  too tired and sleeping all day never seems to be enough
And the times I am awake I cry uncontrollably.. 
Sometimes it’s hard to fight with that little sharp demon that helped me cut myself when I was younger .. I made an appointment with a new therapist but what if it doesn’t work out with this one.. 
That crisis text line doesn’t really help.. it takes so long to get a response, and I haven’t hurt myself but I feel like sometimes I feel like I’m close to letting the sharp demon win.. at the end of the day who do I talk to.. who can I talk to?",09May2019,2

9,"Sorry for all the text. I'm not very okay. 

I'm at a loss what to do. I want to fix it but I can't think of any way I can. I feel so bad because I contributed to reason of the break-up. I can't help but blame myself, even if I didn't directly cause it. 

I'm still friends with them but they're not with each other. 

-Friend 1 (F1) feels betrayed and wants nothing with other. They don't want to listen to anything Friend 2 has to say. They think the incident was worse than it was in reality. 

-Friend 2 (F2) is deeply sorry and didn't mean to hurt Friend 1. They want to explain their side of what happened in hopes of repairing their friendship. 


I invited my best friends over to hangout, as it one of the few times F2 was in town. We all went to the camping trailer. The two of them were drinking. I went back into the house to sleep at some point in the night. They were fairly wasted at that point unknown to me at the time. 

I don't know when but, after I left, the two... Well fucked. F2 told me the night before they had to leave what happened. F1 after waking up, thought that F2 forced themselves on F1. They're both deeply hurt by what happened. 

F2 is a brutally honest person, fiercely cherishes their friends, and has a bleeding heart, I have no reason to not believe them. F2 can't fathom why F1 would even think F2 would hurt them.

Now neither of them have any contact with each other. F2 cut all off all contact with F1 as to not hurt them any further. All F2 wants is for F1 to get  help, even that means never interacting with F1. F1 doesn't care about F2 anymore. 


I've been offering my support as best I can to the both of them. I care about them so much. This screws me up so badly. I blame myself for the whole thing. I wish it was possible to magically fix this.",09May2019,1

11," ive had this crush on this one girls since i first layed eyes on her. it was in 5th grade, and i always looked at her from a distance. i always wanted to be closer to her. then one day on a field trip we were given cards with numbers saying what assigned seats we were assigned to. i did some detective work, and figured out her number, and i traded my way to her. it was the best day iv'e had. although we didn't really talk much, it was nice for me.i wish i could relive those moments iv'e had with her. middle school made it impossible for me to get in contact with her. i was bad at language arts, while she was bad at math. this separated us, because i was in advanced math, while she was in advanced language arts.  haven't seen her that much ever since. 8th grad, and i still havent seen her. the depression hit me hard, and i was getting worse grades. i was ""behaving"" according to the teachers, and i stayed up untill 3am every day which didn't help with my grades either. at the time i had extreem emaphobia, which any little feeling i got in my stomach made me go to the bathroom. people started saying that i was doing it to skip class, and i really wasn't. my depression, my lack of sleep, my emaphobia, and my masturbation addiction lead my grades to fall tromendiously, and i couldn't take it no more, so i asked my mother to do homeschool. i told her is was because of my emaphobia, but really it was also, because i stayed awake to 3am masturbating, i thought that homeschool would let me sleep more. i was right, but another problem arosed. i was able to masturbate more. when you masturbate more than 3 times a day, you deprive yourself of energy. this became a problem, because i wasn't having enough energy to do homeschool. then for the first time i lied to my mother. i told her that i did my work, and she believed me. it became a habbit for me to lie to her. most of my work is unfinished to this day, and i spend most of the day sleeping because of how much energy my masturbation consumes. im still trying to fight my addiction, and i know i need to stop NOW, but at the same time it is my coping mechanism for my depression. i feel like im trapped in someone im not. help me",09May2019,1

13,"I feel horrible. I need to talk to a professional who can help me understand why I do the things I do..
Overreact to minute details that I search for to be upset about it seems like that after I calm down and talk myself back to reality and realize nothing is actually wrong nothing is actually happening that would be considered detrimental to bring up as a complaint or argument. Why do I do this??? Why do I get angry and “hot” anxiety that this is actually happening, that this story I’ve concocted is actually real. When it’s not real. I apologize after and he forgives me. He’s honestly the most amazing human I’ve met. So much to look up to and admire but most of all the man I get to love. I am so blessed. 
I smoke weed a lot and it helps me sleep. Also I use it throughout my day every day. I need help. It slows me down and makes me forget. I’m immature in some areas and over dramatic at times. Then get really depressed. Everyday there is some sign of my depression  but I live through it and make the best of who I am. Depression is not who I am. It will not run or ruin my life. It’s just something I have to work with and find the things that help relieve it. I’m happy but also depressed. Get it? I am also impulsive. Especially when it comes to buying things. Anything except for bills. I love spending. It gets me high. I have to go to bed now. Write more later. To be continued...
Back again and it’s May 7th. I guess I feel depressed and super anxious again. Big surprise.

But I hate a big part of myself. It makes it hard to be around me all the time so I smoke weed to forget, soften the blow. I have a problem with overtly sexy women. I see pictures or women in really life dressing like they want to get fucked. That’s so harsh. I hate to even think or admit it so bluntly. But I don’t want to feel so strongly about it. I love my boyfriend but I hate MALES. They think with their cocks ALL DAMN DAY they can’t even help it. How fucked up is that, and supposedly they are better leaders? Fuck off.I’m so angry about it. They all need to be emasculated so they could see and feel life the way a female does. The whole menstrual cycle to the having a baby come out of you while your hairy vagina is there for all to see/feel/smell. As a loyal woman stays catering to her ever so loving and untrustworthy man. Loving him and forgiving him. How will I ever get married or be a good and loving mother if I have so much resentment in my heart?  My thoughts turnover rate for negative thoughts is at a record breaking high! Boo boo hoo poor me so sad all the time. Trying to figure out why I’m so fucked in the head.

15,"About five days ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bkgukz/i_dont_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_to_exist/) here asking for advice. I wanted to update everyone on what's happened so far.

I told my therapist as much as I could in our hour session. She was a bit surprised since I've gotten good at hiding how bad off my mental state can get. But she thankfully didn't immediately want to send me to a psych ward, which had been my main concern. She has assured me that unless I'm actively planning on offing myself or hurting myself or others, she won't put me through that. She suggested I take a week off from work, to give myself time to recharge and look for something else. I agreed. If I can keep from quitting until I get something better, that would be great. We'll see how that goes, though.

I got a text from a coworker yesterday morning right before I went into my peer support appointment. I had been scheduled for two extra hours for Thursday and Friday, which I simply can't do. Said coworker asked our manager about it and was told it was a typo, but that our manager was going to ask me to work until close on Saturday. Considering I was so mentally and physically exhausted yesterday that I was fighting not to nod off in my appointment, I knew I wasn't going to be able to deal with her careless nonsense the next few days. So... I went above her and asked the 'big boss' for a week off. I didn't give many details, but I was able to take off. I don't go back until the 17th. 

I'll still be pretending to go to work since my grandmother will otherwise ask me to go on a million errands, but I think the time off will help me heal and give me time to look around for better options. If nothing else, I hope it eases this fatigue I feel. Thank you to everyone that commented on my first post, and gave me advice and support. 

As for now... I think I need a nap.",09May2019,3

He made me feel so much better about my guilt.
All my friends and family say that I should try harder, that are people out there with high functioning depression, and I have to make more of an effort.

 I always feel awful about that and I believe them

But he told me that this is a disease like diabetes, not all people have the same type of diabetes, and the treatment is not the same to everyone. 

Lack of will power and extreme guilt are symptoms of depression, and there is nothing I can do.... except the treatment. 

As long as I'm treating myself, I'm doing the best I can. 

I moved to another country so I'm 1 year without therapy, and I just changed meds when I was visiting my family  during the holidays, I should have gone to a psychiatric here last month to check, but I didn't. 

He up the dosis of my meds and will suggest me a therapist.

I treat my depression for 7 years, I heard that all before, but when everyone is saying the same thing over and over again it's easy to forget.

If you have depression and are not being treated, you really should. 
That friend that said that had depression after the break up and ""cured"" themselves, so you also don't need a treatment? wasn't depressed, just sad. 
If you don't have money, you can find free help in universities or institutions, it may be far and a bit inconvenient, but is so worth it.

It takes a while for you to find the right medication, but when you find it, the world changes. For real. 
and therapy is so important, I don't know how I survived 1 year without it. 


Fun fact: when he asked me who told me those things about how I should try harder and that are people out there who has depression and still work and go to school, I said that nobody told me that.

I don't know why I lied.

Ok, not that fun. 

I just want to encourage anyone here who is avoiding treatment. You should try it, please.

She did reply later after I told her good luck with her exams and the reply sounded normal and cordial. I just want to tell her that I still want to be her rock because in letting her go ive been able to realize that she means so much more to me. All of the great times we had can trump any of the hard times. I just want to tell her I love her still and that I want to work it out but I dont want to keep pushing the issue and chasing her away. So for now im trying to keep it cordial and not text her for awhile. It is a long distance relationship for the meantime but we have been able to visit each other a few times.

22,"Its so many fears, actions of others, a milestone for my kid, a milestone for myself all converging at once and I am overwhelmed.  Its a dawning of a new period in my world and its one I don't have a place in.  Its one that has been building and all it will do is leave me more isolated and helpless at the mercy of a Narcissistic.  In two weeks on the same day my son graduates high school and I turn 50.  I will have my entire family traveling and staying in my home.  Never in the history of family get togethers has any event been peaceful and one person triggers off another and then it all begins.  I only see my family once a year because i live so far away .  I am disabled thanks to 9/11 as I was trapped  down at the WTC.  I adopted my son and raised him on my own.  It was not easy but I did.  The hardest time period was when I started around 2009 becoming ill and having issues from my experience.  There is so much to this story that would make this too long to write and id say no one would read but it really is an incredible story.  I have secrets and issues I hope no one in my family  or friends learn of and bring me great pain.  My son has been the reason i have not killed myself but in 2 weeks time he will be a high school graduate and starting college soon after - my reason for being alive is done.  I will have no purpose and he is the type out of sight out of mind and will give me little thought.  In almost 18 years the kid has never thought about dad and all he does - rarely says thank you and never sorry.  Learned that from the Narcissist that will keep me captive, but dont ever bring that up as both will flip out that they are nothing alike.  My partner has been in my sons life since he was 5 and its been like raising 2 kids.  To get him to act like a parent instead of a tattletale sibling rivalry would be a miracle i never achieved.  To this day anything to the point of searching for it - my partner takes joy in coming to me with my kids issues. My kid will flee as soon as he feels he can, thankfully for me i know he knows he is not ready to be on his own.  In the next breath i don't want to be around when that happens.   Demands and ultimatums, knowing my abilities and recognizing his fears and issues, because im a caretaker I dug this hole I am in.  Belittled and berated, always making excuses for his manipulation of all things I stood by for reason i know others who have been where I am could only understand.  I am so anxious about all being here and what stunts my partner and family will pull.  Financially I am losing my disability check for my son as he turns 18 and none of my bills like my rent will go down.  I pay rent to my partner and sadly its 3x the amount i could get a place on my own for.  Threats keep me here and i cant start over at 50.  My two furbabies that love me unconditionally are 12 and 10 which scares me that they will sadly depart from my life sooner than i could ever want and both are clearly showing their age.  I cant cry anymore, I can't feel the way i do.  This past weekend was the topper as i had to go out of town and ended up stranded in an airport due to weather.  My id fell out of my wallet somewhere and i realized as i went to tsa. There I was physically searched and felt up that a drink or a date would have been more appropriate first.  trapped in airport as weather shut down, chaos and rebooking, I was sent to eventually another city after a day already of traveling and cancelation and rebookings .  I was told if i did not get on the flight they were putting me on I would not get home for at least 2 more days.  I boarded the flight to a city an hour drive from my home and not the city i was to fly to.  Once there the airline did nothing to help me - mind you i have no id so i could not get a room or a car.  My partner would not drive an hour plus to get me since he claimed there were other solutions.  I did not know what to do and all my electronics were dead since every electrical port were used by all stranded passengers.  So I hid in a family bathroom charging until i was thrown out of airport as that wing was being closed for the night.  I was sent into the rain and felt like ending it all. A friend that lived close by i finally got a hold of and was picked up.  My partner came the next day but not without threats to the point my friend did not want to let me go home.  I did go as my kid and pups were there.  i can't do this when he refuses to acknowledge how i felt and experienced.  My issues with 9/11 all flared up and i can't do this again I need to die. As selfish as it is I don't care as no one except that friend cared as i stood in the rain sleep deprived and hungry with no proof of who i was.  shit i don't know who i am anymore.  I know this is a cry because i really don't want to die but i just can't do it anymore.  I don't want to do it anymore i just want peace and to not hurt any more. Maybe this is not a cry but more an explanation so i'm not misunderstood.  I have withstood so much bullshit at my partners doing that i deserve some repreve and death will be it.

And if its all in my head then i am more defective than i thought and death would be doing all a favor. So how I will or can do it must be figured out before my bday and the kids graduation as i need to be gone before then.",09May2019,1
23,"I can start by saying I know some people think I'm great, but there's still a shadow of dread that keeps me from appreciating myself or anything I do.

A little backstory: I was living with a girl for a year until recently. We were together every day and often I replaced my idea of self-worth with hers. Relying on her positive perception of me to combat my shitty self deprication. Things fell apart obviously and she now leads a fulfilling life as an escort..enough on that, but that's where I'm coming from the last couple weeks.

I want to be able to generate my own optimism and feel okay in my skin, but lately I've been smoking more and more, drinking with friends almost every night. Just distracting myself from her loving someone else, from my own depression, and from moving forward.

So to direct my request for advice a bit more, how do you take that initiative to do what you know you need to for your own benefit when you haven't felt worth the effort for so long?",09May2019,6
24,"
My biological parents gave me away because they were too poor and had no budget to cure my asthma when I was a infant, I was also diagnosed as ADHD, adopted then raised by my stepfather's house. Mother wasn't really fond with father so mother packed our stuff and we lived at the residence of my grandma, because she wasn't content with my stepfather (I was still 3 years old). We moved in, and in years I went and came to school and in summer mother decided I should visit my first stepfather every summer time from time again, however it didn't lasted that much until I turned 10 where my life started to decline, wasn't doing well with school and I wasn't that much social was too shy among other people as a kid, mother wouldn't let me have access to social media's because I was too ""irresponsible"", I had no social media so I had no option how to interact with others. Often times I draw all day to ease the boring Atmosphere. Didn't really gave any sap of fucks to any of my teachers, that obviously resulted with dozens of failed exams and bad grade marks, often times I get punished by the iron belt or kneeling on a tray of salt for hours until my knees almost bled, I had another stepfather during those years, they made me feel like a mistake so much, too much, and because of that Greek tradegy I took my grief and frustrations out to someone else, I was the asshole of the school, no one saw me as a friend nor did I, they never saw me or talked to me eye to eye, nobody did, nobody cared. I fucking hate my childhood, both the school and the teachers. I also said things to my mother that would broke her heart and came to regret mine. And to add the insult I later found out my stepmom was cheating with a tomboy, father found out as well as she was flirting on someone else, so he had to take matters on his own hands, my stepmom's siblings and grandma kept arguing with mother that whole night, I was cold, hungry, all afraid, couldn't sleep and didn't know what to do. Next morning I heard my parents came to an agreement that they both settled in a divorce, my mother decided she took me in, meanwhile grandma was still furious so she decided to kick us out to justify the shame my stepmom did. I was confused, I thought I had lost all hope, until the tomboy encouraged us to live at her homestead, mother introduced me and my shitty back story, that very day all hell broke loose. Same as always, mother always finds drama about my education, I also had a couple cases of panic attacks. Tomboy aka another new stepfather--shouting at my ears asking why was I such pain in the ass and couldn't stop drawing in school and why I had bad grades blah blah blah etc. Kept going and going and going, but one night mother collapsed while she was listening between me and Tomboy were arguing, the fellow neighbours called an ambulance, it was raining and it was dark, I tried to help but I couldn't, I couldn't do anything, everything I create or touch dies. I felt so devastated, and all I got that day was angry stares from my step siblings and my neighbors that night. My chest kept pounding and pounding like an avalanche crashing down to my back. My tomboy father pointed me the door and I left the house, ran so much I had cold sweats. Waited a couple hours and hoping curfew wouldn't spot me, mom texted she was alright, and I felt so relieved my legs gave out. Next morning stepdad came crashing the door as always spitting bitter insults like, ""I should've been abandoned in a dumpster where all trash subside"" and all the things that will taste like hell. I remembered my 2nd stepfather once said to me, ""when there is anybody to speak to, you can always talk with God."", and I said to myself, if this was the life I was given, Either God Is a devil or God is a Bitch. I've spent my remaining days in that home being a sorrowful bastard hoping someone could fix my life in a blink of an eye, no one came because it was too good to be true and also nobody came in mind. I couldn't trust my own mother to the fear she would leak it to my stepfather tomboy  knowing she would debunk all of it with her side of the story. I had enough, I said, I wont fake to myself no more, I became more violent with my stuff I couldn't enjoy the things I draw, and I bargained she should just let me go and live with my first step fathers homestead, because we were still in a good terms with him. (also she was shit pissed at me the whole conversation while I was confused the whole time) Tomboy stepdad rushed all my things packed all like daily garbage, said goodbye to my grandma and left me a hard slap in the cheek, then me and mother drove off. Arrived at my old man's home and hugged my dad while my mother hit the trail leaving the chance of me to say goodbye. (I was 15 when I moved in) Me and Dad were silent that night, Next morning I explained to him the details and he understood though he could not distinguish what I feel, stayed in school and now I have access with the Internet, I had the ability to finally make my own social media account, fast forward a couple weeks and realized nothing changed in life the difference is I had access to the Web so I can hear all my classmates opinions about their own love life. Life was regular as shit to me and bullies kept sending DM's to me. Decided I skipped highschool, decided I turn into someone else maybe a gamers perhaps I said, so I skipped school and went to Internet cafes and spend mu miserable days shooting players at csgo, and surprise surprise dad finally caught my bullshit and whipped me a fine glass of beating, yes he turned out an asshole as well with no notion to what I feel, granted it was reasonable I was to be beaten, but it wasn't reasonable till he threatened me that I would be homeless if I had anymore offence, I was horrified, and I promised not to do any bullshit again apart from still being mentally broken, fast forward a few years I found my self cutting was the answer to all my sadness. Finally I graduated highschool, even had an award at graduation day, but everytime I came home from school, My chest feels like an anchor sinking into a bottomless ocean. And now I live, as for to today I write this, I still have no Idea what direction in life can lead me, I am still Deeply Broken, Overwhelmingly Depressed and traumatized, and being constantly afraid like if I'm always being threatened, The worst part of all, I can't draw anymore, not because Im not holding a pencil, or too tired to do it, but because I have no will to do it anymore, they always tell my art is tasteless and immature. But okay I understand. I always Understand, so much so I Understood that nobody really understood me. Well they're gonna be glad anyway, once I'm already gone.",09May2019,7

26,"I’ve made a list of small manageable tasks to do daily over the summer that would help with productivity and to make me feel at least decent mentally and physically. Here is the list:
* Shower every night 
* Brush teeth twice a day 
* Make bed every morning
* Have at least one good meal 
* Read at least 30 minutes
* Try to take walks even if they’re short 
* Drink at least two big bottles of water throughout the day 
* Stretch 
* Journal regularly 
Im posting this because while I think this is really simple and manageable (as in I won’t get overwhelmed and not do any of it) id like to know if anyone has anything else that they would personally suggest to add to this list or do themselves. Thanks :•)",09May2019,1
27,"I don’t know how to keep going on. I don’t think I will attempt to kill myself, and I’ve never had a plan, but I don’t see how I can keep going. I know I have some sort of anxiety/depression issue. It’s been around since high school, going on 7-8 years now. I just don’t know how to handle everything. It’s like a big black ball of the worst feeling in the world in my chest, getting bigger and bigger and consuming everything. I have no energy to handle my life, everything feels like it’s spiraling out of control. I can’t think, I can’t remember, my brain feels like the static on the TV there’s so much going on and not enough at the same time. 
How have y’all learned to handle life under the influence of the feelings of failure and worthlessness, when there are any feelings at all? I’m trying to move on with my life, go forward, but every time I think I’m out I fall right back into the black hole.
I’m just so tired of struggling against my own brain. I just wanna be happy. I just don’t want to be dumb anymore. I just wanna be free.",09May2019,1
28,"Hello everyone I’m new here and I don’t know how this works. So I’m just going to treat it like how I’ve seen support meetings done on media and tv shows. Im a 21 year old male, I’m 6’2 and about 400 pounds but I’m to scared to step onto a scale. I’m being laid off from my job for hygiene reasons due to smell even though I attempt to clean myself. For months I hid from my feelings and those around me and about a week ago I finally tried getting in touch with my gf who lives across country and was very supporting but she has now told me she is with someone else. I still have feelings for her and I c an tel she still cares about me and I’m afraid of cutting her out again so I’m trying to be friends with her but it hurts. I pay rent to my family to live at my house at a very reasonable price for where I live and we all care about each other but it feels so passive aggressive hostile and just loud all the time. The only time I feel calm is at night when everyone is asleep so I have only myself but it makes mornings harder. I don’t think I have any set plans for my future any more due to my continuing lack of care about my life and self and I think it’s time I be honest with myself and admit I might have depression.",09May2019,4
29,"I have a therapy appointment coming up next week and I have been dreading it. This is my second attempt at therapy and I have huge problem opening up. And when I do I cannot help but just sob. I hate it so much. I am a giant guy. 6""4' over 300lbs. I just feel so stupid when and if I cry. I hate that feeling.   


That being said...is it normal...or even socially acceptable to cry during therapy?",09May2019,2
30,"I’ve been doing really shit in school this year. I’m about to fail all my classes this semester. Basically I began a downward spiral into depression and bad study habits after I lost a close family member to cancer a while ago.

But the worst part of all this has been the weird feeling of guilt when talking to my friends/classmates/coworkers about school. I know I’m not obligated to tell anyone what my grades are, but I can’t shake this feeling that I’m living a lie because everyone thinks I’m doing fine. 

If you were in my position would you tell people you’re failing?",09May2019,1
31,"I regularly suffer from intrusive thoughts. These thoughts ranged from ""what if I'm racist?', ""what if I'm a pedophile?"" ""What if I went psychotic?"" and ""What if I were a terrorist?"" I'm not racist, a pedophile, psychotic, or a terrorist. I don't want to commit any acts of terrorism. I don't want to have sex with children. I don't view any race as inferior. I've never been diagnosed with psychosis. But my mind doesn't care. 'you COULD be a pedophile' or 'you COULD become a terrorist'. I talk to my therapist about it quite frequently. I just wanted fresh perspectives. My psychiatrist has diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Autism, and I am on Mirtazapine.",09May2019,1

33,"Here's the thing about not being attractive (pretty, beautiful, etc), not having friends, losing all your friends, and having a limited family; it makes it easier to end things.

It's a matter of when and how. You know it's going to happen, but when will it happen? What you don't know is how. A gun shot to the head? Maybe. Buying seeds from the most poisonous plants and putting them in a blender with ice cream and taking Zofran to prevent vomiting? Most likely. Jumping off a bridge? Well, no. That's a scary way to die, in my opinion.

Those who say looks aren't everything must be in denial. Sure, the majority of decent people don't take them into huge consideration in the grande scheme of things, but they are unfortunately a massive deciding factor for us. You may think you're above all the rest, but how many times have you witnessed someone who looks a bit off, and sneered or commented to a friend or family member? We've all done it. I'm guilty of it too. Looks are everything, but those of us who aren't the most attractive individuals use it as a double-edged sword. Those attractive women don't really care if some guy (who is probably ugly or average looking) is butthurt because she won't date or sleep with him. They have other and better options. Being attractive never backfires. At most for a hot girl, people will assume she's sucking cock or married to a rich man if she's doing well for herself in life when she may be there on genuine merit, but that is nothing compared to the genuine hell that your life is made if you're legitimately ugly. Every time you see an extraordinarily beautiful woman it will hurt you. It’s a reminder of what you “should” look like, and of how different you are. It will make you feel out of place, sometimes worthless. Our society is so vain and appearance driven how could it not? I actively avoid reading magazines or looking at make-up ads for too long. Why torture yourself? The struggle is real.

I could do this now. I can easily order the seeds and have them here in less than 5 weeks. What's stopping me?

I'm told surgery can make my dreams come true. But then I have surgery and become disappointed when complications arise, or when it's botched, or when it doesn't turn out how I wanted, etc. But still, I proceed with surgery and revisions because I like to think it's possible to have what I desperately want.

I don't want to admit I'm wrong.

I don't want to admit that some people can't ever look beautiful.

I don't want to admit that it was a mistake to transition from one gender to another.

I want to be right.

I want my goals to be reached.

But deep down, you know you're wrong.

Deep down, you know you're going to die,

Deep down, you know everyone is laughing at you.

Deep down, you know you're pathetic when you look in the mirror.

I'm a 21-year-old post-op transgender girl with botched genitalia that resulted due to complications and a bad surgeon. I have lost a lot of tissue and in agony because of a gaping opening and scarred tissue. I have scars everywhere, including my abdomen area due to a failed skin graft. I have gained a lot of weight and there's a lot of stretch marks on my body as a result of my surgeries, especially my breasts due to breast augmentation. The scars are also there, as well.

As for my facial appearance, I'm androgynous and plan on getting facial feminization surgery sometime in July or August, however I was recently told that it would still be my face but a more softer version. So, that was very disappointing to hear. I'm not expecting much at this point.

Next week I have a colon-vaginoplasty surgery, they are going to take about 8 inches of my colon to try and form a new vagina. I hope it doesn't malform this time, but again, I'm not expecting much. If this goes wrong, I'm done.",09May2019,1
