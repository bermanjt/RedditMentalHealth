If I’m covering up with a blanket all of a sudden I’m automatically hiding a hickie and I’m not even like that and then today another guy I’m working with on a project said no offense but I think you’ve hit your peak  I’m 18 and that hurt a lot!

3,"I recently asked for more hours because I would at least like a minimum of a certain amount of hours while being in college. I thought this was no big deal but my boss was unable to guarantee my hours. My coworkers asked me to come and meet them to go out to eat the next night (I didn't even get anything because I am so paranoid about money &amp; my anxiety wouldn't have allowed me to keep anything down anyway) and I told them that I might be looking for a second job or another job merely based on hours. The next day at work my boss pulled me aside and gave me more hours and a raise. But I noticed that afterward, she started sending really weird passive-aggressive texts through our group chat. I confronted her about how the text concerned me because I had no idea who it was referring to and that if there was any kind of issue I would really appreciate being informed and settling it together. She seemed to react to it well, but I'm unsure of it now. There is a new manager and I feel a bit nervous around her because of my anxiety, she is nice, but my mind keeps telling me ""everyone there hates you"" and that when I go into work I come across as annoying. I try to reassure myself by saying that I give no one a reason to hate me and I go into work just to do my job and go home. I kept going to one coworker when I was anxious, but I think she's grown tired of me. My coworkers invited me out to help them celebrate something happening in my bosses' life. Should I assume that they actually like me? I feel as though my boss doesn't want me to go. I know this comes off as obsessive, but not knowing where I stand with someone freaks me out. I know this is more anxiety-related, but it's really affecting my life and my will to get out of bed on the days that I work. I need the money and that is the only reason I keep going in.

6,"You might be depressed right now.

That’s a terrible feeling. 

I totally know that because I’m no stranger to that.

I might feel depressed at times, but you know what? 

I don’t let myself stay there.

Here's my method for dealing with depression naturally.

If you prefer to hear me talk about it in my podcast, here you go:

The concept of engaging our emotions for dealing with depression naturally

To fight depression effectively, we need to realize that it’s just a feeling after all.

We have all sorts of emotions during the day.

Depression is just one of them, even though it’s a powerful one.

Tim Matthews, the founder of The Powerful Man, gives one good example of how we create it:

&gt;“When we start to think that we should be farther ahead than who and where we are now, we begin to feel so much pressure which can lead to depression.”

Even if we feel depressed, we can switch to another emotion instantly.

For example, I feel love whenever I give a hug to my kid.

Which means I can switch to that emotion voluntarily.

My current emotion is the one that I choose to feel by focusing on it.

Tony Robbins has this concept called the Triad.

Changing our feeling requires changing the following three things: 

1. physiology: posture and breathing
2. focus: what we think about
3. language: what we say to ourselves when we think about it

Here I am talking about the second part: *focus*.

Let me show how I replace a negative emotion with a positive one using my focus.

**Step #1: Have a memory associated with a strong positive emotion**

I have this memory of feeling like a winner.

A few years ago, I went to a park on a date with a girl.

We took a walk for about an hour.

When we returned to my car, I pushed the button on the door to unlock it.

But it wouldn’t unlock.

I was confused because my key was supposed to be in my pocket and the car was supposed to unlock.

But what if I didn’t have the key?

I looked around for the key but it was nowhere to be found.

I lost it indeed.

So I called a taxi to take the girl home and grab the second key from my home.

In the morning, I decided to go look for the key.

I thought that would be a waste of time.

I mean what are the chances to find the key in a huge park where we walked a lot.

But somehow I trusted my intuition.

I drove back to the park and started following our yesterday’s path.

I was 100% sure I had no chance.

A large park, high grass, and a small key.

And sure enough, there it was, lying in the grass, waiting for me.

Man, this looked like a miracle.

I felt ecstatic for so many reasons.

I don’t like to lose things and I avoided losing the key.

It was quite expensive to restore and I didn’t want the hassle.

And most importantly, I couldn’t believe that I actually found it.

It might not sound like a big deal to you.

But it doesn’t matter!

What does matter is that for me it was a miracle.

I couldn’t believe it.

And I committed this feeling to memory.

**Step #2: Rely on this memory to recall the emotion**

Now I use this memory as a go-to place for things like winter depression or any other negative thoughts really.

See, I noticed that it could help me just a couple of days after finding the key.

I was running and really pushing myself.

It felt hard, but then I suddenly remembered about the key.

And running felt less difficult instantly.

So I said to myself:

“If I can use this memory to change my state when I run, how about other situations?”

So the next time I felt depressed, I replayed that memory.

I recreated the entire experience in my mind as vividly as possible.

Summer park smells.

Sounds of the wind in the trees.

How the morning sun felt on my skin.

How I noticed the key.

The unbelievable feeling of victory.

The gratitude about trusting my intuition.

And feeling happy telling the girl that I found it.

Replaying that memory took me about two minutes.

And it was already worthwhile because at least in those few minutes, I didn’t feel depressed.

I felt elated.

But it didn’t really last just two minutes.

In fact, I stayed elated.

And I would keep reminding myself of the key from time to time.

That was enough to renew my focus.

And whenever I felt depression coming back strong, I replayed the entire experience again for a stronger effect.

That's it: dealing with depression naturally is that easy!

**Step #3: Keep programming yourself**

As I kept using this memory, it worked even more effectively.

The idea is to make it so habitual that it happens automatically.

In fact, we do it with negative emotions all the time.

We keep thinking of something bad and we feel depressed.

That’s because our mind is focused on survival and keeps looking for what is wrong.

But if we can train ourselves to feel negative emotions, we can do the same with the positive ones!

It just takes more practice and patience.

As we practice shifting from negative to positive emotions, we program them into our subconscious mind.

And eventually, we are able to call those positive emotions just as quickly as the negative ones.

Start dealing with depression naturally today

**Conclusion**

There you go: there is no reason for living with depression when it’s just a matter of focus.

Instead of focusing on what’s bad in your life, you have the power to focus on a positive emotion.

Find a memory when you felt elated. It doesn’t have to be as big as winning a Nobel prize. What matters is how excited you felt at the moment.

Replay that moment in your mind in detail so that you feel the positive emotions in your body.

And then keep focusing on those positive emotions to avoid the negative ones.

When you feel that the negative emotions start creeping back in, replay the moment in detail again.",01Nov2019,2
7,"I had noticed I've been isolating myself from the world too much. Now as a junior in college,other's lives seems to be moving so faster than mine. Graduating, getting a job, being free to hang out with people. Movies, videogames and porn had been my main form of distraction. I see I got too accustomed to it that this self isolation is really affecting me. I think I've become a shut in.

I do have friends to joke around with. But I am unable to connect with them in a deeper level. 
Their lives also seem to move faster than mine. 

I never had a romantic partner, this semester has become harder for me to keep looking for someone, I understand seeking for a love life is not supposed to be ASAP. But I see my siblings going out on dates, while I've never got to experience one yet. I'd wish to get to know that kind of warmth. My last love interest is now one of my ""closest"" friends, I fucked up when I told her, somehow we stay in touch, I still like her but I think asking her again would ruin the friendship I've been working too hard for. I do not think I have someone I would truly consider a best friend tho. No one seems to ask for me. 

For a while I've been having thoughts of death, but not suicide, I don't own any plans for that. I had never attempted physical harm, I'm too scared to try it, I know I do not want to die, I want to live, I do not wish to give my family pain. But I do not know what to do next. 

I've went a few days to a therapist. It is hard for me to keep going since she knows my parents and they are very christian and so is the therapist. Apparently she is the only one they would send me to, since she is less than one block away from my house.  It feels super odd to walk a few steps to her house, sit down an hour, pay for the session, and walk back home. 

I've never felt a religious connection, it is hard for me to follow what the therapist tells me to do when god is mentioned most of the time. I don't think I really believe in it. I end up attending to mass, I do not ask for it. 

I do not feel I really belong anywhere aside from home.",01Nov2019,2
8,"I was surprise dumped six weeks ago after being in a relationship for 8 years and living together for 5. It wasn't a great relationship but I thought I could have kind of counted on this person. Since being dumped I've been having flash backs of abuse and sexual assault I endured when I was younger. I am spiralling and feel like I'm failing everything in my life. I have barely been getting out of bed or eating. And I dont have anyone to talk to about these things. Right after the breakup I started going to counseling but all these things I thought I'd moved past, are surfacing again.... and the counseling is not helping quickly enough. I keep thinking about how to kill myself because I dont think I can handle this much longer. I was prescribed a med for panic attacks I've been having but taking them I fall asleep to the point where I feel like I cant wake up to alarms.... and then I sleep through more responsibilities which just makes me more stressed. The fucked up thing is my ex dumped me out of the blue.... after saying he was happy all along, he just decided to tell me he had been unhappy for years among other hurtful things. But I have no family support and no friends at this point and I dont know who to turn to. He hurt me so badly and after the fact I retaliated and said hurtful things.... but I wish I could call him and have some sort of support. Am I right thinking its fucked up to want to reach to him for help? Does anyone have any advice for getting help more quickly? I cant afford checking myself in anywhere and that frankly scares the shit put of me.... but I dont think I can do this much longer.",01Nov2019,3
9,"Today was my last day of high school before final exams and then graduation. At the end of the day we had to do this activity where you needed to write 5 people a note that fitted into one of the following categories: 

· Thanking someone for being your friend.

· Saying sorry to someone about something.

· Saying that you wished that you could have spoken to someone that you hadn’t.

· Saying that you are proud of someone.

With these notes, we had the whole grade site in a circle and take turns hanging them out to the person you wrote it to. As I was not the most social person, I wasn’t expecting to get many people to write something about me and that’s exactly what happened. I got nothing. This didn’t affect me overly until some sitting near me said “imagine if nobody writes something about you because it shows that you have wasted your time and effort”. This wasn’t directly targeted toward me but the second I heard this all my emotions changed and I started crying for about 15 minutes.

Now all I can think of is how I am a failure with no friends and how I regret not doing things that I should have.",01Nov2019,2
10,I'm 37 years old a smart person but I grew up with a mother and father (divorced)  who in turn grew up in a abusive environment.  My father as I know he loves me has never said it.  My mother says it but her new husband won't let her around me.  Every single boyfriend I have ever had has abused me.  one tryed to shoot me another use to throw me at the wall and floors. I am a kind caring person who tries to help homeless people and low income people with food. I work 60 hours a week and clean and maintain a household. I would do anything for anybody.  I hate myself and I think if no one has ever truely loved me my whole 37 years of existence what is wrong with me.  I know its not me even though odds say it must be. I think its time to call it quits and just end this life.  I've been trying for 27 years to make it happy and have anyone love me but its not going to happen.  I'm sick of crying everyday and thinking about a painless way to kill myself.  In reality I wanna live but there is no point anymore its just too painful.  What do I do?,01Nov2019,1
11,"I have to write this while I can, and it’s a throwaway because I don’t need anyone taking away my options. I don’t know how long it’s been, but years ago I feel into depression. I can’t really explain why, but I’ve been trying to figure it out for long - and because that’s been my focus I’ve let myself go. In trying to figure out what’s wrong with myself it’s like I’ve forgotten who I am and try as I might I can’t remember. I keep forgetting things, past and present. In the day to day it feels like I’m looking up from a dark well through my eyes - or like I’m trying to drive a 15 seat van from the back most row. I’ve let what little relationships I’ve had rot away and I haven’t seen or talked to people outside my family for months. Recently I saw myself in the mirror, and my body is so pale and misshapen. I look like an alien.

I’m finally ready for help, but I get this lurching feeling that it’s all for naught, as even know I feel myself sinking back into the calm introspective hell I’ve been trapped in. I don’t know if there’s a way out or if I’ll care tomorrow. It hurts to care, and I lose track of my focus so easily and then my control slips away into distraction. 

There have been so many red flags and lines I thought I’d never cross. I haven’t done anything serious yet, but sometimes I’ll put myself or others in danger. On the road, I’ll let go of the steering wheel and close my eyes until that sense of panic forces me to take control again. At night I’ll hold a gun to my head at times, waiting for some reflex to pull the trigger for me.  I don’t want to die, but I think it would be easier than this.

Tomorrow I plan to go to the gym, I’ve been once in the three months I’ve payed for membership. It’s like there’s a physical force stopping me from doing the things I want to do and things I need to do. I feel unhealthy, I’m in debt and I was recently fired..so much is flooding back, now I just want to sleep.",01Nov2019,8

I just... don’t feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I don’t even care about the debt, I can’t see myself ever buying a house and I can’t even bring myself to imagine having a s/o and kid’s. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I don’t know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and i’m studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars.

13,"I have Anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar Depression, Pulmonary Embolism, Obesity, and Mobility issues, and I am only 35/M/living in the Seattle Area. My self-confidence and self-esteem have been depleted.

It's hard for me to go to medical appointments because I am just tired of the frequency, and if there is bad news, it's only me and my shoulders. I don't have anyone to share the burden with. I have a giant hole inside of me, and I can't fix it.This past week or so, I have had this sense of feeling lost, and I have been sleeping almost all day and up most of the night. I am homeless, jobless, and I am also semi=disabled. I use a four-wheel walker to help me get around long distances and a cane around the apartment. I have been staying with friends since I lost everything in a fire in February 2016. Because of my weight and health issues, homeless shelters won't take me because I am a high-risk liability. I sleep on the living room floor at my friend's apartment, and their adult boys love to be up all night and play video games, so I don't get the best sleep. Eye masks and earplugs don't help me. I can't sleep in a chair that I have because I toss and turn. They don't give me the respect that I need so I can sleep and do stuff like hold down a job. I have lost several jobs because of my unstable living situation.

14,"last night she told me everything. Although she has mentioned it in the past they were mostly jokes (which are clearly inappropriate looking back now). Now she says she has had suicidal thoughts and has been considering cutting herself again. She says it's because of ""dumb stuff"" she has done that embarrasses her around me. Is this a normal reason to do so? I don't want to pretend like I know what im doing cause I don't, and I could really use some guidance on how I can try to stop anything bad from happening. 

Later that night, I texted her asking to promise that she wouldn't cut herself as long as we're together. I fully understand that this is probably really hard to do, but I thought I'd try. All I got was an ""I'll do my best"". 

I have no idea if there's anything I can do but if anyone has been in a similar situation I would really appreciate any input or advice.

I am considering telling her that if she ever does end up harming herself, that we would break up. Is this a good idea? I'm just worried it could cause an even bigger issue and cause her to snowball into feeling even worse.",01Nov2019,2

I have a few friends that I talk to after school but they are mostly adults and I see them at my jiu jitsu classes, I have a few friends I talk to in school, and last I have a great friend group online. Most of my days i just mind my own business and carry on with my day and try not to worry about others but it has come too far. I often wonder will I make any friends when I'm adult? Will I ever find a girlfriend as an adult? I don't plan on dating until I'm either in my last year of highschool or graduated.",01Nov2019,1
32,"I think I may have depression. Though I have most of the symptoms that are well known for it, I don’t ever want to tell my friends or family. For one they’ ll think I’m joking or attention seeking. Secondly whenever I open up to anyone it always goes wrong. So I’ve been bottling up everything I’ve been feeling for years now. 
I’ve lost interest in hobbies and I’ve been getting  emotional over small things that happened.
Do I really have depression or am just trying to be dramatic?
Someone please help.",01Nov2019,1
33,"I've thought a lot about being human. As conscious beings who are so intelligent. I feel as if our intelligence makes us insane. There are slews of diagnoses we have and can give. I was personally diagnosed with GAD and PTSD. I am now knowing what depression feels like. It's crushing. I feel emotionless. Empty. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I still try to do the things I used to enjoy but they don't bring me the same level of happiness. 

I'm lost. I'm scared. I'm hurt. 

I don't eat much anymore. I barely weigh 100 pounds. It's hard to shower some days. I used to be the girl who would get dolled up just to go through the drive thru. Now I'm wearing the same clothes multiple days in a row.

I'm a mess.

My hobby is/ was video games. They now bring me no joy. I have video game tattoos. I hate my tattoos and regret all of them. The only thing keeping me going is my cat. Shes 14 and diabetic. She's the only reason I'm still here tbh. 

What do I do?

I used to be an artist. I gave that dream up last year. I have zero interest in painting or drawing again. I was never Picasso but I was decent. Doesn't matter though. 

My mom is narcissistic. My current bf is controlling and manipulative. (Says he's working on it.) And I'm a shitbag. 

I hate who I'm becoming. I've seen multiple therapists and I was getting better. Now I'm shit again.

I'm 27. I live with my parents again. I work part time from home. Job pays well and is a job I should feel special about, but I don't. All I do is lay in bed. As I am now. Feeling shitty. 

How do I stop?

Please help.",01Nov2019,1

36,"34M. I'm not a native speaker, so sorry for mistakes.

Hi, i live in Berlin, Germany. 

Since today is a tough one for me, with a lot of negative thoughts and stuff, i'm writing this just to tell it to someone and to get it a little bit out of my head.

I'm struggeling with depression and low selfesteem since i'm 18/19 years old.
At the time i left the religious group Jehova Witnesses (Parents and sister still in it) and my family got really angry and disappointed about it.
Also my mother was struggeling with heavy depressions through most of my youth.
Since then the contact got really loose. 

I went to therapies and was able to keep it together for quite some time.

But the last 5 years things started to go down.
Relationships and close friendships broke up, 3 grandparents died in 4 years and the stress and dissatisfaction in and about my Job (Chef), mixed with the usual depression stuff, took quite a hit on me.

So last year i missed some rental rates and paid them, as soon as i noticed. But obviously my Landlord sued me for leaving the apartment.

Since then, some part of me gave up and the depressions took complete control over me, even though i was able to hide them, most of the time. I started to live in a world of lies and kept all my problems to myself.

So two weeks ago i lost my Apartment. Since then i live in Hostels and Hotels.

I told my Parents about it, and they're helping me. But not without letting me know, that this is some kind of punishment for leaving the faith.

I still have my job and i'm financially stable for now. I hope that i will soon find a new place to call home, already made some applications. 
But obviously with a history (getting sued, losing apartment) like that, many Landlords will shy away. 

So yeah, today the mountain in front of me looks really big and i feel quite lonely, i'm literally crying right now.
But i'm trying to keep my head high and take one step after another. I dont want to lose to this shit.

Thanks for reading &amp; take Care!",01Nov2019,1
37,"I'm down, so far down in my mind, so lonely, so pitiful, so lost. I don't know what to do. I want to accomplish so much but I'm asking for what, what's the point of exerting any energy for what, for who? I need help, but I don't believe anyone can say anything to help me. I wish someone could help me, I wish I could help myself, but I don't know how. Some days are ok and then some other days I just plunge into this darkness. Where does it come from, how can I get back to being alive? How can I get out of this hole?",01Nov2019,14

39,"I’m too scared to follow through. The idea that if I harm and/or fail. That everyone will think it’s for attention kills my spirit on both sides. 
However I don’t talk to anyone because I also feel like they’ll think it’s for attention.  
Literally just lost all my friends for this reason. They don’t get it I just want to be ok.  I just want to feel in place, needed, loved something.  I have no reason to live.  Except for saving people pain and at this point it feels like there’s no one that would be hurt except for close family and even they’re distant. I’m scared to wake up because each day means a new person not wanting to deal or be around me. They get annoyed hey go away without really making it apparent what’s wrong That’s what neutrals tell me and what I’m interpreting it as. I’ve tried meds. I smoke weed. But at the end all I do is sleep and go to work.  Because thats all I can do. But even at work I’m too slow or people are just annoyed by me.  I don’t know what to do it feel like I’m grabbing in any direction for someone who won’t get tired of me. Im so tired of this.  It just get lonelier and lonelier. I’m not sure if I want anyone new because then it’s just more people leaving. It becomes an endless cycle.  All anyone wants me for is sex. I’m just fucjing done",01Nov2019,4

43,"I had a best friend. Am amazing person all around. I honestly lived for them. It was better some days, even. We had a falling out over something that really wasn’t a huge deal, and I’d like to fix it, but he won’t speak to me. It’s been months. It’s so much worse to have had something, and then have it ripped away. The only reason I haven’t ended it all yet is because Halloween is his favorite holiday, and I never want to hurt him again. Nothing works anymore. I’m not hungry. I don’t want anything. He deserved so much better. All I do here is cause pain. I really did try, guys. I don’t know what is left. He was all I really had at this point.",01Nov2019,1
