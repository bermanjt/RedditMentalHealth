0,"Hi I’ve never really posted to reddit but I figured I would give my thoughts in hope to receive some advice. 

I’m 21 years old and a senior in college. I’m writing because my depression recently has been the worst it’s ever been and I feel as though I’m at a breaking point. I’ve been depressed and have had anxiety issues ever since the beginning of high school. I’ve seen a few counselors but none ever lasted/helped. Last semester I saw a doctor about medication, which I was super hesitant to do, and all the meds did was making me feel exhausted and sick 24/7 so after a week I went off them. I saw people at mental health services which my school provides but it didn’t help whatsoever. 

I’ve talked to my mom about my issues and she has been very supportive but just can’t relate to my situation. I’m afraid to talk to my friends and others because I feel as though people will think I’m psycho and avoid me like the Black Plague. I have had a lot of trouble recently having any sort of friendships develop and just assume people won’t like me or will just turn on me sooner or later. 

A little background on me....
I recently studied abroad and had an amazing time with a great group of friends and had a gf. That ended when I had to leave to come back home and I realized just how shitty of a life I have back home. I have a few close friends but none that I see that often because they r from my hometown and not from my college. I fucked up college.... freshman year I tried to do too much... club sport and frat, so I didn’t get close to any group of friends and by sophomore year I was fucked. At this point as a senior I hang with some people but we aren’t close and it’s like a once a week thing. I’m usually isolated most the week. I’m super stressed about the the future and getting a good post-grad job, and forming a good social circle/ getting a gf. I feel like my life has gone so shitty and I’m to blame for it. I hate myself very deeply and can’t forgive myself for a lot of things from the past. I feel like no matter where I go, things will always get worse and I can’t change anything about it. I feel hopeless about the future and don’t have any motivation to continue on and live. I feel stuck and like the only way out is to kill myself, but in reality I don’t want to die. ",10Mar2019,3
1,"Im currently really depressed. I can't stop the thought that the world would be better off without me from sneaking into my head. Ive told my fiance this. He was supportive, but as of today he says he's done with my depression. I understand. I wouldn't want me either. But like the thing is, I know I'm not keeping up my end of household chores and such..I just literally feel paralyzed. It's like a darkness is pulling me down away from the light. I try to pick stuff up and then I see how much has gotten away from me and I cry. I try to play with my daughter and she laughs and all I want to do is cry. I want to be better, I just feel so stuck. I went through horrible depression the past three years, and I'm afraid of falling into it again. He wants me to snap out of it and be done with it. I don't know how and that overwhelms me and makes me cry more. I love him so much, but maybe he deserves more than me. ",10Mar2019,1
2," I'm feeling really bad, and injuring myself more than normal. I have ambien at home but I just wanna stop myself, how much is safe to take to just keep myself down for at least two whole days? I'm resisting any suicide attempts but I don't think I can without sedating myself for a really long time. I have other things to take but I guess ambien is the safest of them. ",10Mar2019,1
3,"I've had numerous kinds of treatment for depression. I'm currently weening from Effexor. Ive had depression most of my adult life in varying degrees. I'm wondering if I should inquire about electroshock therapy. Has anyone here had it and if so, what was your experience? ",10Mar2019,2
4,"Why do I refuse to start my medicine? I’ve been doing this for 20 years and I’m really sick of the medicine. It makes me feel blah and the sexual stuff has always bothered me.  The longest I’ve been on medicine was maybe a year. I go off and on and I just can’t handle the side effects. In my early thirties I was going to therapy and on medicine and was feeling pretty good. I moved and have never found someone else to talk to. Now I’m back to just feeling shitty all the time.

I have some new medicine called Viibryd and I am scared to start. I don’t know if I have the power to start again. I guess I’m scared I will feel better and then fall back even further. Im at a 5 right now. Maybe I’ll get to a 7 but risk going back down to a 2 or 3. Anyone know what I’m saying? 

I really don’t think I’m going to try my medicine again but maybe someone has some advice.",10Mar2019,2
5,"I was wondering how do you differentiate between needing a therapist and needing a psychiatrist? I've been a pretty big cannabis user for awhile now, and recently had a panic attack that ended me up in the ER. So I decided to quit cold Turkey and 2 weeks now and still kinda having passive thoughts about suicide, but I always tell myself I would never do it.
 And just move on about my day.. but I also get a wave of negative thoughts that I know are mediocre problems or things people have said to me in the past and it just keeps rolling on. One day I'll feel fine and convince myself it was something I ate or that I just got more sleep that day. Sometimes I'm a little paranoid, like he said this because of that or just that type of constant mindset. 

I've had this once before when I quit smoking and ended up getting diagnosed with general anxiety disorder.. took medication for probably 2 days because I thought it felt wayyy too intense (klonopin). I ended up eventually feeling better through exercise and eating right but I guess that made me think it was okay to start smoking weed again and that was about a 3 year period between these two episodes.

 I told my parents about this tonight and it kinda made me feel better but also made it more real. Like I was always saying it was my diet or the weather or whatever excuse it was for the day. 

I keep telling myself I need to just give myself some time away from the weed, which has been about 2 weeks now. But I'm at the point, where I know these thoughts aren't normal. Maybe the weed was just making my symptoms and made me feel better for awhile, but now I'm at the point where I want help. Because I dont want to end up without a job and homeless one day without any help and a bunch of mental issues. 

Do you truly need to hit rock bottom before you accept that you need medication?

6,"I'm tired of just being okay or depressed, I want to be happy. I'm 20, I don't talk to half my family as my brother has poisoned them and stole them (he raped me as a child and it came out last year, half my family don't believe me and I'm not allowed to see my nieces and nephews I love more than life itself.) I just feel like all I do is work just to survive. I work over 50 hours as a carer which I love but on my days off I just see my boyfriend or sit in the house. I don't like leaving my house as if I run into my old family they tell or give me dirty looks. I just feel so angry all the time. I don't want therapy, I don't want to remember what happened, I want to run away, I want to be free of this life. But what if I run away and I'm still sad and angry? What if I'm just broken and nothing I can do will fix it? Am I destined to be on anti depressants just to survive and scrape by? I don't even know if this is a question or a rant at this point, I just feel hopeless",10Mar2019,3
7,"At the point where I feel like everything is genuinely meaningless. All human relationships are pointless. I don’t have any desire to actually live a “regular” life anymore. It will never happen for me. 

The only time I’ve been genuinely happy since I can remember is when this girl was living with me for a week and when we were dating for four months after such. But she’s gone now since we live in different countries and can’t keep a relationship going living so far away. 

I feel like I have no genuine friends. No family members that really care about me (abusive parents). I hate feeling this every single day. I want to just stop feeling anything anymore. ",10Mar2019,3
8,"Last Oct 2018, I resigned to my full-time day job. I alloted time for myself to think what I really want and what I am passionate about (but still accept work from home job so I can still have money to support my needs). Last Feb 2019, I've been invited for interview and undergo training up to this date. I really love the environment, the people, and the culture there It feels like I already found my place, then my medical exam came and I was diagnosed with Tuberculosis (I don't smoke and drink alcohol, I'm not a party goer as well.) The company have to pull me out of the training. I cried all night because I'm constantly praying for this opportunity and I really want to be in it. Plus, I'm also problematic about my expenses. I'm losing hope. That feeling that you're not sad anymore but you feel lost and empty. I need help. :( ",10Mar2019,2
11,"I hate feeling like I’m not loved, I hate not feeling safe or cared for in my own home with people I used to be close to. I hate feeling like I burden my friends, they just drop me because I’m to sad all of the time. ",10Mar2019,10
12,"I can feel it. I can feel myself spiraling down into misery. I've cut off comms with my friends, even those I've known over 5 years, and considered closer than family. I'm about to completely isolate myself.

14,"I'm posting this on a throwaway because I feel like I post too much here on my main. I feel really alone tonight. I have no irl friends because they all left after I was diagnosed with depression, and my ex broke up with me after she told everyone about some personal stuff I told her. I'm afraid of being alone like this forever. I'm not sure what else to do other than post here.",10Mar2019,31
16,"I’m so fucking exhausted trying to conceal my depression from my family and friends and just people in general to try and pretend to be ordinary. I just want to be ordinary. 

I’m 17f, in fact only recently turned 17. Throughout my life I was raised by an autistic Dad and a careless mother. When I classify my mother as careless, I don’t mean she’d neglect me or anything major in that sense, but in inconspicuous ways she’d just not care. She can’t comprehend the concept that her daughter, someone who she perceived as sweet, shy, smart and innocent, has turned into this suicidal being and therefore every time I plea for help she’d ignore me. Completely. 

Despite this, my mother and I can be very close. I know how she believes mental illness is for the “snowflake generation” and that generation Z and millennials need to “pull their socks up and face reality” so I subconsciously try to hide it. I don’t want to tell the person who sees life as a gift and gave me life that I don’t want it anymore.

Every single day spent outside of school, I spend locked away in my room influctuating between consciousness and playing video games to ease the numbness or just sleeping. Most of the time I’m just sleeping to get away from this world. To get away from this aching numbness. 

My two friends are no help either- being the funny individual of the group, or at least used to, me expressing emotions is difficult for them to digest as I’m known for being the entertaining aspect of the group. Expressing how depressed I am is incompatible to their perception of me and therefore they begin viewing me in a distorted manner. She’s the funny one right? She shouldn’t be feeling depressed or emotion?

I’ve always been academic in school- I’ve just completed secondary school in which I’ve obtained a set of A stars and A’s. Granted access to one of the best schools in my area for A Levels. Though, despite how happy I was to attend my dream school, my attendance is deteriorating because I just can’t get out of bed. Getting out seems too much work and I have so much to catch up on. It just seems.. to much. Too fucking much. Too exhausting. Too overwhelming.

Weirdly enough, I have a love-hate relationship with loneliness. There are days in which I’m drinking and crying silently to myself on a Friday night to the early hours of Saturday morning longing why no one has loved me in the way my friends have relationships. Why am I so abnormal? Why can’t I sufficiently socially interact to people in a normal way? But then again, I *need* to be alone at some points. After a day at school, nothing feels better than to just hide in my room and go to sleep. I couldn’t interact anymore.

Now I’m borderline on an eating disorder. I haven’t been diagnosed properly yet, though it’s occurred to the extent that even my careless mother has been noticing and worrying. I barely eat one proper meal a day. On top of this she’s realised my excessive alcohol intake and lack of motivation to do anything. 


Please someone tell me what to do. I haven’t had a therapist yet, but each single day is getting slower and worst then the previous one and it just feels like I have this constant weight on my chest and anchoring my ankles down. My brain feels diseased.

17,"I feel so low and hurt and anxious all the time. I either feel nothing or just cry for hours. I can’t cope most of the time and when I can I am expecting the feeling to come back at any second which it always does. I’m scared I’m doing this to myself, that I’m making myself feel like this and I deserve to feel like it. Maybe I’m an attention seeker and actually enjoy feeling like this? I know in my heart I definitely don’t enjoy feeling like this. I just want to feel happy and normal and not scared and sad a paranoid and lonely and hurting. I don’t want to cry all the tine and sleep. I don’t know what’s wrong with me,",10Mar2019,6

21,"Hey guys! It's been a rough year for me, I was feeling suicidal,I was deep in depression. In August 2. I met my first ever girlfrien. She was the meaning of my life. Sadly, she left me because i only brought her down. After that, my depression kicked in, i had a lot of suicidal toughts,when she came back. In December 19. on my birthday we were back together. I felt like I was in heaven. We spent the New Years Eve together, we were really close to each other. On January 9th something changed. I was chatting with one of my ""friends"" on discord when i got a message from her, saying that she loved me,but I'm not the guy she thought i was. I got blocked, my accounts and phone number was blocked. I went to her house but only her dad was there, who told me to leave. I was shocked. I haven't slept a minute for about 70 hours. I was in zombie mode: drinking, eating, thinking. Since then, i had the chance to speak with her again, but then, after 2 days of speaking, she told me that I should get locked up, I am isane. It's been 3 weeks since then. I am a total wreck. I don't know how to get out of this. I can't sleep enough because I'm having dream with her, with my best friend dying and with my dead grandpa. They all speak to me in my dreams, they all say that I should die and I'm insane. I don't know what to do. I talked with my best and only friend about this, but she said that I'm just whining and I should be a man, not a pussy.

22,"How? How do you guys reach out.

It's like, yea i want help with my problems, but I just cant reach out. I walk by my school's councillor every day, and I just think, ""I'll talk to him about my shit tommorow,"" even though I *know* im lying to myself. I cant fucking tell anyone, my subconcious just says no.

Even when I want to, I just freeze up and try to cover myself. Like, I know reaching out is what I should be doing, I just mentally cant.

23,"I don’t have depression myself anymore, but suffered from it for several years in the past. My friend is dealing with depression now and I try to be supportive when she talks about it, which isn’t very often. I don’t bring it up with her or pry much beyond “how are you doing”.

Recently she started posting more about it on her social media, saying no one loved her, and stopped talking to me. She used to tell me a lot about what was going on in her life but lately every time I try to talk to her she doesn’t really respond, in person or in text. She just says “oh” or “hmm” or “yeah”. Not in a sad way. Just a reserved or uninterested way. Suddenly we’re just acquaintances. Nothing happened between us that I know of.

I figured she didn’t want to talk to me anymore (I have anxiety :/) so I didn’t push and just gave her space. 

Last night she posted something really worrying on her social media. It was a screenshot of her notes at 3:00am that said “I’m going to [crossed out] -self on tuesday”.

Later in the day she posted on her story saying “I’m doing something this summer so I’m not going to do anything stupid now.”

I don’t know if it’s a cry for help or how much she meant it or if she’s still going to do something but I’m scared. I’ve been where she is before. I don’t know if I should reach out because she has a lot of friends she’s much much much closer to and doesn’t seem to want to talk to me.

24,"I think I may have HFD and so I would like to know what HFD looks like for you. 

My story:

I had 5 hard years in a tough industry (read: trauma), then 3 years of getting over some painful physical injuries + supporting multiple friends and family who ""had it worse than me"".

While my situation has improved significantly, instead of feeling better, in the last 2-3 years I have just stopped feeling as much.

On the outside I look like a together, high achiever with a great job. Outside of my job and getting my mobility back my major achievements in the last two years include: establishing a sleep routine, not wearing the same clothes 24-7 and basic stuff like that. You wouldn't think to look at me, but those things have been really hard for me to do.

I thought I was just a secret failure until I read about HFD. If it's not HFD maybe I've got some kind of feelings burnout? I would like to know if others have had similar or different experiences. Thanks.",10Mar2019,3
25,"After a decade of depression, I've finally gotten to a strange place. I can't distract myself with media anymore. I just sit in a room. 

I've spent the better part of my life on a computer or my phone, but that isn't helping anymore. I've lost interest in my shows, sites, creative outlets, it's just all gone. I don't look forward to anything even a little and that's beyond anything I've dealt with before. I always had media to keep me occupied.

I shower once a week at most, I interact with people once a fortnight, I haven't cooked in months, I feel like I'm moving house every time I need to go outside because it's such a big undertaking, I don't have a job and looking for work is an impossible task

Therapists have told me they don't know what to do with me. I can't afford one now anyway. I was on medication for years and it didn't help. I've been off meds for a year now and feel mentally much better without them. I'm just really not sure what to do with myself",10Mar2019,11

32,"I feel happiness, I feel sadness. However, I'm neither happy nor sad, I'm just coasting through life peering through windows into the rooms that others are inside. Mostly, everything is dull, the excitement for arguably trivial things I used to experience is gone, along with my motivation and potential to achieve goals.

Seeing people either be happy or do 'happy' things makes me wonder what they did to deserve it, and, what I must of done to avoid experiencing such things for so long I only remember the memory of how I think it felt. I hate that it seemingly just comes to them, the lack of pessimism is infuriating.

&amp;#x200B;

Life started off as good as it's reasonable to expect - parents who love and care, who work hard to provide a decent leg up in life, a sibling I get along with well, live in a good area, went to a decent school, no crime, no traumas. Earlier on, school was enjoyable, I got top grades with minimal work, had a relatively large circle of friends. When everyone started to go out, get drunk and make fun memories I didn't. My A-Levels were a horrific drop off from the A's I got at GCSE with no work, now university is becoming another failure after a promising start.

I think I've had friends back in school, I see them occasionally, I'm mostly there for filler. At university there's no one, I was around people, just around, never really a friend. I'm around new people now and it's the same thing. I've never had any hint of a relationship, been friendly with a decent number of girls, never had a problem having normal conversations with them, never had the nice-guy/incel toxicity. Evidence would suggest I'm just not wanted in that respect, I understand, it'd be nice to get a peek into that world, but it's not a world I can visit.
