0,"My thoughts are mostly jumbled right now, but I need to get this off my chest somehow, everyone of my support people are busy with work or other things right now, so here it goes.

I've had depression for over two decades, so I know this isn't the end of the world. These feelings making me feel trapped in my own head. Like life is pointless, meaningless. Like I'm worthless. I know it isn't, I know I'm not. But convincing the part of my brain responsible for these invasive thoughts isn't easy.

I haven't showered in days. I've skipped all my physical therapy for over a month, I just skipped my follow up appointment with my PCP today because I was too anxious to try to find a ride, I don't feel worth anyone's time and effort to go. It feels like the doctor is just wasting her time on me.

I had a break down a few days ago, the likes I haven't had in about 7 years. The kind of breakdown I thought was part of my past alcoholism. I just started crying for no reason, then my head filled with thoughts of self harm, death, extreme worthlessness. I felt like no one really loves me, that even my husband is just pulling some long game elaborate prank on me. Just using me so he only has to pay half the bills. I made my way to the living room where I totally lost it. I cried so loud it was like a banshee wailing. I was trying to smother the sound with a pillow, but he heard and came out. When he put his hand on me I screamed like I was being hurt, over and over again. I cried like that for over two hours. I'm feeling close to that point again right now.

I've been on so many medications, tried different dosages, and combinations. They all made me an emotional zombie, or made the worthless feelings shoot to like maximum intensity to where just ending it seemed like the best option.

Right now ending it doesn't sound so bad, the only real thing keeping me from doing it is it would negate my life insurance and I can't leave my husband to fend for himself like that. 

I don't think this post really has a point. I'm just trying to avoid turning into a screaming, sobbing, snot dripping mess right now while I'm home alone. 

Thanks reddit. Even if nobody reads this far, at least this gave me a place to scream into the void for a bit.",30Oct2019,1
1,"Hey beautiful people!   


I just wanted to throw out some love, support, and hugs to all of you! AND to post about some of the things that've helped me battle the ol' ""Noon Day Demon"", As Andrew Solomon called it. (\^\_\_\^)  


(And I totally understand that everybody's different. What's helped me might not be so helpful for someone else. this is just to offer some hope, if I can-)  


*Legit,* if you haven't watched Andrew Solomon's TED talk on depression, I definitely recommend it. He describes in words what is so *hard* to tell people about depression. Fella's a genius.   


And that brings me to the first thing that's helped, as silly as it might sound:   


YouTube.   


TED Talks.  
   
There's also a channel called Ben Lionel Scott that has some *seriously* kick-butt motivational videos. They make me wanna walk outside, draw a sword, and battle some bad guys. Bad guys who would easily take me down, due to my pipsqueak size but-hey- the thought is totally epic!  


Laughing helps get the ol' serotonin' going too, so check out QPark's public dancing videos (I PROMISE you won't be disappointed!)   


The Second thing (And I feel like I should have mentioned this *first.*) :   


***Please*** *don't be hard on yourself.*   


Seriously. Truly. Don't be *mean* to yourself. Because more than likely someone has *already* been mean to you, and that's one of the reasons you're struggling as you are now. Because you've *already been made to feel horrible*. And now your own brain is attacking you.   


Be PROUD of yourself, instead.   


Because- you know what?- you're here, you're still fighting. You're battling monsters on a daily basis, more than most humans have to deal with.  


Thirdly:  


Stay active on forums. Join MORE forums, if you can.   


I think it helps us feel like there is more of a community, around us!   


Ya know how they say, ""It takes a village to raise a child?""   


Well, I think it takes a village to help *heal* one, as well.   


There's a beautiful picture online of a group of people standing around someone, and all of them are holding onto the person, offering support and kindness. (I'm paraphrasing, but the reason was that the individual was emotionally suffering from a loss of some kind, and this was the village's custom)  


Fourthly (Uh, is that I word? Crap):   


Baby. Steps.  


Don't try to do too much at once; even a beaver takes five years, sometimes, to build a dam! And Rome wasn't built in a day.  


 Start small, do *one* habit daily, such as making the bed. Eventually, it will snowball.   


Other Thoughts: 

You can *do* this. I know you can. You are someone with a storm inside you, and right *now* you're in the eye of it, surrounded by viscious winds and watching the chaos all around. You can MAKE IT OUT. I believe in you.   


And- again- in case no one has told you today, I'm *proud* of you. ❤",30Oct2019,3
2,"I used to struggle with really bad depression, but despite constantly feeling like life was worthless, I never made any serious attempt to take my own life. The worst I would do is hold some pills in my hand or sit by some bleach, not really acting on anything. Recently , especially within the last week, I've been having some bad panic attacks followed by suicidal ideation and a general feeling of not wanting to be alive. I really want to talk to somebody, but sometimes it's too much emotional effort to find a family member or friend to talk to in the middle of such strong feelings. My question is, is it selfish to call the hotline if I have never made a serious attempt on my life and probably won't do anything to harm myself? At what point do I qualify to call? Is it just for people who want to die and are in a really bad place, or do I have to be in active danger of myself?",30Oct2019,1

There are SO many things I want to tall about here but I just cant cause me father sees and read over all and I mean ALL my out going messages and because of that the really deep things I want to talk about may never be spoken, the kind of things you rather talk to a stranger about and not someone close.

4,"So i am 16 M just wondering if this sounds like depression. So about a few years ago I noticed I wasn't as happy as I normal would usually be. I started finding the things I usually enjoy or find funny not anymore. I didn't hate these things I just didn't enjoy them. Fast forward a year or two pretty much everything Is like this and I was super desperate too feel happy so I tried weed. It was actually great for a short period of time until I started smoking daily for about 7 months. During this time the effect it had on me began too ware off and It wasn't an uplifting effect on me anymore if that makes sense it seems like it started to make the problem worse. People say it isn't addictive but I couldn't go a day without out it for so long I had to do it to make my self feel anything really. It wasn't even to feel happy it would just take my mind off everything and kind of suppress the no feelings I already have. At this point I new I was abusing it and I had to stop but I didn't want to go back too feeling nothing. Its not that I was sad but I picture it as the mind is an empty plane like a void. And emotions are like cars going over hills going up and down and experiencing highs and lows but too me its like a void almost like a flat surface going for miles with nothing. Its almost like static on a tv instead of an actual movie or show. Because I invested myself in weed I thought It would be good try try mushrooms. Ive heard they are life changing and have amazing effects long after a person takes them. I thought this was the answer to my problems. And the first experience I had was genuinely amazing. It was the first time in years I had felt genuine emotion I was super happy and sad like a roller coaster. The effect only lasted so Manny hours and had a short term effect into the next few days but wasn't permanent.  At this point in time ive done them about 5 too 6 times and they are great in the moment but don't really change anything. Im hesitant too get help because I don't want to have ""depression"". I don't want anti-depressants becasue they fuck you up real bad. So I decided it was time to stop smoking daily not by choice but by not having a job and money to afford it. So I was kinda forced too stop and its been around a month now that I stopped only smoking occasionally and now its like a fog in my head. Like nothing.  I dont know why but ive been hesitant to ask for help for years now and I dont know what todo. Sorry for the long story",30Oct2019,3
5,"I am interviewing for a job tomorrow, but I am feeling sick about it - like the job is some horrible shitty deal, when I know that it is just a job, neither good nor bad. I also have anxiety about transportation, so I am taking the bus. 

I tried getting to the jobsite on my scooter today (in advance of tomorrow's interview) but I cannot cross bridges (which is anxiety related). The bus will get me close enough to walk the rest of the way. 

I am anxious about going to the very outskirts of town, somewhere that I have not been before. I am anxious because I am unemployed. I am anxious about the interview. I am anxious about having to walk to the jobsite from the bus stop. I am anxious about the job's distance. It seems like every little thing is causing me anxiety. 

My last job alternated between being good and being horrible, and it was never stable. When I got laid off, it was both freeing and depressing at the same time. The job did not pay well. 

I just feel unbalanced, not in a good place. I am trying to do self-care, and it does help, but things feel so out of place. The job boards are a wall of listings, just garbage - but it's not garbage. I did apply to some jobs, that's how I got this interview.

7,"I’ve been dealing with another bout of depression, and I’ve alienated anyone and everyone who could possibly care or try to take. 

I’ve rapidly changed medications multiple times in the last 4 months to try and curb whatever it is I’m dealing with, my constant need to hate myself. 

I was changed to another Rx last week. It seems slightly better, say 10%. I keep having manic episodes, not sure if that’s related. But I’m really to a point where I’ve detached from everyone and everything.

Aside from my normal self-doubt/hate/apathy I have an overwhelming desire to run; flee. I want to leave everyone, everything I know and have behind. To leave behind all the fake friends, the social and financial hardships. Just everyone and everything. I’m so sick and tired of being here. I hate this city, I hate this town, I hate this house, I hate everything and everyone around me.

No body believes me because I’m always smiling and laughing and making stupid jokes. People think I’m a quirky hippie artist girl, but honestly I’m just sad. Most of the people my small school think I’m crazy and judge me. My roommates obviously don’t Actually enjoy my company, they just enjoy my input of rent. My professors don’t understand my depression and how it inter fears with my homework and attendance, it’s my fault I’m a bad student. I moved 15 hours away from home, I lost all my childhood friends, I don’t even know what my family is like anymore... I never go home.... im just sad, I don’t mean to complain but nobody believes me when I say I’m sad.

9,"My depression has always been severe, and I experience most symptoms other than an increase in energy and appetite. The worst symptom I used to have was intense pain in my chest as if someone were trying to rip out my heart. However, I just had my worst depressive episode ever, and it lasted for about a month.

My symptoms were:

1. Feeling as if I weigh a ton, and have immense difficulty moving
2. Nausea
3. Aforementioned chest pain
4. Tunnel vision
5. Blacking out

Every time the sun went down, and sometimes during the day, these symptoms would occur simultaneously and in very high intensity at the drop of a hat. I never felt it coming, it was like a switch being flipped, and then I would suddenly be filled with the worst dread I had ever experienced and feel my head floating away from my body from the sheer intensity of the depression. 

I'm not necessarily looking for sympathy, I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this as I've never heard of depression getting this bad and am wondering if something else may be wrong.",30Oct2019,2

Anyway yesterday morning about half an hour after opening a guest jumped off the bridge to their death. I didn’t see it happen, I was greeting guests at a different area so I only heard everyone on the radio. 

I used to get suicidal thoughts when I was a teenager, and I go through really bad depressive episodes every once in a while. The last one was about two weeks in late March/early April. 

I was doing so well with being happy and having a good time, but this is pushing me down the spiral again. We had a counsellor on site today so I spoke with them for a bit about how I’m feeling and when I left the session I felt a bit better, though now that hours have passed since then I don’t feel okay anymore. 

I never learned a healthy way to deal with when I get this way, I always just ignored it until it goes away and ignore the feelings when I have them. It never works out well but like I said, I never learned a different way to cope.

14,"Just had a breakdown. I don’t know what to do anymore everything just seems pointless. The thought of suicide kinda seems not so bad since I wouldn’t have to stress about anything anymore. I won’t because I’m too scared to, but I’m just in a bad place. My whole life has been nothing but disappointment. I’m not diagnosed but I’ve always felt I’ve had depression and anxiety (especially when it comes to socializing.) I can’t figure out how to go about talking to a doctor about plus I wouldn’t want to be put on medications. I just want to be happy. 

There’s so many negative forces in life and my past that I can’t get over. I’m alone and no one understands how messed up this world is. I can’t get myself out of the hole I was born in no matter how much I try to climb. I end up being my worst enemy a lot of the time. I feel like if I try talking to anyone they’d either not understand or blow things out of proportion and act like it’s because of something else. 

My childhood was shit. My parents are both selfish, greedy, manipulative, and all around not there for me like a parent should. I’m not even in contact with my dad anymore so proves how much he wants me. The only time he contacts me is to tell me about all the stuff he has (new truck, boat, house, etc.) I can’t even believe when my mom tells me she loves me since she won’t give up drugs and all that. All I have is my boyfriend and siblings. I don’t even have any friends anymore since high school ended which I already knew was gonna happen. Also I feel like I’m just weighing my boyfriend down by being a stupid failure. I’m 20 now and whenever things are going okay life just knows how to make me look like a joke. I can’t even get myself a car (previously had one that I bought from my uncle tho that was a mistake since it broke down and I had to junk it, basically he screwed me over.)

I know this is a lot and i don’t really know what I’m posting this for. I just don’t want to struggle anymore to make ends meet. I’m so sick of being dirt poor. I’m so sick of not being able to function like a normal human being. I just want to be at peace. I don’t know.",30Oct2019,1

I mean there are times I feel not ok due to different reasons (being on my period, having exams, etc.), but this is a very strange feelings.

It's so weird that EACH time I hear something sad, I imagine myself being in that situation; for example, I was chatting with a guy some days ago and he was telling me about his life and how he regrets cheating on his girlfriend when they both had a daughter. I immediately imagined being that daughter and felt so bad and wanted to cry. Yesterday, one of my aunt's friends died (she had breast cancer) and I saw that her daughter was shocked after her mother died. I suddenly imagined losing my mom and wanted to cry. 

The problem is that I can't pour out my feelings and simply cry. It's a very strange feeling since I don't know what I miss or why I'm even feeling this way.

Has anyone here had this experience? If yes, what did you do to get better? Should I just wait to get better or I should do something about it? If yes, what should I do?

25,"Hi everybody, first I hope I'm not disturbing people who seek for help, because I'm not the depressed one. 

Lately I feel like I'm not helping my boyfriend, sometimes he's really sad, looses all hopes and doesn't want to live anymore, he says I'm not helping, or sometimes I make him feel really not worth, it hurts him.

I often make the mistake of justifying me, saying I'm sorry I didn't notice soon enough, I just feel like I'm looping on myself and can't switch to a safe way of talking to him, listen to him. Just not feeling safe for him.

So, I know everyone is different and living different experiences on depression, but if you could help me find better words, give me advices to improve my way of standing at his sides, helping, or just being safer, that'll be a great great help.

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",30Oct2019,32

I've had mental health problems for most of my life. Taking vitamin D and spending time in the sun is easily one of the best things I've ever done for my mental and physical health. Doctors and therapists don't tell you about this because you want you to keep coming back, then prescribe pills that don't treat the underlying symptoms.

32,"I have dysthymia or persistant depressive disorder. 

Here's an overview

I was 18 working 55 hours a week with a girlfriend and also going to school. I got certifications in my field that people usually dont get until they are 26 to 30 on average. I was making 16 an hour in florida which was double the minimum wage at the time and much higher than anyone my age was making.

I ended up going to work for Dell and was on the way to becoming a manager for my department within 2 years and began being groomed for it...

Then it started.

I started having more issues and irritation with my commute. Simple things started to become harder to do. 

I started fighting with my girlfriend and treated her unfairly- and it didnt occur to me that my actions were anything but how I really felt.

I started to not come to work. I started making excuses and staying home just to look at the wall or browse on the computer.

I started sleeping much more during the day and staying up late at night.

Before I knew it, I quit before I was let go.. I'm losing the love of my life, and ive currently been unemployed for two years.

I'm 22. I dont care if anyone around me lives or dies. Ive completely separated myself from every person i knew and deleted all my social media. I cant feel bad emotions or good ones. I dont feel good for helping others and I dont care if people are suffering. 
I'm sitting here wasting my life, out of resources, leeching off family for survival.. I gained 80 pounds (no eating disorder) and I gave myself blood pressure in the range of 163 over 104 ish.

I gave my family my gun because I didnt trust myself. 

I dont feel anything. I don't hate myself. I don't have interest in anything.

Not to come off the wrong way but I have an iq of 127 and I can guarantee that everyone ive associated with in my life was well below 100.

Nothing stimulates me. Nothing holds my interest. I sold my car for a motorcycle and drove at 100 mph on the way home with no experience riding a bike and didnt feel scared or excited. 


I have tried 3 medications. Wellbutrin, lexapro, prozac all at varying doses for over a month each.

Help me- I have no idea how to feel anything anymore and have lost most if not all memory of my past. I'm probably going to be dead within 6 months or a year when my family cant take care of me anymore. If you have ever been in my situation- this is dire. Please share anything that you believe could help me.

Thank you for your time",30Oct2019,1

35,"They always say, “If you need someone to talk to, just reach out.”

My life at the moment is a mess.
I’m like £3,000 in debt, which my partner doesn’t know about, this obviously effects my credit score baldly. Yet, she’s consistent on getting a mortgage, which obviously won’t happen for me. She also wants to get married, have a kid and or dog.. all things that I can’t offer her. And probably not for a long, long time. And it makes me feel useless and irrelevant. She could easily find someone else better and who can give her what she wants. 
Haven’t spoken to my best mate in almost 4 weeks, probably doing good without me dragging him down and or holding him back.
Insecure. 
Over worked with little to show for it. Exhausted. 
Overthinking. 
I have no savings and I’ve been working for 6 years I’m well paid jobs, which shows how bad I am financially. 
I can’t drive. 
Failed my CBT test...TWICE, which I was told is impossible to fail. Useless. 
Where I’m constantly changing jobs, my partner didn’t want to keep telling her parents I’ve recently left my job, so they still think I work where I worked two jobs ago. 
I’ve had and life long ambition to be a musician, but just too embarrassed to tell my partner, thinking she’ll laugh at me and find it pathetic. Which makes me not want to make and definitely not release any music. Definitely can’t write anything around her in case she questions it.

Just fails after fails.

37,"I really don’t know if this is the right place to post this, so correct me if I‘m wrong. Basically, my life has gone to shit. My parents are middle class and we live in a developed country, so I should have the perfect conditions to thrive. That’s just not the case. I‘d like to do this chronologically, so here’s the start of the shitshow named my life: my parents married sometime in the late 90s, I don’t care enough to look up when it was exactly. Now, you might ask: was this the perfect love story? Far from it. My mom had already wed once before and my father is a chronic cheater who never even loved her. Best combination, right? It’s a miracle that their marriage even held that long, but I was finally born in 2002. My parents had tried to get a kid for so long, that they actually decided to adopt one after multiple failed pregnancies. So, in July 2001, they adopt my brother. He is the kid of some druggie and was left alone in the hospital for multiple weeks, which might explain his behaviour later on. Soon after that they receive the good news: My mom is pregnant with me as well. Here’s a bit of a jump because I don’t remember my early childhood, of course. Until 2011 my life seemed perfect. I was great in elementary school and even skipped a grade. However, I didn’t have much contact to my family. My father always promised to do something with us but did jack shit and he came home around 7PM. My brother had learning difficulties so my mom naturally spent most of her time helping him. I was alone in my room, basically the whole day. Bad habits started forming like a low work ethic with homework, bad hygiene and so on and so forth. I was bullied as well, but it didn’t bother me. But until this point in time, it’s fairly ok. Good, even. Then comes the abomination, the hellhole, the absolutely most disgusting and vile place on earth: my secondary school. Let’s just call it Gymnasium Duketon. I don’t know why, but around that time, my mother though that it would be a great parenting move to sit with her son until midnight and tell him how much everything sucks while crying. She told me that my father threatened to move out every week, that he cheated on her shortly after the wedding, that he cheated on her multiple times with prostitutes and that everything was sooooo much better with her earlier partner.  Great fucking things to tell a 9 year old! This went on and on and on until now. I always got to know what was happening. Oh he signed up on tinder? Good to know. He blames you for being a sick depressive fuck? Thanks for sharing. He thinks we are more of a cohabitating unit than a family, although he and my brother are literally the reasons for that? I‘m glad you told me mom. I even got to see some of the pictures on his phone from other women, just this past summer while he took a family picture. How ironic. My mother isn’t a saint as well. She’s got no friends, no hobbies and blames me for everything. To this day I wonder how they got through the adoption check by social services. At the same time, school work is going well. And I have many friends both outside of school and good classmates. Oh and I have a girlfriend as well, the love of my life and the only one who ever understood me. Then comes 8th grade. For whatever reason, classes get mixed and I end up in a completely different surrounding. All of my new class mates are two years older than me and I don’t find friends. Shortly after the school year begins, my parents forbid me to meet my gf, my brother punches my best friend with a stick, starting a neighbourhood war, and my old friends from my town switch schools. I am completely isolated. Before class begins, I regularly lock myself into the toilet and wait until 8AM. But I have one hope: the guy who I met in a course for highly gifted individuals is joining my class. I just have to wait until that. However, he sees me as a rival of some sorts, and is a completely changed person. I am isolated that whole year. And at the end of it, the bullying starts. In 9th grade, I hit a new low. I was craving social contacts so much that I allowed the guy to make fun of me and still invited him to my birthday. He invented a funny game: trying to destroy my confidence. He would attack me without cause, calling me a bad person, attacking my looks, although he‘s the definition of a neckbearded nice guy and so on and so forth. I am devastated. I cry myself to sleep every night. My parents don’t care, of course. In fact, at the end of 9th grade, I’m contemplating suicide. It never got to a planning stage, I just tried to stop breathing or press my head into the bed until I passed out. It never worked, needless to say. At the same time, I loose a sense of reality. I don’t care anymore. What is this shit even worth, if everyone I ever know is bound to leave me? The only thing that saved me was the graduation. Only three more years, I thought. 10th grade was the same as 9th grade and in 11th grade I didn’t even care about anything anymore. I bought train tickets to Hamburg or Berlin or Copenhagen, just wanting to get away. At the end, I got my diploma with an above average grade. Instead of saving me, it pulled me down. I was extremely unhappy with my life, my grade and I lost the few acquaintances that I had. So i decided to do something against all of that, and enrolled for a CAIE A Level class. I also took the SAT and got a 1490. but it never got better. I am still unhappy with my life and everything seems to get worse. I have no connection with anybody. Just today, I thought that I reached my breaking point. I apply to US colleges this year and I wanted to send my early decision application today. But, being underage, my mom said no. She sat in my room crying how I could leave her and so on and so forth. She told me that she should have given me away and that I am an ungrateful asshole, proclaiming that they bought me everything I wanted. After that, my brother argues with my mother and tells her that I am a useless waste of space that nobody loves. My father sits in the living room, reading news or probably writing with other women. This has been my daily routine for the last 5 years or so.  I don’t know what to do.",30Oct2019,3
38,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’ve been super sad lately and I don’t have anybody to talk to. So at the beginning of this semester I started talking to this girl. We went on a few dates but I thought at the time I didn’t want to be in a relationship so we mutually decided to stay just friends. After this though I realized how much I actually like her. Since then we’ve become really close friends and we hang out often, but I’m too worried to tell her I still like her due things being weird if she doesn’t feel the same way. I think about her all the time and I’m just stuck in this endless cycle of hopefulness that she will show that she likes me as well.
