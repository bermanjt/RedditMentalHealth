0,"I’m sorry in advance of this triggers anyone with it being about a heavy subject 

So I normally don’t talk about these things to other people since all I usually get back is “I’m sorry” or something else like that..but earlier this month on the 21st of December to be exact I just felt like I’ve been at my lowest and worst point and I just tried to kill myself with an overdose of the antidepressants I’m supposed to take..it didn’t work obviously instead I passed out but nobody seemed to care and just thought I was asleep, I didn’t tell my family since I’m scared they’ll yell at me again if I do 

Because of that it’s just put me off of wanting to even take them and even when I do it doesn’t work all the time so I’m just looking for some advice on what to do about it since I don’t feel any better haven’t since Christmas was so bad for me too..thanks in advance",27Dec2019,1
1,"Long story short since escaping an abusive parent that financially supported me I've been jobless and I'm running out of money (don't worry I'm not asking for any money, just advice). This is a time in my life where I need to double down, try and get a job, and get my shit together. Because if I don't I'll literally won't be able to pay my bills and live, right? 

Well that last part is certainly true. But ever since three months ago I've had a terrible depression (and also symptoms of ptsd) and it's been getting worse. I always feel empty, unmotivated, and tired. Things I used to enjoy I don't anymore. I don't really feel much of anything lately except for emptiness, boredom, and sometimes anger. I'm 100% certain I have ptsd and depression but can't get a diagnosis until I get an appointment with a psychiatrist and that'll take a month with my free public health insurance. So not only am I not able to function with my depression with things like eating and sleeping let alone job seeking, I'm in a situation where I can't immediately get help *and* where if I don't get a job within the next month I'll be fucked. Is there any way I can cope or did method I can do to get myself mentally sound enough to get a job, at least until I can get the treatment I need?

4,"I’ve posted about this on reddit before but I’ll just share it again. I’m a 15 year old boy and my parents are divorced. It’s a pretty normal situation on the surface but what isn’t normal is my parents never agreeing and ignoring each other causing my life to plummet every other week. They got divorced when I was 3 years old and my first memory is them fighting and I just remember the fear and confusion of it all. My second memory is a man shooting up on the side of the street (downtown San Diego). At the time my mom was trying to live big off the money she took from my dad who was forced to leave because he couldn’t take her anymore which I don’t blame him a bit for. My mom bought a brand new jaguar and started business to show my dad that she’s better without him, all of it failing and it eventually led to us homeless with no where to stay for months. That’s when my dad really started fighting for more than 50/50 custody (I was around 7). But since my mom was broke and homeless she decided to try and take me away to live with my grandma in Texas, however to do that she had to lie to me about my dad being a drug user and alcoholic. He’s not any of those terrible things my mom said he was, he’s my favorite person and I love him more than anything. But I was young at the time so I was easily convinced otherwise and was coached on what to tell the court mediator when asked about my dad. Luckily the woman saw through it and called my mom (in court papers) an ""unfit parent and irresponsible in almost every manner.” And as you can imagine this messed me up pretty bad for a while because I simply didn’t know what to believe. Eventually I got old enough to see how verbally abusive she is and finally saw my dad as the man he is. But I still am forced to be with my mom 40% of the time (10% got taken because she pushed me down a staircase after she got pissed at me for not being good enough on Mother’s Day). I think about suicide everyday and i tried it 9 times, and because I was to scared I didn’t ever go through with it. However I went to the hospital every time it happened, so now I can’t be bothered to even muster the strength or willpower to go through with it. Because I’m known as the funny and dark humored kid I can’t break character at school, this has me meet friends that don’t really like me for me, they like the jokes that cover my internal suffering. I’m only doing this thread to vent, I can’t tell anyone how much pain I’m really in or else I’ll either sound like a little bitch and be told to deal with it or back to the hospital. So I deal with it, I deal with it because it’s just not fair to others for me to die and they don’t deserve whatever pain they would feel because of it.  I have 2 real good friends that know about me for me and love me for me. One of them moved to Texas and I haven’t seen him since he left, we talk sometimes but it kills me not seeing him like I used to. He got me through some tough times so I really miss him. And the other friend is a girl, and we really click well together. I’ve loved her for a whole year now and I never stopped thinking about her, she’s the person I can feel safe around and really be happy around. I love her so damn much and it kills me everytime I see her nowadays. I just really want to tell her, the worst part is, right as I was telling her I was dating this other girl she told me later she was going to ask me out that day. It’s probably the biggest mistake I’ve ever made, I know I’m young but i feel such a strong bond with her and now that I’m single and lonelier than ever I’d love more than anything to be with her. But you know how it goes, she’s dating a guy that she really loved, and I’m happy for her. All I really want is for her to be happy. I just can’t help but feel my heart break and cry everytime she talks about how much she loves him and vise versa. And on another note I cold turkey’d anti depressants 4 months ago because I didn’t like how they made me feel. I just feel worse now, i would never kill myself. But god damn it, supporting my mom even though I hate it, getting over the girl of my dreams, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts every single day. It’s just wearing me down and it doesn’t feel like it’ll ever end. Oh and i failed to mention my mom is unemployed, so I was the one giving presents and not her. If you’ve actually read this whole thing I applaud you, and I also ask, what should I do to help myself.

8,"Spilling my guts here with life depression and stress, so here goes/buckle up: 

Been depressed for my whole life. Had a really hard time growing up (not many friends, being ostracized), and compensated by focusing on school, which I was always good at. Depression runs in my family. Never felt like I had a community or a support system. Tried therapy as a teen, but I felt judged by therapists I went to, which made things harder. 

This bled into relationships - feelings of self loathing and depression tended to push people away. Everyone I ever dated cheated on me or left me for a guy (I’m a queer woman), which made my self esteem worse (being cheated on is bad enough, but when you're depressed about being queer, being left for a guy tends to validate your feelings of worthlessness about being queer - that's another story for another post). 

I've been in a relationship now for over a decade, married. Learned end of 2018 that my wife cheated on me with a guy. My biggest trigger for self-loathing/hatred. I’ve been in therapy since, on antidepressants, which kind of help, but I’m still angry and sad a lot. I understand through therapy that my depression set up a situation where she felt alone in the relationship, but I feel like, while I’m healing and trying to be better, I don’t really get supported by my wife. 

As a key example, I have recognized I have some suicidal ideation sometimes. Before this year, I used to express that regularly, at least every couple weeks, and I consider it a big success that I’m down to once every month or every other month, when my depression gets to be worst. My depression used to include suggesting that we break up, and I haven't done that in months. I don’t even feel suicidal right now, I feel like I’m improving a lot, my deepest depressive moments are clearly hormonal, and pills and therapy both help - my coping mechanisms are so much better.

While I’m getting better, she’s also been in therapy. And in a lot of ways, I feel like I’m getting the weight of her ""healing"" put on me and very little appreciation for the work I’ve been doing to better myself/help things get better. And I don't mind being asked to help her, she deserves to be helped and supported, but I feel I deserve some support and appreciation, too. This week, I learned she has a ""safety plan"" to get out of the house if I ever express anger or suicidal thoughts (as noted, I'm doing that wayyyyy less than ever before in our years of being together), but for some reason that makes me feel worse - like I’m now responsible for her well-being, along with my own, and I really need more support rather than less (yes, I understand the irony). I’ve never been a danger to her or anyone else physically, and it freaks me out that she feels she needs a plan to be ""safe"" from me, and has set back the work I've done in therapy a good bit.

It feels right now that she’s way more on edge and trusts me less than when I was in a way worse place - almost like, the more I’m getting better and healing, the less trust and support I feel. I want her to feel safe, and I'm glad she's working on figuring out how to do that, but it feels like she somehow is less supportive today, when I'm proving myself and improving myself, than she was when I was at my most depressed and treating her and our relationship way worse. 

I think she does still love me, I know I still love her even with all this, but we're in a really dark time, holidays add so much stress, and we're both trying to heal from things that end up sometimes in conflict. 

But to sum up, I kind of feel like I'm doing this all on my own, and I want to keep being better and getting better, but don't know how to do that without feeling any support from the person who matters most. 

Assuming things stay the same for a while, and I think they will, anything that anyone can suggest, even if it’s like “read this great book” or an activity or coping mechanism or something aside from therapy and pills would be great. Or if anyone got out of anything similar and is doing better now. Or if anyone just has a positive thought to send my way. I do want to feel better, and I'm willing to be proactive about it. Thanks in advance everyone, and thanks for this subreddit, and if anyone read this all the way through, huge thanks for even being willing to do that.",27Dec2019,1

10,"Hey all, 
My name is Jacob I’m 21 and a student in college. I’ve battled with depression for most of my life, it started when I was about 14 I think and has come in waves ever since. I can’t even really describe why either it’s just some days I’m ok and other days I’m just there, you know? Most of my problems come from lack of social interaction I think. I’m a pretty introverted person when it comes to new faces, but with people I know and I’m comfortable around I’m super energetic, goofy, and just dumb for lack of a better term haha. But when I’m in classes or around people or out on the town I don’t know what it is. If I don’t have an enabler, like a friend I’m comfortable with, or I’m just having a good time I just can’t bring myself to say a word. The way I described it to my dad, who’s way more outgoing than me, is that it’s like I’m an extrovert trapped inside of an introvert, if that makes sense? All I want to do is talk to people but I can’t get over what would happen if they don’t like me or such. All I’ve ever wanted is for people to like me but I just can’t get over the fear of what happens if they shut me down, think I’m boring, or other things.

And as such I suffer the consequences, I’m lonely and my depression from lack of socializing comes back. I live alone right now, it’s nice but I hate the downtime. And I know I should get out and do things but I just can’t. I’m constantly tired. I guess I’m not as depressed as other people are, but I’d like some advice if you could give me some. I’m all ears.

11,"How do I say this? My family is both good and bad, I'm always the joke of the family, and my mom hates me because I don't get involved with school activities, that's because I am happy as I am. I get yelled at, beat, slapped, and punched by my mother. And then the next day, she goes on telling me how much she loves me. My parents are divorced.


 My dad occasionally curses at me. My problem is that I feel that my family pretends to love me, but deep in their heads they absolutely wish I was dead. I've been feeling like this since 2017. I'm only 14, and I hide my pain by being humorous and a minor jerk, but loving person. I cry every night, because I just don't feel loved. I want to be loved, but I don't want love.

13,"I always value little things in friendships like being asked how you are or giving hugs. For years I've near always asked whoever my best friend is at the time how their day was or something like that and (other than 1 person who turned out to be a manipulator) I've only been asked how my day was first in a conversation prob 4 times. This makes me amazingly sad cause I always think that asking someone first on how their day was shows how much you care about them, but I'm almost never ever asked first and since people basically always ask you back after you do it never feels like they really mean it or care. On another case I got a friend in really close with and I'm really cuddly towards and she is as well but whenever she and i are around one another I'm always the one to go over to her first or hug her first and she will hug back but like before she never hugs me first, she is like the only person who even hugs me. I always feel like I'm left out and ignored most always with school clubs being the only exception and since I'm online most the time the only ever time some one asks me or even says anything to me are on rare occasions, very rare occasions. I mean I can remember the last time some one asked me something similar to how are you, it's when a friend of mine came over and ask something like ""what's wrong?"" because I was crying to myself in class and basically trying to bite part of my hand off cause I was trying to not look like a wimp in the middle of class. I just feel so neglected by most my friends and even when I did say to my friend I'm cuddle with about how I'm sad that no one ever asks me how I am first on a conversation (though I was kinda alot sleep deprived, so it may not have been too clear). If yall got any advice for how I should or even if I should tell my friends about this because I think I'll just sound like a needy burden if I do",27Dec2019,1

Stress and Depressed.....I just want to feel better

I don't know what to do. I never want to leave my house unless its for work, doctors, food, or something that is a necessity. I have completely stopped all habits, even bad (not really by choice, since when I am not working I just sit inside and play video games, watch movies. I tell myself many times I want to ""end my life"". But honestly, I am too much of a coward and scared to do something like that....what I mean is I want this part of my life to end. Every now and then, I get this feeling of euphoria. I feel on top of the world and so excited, I am confused at what I should do next. It does not happen often, but when it does, it's only for a few shorts mins. So short, I can't figure out a way to replicate it on command. I do not know what triggers it. Just the thoughts in my head seem to align with the stars and I just feel good. Literally better feeling than any drink or drug has ever done for me.

I am trying my best. My depression was so bad about a year ago, I was applying for jobs in my degree field (Sports Management). I would get an email inquiring about an interview. I would respond with comments that I am not worth it, I don't deserve it, I don't know what I would do if I was given the position. etc. It sounds like I want someone to feel sorry for me, but I dont. I have no rational why I think like that, but I do. I sit in my room contemplating what goals and what I want to do, but actually putting things in motion to accomplish those goals is a daunting task. I download music and still collect music because I want to get back into djing. However, I tell myself I am going to do what it takes to get back out there and spin some tunes. I just can't. Whenever I log on my computer and tell myself I am going to sort through and organize my music, I just put it off.

I currently take medicine and currently see a psychiatrist. Stopped seeing counselor because the way she was talking to me was not cool. Plus, I live near a University Hospital, which is also known as a teaching hospital. Many of the doctors, and employees in general, are still in grad school or literally just graduated. They have little to no experience. And because they are a teaching hospital, you have to roll with one of there younger doctors, even though they have senior physicians that oversee them.

I hope this post can help someone and help me. I would like for it to just blow up and be a post that never goes away. I want to do something good and I want to overcome this.

One other strange thing is talking and hanging out around people makes me feel amazing. I feel great. Common sense would say I would try and do that more. Even though in my mind and heart I want, I just cant force myself to go to a movie, or go for a walk, etc. It's like the most simplistic tasks take so much effort. Think of it has having your car stuck in the mud, foot slammed on the gas pedal. You have people pushing your vehicle to become unstuck and your pedal to the metal, but you aint moving no where. When you do finally move, you slide farther than you were before. Thats my life in a nutshell.

18,"I don't know who to talk to so I decided to come back to this subreddit. 

I have had depression for two years and last August I started taking an antidepressant for the first time. I found my mood to improve and I didn't have breakdowns or suicidal thoughts at all anymore. However, I still lack the motivation to study, to go out with friends, and all I've been doing besides going to class it's playing video games to keep my mind busy and  to avoid my responsibilities. Exams are in three weeks and I haven't even studied yet or feel the energy to start. I try to but I just can't concentrate or memorize at all and find my efforts useless, to kept on avoiding touching the books.  I really thought I was ""cured"" because my mood wasn't a mess anymore, but today I just realized my situation hasn't changed much from how it used to be: I still isolate myself, find everything boring and meaningless, have no interest for anything and feel lonely, still without energy/motivation to socialize or change my situation. I'm not like I used to be 3 years ago before my depression. I was wondering if someone has experienced this. I just feel like I'm a lazy brat who is been procrastinating all this time but I just don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been a good student. I'm on my fourth year of med school and I feel so overwhelmed and with no illusion for my degree anymore. Every time I think about exams I panic because I've had such a rough time, specially last year, trying to pass all subjects and fighting my depression at the same time and my self- confidence is so messed up. Still I feel I'm just a spoiled brat trying to justify somehow her procrastination. But honestly, I don't recognize myself. My family is putting pressure into me more than I already do because med school is expensive and the stress is killing me.  However I don't think leaving my degree would be of help... I just don't know what to do. Is it too early for my motivation and will to do things to recover? Or I've just got used to my own disease and got lazy?

So I’ve been working abroad for the past 18 months and it changed me in so many ways. It helped me a lot, but it also made me question almost everything. I’m finding it difficult to grapple with these questions of identity since returning back home. And it’s only so long that I can ignore them and push them away.

27,"Sigh so...frustrated. and Angry since yesterday night. My nutbar Aunt and her husband were in town.  She wanted to treatme to rise of skywalker. Me being me said coolness! (at first) but decided better part of something to say...except I've seen it before and it was meh. Would love to go see Jumanji (next level) which lead her \[it felt like\] to start over thinkinking.  What's that movie? Who's the Rock? Oh Him!...There's two? I thought they made only one? Something about  video game esk movies being a product for addhd melenials with apreciation for the art of a good movie. Even though she loves the original StarWars...and how about this depressing movie instead?  (no) Gosh you're such a pill!  I guess I made the mistake of comenting how I just like sometypes of movies but not others. I like uplifting ones, and also like funny ones. Just didn't want to see Knives out, or a nature documentary--which did look excelent, just not in the mood to see it. That lead to ""fun"" drama. about being picky (????) and now it's made things hard for her to treat me to movies and gosh she thought it'd be fun etc. But as a back up plan she happened to have some cardgames.

Meenwhile Oh. My. God. Both my parents and her taking turns tag teaming how really need to get off cymbalta because  it's becoming netorius for adding weight. and how my therapist is so evil, and by the way so is big pharma.  Dad being him wanted to rant (loudly) about 45, with Aunts husband. Probably because at christmas,  I had enough of him ranting about tech and ""civillians (his insult for novice users). and how 45 is so great for at least doing something.  And I had bluntly changed topics, only for him to talk even louder. His  way of being passive aggressive. Yesterday he doubled down on the aholery: playing videos about politics on a laptop loudly while mom decided she had enough and ""just happened"" to go for a walk. Aunt and I wanted to have fun with her new card game.  She does that in the hopes he'll get the hint he's being an ass. Rather than saying: we're trying to have a nice day.  She used to say something, only for dad to explode claiming he wants to talk politics and if we don't like it tough (basically). 

He finally got the notion after 3 hours of being a douchebag to talk almost anything else with aunts husband. He does this because no one else wants to talk polotics or go off the handle about pretty technical mondane (and boring) javascript issues.

Talked with mum about  getting as a gift  for  my birthday (comes up soonISH) a membership to planetfitness and hopefully either a membership to a zumba class, or a generic dance for fun and cardio class. lol I mis being around pretty  people! 

I got pissed the fuck off at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) though. Because aint shit listed!   Now trying to crawl out of a fowl mood  to enjoy my day :( . I just  hate how my dads turning into a bitter angery shut in, that's willfully out of the loops and doesn't give a F about anything that isn't related to very specific things, or he'll just sulk in front of the TV with beers.

I also hate how useless feeling [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) has become and I have no idea what other places are in a similar spirit of groups meeting to make friends and do something fun.",27Dec2019,1
28,"This will be a very **long** and **complicated**, personal problem. As an undergraduate in college, I will try my best to describe it (chances are I'll end up ranting, go all over the place, and confuse you lot).

I don't know if my ego's too big or something (I don't mean ""egotistic"" as in wanting attention for everything or automatically believing I'm better than everyone else around me): I don't enjoy being in the spotlight, but I also don't like being ignored for my contributions in a conversation or a team sport such as Ultimate Frisbee.

I also have trouble being overly expressive of my depressive thoughts (even struggling online) because whenever someone tries to comfort me, it makes me feel like I'm some **terribly dependent victim** in need of serious help, and then (for whatever reason) it feels like a ""cringe moment"" that I could not stand. Hence **the more I try to talk about my feelings, the worse it feels**... and so I rather keep it to myself, aka in my fragile eggshell.

And this comes to learning as well, like, literally learning about ***anything***. My major (homeland and cyber security, I'm trying to grasp on the basics from an introductory textbook but I get fatigued and reluctant reading/absorbing new knowledge), my hobbies (chess, Rainbow Six Siege, writing... but when I feel like I'm stuck repeating the same mistakes over and over, I reject myself trying to look up helpful tips because I feel inferior for whatever reason... whenever I'm reading a tip or a guideline, I feel as if I ***have*** to listen to it no matter what. In other words, I worry what if the tip doesn't work for me in a different yet specific situation? Like listening to people debating politics or reading news, for whatever reason, I just **can't think outside the box or for myself**).

For example with chess, I'm decent at endgames but weak with openings and attacking in the middlegame. If I were to dedicate myself to learning from grandmasters for one day on how they attack and develop in openings, I would feel slightly accomplished, but immediately unmotivated to continue on the following day because I forgot everything I learned the previous day. With situations like this, I can think of possible reasons:

1. **I see everything as a chore**. This isn't a wrong observation, for it could be my poor sleep schedule (my eating habits are okay, so are my exercising/workout sessions, I think?), but I doubt fixing that will get me progress to become a better version of myself. I haven't tried sticking to antidepressants because my dad gets furiously... furious. (Asian parent stereotype of not emphasizing on mental health). Subsequently, I had to take them inconsistently before giving up on them.
2. **I don't have short-term goals.** Heck, I don't even have long term goals. I can only break it down to finding a decent job related to my major that can support food, bills and minor luxury. Every time I start thinking of what I should do in the long term, I stress out because I keep doubting myself. This lack of confidence is due to my **low self-esteem and being highly sensitive/easily emotional** to mental and emotional pain, but also due to my lack of knowledge for anything at all (read the third paragraph). The more I try to think and maybe lazily plan ahead, I hit a mental block on the road and then I feel like I'm on a sick cycle carousel, thinking about the same problems because they're all somehow connected to each other. How am I supposed to find a solution if that solution requires a series of steps to another solution and it goes back to where it all started?
3. **Contrasting background**. My parents and the relatives who took part in raising me for 5-6 years never supported me doing anything different from their standards (of course, this is what all parents do, but in my eyes, they seem a bit too authoritative trying to enforce their influences upon me). Don't get me wrong, they are very caring and educated people. But on the downside, they argue over little things, badmouthing everyone around them behind their backs, and criticizing me in what I would call it: *harsh* enough to discourage me from thinking differently ever again. It may sound general, but their actions might've killed my sense of creativity and courage to even speak about my thoughts in front of friends and peers in academic settings because it gives me the vibe that I'll be wrongly judged for being ""stupid"" or ""uneducated"" and never reach out to me again. Thus, learning becomes hard because I'll only absorb information on a literal basis and not apply it to anything, rendering it useless in my brain until I forget about the information.

Nowadays I think so lowly of myself that I've developed suicidal thoughts; I value myself less and less, and these depressing thoughts haunt me every day. I can't find myself learning new things anymore, or that I am, but so damn *slow* that it's not enough to land me on an independent life once I leave college. The vicious cycle of my inner struggles has manifested onto me as someone who is forever a prisoner of his past.

29,"Hi all, just some questions. I have been unemployed since December 2018, on and off again work before that since May 2014. What are some tips to get back into the job scene, and what types of jobs are available 
for someone who has not had a great employment record in the last few years, coupled with depression, anxiety and other comorbidities? I am a 29 m, no degrees but 4 years of college experience, had been a manager of various jobs prior to a breakdown in 2014. Thank you for any advice.",27Dec2019,1
30,"There’s the fake out-I’m doing great! How about you? *me imitating Patrick Stewart: acting*

The universally recognized by other depressed people: “it’s going haha,” and “just living the dream haha!

I basically didn’t participate in holidays this year because I’m tired of acting and not having anything exciting or good to talk about with relatives and family.  

Since “I crave the sweet release of death every waking moment” isn’t a socially appropriate response I was going to holla at reddit to see if anyone could insoire or advise.",27Dec2019,1
31,"How badly does long term depression mess up your memory and head generally and what's the best way of reversing it? Memory is definitely far worse than it was.

Been depressed around 7 years but haven't been on any pills as my family don't really buy into that and it's kinda rubbed off on me.",27Dec2019,1
32,the last couple months nothing feels real. i rarely get excited and even when i do it’s like i still can’t display real emotion towards it. it’s like i’m getting sadder and sadder everyday and i can’t help but feel like everything would be so much easier if i just ended it. but i’m scared.,27Dec2019,1
33,"So I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder around two years ago. It took a while to figure out what meds to take but i now take two different medications together to treat it. Ive told the doctors I can tell its helping, but I feel as if it could do more. But sometimes I tell myself this is as good as its gonna get because these meds wont cure me.

But anyways, onto what this post is really about. Recently I have been in a slump and I’ve been thinking of things about me or things I do that I don’t like. I wrote them down but I don’t know if these are caused by my depression or if its just who i am and i need to come to terms with it. These things include: 
•Serious lack in motivation. For work, class, and fun with friends and family
•Laziness/laying around all day
•Unable to find enjoyment in a lot of things
•Rethinking my relationship with my SO despite her not doing anything necessarily wrong
•Not reaching out or checking up on important people in my life
•I am less talkative than i used to be/Ive become more introverted
•I become envious of people’s financial positions to the point I put myself in a bad mood, and almost resent my friends

I don’t really know what kind of responses I am expecting from this. I know some things above are directly caused by the depression. But others im not so sure of. I guess any advice on my whole situation, or on any of those points would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",27Dec2019,1
