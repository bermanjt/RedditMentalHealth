 Hello all. For fifteen years of my life, I really struggled with depression. I have since overcome to worst of it; some of it still shows up from time to time; but my coping mechanisms still remain. 
I used to cry consistently. Only when I was alone, but in public places and the quiet of my own home. Crying made me feel better when I was lonely or down. But now that I’m not any of those (I got married last year, and my life has only gone uphill), the fact that I still cry at everything really frustrates both me and my husband. 
How do you stop yourself from crying when confronted, even when it’s nothing serious?...
How do I stop thinking that everything is a slight against me, and that it just confirms that I’m nothing?...
TLDR:
When I was depressed, I cried at everything. Now that I’m not, I still cry at everything. My body is so addicted to crying, that it’s the only thing that makes me feel better. Help. ",08Mar2019,3
3,"So I just recently said to 2 of my friends that I did have suicidal moments and that I have overcome them. I then told the rest of my friends a few days later after not speaking with them as i was busy doing things. The first 2 friends said that they didn't recall when I told them but that didn't really matter as they still cared that I was ok. Another friend however kept on trying to argue with me for my reasons for wanting to kill myself and what I've done to overcome it. 

The main reason that I was putting other people first instead of myself and I was feeling last in my own life. What i said  was that I needed time to myself and I needed to put myself first and try to sort out my life. One friend said that he didn't agree with me and that he couldn't support my decision. 

Is there anything I could say that would help them see my perspective on the situation that would help him understand why I have made this decision?",08Mar2019,3

6,"Hello all,  


I have been happily coupled with my SO for a few years now.  He has always had an uphill battle with anxiety and depression, and I've always tried to be there in whatever capacity I can be.  His anxiety mainly presents in the form of physically running away from stressful or potentially important decisions.  As a background, he is well educated with a Masters degree and has been looking for a career change.  He has gotten multiple offers for job interviews, as his job history and education make him an attractive candidate.  He will accept the job interview and have a panic attack the night before and immediately send an email rescinding his application, a scenario which has happened about 4 times now.  I've asked him if he wants to talk about it, and he will always respond with some form of ""I'm not a good candidate, I couldn't do that job, I'm not worthy of doing anything"".  


Recently, this has lead him to substance abuse as a coping method.  We've always been casual, once-a-week bargoers with friends, but for him this has turned into 3-4 days a week, and sometimes other hard drugs, and then proceeds to drive home very drunk and/or very high.  I have no reason to believe this is not a recent thing, but the people he's doing this with are not good people.  On one occasion (my birthday night), he drunkenly said that he was going to a ""friends house"".  When I confronted him and said I knew what was going on, and that I wanted him to choose between me and the drug, he left.  On my birthday.  He apologized the next morning, citing a very difficult night and a lot of anxiety that he just wanted to escape from.  


Increasingly more and more, my SO has been pushing me away, insisting that I need to move on from him since he ""isn't fixable"" and ""is only going to drag me down further"".  I love him unconditionally, but he's needed professional help for quite some time, and whenever I make a suggestion to see someone, tells me that he doesn't need me ""instructing him how to fix himself"" and that I just need to ""be there for him"".  I'm afraid I've turned into an enabler because I haven't tried to push him in a better direction for fear of losing him.  Since I'm assuming this will be mentioned, he used to be on an anti-anxiety medication, but recently stopped because of suicidal thoughts while on it.  He does not want to have those thoughts again, and is against going on medication again.  


While not having a panic attack and not under the influence of anything, he says he appreciates my patience and that he doesn't know what he would do without me, and that he's trying.  It's something that I'm trying to hold onto, but I'm afraid he's going to lose his job, get arrested, or OD.  What can I even do to help?  Am I simply in an abusive relationship that I need to get out of?",08Mar2019,1
7,"I’m feeling down. And I keep letting myself fall down the rabbit hole of despair, nostalgia, and fear. I suddenly realized there’s this giant void and nothing can help it anymore. I miss things.

Thanks friends ",08Mar2019,50
9,"I have slipped into my depression deeper than I’ve been in long time. I’ve been sleeping for 12-20 hours at a time, and when I wake, I’m still tired. While I’m awake I have been spending my time on my phone or laying on my couch. Hardly eating some days, and others binging everything. There have been moments when I am with my bf, whom I live with, where I have to fake my happiness because he just doesn’t understand... I hate myself for putting him through this. 
I am failing my college courses. This is my second semester and these two weeks have really fucked me. Knowing this just makes it worse as I try to think of a solution and end up longing for a whole to crawl in and die. Then, I start to remember all of my other failures, past and present, and this just adds to the problem. I don’t know what to do. To be honest, I don’t know why I am posting here. I feel like I’m going crazy and just want this to end. I wanna stop trying and make everything stop. 
I guess I’m just looking for people who can relate and maybe shed some light on ways to possibly pull myself out?

11,"Ive lived here a month as of tomorrow.

Housemate 1 (HM1) was who i was originally going to live with alongwith her girlfriend. But they broke up. So now HM1 is here, and HM2 moved in as moral support.

Im here because the rent cant be afforded without another person i never met either of these people before.

Without going into the full story, HM1 ex was abusive, but she wants her back anyway because she sucks at letting people go. Ex is not removing herself from the picture which is only making everything harder.

I was away last week, and when i came back HM2 informed me that 1 had attempted to commit. And is terrified shes going to try again.

HM1 has only been getting worse as time goes.

Ive decided if she doesnt go to work tomorrow, that im going to call up this team of people i was told about who do house calls for mental health and are able to do unwilling admittances. HM1 needs help and considering my mum just died, im not gonna sit by and let anyone else. Not in my own fucking house.

HM2 doesnt want to because then HM1 will hate her, but honestly i dont care. HM1 can hate all she want, at least she isnt dead.

Ive got my own depression and anxiety problems and so does HM2. All i can think is the sooner we get the worst of us helped we'll all start getting better.

I just need advice on if im doing the right thing, i dont have the full story myself. Shes not on medication. I feel like its not my place at all to meddle, but its happening in MY home so fuggit. ",08Mar2019,7

15,"So first off im a 16 year old man.And today is nationals women's day and honestly this is just so unfair that i refuse to go outside to even look at anyone.

So i went to school in 7 am.

1st class was english and the professor was female we played a game where literally only women played and us men were forced to watch it and if any of us wanted to be on our phones we were punished.

2nd class serbian-our teacher gave us our tests back,out of 14 possible points i scored 8, and i got an 2(1 is worst 5 is best) and i asked if the teacher can give me 1 extra point because i really needed a 3 and instead of just begging i showed her that i had an question completely right i just wrote 1812 instead of 1814 and question above i had it half correct,enough small points for 3 and it would make my day.She looked at me as i said i wanted a 5 and told me that this is not a market and i can not act this way and off i go to my seat.She starts calling names and asking what grade they got so she can write it in her registry(i think thats the name) i tell her i got an 2  and then 3 persons after me a girl who knows serbian really well and has all 5  gets a free 5 because she put it in there by accident,saying you will prove that and had a laugh(she got a 4 btw)

I was really really angry but i keep my calm and move on

rest of classes were pretty normal cuz we had male teachers so i didnt bother too much,i got home and my gf who finished school aswell calls me so we can talk about our day and this is the following story

&amp;#x200B;

A feminist teacher that teaches history went in the class(this day they were supposed to have an oral exam) and says all the girls dont have to do an oral exam only boys.And so she gave around 8 1s to all the bois and completely ruined their final grade.Do you know what happened after that??!?THEY ALL FUCKING LAUGHED,and my gf couldn't stop laughing as she was telling that story and im here just fucking hurt af,if that happened to us males where we didnt have to do an exam only women there would be fucking protesters outside screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i dont know if this is a national thing but girls have developed this kind of joke where 9 of march is day for gay people,so whenever any boy would say i wish we had a day where we would get stuff like this they would reply with dont worry tomorrow is your day.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know but i hate when something is unfair and this day felt really unfair,why should i as a male get fucking bashed all day because its a day for women yet i cant have such day for myself and nobody complains about it.

Now please dont take this the wrong way but try to understand what im about to say:

14 feb-day to please women

8 march-also another day

their birthday-aswell another day

if you have 1 month 6 months or 1 year with ur gf thats-aswell another day

If she is on her period(this includes friends aswell)-again for 7 days you need to be good or else it creates a fight

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe im just fucked in the head and overthink things and make myself a dramatic bitch but i just had to get this off the chest

16,"I don't really know where to start, so I'm sorry if this is a little hard to follow. Any advice or help would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be suicidal, and cut. I was in a boarding school at the time, and eventually I was able to move past my depression and also left the boarding school. I was not depressed after I left but I wasn't happy. I was still holding onto my old life in a lot of ways. About 4 months after boarding school, I met a young woman who helped me move on from this, and she became my first girlfriend. The next 6 months with her were the happiest of my life, and for the first time I felt truly good, even when I wasn't with her. She was an international student, and was in my country for 5 months. She had to leave eventually, where she went to a different country about 6 hours journey away. It turned out she was battling stress and unhappiness of her own, once she had left, and was not coping. This caused her to lash out at me, during the last month we spent together. I never held any of this against her, and she is a good person. 

We mutually agreed it was best to break up, and become friends- we still loved each other, but she couldn't take hurting me, and was starting to hate herself for these occasional breakdowns, which were becoming more frequent. Similarly, it was distressing to not be able to be there to provide support for her like I was previously able to. 5 days after that breakup, we argued and, both of us hurting a lot, said hurtful things. This caused her to go no contact, with no specific end date to it, though not permanent. I was already barely keeping it together,

This no contact caused me to completely break down, over the past 4 days not talking to her. I have become visibly ill, I have no appetite, my skin is irritated, I have severe chest pains and I feel weak and unsteady most of the time. I have pains in my neck, too. The weight that I had throughout my previous depression has returned, and I break down in tears randomly and without any real warning. Sometimes, I am nearly sick, though I have not been yet- only retching. I have nightmares about our argument, and a lot of the time I feel like I can't continue. My suicidal tendencies have half returned, with no real backing or conviction to them thankfully, the only driving force being a need to stop the pain I am in.

&amp;#x200B;

In boarding school, I was surrounded by good and close friends, and although I still felt lonely there, they supported me and helped me through. In my new college, I am isolated- I feel disconnected from my classmates and people my age (17), and cannot relate to them. The people I used to sit next to at the start of my time there actually left the college, so I am isolated even on that level. Because I was with my girlfriend for so long, I never reached out and made friends when I should have, and so I am now alone. People are friendly to me, and I to them, but I cant break into any friend groups. It just doesn't work, with them or me. This is probably cliche but I feel like I've grown up too fast. My girlfriend was in her 20s, for reference, and was the easiest person I have ever talked to- even when we were not together yet, I still found conversation with her natural despite the age gap. 

I cant contact her myself, as she is trying to get over me, and needs to focus on her life- if she does not, she may be unable to stay in her current country and be sent to a country she hates, that sends her into a deep depression when she is there. She needs to focus on her work, which is hard to do if you cannot get over a relationship (or at least lessen the pain). I cant endanger that. 

I don't know what to do. My only comfort is that I gave her the advice she needed to seek help herself, and that she will be ok without me. But I dont know if I will be ok. I have nobody to confide in, and my experience with any counsellor or therapist (albeit limited) has been unhelpful.  I am scared of falling back into depression completely, and feel like I am drowning. 

I've vented to myself by typing how I feel, as a substitute for real people, but this is the only time I have actually shared this with anyone. I never thought I would go to reddit, but after finding this subreddit, I can only hope that someone with more experience than me can help. Thank you for reading. ",08Mar2019,5
17,"I've lived with depression since I was a kid. I started taking medication when I was in high school with mixed results. It's only been in the past 5 years or so that I've found a good balance. After my dad died I began to experience more instances of generalized anxiety on top of the depression. My partner new all of this going into our relationship, and having been through therapy for nearly 20 years, I'm incredibly self-aware of my needs, moods, and when I can feel them shifting. I've tried to be clear with them about when I'm in a particularly bad place and ask clearly for support from them. Things I have said: 

* ""I'm very stressed and it's triggering my anxiety and negative thoughts, and I'm falling into a spiral. Will you tell me a few reasons why you love me and why I have value?""
* ""I'm looking for support and compassion right now because sometimes when I want to talk to you about my depression and negative thoughts, I feel dismissed. I would like it if you could just listen to me and tell me I'm worthwhile.""
* ""I'm not looking for a solution right now, I need emotional support and affection.""

Considering the pretty hopeless place I was in, I thought that was really clear. Their response was to say I needed to relax and chill out and there's no sense worrying about things that I can't control right now, and let's come up with a plan for what to do tomorrow. All of which directly opposed what I had just asked for moments before.

I know that my partner's ex was much less communicative about and functional with their mental health challenges, and that sometimes my partner feels PTSD from their time living with that. I try to be respectful about that, and most of the time I find ways to manage my depression and anxiety alone or with supportive friends, but I would really like to be able to come home to my spouse and have them tell me that they love me and that I have value to them when I'm at my lowest, not just when we're having fun and playing video games or watching a movie.

How can I better communicate this with them? Are there resources that anyone can recommend that I could share with them that they might read? Has anyone else experienced this and come through with positive results?",08Mar2019,58

20,"I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms. He works about an hour away, while I work from home, although I have very little work, so most of my days are just spent doing...well, nothing. I'm sometimes so depressed I can't keep up with basic chores, which I feel I should be doing since I'm home all day. My husband hasn't confronted me about it directly but I think it annoys him.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I feel okay. Other days I am irrational, fearful and tearful. I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to him--and which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I can't seem to help myself. I can't imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if he's coming home to see me on an ""okay day"" or a really bad day.

22,"I’m slowly losing the motivation to write this with every word, Ima be honest. However, I gotta start somewhere, don’t I? It’s been a month or two since I’ve felt legitimately down and 3-2 months or so since I’ve had a fit of depression as severe as this one. I don’t even know where to start tbh so I’ll just spout shit and hope you guys get it or something. 
I deal with anxiety daily; the smallest (and at times PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE and outlandish things) can make me spiral into an anxiety attack. Sometimes it just happens randomly- when I’m amongst friends. But this- this is different. I’ve had dealt with depression in patches in the past and have given serious contemplation about doing IT. I don’t self harm (often- I punch myself sometimes but those are rare occasions) but like I stated, I do contemplate about doing it quite often and quite vividly when I’m at that state; it really puts me in a state of distress. I reason that there’s no reason harming myself unless I could knock two birds with one stone in doing it. I don’t think I’m high risk; I am generally scared of death. But what I’m about to tell you guys makes me think that maybe in the near future I might think otherwise.
These past two years have really not been quite easy for me- I’ve lost a friend to suicide, broken up with my partner in a manner that changed my perspective of people for the worst, been brutally betrayed by one of the people I considered my best friend (granted- I didn’t have a lot of friends to begin with; I could’ve count them on two hands before and now I can only count them with probably half a hand), amongst other things. I used to be an A student; now my grades are sub par to say the least. Home life has been hard too; constant fighting- you know the deal. I can’t even get enough energy to connect with my little brother anymore, who I love most in this world; I’m gonna miss out on his youthful years because of this shit. Needless to say, I had a lot of things pick at my heart throughout these years; it gave me an incredibly pessimistic view about the world, about myself and about other people. I was tired of it; I was tired of having feelings in general. So on December, I rewired my mind.

Granted, I didn’t knew what this would do- I thought it would give me tougher skin; it would allow me to not completely crumble under certain circumstances. I didn’t think it would change me to the extent that it did.
Part of the reason why I struggled with such intense feelings was because, as negative the opinion I had for myself was, I nevertheless acknowledged that I was a highly empathetic person. It really allowed me to connect with my friends at an extremely personal level. But that changed- rewiring my mind gave me an initially slight sense of apathy. I found myself not completely freaking out if I wronged others because, as I thought at the time, “we all fuck up”. Consequently, I began been pursuing personal goal instead of putting them aside to help people as well; I began treating myself, thinking “if they can treat themselves and pursue their own goals, why can’t I?”. As a result, I began convinced in January that I’ve gotten over my depression; I’ve still had anxiety- however it was rarely coupled by depression. Scolded at my mom? Didn’t care. Angered a friend? Didn’t care. Was rude and rowdy with people? Didn’t care. Crush didn’t like me back? Didn’t care. I became blunt with people- stating what I wanted to state and doing what I wanted to do. Then February came along...
In a span of some months, I went from being known for my empathy and for being a little crazy to being known for my outright recklessness. I was insanely euphoric and hyper all the time and regularly doing risky things; the euphoria was so much, it exhausted me to the point of headaches and stomachaches. The apathy skyrocketed- I didn’t care about people nor what I would do to myself. My compassion was reserved for only two people of the time; my apathy towards people made its way towards the sentiments I had for my family as well. At that point, I knew something was off; I had to PRETEND to care about even some of my closest friends. Why is this happening? I had no idea. Towards the end of February, my apathy was replaced by irritableness and near hatred; indeed, I began hating my close friends for no reason- I simply just couldn’t help it. Fast foward now: I snapped at my friends for virtually no reason , I’m alone, and I want to disintegrate. Everyone- my best friend, my family, EVEN MY CRUSH- gets on my nerves. I have absolutely no love for people and neither any love for myself; I want to constantly stay in bed and sleep. I just want my existence to stop- not my life per se but rather I just wanna clock out of reality. There’s so much noise- too noise. I don’t trust myself nor other people; everything and everybody- every nice gesture- feels fake. I just want isolate myself from other people and isolate myself from myself. I hate everyone including myself and I could hardly care for anything anymore. I have no idea why this is happening. Any ideas?",08Mar2019,3
