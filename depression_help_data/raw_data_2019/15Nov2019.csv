0,"Hello there, first time on this sub, hoping that whoever is reading this is well. So basically I have a friend who, drunk, told me he was depressed and had previously called the suicide hotline (though he did not actually say if he was suicidal) and that he had just called it again tonight, to which they told him he should tell a friend how he was feeling. This is the first time I found myself in such a situation, and I just don't know how to deal with it. I told him we should talk, and asked him if he wanted to chill and watch a movie, or get in (I was speaking to him from within my house) He said he was fine, and he was going to sleep. I know that he has no way of hurting himself badly at his place, and I trust him enough to know that he actually did go to sleep and he won't hurt himself. My question is how should I deal with this? What should I do? He was pretty drunk, so if I breach the subject tomorrow he will probably pretend not to remember it, and if I don't breach the subject he will most likely not mention it, as sober his emotional walls will be back up. Thank you for you help",15Nov2019,1
1,"So I live in a mix of two houses that are next to one another. One is my mom's and the other is my grandma's. Well, this whole thing has been happening for a while. Ever since my mother had gotten into a relationship with an abusive boyfriend  (that is now over) everything is now about my mom. How she is the victim and what not. But long story short I have been getting menatlly abused by my mom and the only way to get my mom to listen to me is by calling her names and then she listens. Well, even then I am still the one being called the evil one when I have a tough time because she doesn't care. And I know I shouldn't call her names but I don't know what to do because she won't listen to me. And my whole family is making me be the bad person and I am just done I want out of this house.

2,"I've been battling depression secretly for awhile now and it seems to stem from a constant feeling that I'm just not good enough at all. 

It all seems to have surfaced after I started building motorcycles. I work really hard at it and they've been in some shows which is nice. I can't stop feeling like no matter how much I do, or how beautiful my bike is it will never amount it anything. I feel like I need to be 100lbs soaking wet with my tits out for anyone to notice my craftsmanship. Building has always been such a great passion for me but it's starting to dull inside of me now. I'm becoming more and more sad that what I once loved so much is just slipping from me based on the fact that everything is so superficial. 

It just seems like if you fit into a perfect image you can do next to nothing and achieve success. 

Am I bonkers for feeling like this?",15Nov2019,1
3,"So originally I was taking Setraline 50mg and 10mg amatriptyline to help with my Fibromyalgia and accompanying mood issues.  How ever on the third day of taking the Setraline, my stomach felt like it sank inward (a very unpleasant and first time experience) and then I felt cold and almost felt like I was going to panic.  So my doctor switched me to  mirtazapine/remeron.  It’s been almost two weeks and only just tonight suddenly after eating (20 minutes) I was upstairs and I had a huge stomach pain I mean so bad, it hurt like hell and went away, I then got the sensation to go to the toilet and then the pain came on again, followed by a gurgling sound in my stomach, this pain didn’t feel like bad food.  It kept happening and happening, going away as I sat on the toilet for longer, then as I went a toilet, passing felt very strange (a weird feeling) and was not normal or hard but watery.  I’ve taken tonight’s mirtazapine/remeron but does this sound alarming ? even now whilst lying in bed my stomach feels a sensation an, odd sensation at that.  What should I do ? anyone else experienced this on mirtazapine/remeron.  Thanks sorry for the gory details.  I tried to keep it clean.  These sensations never happened before as before I had never taken anti depressants.  I don’t want to give up because they are helping my mood, but will this go away is it something I should wait to get through ? Thank you.",15Nov2019,1

6,"So i am 29 years old, i live at home. To most people, at least in their heads they probably see me as a massive failure. Heck, i think so too. I don't work currently, i can barely go shopping without having a panic attack. I destroyed my career because of my anxiety/depression and i keep telling myself I'll go back to school eventually, anyway i digress.

 My parents are amazing, they think my diagnosis is their fault (which it isn't). They've never beaten me, nothing more then a light slap on the bottom when i was a toddler. They rarely raise their voices and are more the ""*I'm very disappointed in you*"" kind of parents, we're also a very sarcastic family. They don't ask me for rent (I do all the housework cause of course, and manage their bills, etc), my mother tries to bond with me through games which has been pretty cool actually. My father treats me like he always has, he was a military man for most of my childhood, so he's kind of awkward but in a loving way. That's some background info for this next part.

 My mom was talking to my aunt and the topic of how i was doing came up, not even thinking i uttered the words ""*Well, I'm not hanging or in the ground yet so i guess I'm doing okay*"" now i didn't see anything wrong with this at the time, i don't think my mom heard me but the look my dad gave me kind of threw me off. I've never seen him look so shocked or hurt. He asked me ""*What did you say*?"" i kinda stumbled and repeated what i had said in a more sarcastic tone. I didn't think much of it at the time and it wasn't until later that i kinda thought more about it. I really freaked myself out how easy it was to say something like that to people who genuinely care about me. I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, and i had been improving so much recently. I apologized to my father and he just gave me a hug and told me to not joke like that. 

I'm going to be bringing this up with my therapist but, i guess i just.. need to get it off my chest now. This is my first post in this subreddit, so if i broke any rules i am very sorry! Thank you for taking your time to read this, it means a lot.",15Nov2019,1

We had a conversation the other night as he was saying that he “couldn’t find the energy” to do even simple tasks like picking up his clothes off his floor or even eating sometimes. I want to help him, not only because he’s a very good friend that’s helped me, but because I know he is really talented as he has shown it to me when he did have the energy.

The distinctions can enable an individual to perceive when to look for treatment.

In this article, we help the peruser make this differentiation and recommend treatment alternatives for sorrow.

**Knowing the distinction**

Characterizing misery and sorrow is significant for improving prosperity.

**Misery**

Misery is a typical human feeling that everyone will involvement with distressing or serious occasions.

Various life occasions can leave individuals feeling pitiful or despondent. The misfortune or nonappearance of a friend or family member, separate, loss of employment or pay, money related issue, or issues at home would all be able to influence state of mind in a negative manner.

Bombing a test, not finding a new line of work, or encountering other baffling occasions can likewise trigger bitterness.

Be that as it may, an individual encountering trouble can ordinarily discover some help from crying, venting, or working out disappointments. As a rule, bitterness has connections to a particular trigger.

Misery more often than not breathes easy. In the event that it doesn’t pass, or if the individual winds up incapable to continue ordinary capacity, this could be an indication of misery.

On the off chance that low state of mind deteriorates or keeps going longer than about fourteen days, the individual should converse with their primary care physician.

**Despondency**

Despondency is a psychological issue that overpoweringly affects numerous pieces of an individual’s life. It can happen in individuals of any sexual orientation or age and adjusts practices and frames of mind.

In 2015, around 16.1 million individuals matured 18 years or above in the U.S. had encountered at any rate one noteworthy burdensome scene in the most recent year, representing 6.7 percent of all grown-ups in the nation.

**Manifestations include:**

* sentiments of debilitation
* trouble
* sadness
* an absence of inspiration
* lost enthusiasm for exercises that the individual once found charming

In extreme cases, the individual may consider or endeavor suicide. They may never again want to invest energy with family or companions and may quit seeking after their leisure activities or feel unfit to go to work or school.

On the off chance that these sentiments of uncertainty last longer than about fourteen days, a social insurance expert may determine the individual to have significant burdensome issue (MDD).

**Indications of MDD include:**

* a day by day discouraged state of mind that goes on for the greater part of the day, consistently, with observable indications of misery and bitterness
* lost enthusiasm for ordinary exercises for an all-inclusive measure of time
* huge and unexpected weight reduction or addition
* a sleeping disorder, restlessness, or expanded measures of rest that influence typical calendars
* tiredness and low vitality
* sentiments of uselessness or unnecessary blame every day
* failure to think or decide
* repetitive considerations of death, self-destructive musings, or suicide endeavors or plans

A specialist would consider an individual who encounters any five of these manifestations for longer than about fourteen days to have a restorative issue instead of a delayed encounter of trouble.

For a conclusion of MDD, the specialist should interface the manifestations just to sorrow and not to another therapeutic determination, for example, substance misuse or a basic condition.

In contrast to bitterness, sorrow can leave an individual attempting to get past their day. Bitterness is only one component of misery.

**Treatment for depression**

On the off chance that an individual has side effects of gloom for longer than about fourteen days, they should look for expert assistance.

A doctor can decide the degree of treatment important to oversee indications.

Following determination, potential medicines incorporate drug, advising, and psychotherapy.

**Meds**

Meds incorporate particular serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a sort of upper.

These capacity by expanding levels of serotonin in the cerebrum. Serotonin is a substance emissary that improves state of mind.

Instances of SSRIs incorporate citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline.

As per the Mayo Clinic, these medications can facilitate the side effects of wretchedness, despite the fact that they do convey a danger of antagonistic reactions.

For instance, when individuals first use antidepressants, these medications present a danger of indications falling apart before they improve. Relatives of the individual taking the prescription should screen them intently and look for restorative consideration if manifestations exacerbate.

The U.S. Sustenance and Drug Administration (FDA) have communicated worry that a few SSRIs can cause expanded self-destructive ideation in more youthful individuals and may represent some hazard to the hatchling whenever taken during pregnancy.

Therefore, the medications convey a discovery cautioning, which is a significant notice on the data pamphlet sketching out the potential threats of the medications.

When recommending SSRIs, prescribers should cautiously adjust the advantages and disadvantages of utilization.

**Psychotherapy and guiding**

Psychotherapy includes conversing with a prepared proficient.

An individual can seek after psychotherapy all alone or with the help of energizer prescriptions. A specialist can help distinguish issue zones, show methods for dealing with stress, and teach a person about the substances of the condition.

A therapeutic group may concede an individual with serious melancholy to an emergency clinic in the event that they are in impending threat to themselves, either on account of the danger of suicide or absence of capacity to think about themselves.

Outpatient offices and psychotherapy facilities can help with long haul care.

**Takeaway**

Despondency and pity are connected yet are not the equivalent.

Pity is a feeling that everybody encounters, frequently after unpleasant or annoying life occasions. Misery is an overwhelming and progressing psychological well-being issue that can definitely affect on day by day living.

Explicit triggers will regularly cause misery, while gloom may have no recognizable reason. Trouble is a piece of sorrow however increasingly transitory in nature.

Look for a therapeutic assessment if trouble appears to proceed for an unbalanced measure of time. This could demonstrate the improvement of discouragement.

16,Our furnace in our home broke and we're losing heat every hour.  It's at 48 f now.  We don't have enough money for a service call and no one I know has the knowledge to fix it.  I'm feeling so low right now.  Everything goes wrong at once.  My therapist appointment is cancelled for today and I just don't know how to cope with this right now.  I feel like nothing is going to get solved and I just keep having bad intrusive thoughts. Man I just hate this.,15Nov2019,1
17,"Depression is coming back. I’m scared. I don’t want it to fuck up my life again. I feel so hopeless and see myself as worthless. I know it’s probably the “depression goggles” as I call it, but I just can’t get past it. I just keep thinking of the reasons why. This is mostly at work because work takes up a large portion of my life, (hell, is my life since I don’t have interest in doing anything), and is a source of stress. 

I feel so overwhelmed and I don’t want to say anything to my boss because I already feel like a fuck up who’s not doing enough. 

I can tell it’s becoming obvious at work. My boss literally asked if I’m not happy I need to say something...I think he said something else but I can’t remember, but I think it was suggestive at we can package you out. He sounded annoyed. Who wants a negative employee? He’s meeting with his boss later and I’m sure they are coming up with a plan to get rid of me because I’m worthless. 

He said he knows there’s a lot to do. But I can tell the way he says it that he just feels annoyed like everyone has a lot to do and they handle it fine. He said he had a list of things he needed help with but we can talk about it later. Now he feels like he can’t ask me to do anything. Another reason to fire me. 

Now I’m so embarrassed. Why can’t I just keep my mouth shut?? Why can’t I just put on a happy face for 10 hours (it’s SO hard now). 

I tell myself it’s the depression talking but I can’t think of any reason why my thoughts aren’t valid.",15Nov2019,1
18,"(sorry I didn't know how to flare the post except 'Other')

So, I've been depressed for, well not so long. 4 and a half months I believe. And during these 4 months I have learned to deal with depression. When it hits me I usually lay in bed, listen to some chill music, think about nothing and wait for the feeling to pass. 

At first, I would even cry for quite some time. I cried a lot. And as the time passed I cried less and less.
And now I do feel sad. It does hurt but I am literally unable to cry anymore and unable to let it all out.

The last snap I got from her she said something about how she's ""not sure she can make it through the next couple weeks.""

20,"Hi everyone! First, I'd like to apologize in advance for I'm French and my English might not be perfect. Second, I'm terrible at telling stories, but good at lists, so buckle up buckaroos, here comes a big one (tl;dr at the end!).  


One upon a time last year, when my life started to feel like a curse: 

1. Had cut every people I knew from my life since they were either jealous, take advantage of me, willing to drag me down in their misery or only using me as an emotional dumpster. Basically I had no friend. It was scary the first months but eventually I realized I was feeling so much better.
2. My boyfriend had maaaaaany ""friends"". They were all toxic in their own way: heavy alcoholism (the kind who says you're not fun if you don't drink), drugs, jealous, envious, lying SOBs. My BF knew all that before he met me but it was hard to cut those people from his life since they were childhood friends. He did cut them off, but oh boy what a mess.
3. BF and I decided to move in together, but since he was disoriented and mad at everything, he insisted we move far from our roots (200km might not be that far, but it is to me). I love my family, but I needed a fresh start as well so I agreed.
4. We found a house for rent. At first it was very cute, but it is a living hell: the floor is leaning, every step you make makes the whole house tremble, we hear every single noise from the outside. We thought moving in a small village would be a quiet bliss but we live right next to a daycare. It was closed during the summer we visited and moved into the house, and the landlord didn't mention it. The toddlers are crying non-stop from 7am to 7pm, the ladies in charge yell at them and the parents are amazingly stupid. All that means we cannot rest in our own house. At all. Never. 
5. I applyied for a postition consisting in accompanying student with disabilities, I had been doing this job for 3 years and loved it. It consists of me sitting next to attributed kids in class and helping them as much as I can. I began in october with one little girl in a class of ten pupils, and  a teacher who left me with a lovely PTSD. Crazy fucker, yelling at kids for not understanding the lessons, yelling at them for sneezing, yelling at them for everything, punishing them for crying, being a dick with me. The other teachers took his side, obviously.
6. Since my BF couldn't manage to find a job (not much opportunities where we live), and as he was already pretty much depressed from all the quitting and starting a life from scratch, I had to keep working in that hell of a school for 6 months, until my body couldn't handle it and I fainted before going to work one morning. Two doctors promptly suggested a sick leave.
7. Oh, during those 6 months, since my BF was a mess, he put the blame on me for all the bad things that happened to him. Yay. 
8. Eventually, I felt so useless and shitty that I considered closing my eyes while driving. Many reasons stopped me immediately, from the fact that I didn't want to kill a wild animal nor another driver to the fact that I refused to end up in a shady article in the news ""26 years old young woman kills herself in a terrible car crash, CLICK HERE for the picture of the crash"". I was intelligent enough to convince myself I had many things to do with my life. (playing Dark Souls helped a lot)
9. I started to see a therapist. BF gets more and more insecure while do my best to cheer him up (even before taking care of myself). 
10. BF found a job last summer. It was amazing for a week, but it crumbled appart and my BF got even worse in terms of insecurities, anxiety and depression. Did I mention he's hypochondriac too? I shup up and take care of him, but god do I need a hug and/or someone to take care of me. I considered learning sciences and cloning myself, or, again, ending myself. But I don't, instead I paint and play Dark Souls.
11. I would need a friend, but BF is being very posessive and judging about the way I talk to people, so I don't in order to avoid a scene. 
12. I would take an art class or go to the swimming pool, but I absolutely don't have the money for that. With BF we are considered poor in France, by the time the rent and bills are paid, we just have enough for some gas and a bit of food. Last winter there were time we had to choose between gas and food.

**This is an ordinary day for the past year:** 

* I wake up at 7am due to people being disrespectul and slamming their car door
* I go to work, need to talk but to shy to do so. I build up emotional weight.
* Come back to a disgusting kitchen, clean the house.
* BF comes back from work, vents for about 1h. It's always the same song again and again and again, but I stay still and wait for my turn to talk.
* When he's done, BF says ""now I need to be alone and quiet bye"" and doesn't let me talk about how I feel or what happened durin my day.
* I go to my room/office and numb myself with video games, videos or drawings to avoid thinking too much.
* I go down the kitchen to cook/eat what BF cooked, and go back to bed being sad and shit.

I feel like pure shit. Useless, gross, fat (I gained 10kg over the year from stress). I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, I have no friend, my family is there but we are not used to talk much. I call my parents once every two month and that's considered a lot. I'm lonely, BF refuses to see a therapist. Mine isn't really that useful to be honest, but at least for an hour I'm not in my house so...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : OP is French, complaining is in her DNA

22,"I moved 1,000 miles away from my hometown to live with my boyfriend a year ago and I’ve been miserable since. I love my boyfriend with everything in me, but I have a very, very close relationship with my family and the distance is killing me. I practically raised my sister (there’s a 10 year age gap), so I feel like I abandoned my child or something, even though she’s old enough to be more of my friend now. I miss living in a very small town (I live in Miami now), and just being close to everyone. My relationships with my family are slipping and it makes me hate my life.

My boyfriend refuses to live anywhere that isn’t urban especially somewhere as rural and “uncultured” as my home, and there’s no cities within a 4 hour distance from my hometown, which wouldn’t help at all. Idk what to do, I can’t imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I can’t imagine living like this without my family near me for much long either.

Am I pathetic for being so close to my family and not having the strength to put effort into building a life separate from them?

Disclaimer I'm not the most coherent person and I tend to ramble. Not sure if this fits in this sub I also posted to r/AnxietyDepression) 
 
So I've suffered with crippling anxiety since the age of 12 when my dad passed in quite a traumatic way for me. I've been through therapy/on meds for years and about a year ago I was feeling much less depressed and anxious and came off my meds yay!! 

A few months ago, I lost my job and it was a massive blow to my confidence. Ive slipped back into a depression and never want to leave the house and am constantly arguing with my boyfriend (massive social butterfly) because I don't want anyone at the house and I just lock myself in the bathroom and cry all the time. Obviously arguing has been making it worse as I feel like I'm losing him aswell as my mind.
Hes very kind but generally not the most sympathetic as he leads a very fast paced life and has been through a hell of a lot and his way to deal with his issues is the opposite to me lol.

The past month my heads been full of suicidal thoughts, I think about killing myself most of the day, every day. Like even if we are sitting watching TV I'll be looking round the room planning ways I could do it (even though I probably wouldn't). Last night my boyfriend got really frustrated with me because he noticed I'd been self harming (when I do this I don't usually even remember It really and am always so embarrassed by it as soon as I realise-do other people get this??) and I shouted something about how I just wanted to die but I just couldn't leave him on his own and he looked absolutely heartbroken just cuddled me for ages. We had an amazing talk and he was the first person I've EVER told about being suicidal (not even my therapist). I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can't stop crying, even now (in a good way) and I wish I had said something so much sooner. I also not believe that someone can love me unconditionally for who I am and that's really special. 

Our relationship already feels so much more back on track and even though I'm still sad, I really feel like I've accomplished something and feel very blessed to have such an amazing man in my life.

I guess I don't have too much of a point here. I just feel like I've really accomplished something and made a massive step in both my mental health and my relationship and wanted to share with someone. :)",15Nov2019,1
25,"I used to hate that I cried so much... now  I hate that I can't. Not crying has become worse.   
I have the urge to, but not a single tear sheds. I feel every bit of emotion running through my body but it's like I can't let it out. I need to let it out.   


I'm not okay... I need advice.

27,"I have been going through the hardest time of my life for three solid years.  It has been non stop and  I didn’t cause any of it.   I lost all and haven’t been able to recover (flooded), I put trust and loyalty  in a leader that has now caused me to be unemployed twice, I am dead broke with no family.   I am in my 50’s and just mentally exhausted from it all.  If my mother were alive, she would help me.    I miss her.",15Nov2019,1
28,"The only thing that I really love in my life is family. I just failed the most important exams in my college, and I am probably perceived now as one of the dumbest students. Irony is that I studied really hard for all of them, but apparently it’s not enough for my IQ. I’m keeping disappointing my family, all my friends left me at some point of life. I’m really strong believer in true love, but my first kiss was forced since I was drunk to the point of passing out. People probably see me as someone weird + I’m ugly.

I just had enough. Being good student was the only thing that I was proud of, but college changed everything. I just want to disappear or not exist. The only thing that disgust me about being dead is that I’m leaving my body behind.

And no, I’m not edgy 13yrs old girl seeking attention. I’m just tired and fed up with everything, without having person who would hear me out.",15Nov2019,1
29,"My sister's in the hospital because she tried to kill herself. She swallowed every pill she could find and almost died.

There's a lot on my mind about it.

She might be forced into a psych ward and if my parents fight that, they'll get a court order and take her away.

Long story short, my sister almost drowned and died during a hiking trip where we had to cross white water rapids.  I saved her life by jumping in after her. She told me that she was grateful for the rocks because they saved her. She became obsessed with rocks. Eventually she realized I saved her, but she told me that she wished I let her die and that she was upset with me for saving her.

I'm sitting in the hall, because the doctors won't let me or my sister visit her. And now they'll take her away.

I hate doctors and the government. Nobody cares and they're all willing to fight me in any way possible. They have security guards decked out with tasers, pepper spray, batons, etc. That patrol. And they have lawyers and psychiatrists etc.. 

I stopped taking my meds a while ago. My family messed me up. I was physically and sexually abused as a child and I developed serious problems from that. 

Idk. I hate the world and I just want to die.

I want to hurt everyone who has hurt me and everyone who is hurting my sister right now. I hate that the government not only let things get this far, but also passed measures to make this happen.

And then all the people who comment on pages like this pretending to have answers. Causs you don't have any answers for me. There's nothing you can do. I'm so done with life and everyone. All I have to live for is life's simple pleasures and making others suffer for ruining my life.",15Nov2019,1
30,I recently found out that one of my friends has tried to end her life (again) and ended up at the hospital. Does anyone know how I could or can help her?,15Nov2019,1
