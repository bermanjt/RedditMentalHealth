1,"I have a lot of ""friends"". However there's only a small circle of them that I actually trust, talk to, feel welcomed and safe when I'm with them. The problem it that they live abaut 22 miles away from me and this will get confusing but bare with me... I live in a small country in Europe called Slovenia and an eaven smaller town called Gornji Grad. Now the problem with them beeing so far is that from this small town there aren't any buses to their town we don't have a train station I don't have a car or licence yet and nobody in my family hasn't got time to take me there... I know them because we go to the same city to school but we don't get to see eachother there as often as I would like... We do talk online sometimes but they're out most of the day so some days we don't talk at all... It really sucks because I love them and want to spend more time with them but I can't :( ... There's not much I can do but if anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them... Thank you &lt;3 ",04Mar2019,2
2,"My cousin was 26, same age as me. Long story short, there was a battle for a while and it led to a decision nobody thought of. 


I don't know what to say. I'm fucking sad. I was before this happened and now it's impossible. Ever since I decided to leave my girlfriend 7 months ago, my depression has gotten worse; I thought I would be better off without the abuse. 

I'm looking for anybody to just say nice things or share a story. I'm looking for anything. My hands are on the ground along with my head and my knees. I'm beginning to get into a hole. A hole with muddy walls that I can't grab to climb out. I'm stuck.

I feel like I'm all over the place but I needed to find a subreddit for help.

3,"I seem to fall in love wit the wrong girls. Over the span of a couple of months there ware two girls I was interested in. It fell through with both of them. The second however left me ""scared"". She recently broke up with her boyfriend. We talked a lot and I comforted her. She told me how much she appropriated me and how I helped her. I started to catch feelings and so did she. She told me that she loves me a number of times. It made me feel so good, unstoppable eaven. But then one day I sent her a message on snapchat and I saw that she unfriended me and when I checked her instagram profile and I was blocked there. It made me feel sad and numb. The day before she said she loves me. And the next day it was as it never happened. I'm crying as I'm writing this because I can't belive how someone could do that to another pearson. I even told her to not to talk to me like that (how she loves me etc.) If she didn't mean it. I already had trust issues and after a while I believed her. But now I feel betrayed. How can someone seriously do that to someone. Like feeling aren't nothing but a old toy you one day just stop playing with. I don't know if I can ever trust anyone ever again after this. I don't see how it will ever be worth it to risk everything again. I can't and since that I've had suicidal thoughts a lot. I feel like I'm a joke. I can't belive I actually thought I was good enough for her. I don't know what to do. I'm too embarrassed to talk to my friends because in the last they've made fun of me for these things.

     I go to high school and have fake friends, non loving parents, abusive boyfriend, and stressful classes. I feel lonely all the time and these fake friends are the only company I enjoy. But I know they exploit me for my money and would rather do other stuff, I try being positive and funny but nothing works. My parents hate me because I'm gay and their Christian so they'll kick me out when I turn 18 next year. I'm a guy and bisexual and this boy is the only person who won't wanna just have sex and leave me. I take honors and have to, I hate it and really is really the icing on the cake.

     I have suicidal thoughts all the time and think about scenarios where I just end it all. I have self harm urges and sometimes want to get my father's hunting rifle and shoot myself.

11,"Hello,guys. I made a post once looking for help, I explained in that post that I was depressed because I used to over think about my intelligence. In those days I decided to take a professional iq test so I could finally be in peace and happy. I did the test and the score I got was 160, but since then, I've been feeling really sad,stressed and also anxious whenever I see someone who's probably not as ""smart"" as me achieving awesome stuff. I know that an iq doesn't grant success, it just makes it easier for me to learn and understand, but every time I talk with someone who's not as ""smart"" as me, and they act like if they were actually smarter than me, I feel very sad and anxious, I don't know why this happens and I'm getting really sad, I'm done of taking my depression medication, it really affects my brain a lot, I struggle at memorizing information which makes it a lot more frustrating. I have one cousin who's not that smart, that reminds me over and over that I have a poor memory. I know that I say ""not as smart as me"" a lot, but if you were in my place you would understand. I dont know if there's a person who's also intellectually gifted over here, or maybe someone who knows more about this topic. But I need some help.",04Mar2019,2
12," 

I'll start off by stating that though I am suicidal, I am very rational about my mental illness (depression and anxiety both diagnosed) Also My second post on Reddit so yeah, this will be a very depressing read and is more of a rant to anonymous people on the internet that anything else, I am NOT attention seeking.

I'm at the lowest point in my life right now and I thought sharing it with my family would help but it made things worse. I was never of much concern to them, but once I told them that I went to go kill myself suddenly they won't leave me alone, always calling me and forcing me to eat properly. It took a suicide attempt for my family to realise 'OK maybe this isn't something we can ignore and sweep under the rug, so lets overcompensate.

It's gone from nobody knowing about this, to suddenly everyone in my family is giving me pity-attention and I hate it. My life over these past few months has driven me into the metaphorical ground. My friend dies in car accident in December, bad grades on my university work, my concentration and memory worsening, sleeping patters are a joke, starving myself as some for of self punishment and loathing, and to top it all off, my Dog of 14 years and the only part of my family that wasn't disappointed by me and my longest friend had her spine collapse and was put down last week. I didn't even know until two days after it happened. (I live in university halls)

I go to a doctor at my parent's request and they say 'get a hobby, and eat healthily'. None of my hobbies stimulate me anymore (the little that they did). They gave me no answers or solutions to the fact that every minute I am awake I wish I was dead. I can't find anything to excite or motivate me. Everyone around me has a significant other but I'm too much of an emotional bland wreck to even try and find someone to make me happy like that.

The ONLY reason I haven't already offed myself is that it would devastate my family, but when you spend your life being the (again metaphorical) hole in which everyone else dumps their problems on it gets wearisome. No one has ever cared how much my existence hurts, but continue to take me for granted, coming to me with their petty squabbles to tell em how much they don't like so and so, when I'm here trying to stay friends with everyone because if I lose anyone, I can't keep myself sane. I'm supposedly seeing a counsellor but they won't be around for another 3 weeks, my parents would freak out and make me drop out of Uni (even though I will probably fail anyway). I can't bring myself to do anything.

After being the least amount of trouble possible, and the best friend to everyone I could be can't I be selfish for wanting to die? For once in my pathetic waste of a life can't I feel justified in wanting to kill myself. Cos I think I do

I think it would be a cowardly and awful thing to do to my family, but really the idea of jumping off a bridge and letting my brain  splatter is the only thing that actually stimulates me anymore. My friends bicker and it hurts, or they all go off to live their other happy parts of their lives leaving me alone to brood on how miserable I am, and my family looks at me with pity. The last few weeks have been the worst.

Suddenly from my family there's no more pressure to succeed in my successful family member's footsteps, no patronising comments about how childish I am. Not even a 'pull yourself together' for old time's sake. Suddenly I'm like a delicate vase that they're scared of breaking cos they know it'll make a mess. It's not just misery, I'm angry too.

You don't have to worry about me hurting anyone else ('NO ONE GETS HURT' is my rule in this, until I'm dead) but I feel like I'm at the end of the road and my best solution is to kill myself. That's why I'm here at nearly 5AM in the morning with an unfinished presentation due in 4 hours talking to you because I have no one else to turn to but anonymous people on the internet. (NO offence, every real life person I've turned to has made me feel worse).

I know it's the anxiety talking but I don't see any improvement on the horizon, which is why I'm here. I need some reason to keep going on, otherwise I might just kill myself this evening I care that little about myself. Maybe this is all my own fault I'm in this mess I dunno.

So yeah, that's my situation laid bare, the majority of the whole messes up hell I'm living. If nothing else I'm glad I got this down in writing, so even if no one sees it, I'll have a way to reflect on how pathetic I am.

I hope you're having a good day at least, because I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Please be better than me.",04Mar2019,1

If you suffer from depression, then it's beneficial to stay away from people that are negative, but that doesn't mean you that you need to stay away from negative emotions.

And what I am talking about here is that I have some great friends that help me out and communicate with me and look after me but sometimes they get angry at stuff, and they like to vent, and I find that when their venting, that gives me a lot of time to just sit as a friend and listen and to get off myself and that's been really beneficial to me.

I am grateful for

venting negative emotion

I like it when people vent to me.

I don't feel like it annoys me.

I can honestly say I'd push anything out of the way, to listen to you vent.

Because I know how it feels when you have so much bottled inside of you. You're at that point where you can't stand it and need to let things out finally.

I'm a 19yo french art student..
Since last year i've meet some friends that became very important to me, i love being with them. I really think that they permeate a better version of myself.
I've some problems about self confidence and social interaction, but be with this small group is a very powerful motivation to express myself, or just try to talk more. I really want to construct my relationships on honesty and open mind, i work in that way.
But each time, when im alone in my appartment, in the bus, when im working ... I have no motivation, Sad thougts and a mix between dark minds and melancholia.
I can stay hours just laying in my bed, eat nothing or the opposite, eat anything i can found (i hate myself when i do that). 
Watch movies, read or just draw, some of my passions, seems hard to do. I just feel empty some times and i can't tell why. 
The exact feeling i have is like a fish in a bocal, a spiral of boringness and unmotivation. 
I make efforts in social context, and i like the way i follow, i'm happy today like i never been before with my friends, but i just can't understand why this hidden sadness is so powerful and seem so deep. I don't know what i can do. 
With my friends we talk a lot about how we feel, about mental health, and also depression, but i can't stop asking myself questions about my own state ... 
If you have any opinion or advice, i'll be happy to read. ",04Mar2019,2

22," It started early in my childhood. I was a very hyperactive child. Could not focus when in school and always getting in trouble. The school recommended I take medication when I was in elementary school and my dad refused. I got up to 4th grade, again was told I needed help and was put in special ed. That's when my artistic side of me came out. Loved to draw and be creative. Also during these times a brother came along. Much jealously,  also alot of mother and father disputes, and I mean alot. And still I was not treated properly. 5th grade I joined the boy scouts to get away from the family issues and lo and behold my father joined also. Always used me as an example of what not to be around the other scouts. Junior high things began to get even worse with the family issues, and my grades reflected on that. And also at that time I was becoming very attracted to boys my age. Coming from a Christian family it made things very difficult for me. Also my father always judged me. I was very behind in school. Did not graduate till I was 21, and at this time did not have many friends and was even more attracted to guys, due to being still in scouts. And through junior high and high school, never took gym class due to being afraid of being found out. Just could not be around guys in nude or in underwear. I hid my sexuality. By this time things between my father and mother had gotten to pushing, fighting, throwing, cussing and I could not take it anymore. So I began defending my Mom. So the true hatred towards me from my father came out, to actual full blown fist fights and whatever else that could be picked up fights. I desided to work at summer camp for 8 weeks one summer. During this time, my moms mother lived with us due to having a stroke, she had been there a while, all dad did was make fun of her to appoint where she would not even come out of her room. But she witnessed all the fights and my moms treatment.
While at summer camp it happened. Mom got out, went to her Moms house took grandmother with her, no electricity no running water in her home, due to her living with us. I become very emotional and become very depressed, and wanted to kill myself at camp, due to not being there and not being able to get in contact with my mom. I was kicked out of summer camp. And was told I needed to get help soon. We went to family counciling . I was just seen for the first few months, then mom. Then my brother, then Dad. That's when everything changed. My dad was told he needed seperate treatment.  And I was basically the head of the household trying to keep everyone together. I was asked to take hypnosis to find the root of my issues. And quit going to therapy due being found out I was gay. I moved out, got my own place, mom and dad divorced,  and I led a path of self destruction . Drugs and alcohol . Just wanted to escape. Had my first relations with guys, but never thought of myself being attractive or happy with myself. I had no direction. Drugs was becoming a major part of life. Cocaine, pot, pain pills, alcohol.  Where my favs. Then my grandmother died. I was a paulbairer.  That's when I realized I was killing myself. Seaked treatment,  got away from drugs, but still suffered from depression deeply, still to this day. I was told I have manic depression due to being Bipolar.  I take meds. But they seem not to help. Not anymore. My view on life is very bleak . I dont feel accomplished.  I dont feel attractive. Lost interest in things I love most. Art and video games and TV. I would rather just lay in bed and enjoy the silence.  I still look at men, look at men all the time, always have compared myself to other guys. I have a partner of 11 years now. But nothing sexual, due to a surgery I had several years ago that kinda changed how things work down there. Which has not helped matters. So now my partner has become somewhat like my father, criticizing me all the time. I lay here in bed now as I type this, and wonder , wonder if  i will ever know the true meaning of happiness and accomplishment,  and feel good about myself. Thanks for your time. ",04Mar2019,3
23,"I realize that I shouldn’t compare my life to other’s, but I can’t stop myself from doing it.

My two younger sisters are successful in their careers, married, own homes, and having children. I’m in my late 30s, divorced, and I’m living in a trailer. 

It’s not that I think a house automatically equates to success. Although I was pre-approved for a mortgage due to excellent credit, the down payment and monthly payments would make me house poor and I’m afraid to jump into that - some days.

I’m having trouble focusing. Some days I’ll apply for jobs in other states, despite realizing that problems follow you unless you solve them. 

I have began to see a therapist once a week, and that is slowly helping. My student loans (bachelor’s in Liberal Arts) are nearly paid off, and that’s my only debt. At the same time, I don’t make much money at my full time job. 

There have been plenty of great things I’ve done in my life, I have great friends who live close by, and others who are always asking me to visit. My sisters and parents are nothing but great people, but I feel very worthless, and often. 

When I get those down feelings, I get mad at myself because I know it could be so many times over worse, but some days I can’t escape it, and it just sucks.

How do some of you deal with it? I try to exercise. I spend time with friends. My back tightens up if I lay down for more than 9 hours, so I’m not sucked to my bed all day on a day off. 

How are you able to focus and stay focused on the positives in your life?

Be brutally honest. I’ll share whatever is asked. Thanks in advance. ",04Mar2019,9
24,"Basically as the title says; I have some really great, close friends, and over the last year, I've found myself at least semi-frequently taking out my anger on them when they don't deserve it at all. I always realize this soon after, but I feel like you can only apologize so much for that kind of thing. I sometimes find myself feeling like I don't deserve to have some of them as friends bc of how I sometimes treat them, which I always feel horrible for. Luckily they always just interpret as me being cranky or something but I always feel like it's more than that. 

I feel like there's an obvious solution to this, but I don't know what to do sometimes. Does anyone else feel this way? Am I alone in this?",04Mar2019,2
25,"I've known this friend for about 6 months now, I noticed her depression and talked to her about it, and I let her know she is always welcome to talk to me about whatever is bothering her and not think that it would bother me. 
She says yes, but then she pretends to be happy and all smiles and pink all day, until she walks alone and I notice her almost wanting to break down. 

I've been depressed for the last 5 years but honestly even I don't know what I need to open up to someone, I just have a friend that I slowly trusted more to open my heart to them. 

Anyone with more insight knows if there is something I can do or say to help? All I did was make her time at school bearable and to let her know that I'm here for her, but I'm always paranoid that she might do something stupid. 

We live in a shitty country and very few people believe that depression is real, so there is no 911 or some kind of hotline to report to. There are therapists and I talked to her to see one, but she still doesn't feel comfortable with the idea. 

What can I do to help? ",04Mar2019,9
26,"I am really struggling with certain aspects of my life, I can't get motivated. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving various forms of therapy for the past two years since my son was born. I believe that I have suffered with depression since way before my son was born but the signs weren't recognised until I was being seen by a health professional regularly.

I am very lucky to have a roof over my head, a loving husband and a full time job. However, I cannot seem to escape the void of depression. Currently I'm in a the crippling pit, and I cannot motivate myself with certain things. I don't take my medication, I know I should but I have some sort of mental block that stops me taking it. My work is suffering because I've found a way to get by, doing the day to day tasks but not doing my daily reports. I would describe myself as high functioning depressed as I can get out of bed and get dressed, but the only reason I do this is my son.

I live with my husband and in laws and I've just realised that I'm not happy anywhere. I'm not happy at work, I'm not happy at home. I get on well with my in laws but they drive me crazy by parenting my son. At work I feel out of my depth and like I'm just winging it, badly.

I just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I can't bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with?

I cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I can't motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly. I am just existing enough to keep my son fed, bathed and clothed, but I am not looking after myself.

Sorry if this post had no direction or real question, I just hope there is maybe someone who's been through something similar and is now on the other side who may have some advice. ",04Mar2019,6

As you should see I have a big depression I don't want to do / can't do anything and I have extreme anxiety for almost every social situation between my teacher or to the ""cool"" kids in class and also when I want to buy something for example I can't order something in an restaurant because I am to anxious. 

I can take EVERYTHING in an negative way so thats let me think that always the worst situation will come out but it's actually never the case.

I don’t want therapy, but if I tell the doctor how I feel will they prescribe me something or will I have to attend therapy? ",04Mar2019,3
29,"I have had chronic depression basically my whole life. I remember as a kid (8-12yo) I would embarrass myself or feel guilty in some inane way and would cry and scream in to my pillow for hours that I wanted to die. I didn’t understand what was happening and I never shared that with anyone until I was an adult.

In middle school I was bullied brutally both physically and mentally for being an atheist in the Bible Belt. I felt so alone with barely any friends and a family that was evangelically Christian that couldn’t understand or accept me. When I started seeing a therapist my freshmen year of high school I didn’t think all of that affected me psychologically. At the age of 21 I now realize it fucked me up.

As a freshman I began dating a senior (the drum major of our marching band). I lost my virginity to her in the fall and two days later she broke up with me. I went insane with sadness, spending nearly all of my time crying, hiding, and self harming for months. I ended up getting sent to a rehabilitation center by my parents. They prescribed me drugs that made me feel completely numb which was honestly worse than feeling something. So I began faking taking it and reveling in the sadness. I faked my way through rehab and got to go home in a few weeks.

In reality I was worse than when I went in. 

The pain stayed for two years after that. The sadness ebbed and flowed but I slowly recovered. I became really involved in debate (CX) and quit band. I was empowered by debate, it was something that i was actually good at for once. I threw all the energy I had in to the event and won state with my parter during my Junior year. This was the highest point of life, and the only time I have ever felt of worth. By this time I had not self harmed in over a year. My mother told me she was proud of me, my father has never said those words. That didn’t hurt at the time, it does now.

I am now 21, I live a cheap 1 bedroom apartment by myself with my dog. I go to college and barely get by in classes. The depression started again about 2 years ago for no particular reason. Maybe it’s existential, maybe it’s chronic, I don’t know. But I’m suicidal for the third time in my life and I don’t know if I’m going to make it though this one.

I feel as though I live a shadow life, pretending for everyone else and only taking actions that would benefit others. I have a hard time even caring about myself. I lost my job a couple of weeks ago because I couldn’t force myself out of bed.

It’s strange how when you become suicidal. When you know you might just end it soon all of the facets of life that are important to healthy people just start to fall apart. You neglect hygiene, school and work obligations, and nutrition. You begin spending money that you know you shouldn’t spend if you want a place to live next month on gifts for others and anything to numb the pain. 

I know that if I just forced myself to act normal for a bit longer I might be able to get my life back on track, but I’m just so tired. I’m a pathetic loser and I drag down those I love. I really think the world would be better place without me.",04Mar2019,1
30,"Had my first individual therapy session this morning.  For a bit of background, I just turned 39 last week and have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for basically my entire life.  I have the genetic sh\*tstorm of depression from both of my parents.  It's a long line of depression and suicidal thoughts for generation upon generation.  I'm married and my wife and I have separated a couple of weeks ago in order for us to each seek therapy for our depression and couples counseling to work on our marriage.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm encouraged.  I found this group last week and have posted a couple of times on here since.  Just being able to put this out into the world anonymously and get feedback has truly helped.  Take me as an example.  The positive reinforcement that you fine folks send out through the internet into people's inboxes helps.  It makes a difference.  Be a difference maker for someone today.

I'm far from done with this journey.  I won't be until I've shuffled off this mortal coil.  None of us are finished products.  We all need work.  I'm tired of acting like I have everything together.  The energy it takes to remain under the crushing weight of depression is so much more than the energy required to find healing and health.  Take the steps necessary to change your life NOW.  We aren't promised tomorrow.  All we have is today.  Seize the day and start a change in your life.",04Mar2019,2

33,"hey y’all. 24/f/usa

so i’ve had depression since i was ten, and GAD since i was 13, so mental health has kinda defined me for most of my life.

right now i’m living at home with my parents, am unemployed, and take part time classes at a nearby university. i’ve been seeing my therapist for two years now and she has helped tremendously with my anxiety and PTSD, but i haven’t been entirely honest with her about my feelings of hopelessness. and i honestly don’t want to tell her. the idea of admitting to her “i’m worse than i lead you to believe and we have to start from square one” just makes me nauseous.

so besides that: what am i supposed to do? my friends don’t have much advice beyond “oh wow i’m sorry :( “ and i don’t expect them to say much else honestly. they have enough problems as it is, i don’t need to add to their stress. 

and my parents have the combined emotional intelligence of a stapler, so i can’t rely on them for much of anything. oh and my mother’s a hoarder so our home is basically a shithole hahah.

i live in a white bread suburb, no car or license and no hope about my future or present. i’m just lost. i don’t know what to do.",04Mar2019,3
34,"I’m tired of fighting to keep living each day when I just wake up and hate myself and want to die. Why do I keep living if I don’t want to. And as for other people, I couldn’t care less what happens to my family if I were to go and as for my friends they’ll get over it. I just want to drive off a bridge",04Mar2019,5
35,I’ve tried all sorts of medication to help. Prozac made me brake down and drive me to attempting suicide. I’ve found that weed helps me most. Even a few days after smoking/eating I feel happy-ish. My parents know I’ll smoke sometimes but I don’t think they’ll understand. I’m thinking at this point anything I end up doing will make me suffer physically.,04Mar2019,1

37,I don’t know what to do. 2/3 of the people who I could comfortably talk to and rely on to help me with my depression just told me not to message them anymore and the third might say the same thing. It hurts so bad I can’t even put it into words. I don’t know who to reach out to anymore because they were all I had. I even have a crush on one of them and I cannot describe the pain I’m in of them telling me to quit talking to them. I just want to know what to do to get my mind off of things because I feel worse than I have in years. I can’t stop crying and every time one I do I think about them again and continue. Please someone help. I feel like I’m out of options.,04Mar2019,3
38," Hello everyone, I'm new to reddit and am looking for a place not to ask for pity or advice but instead to release the thoughts that are plaguing me. I often find expressing these thoughts out loud to someone helps greatly, but finding a way to do so without repercussions is.. difficult.

So Anyway,

I thinking this is it. The time to be done with it all. Even after months of progress I'm back in the hole and feel empty and unwilling to climb out. I'd seek help but I can't afford to be unwillingly hospitalized. I don't expect any sort of help to found here either, the last place I tried to anonymously dump my feelings I was of course just told to go ahead and do it. I expected no less of course, but it was indeed cathartic, so be able to say, with others reading, I actually want to die.

I'm not even sure if this is the correct place to post this but.. this is just as I said, my catharsis. Please forgive me.",04Mar2019,2
39,"First I’m going to start with my current situation. Got laid off from my job two days after Christmas because I complained about training a jackass piece of shit getting paid more than me. Lived in a 2700 sq ft home where the neighbor had been smoking crack for the entire two years I lived there. I put up with it. Then the guy decides to sell it to a chemist who also an addict. They cooked meth in the fucking basement. Everyone in my house was sick. My 18 lb cat stopped eating for two weeks. I can tell you a cat does not get to 18 lbs by not eating. My dog had stuff coming out of him. I wasn’t sure which end it came out of. 

So I go to the doctor to get all my symptoms medically documented, including aura seizures which is a new thing for me. I find out today that she has decided to diagnose me with something without actually telling me. So currently I am diagnosed with anorexia. When I use a BMI calculator my weight is in the normal BMI range. Jesus lady, I’m already depressed of the entire situation. She didn’t even mention it to me. It just showed up on a form I’m supposed to take to the lab. WTF?! 

Okay when I first started seeing this doctor I weighed about 148, now I weigh about 116. The doctor doesn’t know this and hasn’t bothered to ask me. I had a Mirena IUD for about a month and gained about 25-30 lbs. None of my clothes fit me anymore, and I felt really uncomfortable at that weight. So instead of asking me she just assumed something that isn’t true. 

Thanks Doc I feel a lot better about myself. ",04Mar2019,3
