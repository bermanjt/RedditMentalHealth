Ppl here supported me even though i was honest and looked like an asshole. I acted like one, i realised if i love this girl i need to let her live her life. In the mean time i want to change my life. I want to get fit, get back into therapy. I want to be a better me. I dont want to feel like i wanna die all the time",03Apr2019,4
1,"Recently my ocd symptoms have gotten much worse. It used to not bother me that much, just little non harmful compulsions like washing my hands a little too much. At this point it is heavily affecting my well being and my daily life. I was in such a good place a few days ago but now I am becoming hopeless.

I barely get up from my computer all day. The only things I can do are sleeping or gaming. I have not shaved in days and I stay in bed until 11 every day. Only on rare occasions I do my homework. When I do, I just sit there slouched over with my hands over my face hiding. Right now I am procrastinating on reddit just so I do not have to do anything. Any task that takes more than minimal energy seems impossible and I do not know what to do. 

I really need help, my therapist says that I need to build self discipline and I need to force myself to do things even when I do not have to. This never really was a problem until now. Getting out of this seems impossible.",03Apr2019,1
2,"I've been so distracted and spacey, I feel so useless like a slug recently. The weight of  my my state is really crushing on me and I've been getting headaches alot. I can barely focus and 90% of my interests I can't do. I cry almost every day and its just ruining my life. The last time I remember being happy (besides daydreaming) is a while ago

I'm very passionate about my dreams but lately it feels like nothing works out or it ever will.I try so much to succeed but I just get rejected so much. 

I've tried to do online therapy, but they always reject my signup. Went to talk to my counsellor at my school but it gave me so much anxiety because they would take notes on everything and I just had to talk, instead of answer questions which is easier. I've tried to tell my family but they just ignore and won't let me go anywhere.

Maybe I just have to grind through the rest of high school so next year I can get myself some legit help but for now...",03Apr2019,1
4,i believe i posted on here with me saying something about my friend who has been feeling kinda suicidal or something like that and it happening again and im really worried about him now he is not listening to the advice im giving him. just a recap of what i said his parents are really strict and i mean really strict they told him things like hes worthless he makes more mistakes than anyone in the entire world and he fucks up everyones life. he seems really happy in public and around other people but around me just the two us he talks a lot about suicide and hating himself im really fucking scared for him. im someone who get easily irritated and im struggling with depression and anxiety i really want to help him because he means the world to me he said that i hate him and i dont even know where he got that i really want to help him.,03Apr2019,1
5,"I cannot stop circling this drain and the only thing keeping me up is the love of my life, who has stepped up it a couple times now on me. I love her with everything I have left. Are newborn just turned one and sometimes it's all i can do to even look at him. He hasn't done anything and i love my baby boy. My stomach feels like it's in a constant loop of panic attacks and my wife's stepfather and his best friend keep trying to get my wife alone to proposition her for stuff again that fathers have no business doing and if i say something i send my hunny spiraling too cause she hates it but will not break off from her parents for our boys sake.

6,My best friend (16 years old) is struggling with severe depression. I’ve had to call the police to stop her from doing bad things. Her parents took her out of therapy and stopped her medicine. What are my options and what can she do? ,03Apr2019,3
7,"I'm not exactly sure where to start with this. 

I'm unemployed as of about a month ago, haven't been able to find a job yet. My boyfriend is doing what he can but has to use most of his paycheck (about half) to get to and from work since he hasn't been able to find a car. Lyft rides are 30USD one way, better than a normal cab or Uber but still. Friends that were helping him get to and from are sick of doing it, and I can't drive and my credit score is in the shitter so no help there. We owe about two months in back rent. 

I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and I'm off my medications because I can't even afford the generic (Wellbutrin and Prozac, respectively). I don't have insurance. I was able to go out and apply for medicaid today, so hopefully that changes soon. Without the meds it's getting harder and harder to do things. I've started to very clearly visualize myself dead or dying- like I'll be laying down to sleep and my mind will paint a very graphic picture of my corpse, dead by my own hand. I feel like everything is my fault and nothing I do will ever be of any value. I'm afraid to reach out to my friends because I don't want to mooch off of them or take advantage of them. I know that I need therapy and medication but I don't know how to do so. I feel trapped and worthless. Please, how can I stop this when I have no income and no family to ask for financial help?

10,"Was feeling pretty good today, then it hit me this evening. Not sure what triggered it if anything, but I’m headed to my night class and I’m just ready to cry - I felt the emptiness inside me grow until it consumed me tonight.

After class I went to my Tuesday night extra curricular with my “friends” in my department. While everyone was sitting around chatting I literally laid on the floor, alone, just sitting on my phone. Not a single person acknowledge me. One of my really good friends was there but he started being an asshole to me ever since I got a girlfriend, so another friend lost.

It just furthered the idea that everyone secretly hates me and I just feel so lonely and empty right now. I want to cry but I can’t. I also want a hug more than ANYTHING right now but I’m alone in my room and no one’s around to give me one. So I guess this is my Tuesday. 

It sucks because I had a good therapy session today too and then like 2 hour later I crash back down again. I’m so fucking lonely and I really don’t want to sleep alone tonight. What do you all do when this happens? Any coping mechanisms or anything that helps? ",03Apr2019,4

I have a few other not so close friends I have talked to about depression. And the other day I had 2 leave me on read. :/ 
The first friend I have also invited her to multiple events. I asked her a month ahead of time for a concert and a reading, and she decided she didn’t wanna go to the concert. She was going to come hang out that day, I asked what she was up to and she said she had went to the concert with a friend. 
I invited her to an event this Friday and she said she didn’t wanna be wasting money. Yet she just impulsively got a tattoo the other day with me. I don’t get it.

14,"Was wondering if anyone else has this issue. Granted, I've only been on two antidepressants so far (Zoloft, Effexor), but I'm noticing a similar pattern already: I start the med and once I get to a certain dosage I'm doing really great, and it lasts for a while (like maybe a year or two), then I notice my depression and anxiety sort of breaking through and eventually it's like the med isn't really doing anything.   


Otherwise, I haven't really had any problems with these meds, other than Zoloft seemed to make me want to sleep a lot.   


I'm apprehensive about switching to yet another med just to go through the same cycle again. From what I've read here and elsewhere it sounds like there's a lot of trial and error in finding what works, but still....",03Apr2019,6
15,"I haven't had the ability to feel real happiness in about twelve years. I'm 25. I feel like I'm just waiting to die, and can't make myself take any steps to improve things because I just hate myself too fucking much. I won't harm or kill myself because both of my parents have come right out and said that would end up doing the same if I ever did. So I'm just waiting for them to pass on naturally so I can stop suffering. I have literally zero friends anymore, either because my self loathing appeared as a pity party and pushed them away or my paranoia that everyone hates me as much as I do made me an asshole that drove them away. My whole family wouldn't have anything to do with me if they knew who I really was (atheist, recovered cocaine addict, bisexual) because they're all devout ""Christians"" that are supposed to love the way Jesus loved. I'm so disconnected from all emotion that time doesn't register as passing for me at all. Days all run together and I rarely know even remotely what time/day of the week it is. I'm unemployed, living in a house belonging to my aunt who would disown me for the reasons previously mentioned, and have no prospects for future employment and even less drive to change that.

16,"Thanks to the tag I realized I guess I am just ranting all my thoughts. I don’t even know if Im supposed to post here, but at the bottom of this rant it’s fueled by a depression so I came here. I usually just rant to myself and write it down on paper and feel a little better getting it out. I guess I just decided to switch it up and let people be able to read my rant and tell me I’m crazy so I don’t have to. 
By all means I don’t deserve to post here. I mean I don’t have real problems for some people, but for my life it’s on a steady escalator and the direction is down. 
I’ll start of by saying I don’t think I’m a terrible guy I really like to help people and have fun laughing with friends. The normal typical America 22 year old growing up playing sports and even in college. I’ve had girlfriends here and there and even had both parents growing up. I should have everything I need to succeed right? Well no in college I spent my life savings from having a paper route when I was 6 to working at the pizza shop till I was 18 on the first semesters books not even room and board or tuition... books.. that I didn’t even really need. So I was lucky enough to have my parents help out with the rest always being reminded when bills were due that school is to much and you need to get a scholarship. They always said growing up that they would help with college, you know the American dream promise. But I worked since I was 6 so they wouldn’t have to help, big mistake. I Try scholarships and I applied for every one only lose to because of my race like you read above I should have everything right why do I need a scholarship. Give it to the next guy with a little worse grades, but at least their background is interesting. I wish I was making it up, but I’ve seen it and lived it. So pressured with school and trying to do good in sports with the voice of my parents, play better you need that athletic scholarship or it’s all gone. Come to graduation year the sports program closes so immediately no more help from my parents and I have to drop out and work. End up working several different jobs that I went above and beyond for my employer, because “you work as hard as your worth” right I want good happy things and I’ll work hard for it maybe someone will see it and get promoted type of mindset. End up being used and blamed for the bosses mistake or just fired for no reason. I even worked for my dad to try to grow a relationship that we never had, but again one of the reasons above ended up just stop telling me about work and wake up to him gone. When asked I’ll say ya I have both parents still and everyone says oh must be nice” if they don’t have parents”, but god damn it’s almost worse having parents that don’t want to even get paid and do a job around you. All my life my parents are occupied with their thing usually a screen, but 10/10 they are busy and have no time for you. I’m not lazy or talk to much I work hard I took a test and was classified as a work horse of that means anything. But all my friends, family, school, jobs have just said no. Not any constructive or flat out criticisms, just no. And yes I am a loser I still live with my parents, because every time I’m earning enough money to move out, boom your fired and repeat, just like these last couple of weeks I’ve sent out 10-20 resumes a day and still no reply or interest in me. Sure that’s an excuse, but they offered the same deal live here rent free work and save go to school or get an apartment. They even remind me every week that they will help with school, but I know that’s a lie because I’ve presented them with 10 different school and my plan to a career, payment the whole deal all mapped out within 5 years. They say no, so everything they say they will help with it’s a game in my head wondering if it true. Like yes you have, but see these times and all these no’s for the cheapest schools. So yes they are helping me greatly by not paying rent, but still I’m a 22 living with his parents, my worst nightmare. So I’m stuck trying to find a job only to waste gas on an interview and haircut to be turned down. Now close to starting my dream moving out earning money for school and paying bills. Four weeks ago I got suspended from work but it was a slap on the wrist nothing was being written down just a suspension and we already had the week off so it really didn’t matter. The week comes up and I text the boss all excited to start work up again and boom sorry I know I told you we liked how hard you worked always got the job done without people asking, but we went another direction and your fired. The owner even flew out of state to see what we were doing and took me aside saying nothing but great things like you might even be in my position one day. So it just really doesn’t make sense. Now the thousands I saved are running thin all to start over at some shit job to be used abused and fired again Till I’m 35 still at my parents. I’m sitting here looking at my numbers and plans thinking none of it matters I’m hear again broke no one to turn to. I need a job/car/apartment/school to even get chance to screw up my dream And that’s a minimum $100,000.00 plus on a minimum wage, good fucking luck loser. Please if I had any W privileges let me use them now. So here with a family that allows me to sleep here. I don’t even get invited to weekend dinners anymore. My parents fix up houses to since I live there I offer help when I can. For example with the house we stay in. I repainted, landscaped, tiled the floor pretty much 80% of the work. I know I’ve been saying I work hard a lot probably think I’m using that as an excuse, but no I just like to be productive or I sink in a depressed state like now. So I do all that right even money out of my pocket, but the thanks I get is like “you didn’t get that done sooner?” Or ya you should have done that you live rent free. I didn’t do it for thanks, but wow don’t even say anything.  

All my life sure I’ve done wrong things nothing terrible, but I think I’ve made more good choices than bad. So why am I so miserable, feeling like no one cares, I can’t get or hold on to  a job I’m a bum, I live with my parents I’m a loser, friends are starting to not talk to me and not invite me out. I can’t even date a girl, because of two words jobless, and living with my parents! Idk if I said no money but that’s probably implied when saying jobless and living with my parents next to each other. I tried to do my own thing and make custom wood furniture, tables desks, anything with wood since I have access to my dads tools and I build my own furniture for my room “lightbulb”. Plus all these cool designs I was in the middle of making to showcase what I can do and why people should pay me to make furniture right the whole business model. My dad hides the tools and locks them up after I found them. Explain my process and get shut down saying buy your own tools, cause I guess the ones collecting dust in the garage were collectors items? Idk the constitution world so I guess I can’t blame my dad right. I guess I’m ranting because this week the “we will help you any way we can” speech came up after they noticed me getting down and depressed.  I didn’t snap but everything’s different it’s just there’s no point now to anything. Of course my mom asked in text saying what’s wrong we will help out. I just told them the truth it’s all lies I’ve showed them every cheap school in the nation and got turned down by them and every scholarship. 6 jobs I’ve been to left me in the dirt even my dad. I tried getting closer with my family, but that’s all a lie, 16 aunts and uncles you would think someone could help or show the ropes. No family is a lie too none of them give a fuck my adopted friends/family are pushing my out. The friendly neighborhood cat runs away from me now. It’s a feeling of being trapped in a hole for years, right. You climb and climb slip and fall climb, slip climb and on finally you finally get to the edge and can see over the hole but all I see is that hole I’m In, is actually inside a hole 100 times bigger and when I see that I fall in the hole I’ve been trying to get out of.  The feeling of nothing matters. All these shitty people making millions of dollars for glorifying everything that’s wrong with the world. Not saying that’s what I want or deserve, but if I stand for the right things, say freedom without imposing on anyone else’s freedom and work hard to improve someone’s life, so that I can enjoy a few hours of the day to myself and maybe travel once a year. I don’t think that’s much to ask for. But every opportunity or chance I’ve had has been blind sided like a slap in the face saying what we’re you thinking. So I’m healthy I’m eating well for now until I run out of money, applying to every job that moves slowing letting my mind tell me nothing matters no matter what I do I just end up right here broke jobless and I’m ten years that changes to broke jobless and homeless. Why the fuck would I want to put myself through that. Or fuck maybe in 20 years I can write real life step brothers book you know living with your parents till you’re 40. Fuck no I won’t let that happen I’d rather die. And I’m not suicidal, but yes I do look at it especially in dark times like these and say it’s now or later nothing I do in between really matters of all comes to the same point.  

Well I’m to scared to see how long this actually is, but I guess it’s good cause no ones gonna read it anyway especially after seeing this mountain of garbage I call A selfish rant. Honestly I hate myself every more for ending this, why should someone care I’m going through a hard time for 4 years. 4 years is nothing. Oh no here I go again making nothing out of something. I’m probably the first guy to get handed lemons and make nothing out of it not even lemonade just tried to eat it like an apple and spit everything out. Just a loser with nothing to do no where to go and a place where I can say something.",03Apr2019,5

I want to ask my parents if I could get any therapy or anything like that since what I'm experiencing is overwhelming. I'm never happy, I need some sort of help before I end myself. I'm so scared though, my parents think people with depression are faking it. They don't believe it's a actual thing. That's why I haven't asked sooner. If it helps for answers, I deal with self hate, trust problems, and just constant overwhelming sadness in general. And as I said, I'm very young, younger than most people on this website/app. Anyway, I just want to know what to do. Should I build up the courage to ask them?

22,"I live in a uni house with 5 of my closest friends, including my best friend this side of the country. I’m 19 and have been experiencing depression and anxiety since I was 13, so I can normally handle episodes quite well when they hit. But this time the episode has been a lot worse than the others and I’ve really struggled. I’ve become exhausted and I’ve isolated myself, which is a real contrast to my normal self. Everybody that I live with has noticed and most of the house has offered me help and a space to talk if I want to. I am incredibly appreciative of this and have thanked them over and over. My best friend has just stopped speaking to me all together, and when I asked another housemate about it I was told that it’s because I didn’t speak to her in a lecture we share. I’ve heard from housemates and have overheard conversations of her talking about me behind my back, all going down the route of me being called a bitch. This has changed my opinion of her and I’m not expecting or wanting any help from her, but knowing that I’m being talked about behind my back by someone I’m so close to isn’t helping with negative/suicidal thoughts. 
Is this something I should bring up to her or just let blow over?

TL;DR: best mate/housemate has stopped speaking to me because I have isolated myself during my worst episode of depression yet and is talking about me behind my back. This has backed up negative and suicidal thoughts Im already having and I’m struggling to cope. Do I talk to her about it or let it blow over?",03Apr2019,3

I restless with anxiety and couldn’t even sleep or eat so I later messaged her again asking for closure. I received 2 screen recordings of my photos being deleted from the Cloud and Recently deleted. I was extremely relieved but I was anxious wreck still. I messaged about 7 more times for closure and every time she denied still having them, Also saying things like “I’ve never Blackmailed anyone before” or “You won’t press charges right?” but eventually she said I was harassing her and she blocked me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have become so overwhelmed this fortnight, and my head is a hurricane of thoughts that I can't pinpoint so cannot focus on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is  a struggle and I am behind in work, house chores, personal hygiene and spending time with my fiance.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing I am behind is just causing the pressure on my shoulders to increase and is shutting me down even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no purpose, I don't enjoy my work, my life rotates around trying to pay for the house and bills each month.  My only goal in my life has been to have kids, but I am 31 this year and overweight and it's just not happening.  I feel like I have no right to be a mother when I get like this and it makes me so anxious that I will never be a fit a parent.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my fiance for 11 years but I feel like I am causing problems because I just can't do things that I should be able to - he has to do all the chores, the cooking and nag me to do basic things like clean my teeth which is so embarrassing for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go back on anti-depressants because we are trying for a baby, and I feel to embarrassed to go back to my therapist because I have lost my fight, and depression has knocked me down again.

&amp;#x200B;

I am self-employed and losing the will to do the work which means I don't get paid which adds to the stress of paying for the bills etc.

...I know I am the only person to sort myself out. I know I can't get an instant ""cure"" for this, and I know what the practical and realistic answer is to my next question but I will ask it anyway because it is on my mind and I don't have anyone else to ask it towards...

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever had the strength to just up sticks and start fresh somewhere new to give your head a new start?  I'm not talking about leaving my partner, but more my house and work to move somewhere new.

32,"it has seriously been a very very long time since i’ve last had a bad episode. i’ve had a bad week here and there, but not like this. 

i can feel myself slipping so badly the past few days, and i feel caged and alone and helpless, even though i’ve made it through before — but this time, i can’t afford my psychologist, and i’m feeling panic engulf me. 

at the same time, i’m feeling so terribly numb. i went home “sick” during my traineeship today, completely against my principles, and did nothing but lay lifeless in bed since. it’s 8pm now and i’ve yet to eat or shower, even though i have to be asleep by 10pm again for my internship tomorrow — though i feel tempted to just call in sick again. 

and i shouldn’t. i know i have to drag myself through this if i want to get there early and pull me out, but it’s been so long... i feel like i’ve lost the strength and... “skill” with dealing with my demons. i feel so trapped that i don’t even remember how to tell my friends anymore. how to ask for help. i don’t know what to do anymore. it’s like i’ve completely forgotten what it was like, even though they haven’t left me in over a decade... 

how do i pull through this toughest part... i feel completely lost at sea. ",03Apr2019,1
33,"Recently I made a post on AITA (am I the asshole). PLEASE do not go there and tell me things just because you want me to feel better. The sub decided that I'm a major asshole, and that's the fair ruling.

Multiple times I've been called rude, mean, even lacking in empathy. I hate myself for it. I don't want to be like this. I want to be a good person. But I can't because I don't understand how.

I have autism. I see the world much differently than everyone else. I have no idea why people do the things they do, and I don't think I'll ever understand it. They'll tell at me for my behavior and I never understand why what I'm doing is wrong, even when I explain myself.

The AITA post kind of broke the camel's back for me. I posted because I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't being mean, and... well, I was. Bigtime. People were telling me I was an asshole to the bone, ungrateful, manipulative, etc. One person said ""Douche alert!"" with red siren emojis. Another said that I'd lose all of my friends.

I'm a monster and I'm not even aware of it. Even after reading all the replies, I still can't understand why I'm so mean. But I am. Honestly, I'm just considering suicide at this point. I can't function in the world, so why should I even be here? I don't know how to get better. My brain is wired wrong and I'll always think the way I do. Would anything help? Should I just die? I'd rather kill myself than be any more of a horrible person... please help me...",03Apr2019,0
34,"A little background, I have MDD, GAD, OCD, and psychosis. I take lexapro daily and am trying to get off my Latuda.

Everything is going great, yet I can’t seem to break through my depression and be happy. I don’t understand why I’m not happy and feel like I’m just going through life feeling numb.

37,"Hey everybody. I just wanted a little help on something that happened yesterday. 

(tl;dr at the end)

So, my story first off: I have depression, and it mainly started when my girlfriend broke up with me. I’m still in school and see her every day, and it’s just gone in a downward spiral. I make self-deprecating jokes and can’t feel any emotion any more. 

Now, the event.

So, it was lunch time and we were sitting in the cafeteria. I didn’t notice that it was exactly half a year since she broke up with me, and so maybe that’s why that day was cursed. So, it was the usual day of my few friends talking about stuff, and I decided to joke around and say some bad stuff about myself, which I’m fine with even if people agree. But now, one friend said, “hey, let’s prove to (me) that they don’t just have 2 friends.” So she asked around, and it rolled around to my ex. I was chuckling a bit, and my friend asked her if she was my friend. She went silent, then said, “No. You can’t be friends with your ex’s.” It didn’t hurt at the time, and I laughed, but later in the day it started bugging me and hasn’t stopped. She doesn’t know that the breakup caused my depression or that I have depression at all, and this was like the delicately put my heart back together and then tore it into even more tiny pieces. I started thinking about things and I noticed: She doesn’t know my struggle. She doesn’t know what I went through to try and get over it, that I cut myself a while ago, the fact that I try and try to get over it every second of my painful existence. Now... all my hard work is gone. I feel unwanted, alone, and I feel like nobody cares about me. She doesn’t care about me or my feelings at all, even though I tried and am still trying to protect her from the hard truth. My anxiety’s acting up and my depression is getting worse. What do I do?

tl;dr—at lunch my ex made a hurtful stab and broke my heart again, but doesn’t know anything about my problem. What do I do?",03Apr2019,2
38,"Okay, so, I don't know if this fits, but here we go.  


I've been starving myself for 3 days. It all started because of my mother, but that's a different story. I have eaten about a quarter of an apple for a day, and that's about it. I don't know how to stop, so I'd like to get some help. Sorry if this doesn't fit, but it had to go somewhere.",03Apr2019,3
39,"I have decided to come onto reddit because I am sick of nobody helping, understanding or listening. I really would like some advice and reasons from you kind souls, i just want to know why i feel this way, and why so much damage exists in me, so if you could help that would be amazing. ill provide some context.
I am a 20 year old British Pakistani girl living in the UK. I grew up in a very broken home, witnessing domestic violence and countless arguments between my parents, as well as a bullying older sister and acting as a referee and go-fer between my parents’ marriage for the duration of my life. My mother was emotionally distant and had manic depression for the duration of my childhood and my dad was bad with his temper at times too.
For some strange reason all my life, since I was 6,7 the only thing i have dreamt of having a boy love me. having a boy make me feel special, having a boy marry me and give me this normal beautiful life.
Alongside this, in terms of the love thing, I’ve been in love three times. And every boy I fell for has never ever  felt the same way back. i have always been the “piece on the side” and the other girl, and have been taken advantage of my whole life. I always get rejected because of how i look, or who i am. i absolutely despise myself. This is because I always settle for being the side piece, I know they only want me for sex and also, money. but i feel like that’s some form of attention, in some way. I recently came out of a very messy friends with benefit situation, where he was not only using me for sex for 3 years, but for money. i come from a wealthy family and offered my support when he needed it, and he abused that in the worst way, but for all i knew, i was just trying to buy his love. I loved him like I never loved anybody, he gave me physical attention, I lost my virginity to him, he swore blind he cared about me for 3 years and he had just been lying about everything all along. i tried to buy his love because i don't have anything else to offer, clearly I don't. I don't have any boys running after me, ever, nobody has ever shown an interest in me or made me feel special, not even my own parents. I don't have anything to offer except money, and lets face it, that is attractive.
I have always been “the fat girl”, i was 8lbs when I was born, so i honestly always have been like this its my body, its not out of unhealthy eating or poor lifestyle. I am a size 22 clothing and my body is honestly disgusting, and I know thats a reflection of the fact that I no man has ever felt the same love for me I have them, always been unrequited. I hate myself, my body, but even more, who i am. Im so loud, and annoying, and get attached so quick. Im so desperate for attention, for people to think im this amazing person, so i put on this
I used to say when I was 16, 17 years old to my friends that i don't see whats so good about me that someone would want to marry me. i hated myself when i was 16 and i was petrified that when the time came to marry, i wouldn't have anyone. Im now 20, and for those saying i am still young, im really not. My mum (being of pakistani decent) says she wants me to get married by the age of 24,25 and i agree. i would love to get married now and have a boy love me and give me the life iv always dreamed of. im so desperate to be loved guys, i can't sit at weddings knowing that will never be me, i can't scroll through girls getting their bridal makeup done on instagram, i block any happy couples i see.
I don't see anyone falling for me ever. they haven't in 20 years and i don't see myself changing in the next year, so why would someone come. i have had this fear since i was 15 and now the day is coming so close. The last boy i loved was the only person who really knew me, and vice versa, and i wanted to marry him so much. He knew me inside and out, saw the real disgusting me and left. I don't see why anyone would want a fat, ugly, disgusting personalities ike myself, which is why every boy iv gone for has never ever felt the way back.
Guys don't like fat girls. i am joining the gym but that can't change my personality which seems to deter everyone away. i have tried counselling but it never works, they just say oh you are young you'll meet someone. but it had to be now, im already late. for me it takes years to get to know someone id marry, years. if i met someone now we could get married for 23/24, my dream would be complete.
any one iv met in the past iv always showed them with gifts, money, and favours, and thats the only thing that defined our relationships. They used me. But money and gifts are the only thing i have to offer, i have nothing else but i have that. so i use that to try and get them to love me, i thought if they see how good my heart is when i give them money and spoil them, they will love me back.
I do suffer from depression since I was 15 now and Have had PTSD since I was 14, when I witnessed my mum try and knife my dad, and herself.
Iv got no friends, never had a boyfriend, hate myself and can't see marriage happening, i need to meet someone now so i can have my perfect life, i don't feel like i would have any depression or anxiety or problems period if someone loved me, every bit of emptiness in my life would just be gone.
Why am i like this guys? please someone offer me some advice or practicalities.
thank you x

40,"I need help. I went to see my college's therapist before, but now im out of school and don't currently have one. I've been increasingly depressed and suicidal lately to the point where I cry everyday. 

I've neglected a lot of things in my life, especially my health. I don't know how to even schedule an appointment with a doctor or what my health insurance is.

Can anyone assist me in getting my life together, beginning with getting professional help? Much appreciated. ",03Apr2019,2
41,Ya my friend told the counslor about my depression and me and my mom talked it all good now it wasn't that bad turns out she had most of my problems when she was a kid. LOL,03Apr2019,2
42,"So I’ve had depression pretty much my whole life but after a couple years of actually addressing it and just life situations working themselves out a bit I feel okay most of the time (at least for now). The problem for me right now is when I don’t have planned activities or something to distract me, I will fall into a depression episode for no reason. I hate when I do this because it’s such a burden for my boyfriend and I’m just horrible and negative.

I’m not really looking for advice on more ways to keep myself distracted as I have hobbies (drawing, photography, biking, hanging out with my dog, etc) but more of a way to cope when I’m feeling bored and I start feeling more depressed. I don’t think I should avoid my feelings by distracting myself all the time because it doesn’t work. If my friends aren’t around and I don’t have anything going on I will clean my house or try to go out on my own, but when I’m done and alone then I still end up feeling the same way. I try to implement CBT methods in my everyday life when I’m feeling overwhelmed but I’m not sure what to do when I’m just bored and it makes me feel bad. I’ll end up staying in my house feeling like I’m wasting the day away.",03Apr2019,3
43,"Often, when in my darkest places (like literally yesterday), I need to scream from the rooftops that I want to kill myself, I need to put it into the ether so then I feel obligated to do it.

However, I dont do that because I know people will want to help me and part of me wants to get worse rather than better

This then cycles until I attempt suicide anyway and my girlfriend comes home and we do the whole cry/hospital debacle, again.

How does one resolve this issue (both from the inside and outside perspectives)",03Apr2019,1
