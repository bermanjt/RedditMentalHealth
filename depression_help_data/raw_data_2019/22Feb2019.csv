0,"I am not really sure if what i am suffering from is depression or maybe im just lazy.

I struggle being at work, I call in, leeave early, burn up my pto just to not be there, i never leave and actually do anything but it seems that no matter how much I tell myself to stay I can't. I end up being late on bills, not being able to save etc. 

Anyone out there have similiar feelings?",22Feb2019,1
2,"Im sorry this is probably just a huge waste of everyones time but i just need to type and i just need to keep typing so im sorry if this is so long i hope im not such a huge burden in ur day.

So i need help like serious help i just feel like no one really cares because i ask and people say ur fine when im really not. Recently kinda, my ""best friend"" who has gone through the same thing that i am going through just said nope im done deal with it yourself. And i used to tell him everything but i went to far and i think he was just way to overwhelmed and so he just detached from me. We dont talk anymore, we dont have the same group of friends anymore, we dont sit at the same lunch table anymore, i mean we occasionally see eachother in the hall on the way to class everyday, but thats about the most social interaction that we ever get. But anyways ever since then ive just been numb LITERALLY and i dont know what to do. I have missed so many days of school because of it ive detached from my friends and family and i because ive missed so many days my grades are juat awful and i just hate myself because of it cause i know i can have better grades but i just dont and its eating be up inside. Its like when u poor acid on like a peice of wood or something the wood just disenigrates almost and i feel like its happening to me. But im forced to go to school constantly by my parents and sometimes i just have/want to go to like a psych ward or something just so i dont have to go out in public.

And im costaintly filled with thoughts of self harm and ive taken action on those thoughts by cutting and starving myself.

3,"I know I don’t have it as bad as everyone else, but this is still hitting me really hard. My girlfriend of 2 and a half years broke up with me on Valentine’s Day. She still answers my texts and calls and keeps all our pictures up online. She says it’s because I didn’t make her happy anymore, yet she still talks to me happy and says I love you all the time and it’s just really fucking me up.

I don’t know if this girl is fucking using me or just keeping me around as a backup and I don’t know what makes it fucking worse, thinking I should just stop talking to her or to continue to talk to her.

I know this may not be the perfect place to post this, I’m sorry, I just don’t know what to do.

4,"I lost my boyfriend. He was the love of my life. We spent every waking minute together, and then he just up and left. I have to cope with the heartbreak on top of my depression and anxiety. 

Now I spend my days alone, longing for him. I can’t forget him. I think of the memories we have together and cry. I go to our favorite restaurants and cafes alone, and just sit there - hoping he’ll appear out of thin air.

My friends had to take everything he gave me, the books he got me for Christmas, his clothes that were still at my house, the stuffed animals and weighted blanket he got me, and they put it all in a box and took it away, because just looking at them made me wanna cry and hurt myself.

But now, I don’t know what to do. What do you do when the person you thought you’d spend your life with, the one who spent every second with you, who slept beside you every night - is gone? Now I feel empty and alone. I feel like a piece of me is missing. He was the thread keeping me from falling apart, now that he’s gone - what do I hold onto? I can’t fathom it. I can NOT imagine life without him, never holding him in my arms, sleeping beside him, running my hands through his hair.

I can’t handle losing him. I can’t. Not on top of my depression and anxiety. Oh guys, I can’t go on. I don’t know what to do.",22Feb2019,9

10,"It took me long to accept it, but I am depressed.

In school I put on a mask that pretends everything is okay, and try to have fun with my friends. I laugh but below that I always feel that layer of me being useless.

I’m getting -B’s in math and I feel like a failure. On top of that when my dad yells at me I feel even worse about myself. And then he says that I’m in self pity and that “it’s f***ing moronic, what’s the use?” 

I want to yell out and say that I do feel bad about what I’m doing and I want to cry. But I hold in all those emotions. On the rare occasion when I cry he says I’m a self pitying idiot. 

So I hold my emotions in. At night I just can’t handle it. I break down crying letting all the emotions from the whole day tumble.

It keeps me awake for hours, leaving me with barely 4 hours of sleep.

Then when I wake up I feel drowsy and my dad yells at me. At night, before I go to bed, when I do my math I feel tired. All this while he thinks I want to skip math.

I don’t know anyone who I can ask help for, I don’t want to make the ties with my close friends awkward, or the distant friends gone.

I can’t handle it to the point where I have almost jumped on numerous occasions. At the last minute I stop and think of how my mom would feel, since she already lost a daughter at the age of 4. I’m not living up to their expectations, and I don’t know what to do.

I’ll continue paying money to a therapist to talk where she’ll give me advice that I already know. I’ll follow it and still feel numb. Like really what are we all living for? Like what end goal could be worth all of this pain and numbness? What could possibly make all of this worth it? 
I am in a nearly perfect marriage. Nice house. 3.4 GPA. Work out 5x/day. I’m considered a beautiful person by many. I consider myself a good person.

I have no family. They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways.

I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but that's it, no one else wants anything to do with me. I'm even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I can't stay here at uni.

She's mad because I started having a crush on a girl and talked more to other girls in general (even if I still talk to her everyday after school and while we're at school) and she tells me that I'm getting distant and I don't know what to do anymore. I apologized her 1000 times and I tried to stay more with her(she has a crush too and she talks to him almost as much as I talk to my crush) and I started to think that I'm a bad friend and bad at everything I do basically.

24,"This weekend last year I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Sounds scary, I know — and seeing that I was 12 days out from my 20th birthday, it was even scarier. I literally thought I was going to die. 

But I didn't. I got better. I spent six days in the hospital, and I have to be on medication for the rest of my life, but other than that I'm ok. At least physically. 

My feeling worthless existed before that point, but it just got worse after. Mostly it's that I've got nothing to contribute to the world. I've been up for a while crying tonight, partially because it's the one year, and partially because I've got extra feelings of ""I don't belong in this world.""

It's just... I fucking hate myself. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm pretty sure that all my friends hate me or just tolerate me but think I'm annoying. I'm worthless and nobody will love me ever — I haven't even had a boyfriend yet (although that's a separate issue.). I also hate that I'm not positive about my illness — so many people I see are ""just happy to be alive"" when I'm not sure I even want to be alive. 

And I'm pretty sure all these feelings are tied to my illness. Among other things like my self-worth, but these really compounded themselves after it. I remember reading somewhere that your depression could worsen after a traumatic event? Is that what has happened here? Do I even have depression (big question because sometimes I feel like I'm just faking it)?

25,"It's a little odd posting my thoughts/feelings, but I think I just need a place to explain how I'm feeling and some of my problems and maybe get advice or something helpful or at least have someone listen. I'm used to being the fixer, the one on top of everything, the one that can always be counted on to handle anything. I'm the go to person for advice or support. I try to handle everything thrown at me with grace and most people wouldn't even guess that I've been phased. I'm in a longterm relationship (6yrs) that though has had it's fair share of bumps I feel is worth it and that there is a lot of love here. Now to the problem/s. I am no longer the fixer. Everything is overwhelming and I am crumbling under the pressure. Who I always have been, what I have always been good at is completely falling apart. It's this horrible spiral, I fail to handle something and that brings me down so I fail to handle something else and it brings me down further and it continues. I'm neglecting my responsibilities. I can't sleep until I'm completely exhausted and just pass out, when I try to fall asleep my mind spirals. My sleep issues have contributed to my lack of energy and being late to almost everything. I'm so late to most things that I just cancel altogether. I gained about 40lbs (happened before the lack of energy, likely due to IUD) which has ruined my self esteem. I used to be happy with my appearance, now I hate looking it the mirror. I rescue/foster animals and due to already being completely overwhelmed I haven't been able to take on any more which also makes me feel horrible. I don't have anyone I would feel comfortable turning to and being vulnerable with except my fiance, but I've tried and it doesn't turn out well. He's used to me being the emotionally strong one so I don't think he knows what to do with me in this state. I do try to explain but he doesn't seem to take it very seriously. I've asked for help handling daily tasks to help lighten my load, he decided to ""help"" with the house one day and actually just made a huge mess in trying (there's now laundry covering the livingroom and I'm trying to find the energy to fix this). When I spoke with him about my sleeping trouble he actually said that I'm going crazy and that I should be speaking to a psychiatrist about it not him.. He comes off harsh like that incredibly often. I know he loves me but he is incredibly lacking in the support department. Something I never knew until now since Ive always been perfectly capable of handling myself. Or maybe something caused by him never needing to support me. Anyways. It hurts my feelings, makes me feel alone, and causes me to doubt our relationship and his love for me. I'm feeling incredibly weak, and don't feel like I have anyone to turn to. I know if I can just get my tasks and responsibilities back in order I will at least feel somewhat better and can take the rest from there, but it's all just too much.

28,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first time posting to this thread and I need some help deciphering real life depression symptoms. The web is great and all but I am seriously now believing that I might need more help and these feelings are not normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background. In the past, I checked all the boxes for depression, never went to a doctor or anything but I remember as a teenager until I was 23 I 100% had every single symptom. Feeling worthless, thinking the world would be better off if I wasn't around, very low mood, etc. I thought these feelings were normal and everyone goes through bouts of ups and downs. About a year ago I read some self help books that really put me in a good place. I really felt happy and good about myself and unstoppable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then this past Monday, and maybe a little before Monday, but Monday was when shit hit the fan. I have no idea why? Insecurities came back, the past two weeks I have had trouble sleeping (both falling asleep and staying asleep), super irritable, feeling physically unable to do anything but sit and watch TV (which I barely focus on anyways). Today, I had a major melt down in my kitchen (which I have had melt downs in the past before but just thought it was due to stress or something). I got extremely angry and mean toward my dog for a really stupid reason and flew off the handles with rage. I just broke down afterwards and cried. 

&amp;#x200B;

The internet explains depression as feelings of hopelessness, where I don't necessarily describe my feelings as hopeless. I feel like I cannot bring myself to do ANYTHING. There are days where I feel as if everything is a struggle and I have to force myself to do them, yet I still go and do things. I just don't know if this is something people go through and I just have to push through or what but it has been a solid week of this crap. Again, I have had weeks like this in the past and equated it to stress, but nothing this week could have triggered this I feel like and now I am concerned I should seek out professional help.

A lot of people know me at school and come talk to me about random stuff because they consider me a pal and that’s great. My relationship with family is good too so that doesn’t play a part here. 

I deleted all social media apps from my phone and I closed conversations, deleted friends. It sounds so childish but I am lonely and feel like I have no one who I’d be emotionally close to anymore but at the same time I wanna shut everyone away. I feel like nobody truly wants me around.
