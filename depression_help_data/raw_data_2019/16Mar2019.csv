0,"For some background, I've struggled with depression since I was about 10. I was bullied a lot throughout my childhood and never really felt like I fit in back then. I would try so hard to fit in and cared very deeply about what others thought of me. In my teens, the bullying started to stop and I made a solid friend group and started to feel a sense of belonging. But I would blindly agree with the things people were saying. I found it hard to even speak up if I didn't agree because I was so terrified that somebody would think badly of me or be upset. Deep down, my depression was very out of control. I felt very badly about myself and I wanted others to accept me because I didn't. I spent most of my time with other people to distract myself from me. I didn't spend a lot of time alone, so I didn't really have a lot of my own hobbies or interests that didn't involve hanging out with my friends. Fast forward to now, I'm 20 years old now, living on my own far from home and attending school. I spend a lot of time alone no and it causes me so much distress. I feel like I don't know myself. Nothing really brings me joy, so I don't have any talents or hobbies. Even when I try to do new things, I feel like I'm not good at it, or that I did a bad job and I give up. I'm so critical of myself I feel like there's no room for growth. I feel like I have no passion, but that's not who I want to be. I want to have a passion, something that makes me well... me I guess. This lack of passion, lack of self acceptance, lack of hobbies makes me feel like such an empty person and rather hopeless. I don't get a lot of social interaction anymore besides my significant other and his friends. But, I'm terrified my SO will get tired of me because of my lack of passion. I also feel like it's so much harder to make connections with people, even my longterm friends who I no longer see often.  I'm sorry for going on a tangent, I just don't know what to do anymore.

2,"Its bad. I feel like killing myself. Its kind of weird anyway. She feels im stalking and harassing her. But not in person online. I try not to message her but i can never resist. Even when she blocks i make new accounts. I really try not to, i dont want to hurt her or harm her in any way. But shes all ive ever wanted. Shes always been nice about it but always told me honestly shes not interested, its not on her. The worst part is i know shes too good for me. She was a fitness athlete, ive had depression since 14 and im 35. She likes athletic dudes.
And the even worst thing is she wont even be a friend. Shes honestly so nice and kind. But i dont blame her at all really. I pushed too hard to talk. It makes me feel like a piece of shit when i contact her. I just am so near suicide and have no real friends. No one cares.
I dont know what to do. I just feel so truly hopelessly alone",16Mar2019,2

I've always felt constantly sad, not having many friends, and feeling a lack of motivation to do anything. A couple months ago, my house caught on fire and most of my belongings were destroyed. Due to this Our family has been going through some financial troubles. So recently, I've gotten a complete lack of motivation. I seem to sleep all the time and it is very difficult to get out of bed. Stuff that used to give me enjoyment such as gaming don't seem to interest me anymore. I seem to have more and more suicidal thoughts and recently I came close to having an attempt. I don't have any friends to talk to, and I live in a family where I can't talk about this. Anybody who's gone/going through this have any advice?",16Mar2019,1

6," I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm worth anything. I have nothing to be depressed over. My family is great. I‚Äôm a good student. I have good friends. I have a boyfriend, but I hate myself because I really thing he deserves better then me.

I think I‚Äôm a horrible child to my parents. I don‚Äôt think they should even love me as much as they do. I‚Äôm not the nicest, I keep myself into my room, and I‚Äôm just.. bad. I have Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome and A.D.D, which makes me feel so much worse because I feel like I‚Äôm weird and annoying because I don‚Äôt know how to socialize, nor‚Äô do I always have a good attention span. I do annoy my friends, I know I do, just, only one or two say it. I‚Äôm violent, always punching or kicking them. I‚Äôm underweight, and I know it, but I still believe that I‚Äôm fat, by no means do I have an eating disorder though. 

I have good grades, but I get stressed if something doesn‚Äôt turn out as a good grade even if I have no idea why because my mom cares a lot about them. I‚Äôm grateful for it, but I just don‚Äôt know how to fix them sometimes. Sometimes it‚Äôs up to the teacher when they can fix it. I start hating myself if I see I get less then an A. I think I‚Äôm a horrid person, even though everyone tells me a B is good, I can‚Äôt see that. 

Now, I think I‚Äôm a horrible girlfriend. I annoy my boyfriend, or, I think I do. I‚Äôm not always the nicest. I‚Äôm ugly. I have a horrible personality. Im depressed, and put all my problems onto him, and don‚Äôt know how to help his, even if I want to badly. To be honest, I‚Äôve stopped venting to him, telling him when I feel down (because it happens almost every day, has been for a year), or telling him my emotional problems. The bigger ones, I mean. I stopped because I feel as if I stress him out, and he is dealing with stress. He tells me that I don‚Äôt stress him out, and he‚Äôs okay with me sharing my problems. Yet, I can‚Äôt stop the nagging feeling that I DO stress him out. 

When I‚Äôm complimented, I always say, ‚Äústop with the pity‚Äù because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good at anything. I truly believe that when someone compliments my art, my writing, or anything honestly, I think they are saying it out of pity. I can‚Äôt believe anything else. It took me a bit to start believing my own boyfriend, now I truly think when he compliments me he isn‚Äôt doing it out of pity.

I‚Äôm by no means suicidal. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself. I‚Äôm just always criticizing everything I do, and I‚Äôm asking for help. I want to start believing I deserve love, that I‚Äôm not the worst human being on Earth, and that everything that people say that‚Äôs good about me is out of pity. I hate the fact I can‚Äôt start on my own, so I came here and asked for help, so maybe I can start believing in myself.",16Mar2019,1
7,I finally get a day off work and it just makes me realize how depressed I am. I have no friends. St pattys day is my favorite holiday and my only friend cancelled. I haven‚Äôt gotten anything done today except half of a workout and attempted a new craft hobby for two minutes before feeling drained. I wish I could make more friends... I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me or my lifestyle or what the problem is but it is starting to feel really lonely üòû I‚Äôm in college and female and I know I‚Äôm not into the most typical stuff for my age but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm as much of a weirdo as it seems I am based on how many people respond back to me trying to befriend them.. ,16Mar2019,2

My mom treats us like shit too and makes us feel so worthless and has told me no one will ever love me 
I guess it‚Äôs true 
I have no friends. I don‚Äôt care how sad that sounds no one wants to talk to me everyone ignores me they straight up ignore me when I speak to them or ostracize me.

I feel like I'm a burden. That I'm taking space of someone else. I feel like I should just fucking die and leave everyone alone.
I want to talk to my ex because I want to feel the way he loved me again. But I know he hates me too, or doesn't even think about me anyway.
I want someone to just hug me and let me cry in their arms. But I know I fucked things up and nobody can't stand me now.

I didn't even get to eat the fucking food because it was just half fucking raw. I try to talk to people but everyone's just like ""oh, dang.""

12,"Okay, so I am very conflicted on wether to write this or not, but I'm kind of desperate and tired and don't know what to think about this.

My boyfriend is a lovely person (the best guy I've ever met), we're both 16 and soon have our 2nd anniversary. But recently he told me that he doesn't know if he won't break up with me because he's tired of my mental breakdowns. I've had them the whole time we've been together. He says it's not that he doesn't love me and I trust that, it's just that he's tired as hell.

I feel like it's all my fault. I'm gonna go to the psychologist next week, but I'm worried that he'll be done with me before I have a chance to get better and be less of a burden. I think I've been telling him about my problems for too long. I know I shouldn't have, but I had no one else.

For now we decided to take a month break from me telling him about problems, so he doesn't feel responsible all the time. I love him a lot and don't want to lose him because of my depression, but I understand if he can't take it.

I might delete this after we resolve our situation.",16Mar2019,3
13,"READ: I made this as a note in my phone, trying to ventilate my thoughts into a first/third person story. I made some changes to fit into Reddit, but I barely skimmed over it so any word parts or mistakes will be because of that.

     When at practice for the play Spamalot, I met this girl. This girl seemed pretty nice and kinda saved me from getting kicked in the face. One day during practice, we were all gathered at the lunch tables, and I was looking around at stuff because I was bored. I glance over at what that girl was doing, and I saw here drawing... in an anime art style (I think)! I started to develop feelings for her. But, something was wrong. VERY wrong. So, earlier the summer before I went into 7th grade (when this girl thing was happening), this girl had admitted to liking me. I didn't really feel that way back, but slowly, I started to feel like that twords her. I felt cared about, and I was going through bad depression, so I thought that she could help me. Turns out, she had never liked me. Never. That moment still has an effect on me because of how absolutely devistating it was. I didn't trust anyone and didn't want any relationships. Now, back to the new girl. I glance over at what that girl was doing, and I saw here drawing... in an anime art style (I think)! I started to develop feelings for her. But, since that one experience, I can't tell what I fell about her. My friend had been bragging about his ""girlfriend"" and I started to think that I needed to have a ""girlfriend"" or crush. I kept thinking of certain people that I had a ""crush"" on. After it all just feeling stupid, I realized that I didn't actually like these people, I just feel less or I'm supposed to. I had officially lost all feelings of love or affection. Untill the girl. I can't tell if I just feel like I'm supposed to like her, or if I ACTUALLY like her. I used the play pamflit and Gmail to find out her name by seeing what the person looked like when I typed in their name, and the name I type in that looks like her will be her name! I found out her name was (for private purposes) Tina. I looked her name up everywhere, and on every social media I could think of. I found her on one and I pressed follow to friend her, but the thing says they have to accept it for you to see what they post. But she couldn't know it was me because I made a random email account just for this with nothing relating to me. Now we're in present day. I feel like a creep for basically online stalking her. I don't know what she would think of me. Some pretty chaotic things happened in the drama room during practice, and she was there to witness it. But, one time I was at lunch, eating and talking to my friend, and I see her at a different table. I kept glancing over at here for basically the duration I was there. I think I saw her glancing over at me repeatedly too, but I don't know why. But I just feel creepy, she would probably avoid me if I talked to her and said ""let's be friends"" or something like that. I don't even know if I actually like her! I'm just completely lost. I have literally no one to talk to. That's why I'm typing this right now. I feel like my depression is coming back to me because of this stupid delima the world is putting me through. What's the pourpose of suffering this madness? I'm getting nothing out of it. I'm just stick in this endless loop of gaining someone and then loosing them, and then they add salt to the wound by basically bullying me. The thing is, no one can help me. No one knows of the situation I'm in. And no matter who I do tell, they won't do anything, they can't. They don't know what I have been through. What I'm like.
What's wrong with me. If any one has been in a situation like this, PLEASE help me through this. I just don't know who or what I have feelings for. 

And for a little more backstory, every ""best friend"" that I had from all the way back in first grade has turned on me. That total of ""best friends"" was 3. I had built up strong, long friend ships with them, for it to be crushed all at once. I'm still getting bullied by one of them. Today in the morning, he was saying something, and I had misheard him and said something to him. He got so pissed, and I don't know why. He's just really agressive. He was throwing insults at me left and right, making me feel like the scum of humanity. I just ignored him, but BARLEY started to tear up. He then goes on to do some more insulting. Then like ten minutes later, he was all like "" hey broooo what uuup"" like absolutely nothing happened. His tendencies to do this make me pissed.

14,"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression for the past three years.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened up to my family, didn't help.

I visited professional therapists, didn't help.

I tried opening up to my friends, didn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

soon, I created an anonymous page on Instagram called @ivyintrovert and starting pouring my feelings into words, and while this didn't instantly fix my depressive mind, it helped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking to people anonymously, expressing myself through a platform which allowed no room for judgement, knowing that people were listening to me, it was heartwarming.

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling better day by day, and was having amusing conversations with strangers at night.

&amp;#x200B;

he called my feelings 'mystic shit' and told me to 'stop being a freak'. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was still fine, it was okay. I created a post about it, tried to garner some support, tried to make myself feel better, and I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt better...

17,"It's been almost a year that I (25F) have a close friend (27M) and we were teammate and workmate. I always look up to him because I desperately want to have a brother (I'm the first daughter of my family) and he treats me well. We agreed to be a brother-sister. However, we've gone too far, we started to sleep together since November 2018 but we still able to manage our feeling. I know she was close to another girl (30F) but I don't know whether they're dating or not, and I don't want to know either.

5 days ago, I went to his house. After we're sleeping, we're talking about this relationship. He said he wants everything to go back like when we used to be. Just a normal brother and sister relationship, minimum physical contact. He said lets try it for this 1 month.

I was surprised, shocked, and sad. I'm not sad because I'll miss these physical contact. It's more like.. I think that if he's trying to minimize the physical contact with me, it means he'll make space between us. I'll lost a friend, a brother. These days were quite hard for me. In this age, I don't know what's life, I don't know if I made a decision whether it's wrong or right, that's why having him, and other friends above my age really helps me because I could ask anything about life.

Being the first daughter is hard. You have that burden from the family but you don't have idea how to handle life. I can't afford to lose someone I could learn from about life. 

I said this out loud to him, with heavy flow of tears. I was so afraid of being alone I cried so hard until my hands were shaking. He said that I was negatively overthinking, that's what make it worse. He said to me to believe in him that he won't abandon me, his little sister. He has this family problem that only to that other girl, his 1 best friend, and me he told the story to. He told his family problem to me because he feels comfortable to share the flaws his family had. He also said that only a fool could leave a good friend and he won't do that to me. 

I don't know whether he wants things to be serious with that girl. We're not dating but this feels like a broken heart.

I'm having problem to get rid of my negative thoughts, self blaming and my overthinking habit. It just makes everything worst. I guess he did this because he sensed that he changed me, he worsen me, and he blamed himself for that. I know that he does this for good.

I don't want to live my life like this. I want to get rid of these, but I don't know how. Until now, he still texts me normally just like a normal brother and sister, he still reminds me to eat, asks me my agenda for the day etc. But deep inside my mind and heart are still painful.",16Mar2019,7
