0,"Last month my depression was under control, now it is back in an on and off style. It seems to come and go in waves or in compulsive episodes, just like it used to. Same thing happens with my suicidal thoughts, they seem to be compulsive. My psychiatrist even classified me as compulsively suicidal. Meds seem to be having minimal effect. I think the reason my depression and suicidal thoughts have come back in the compulsive style is because I have woken up and realized how terrible my life is and no matter how hard I try to stop thinking or obsessing about it (I have OCD) it just stays in my mind and makes me depressed. I have disassociated from my friends at college, I have covered myself in fear of what my verbally and psychologically abusive mother may do to me if I come out, I have closed my true self off to the world to avoid being placed back into a psych ward, I have realized that most of the ways that I try to love myself and care for myself are incredibly unhealthy and self harming, I can't love others because I have no one to love and I can only focus on never loving or being sick with love which is unhealthy, I am scared that this is what the rest of my miserable existence will be like. It makes me believe that there is no real future for me, or the future that lies before me is not a future I want to live through.  I'm debating if I should just stop taking my meds completely and let the insanity consume my mind and let myself rot to death. Things can make me happy, but I always end up at the same place, sorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel like a complete man, but I know to do that, it would be physically impossible. I demand too much, and am not a hard enough of a worker. I don't plan well enough and I'm basically useless outside college.

1,"I’m a teenager who was diagnosed with depression last year. I’ve been doing great, supportive family, very little mishaps, all around amazing. I’d even say I was damn near average in terms of mental health. And then two weeks ago I suddenly felt horrible, slipped back into everything. Suicidal thoughts came back, I felt numb for a while. I skipped school for like four days because of it. Last week seemed fine, not great but far better, and then today I suddenly collapsed in the morning, sobbing and just wanting to self harm again or kill myself or something. I skipped school again. And now my parents are mad that I’ve missed so much school right before finals, they’re talking about how stressed I’m making them, and it feels like I’m nothing but a burden to them whenever I’m like this. So I’ve pretty much decided screw it, im gonna stop talking about it and acting like I’m fine so that people stop worrying about me. I’ll go to school and act ok, go home and act ok, that sort of thing, but I’m scared that this may go poorly. I really don’t want to put my parents through this again, but I’m also terrified of being alone again. Anyone wanna either give me courage to finally go through with or or talk me out of it? Thanks in advance I guess",23Apr2019,1
2,"I had it all. House, kid, car, man. All by the age of 25. And when my soon to be husband started doing cocaine and went nuts and tried to shoot me, I lost almost everything.
I left him. Left the house. Lost the car. I have my son and we moved back home with my parents. I should just be happy to be alive. I have so much I should be ecstatic to have. I even got a job that is within the hours where I’m not missing a huge amount of time while my son is awake.  
It’s been three months and I have never felt more alone. I excessively exercise. I read books more than I ever have before. But it won’t stop the sadness. I’m still so depressed. Feeling guilty for feeling this way. It’s like my heart wants to go home and I have no freaking idea where that is.",23Apr2019,4
3,"It's one thing to have treatment resistant depression, and feel like you're a burden on those closest to you. It's entirely something else to have the same circumstances, but have your spouse of nearly a decade ask for a separation because your depression is so toxic to her that it's causing her physical pain. She thinks that I'm a significant source of stress that's exacerbating her fibromyalgia pain. I don't know what to do. Self worth, there is none. The thought of losing her and the dogs leaves me feeling vacant, cold, hurt in a way that I can't describe. I think if she goes through with it in 9 days (arbitrary time she set) that I may take a leave of absence from everyone and everything. My heart is broken in a way that I can't wrap my head around. She's able to disconnect &amp; become apathetic from everyone, but I only know one way of doing that. Fuck this hurts.",23Apr2019,2

I was born with a cleft palate that affects my speech and I sound weird when I talk and sometimes people can't understand me and even mock me, also because of this ever since high school started I started to get social anxiety I was literally shaking in class because I was scared to get called on to read or answer questions in front of a whole class of 30 people, because of this I started doing bad in school and even didn't pass the 9th grade. I'm in my 3rd year and I'm still not living up to my expectations of straight As I skip school, cut class all because of this anxiety. And it translates to my outside life I'm scared to talk to girls never had a kiss let alone a girlfriend still a virgin while all the people I know had girlfriends had sex have a social life partying all that good stuff because I'm scared of getting laughed at for the way I talk. I'm also a basketball player looking to play in college and pursue my dreams of being a pro hooper but my performance in school isn't going to cut it, I get picked on a lot people mess with me a lot. Everybody I know is on their way to college while I'm probably going to still be in high school since I got held back. My parents have a hard time making money also. This is ridiculous like I can't make this up how can my life be so miserable but I'm such a good person. I don't want to be a failure in life but I feel hopeless, I just want to break down but I always look happy and okay im always laughing with friends being goofy and all that. No one even knows I'm going through struggles with myself. I don't do drugs or drink or will I ever think about suicide but these problems make my life hard and I just want to better it. I want to succeed in my dreams and aspirations and not let my parents down. Any advice now that you guys read my story? Thank you so much if you actually read all this.",23Apr2019,4

7,"Not even a few weeks ago, I was suffering from major depression. I was always thinking about what a failure I am and will be. I was sad about the childhood I never had. About the verbal and physical problems and abuse I have experienced throughout my life. There was much more that I was thinking about, but I cant be bothered to type it all.
Last week, my school had taken a trip to a larger school in the area to hear a motivational speaker. I had my earbids in because those things usually get me thinking about my problems. I was listening to music when a teacher tells me to take the buds out. Slowly I do, knowing what will happen when I take them out. It happens. I get to thinking about my problems, my childhood, my deteriorating health, my fears, my lack of any morals whatsoever, everything that has haunted me since my parents divorced. Tjen I think, I want to kill myself. I wanted nothing but to die. The problem, and the only reason I never did, was because I was afraid of pain. I never cared about death. Pain was my fear. It also wouldnt be fair to those who loved me. I couldnt do that to them. Then I thought, with extreme sadness, I cant even die properly. I cant die the way I want to. What control do I have over my life if I cant even die? Then in my head I heard a voice. I figured this is the usual voice in my head that is always telling me how I should live my life. The one I ignore. I noticed, it sounded(not technically sound is it) different. It also felt powerful. It told me that I should stop worrying about it. That my past was over and It wasnt a part of my life anymore. I was able to move on. And for the first time I felt real joy. Actual happiness that would last a lifetime. I knew that this was God who had spoken to me. He helped me get to this point. Now I owe everything, including my life to him. I still have to work on myself, my habits, health, commitments, but I am making progress towards living a real, and meaningful life. I am and always will be happy that moment ever happened. I will never forget a second of it. Hope my story helps.",23Apr2019,1
8,"It's been a year since I've graduated college. I studied software development and graduated. I haven't found a job yet and still live at home with my parents. 'Well why don't you apply for jobs?' Well I don't have any experience. I have been putting lots of effort into my portfolio projects. I know ReactJS and can make work with NodeJS. I haven't been able to produce anything useful for anyone. There are no jobs in my city for entry level software developers. I am getting older and I'm still living at home with my parents. The tech jobs in my city ask for people with higher level degrees, and more experiences. When I do open my computer up I get distracted easily by youtube and internet. I told my current job I was done in May. My current job was totally unrelated to my field and didn't help me much in college. I have become much weaker since college.
Before college, I was seriously fit, now I weigh less, and don't have much muscle. I lose focus very quickly and fall for impulses decisions easily. I really need help.  Most nights I don't fall asleep. 

I have more thoughts and issues to bring up, but cannot at the moment. Essentially I have not been successful in my career. I have put lots of effort in to school and work, but I have zero confidence to apply for jobs. My parents fully support me and it makes me feel like it is wrong. Like I am being spoiled. I fear that it is making me lazy. I know none of this sounds that bad, but it really is. I need to learn how to get my life together.

My current plan is: Quit my current job, Sell my car, go back to school for two more semesters. Hopefully doing those three things will allow me to focus on my computer studies. 

I am not able to express my self correctly, I am sorry. 

My mind gets seriously knotted when I try to think about my career.
I am feeling very hopeless.",23Apr2019,1

10,"hey. i'm a new user, but figured this would be the place where i can get everything off my chest and address my problems.

&amp;#x200B;

so my name's daniel and i'm a 16 year old sophomore. i'm an ap student with a 4.7 GPA, aiming to be val with around a 5.2 or however high i can go. besides school, i mainly do two things: internships and competitions, which i'd prefer not to disclose to keep anonymous, and violin, which i've been doing for 11 years and i'm currently the ""best"" in my state as others would say (basically i've won most if not all the major competitions where i live in, which isn't that hard considering my state has barely any musical education). so obviously, being the asian i am, i want to aim high for college. i took my first act last month and earned a 36 in reading, writing, a 27 in math, and a 28 in science, not bad for my first time. im currently aiming for the joint-degree program at Harvard University and New England Conservatory, even though i most likely won't get in lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

now to get into the depressing shit. before sophomore year, i was always an optimist, someone who always smiled and created small talk with those near me. my parents and relatives would always comment saying how beautiful my smile is and how much of a warm heart i have. in come sophomore year. i overloaded myself with 5 ap classes because our school just recently uncapped our GPA (capped would have been a 4.8 max) and theres 3 kids at my school, including me, going for the #1 rank. in an effort to move up from #2, i took as many classes as i could, even taking spanish 3 and chemistry honors online. i was kind of surprised that most of my classes haven't been bad, but of course the exception is ap calc. calculus was hard the first semester. i worked my ass off, studying until 2 am and staying after school for as much help as i could. yet, i ended the quarter with a 89.32 and entered in the ""depressed state"" im in now. i simply couldn't accept the fact that my school career and dreams are over just like that. my brother was his class's val and got accepted to 15 of the colleges he applied for, including johns hopkins and northwestern. nonetheless, i moved on, continuing to do my best. now, i have a 100 and above in every single one of my classes except for calc, in which i have a D and have given up hope. my calc teacher doesn't care about me, he treats me like shit, and theres nothing anyone can do so i guess it doesn't matter at this point. i dont even know why i try anymore, i end up studying so much and get a 45 on the quiz. now calc is just one reason for my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

ive been playing violin for 11 years. its something i love to do, i used to practice 6-7 hours a day, completely immersed in the thrill of music. however, for some reason, i just cant focus for beyond an hour. i just recently moved teachers because of an argument with my old one and he's no help at all. i have my first, local competition in quite some time this saturday and im so terrified that i'll go and lose to the people i've always beaten while growing up. my reputation and dignity.. shattered from one competition. in fact, my mom just told me that one of the people i played for said 'don't do it. he's not ready, he's going to lose' so.. yikes.

&amp;#x200B;

last but not least, i just feel so alone. i’m not really sure why im alive at this point. life is stressful and i feel like im barely doing anything. everything i try to do turns out bad and its so incredibly hard to focus on what i want to focus on. i really want someone to talk to. someone that i can spill all my deepest feelings into and give me advice on what to do because at this point i don’t even know. one of my friends always tells me 'you’re such an icon i wish i could be like you"" but truth is no one should want to be me. im fat, im ugly, im untalented, im stupid, im worthless, and i can’t even impress my parents with someone i’ve done for 11 years. i dont really know what to do at this point because nothing seems to be working out..

13,"I thought I have been coping well but its not going away. 

It was three months ago to this day that my Aunt passed away. She was a nun; my family is also religious. We were pretty close as she was like a religious mentor to my family and I. She was driving on the freeway and lost control of the vehicle. She drove off the edge of a 100 foot embankment. She was dead on impact. 

I have so much guilt behind her death. She gave me a bible for graduation and I said that I would keep it on my desk but in reality I could care less about it. It never went on my desk for months until the day she died. I never really treasured it until now. I remember her telling me that she wanted to let me know that I was loved but I don’t know. Her quote and the memory has just stayed with me since.

I don’t know why but her death has triggered childhood bullying memories. Not memories of being bullied but the feelings of being bullied. For not fitting or being like everybody else. Of kids mimicking my facial deformity. For being shy. For having a bad short memory. 

My grades are slipping now too. I have lost motivation to excel in school, especially in Math (In HS I really excelled in it). I find myself laying in bed and watching YouTube most of the time; weirdly I find comfort in it. I’m also finding myself spending less time with friends. I’ve been picking skin off of my fingers more often too. I used to be the class clown but even that is depreciating.",23Apr2019,1
14,"Hi. Sorry that I can’t split this long post into paragraphs, I’m on mobile and it just hasn’t been letting me do it. So, anyways... I’ve been struggling with mental problems that are incredibly similar to common clinical depression symptoms (loss of motivation, emotional numbness, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, low self-esteem, and some more we don’t have to bring up) since I was about 10 and continuing since then. Nobody has ever taken me seriously, and I feel worthless constantly, so I’ve just put a bandaid on my problems and tried to ignore them. But it’s gotten to the point where I’m crippling myself to a noticeable degree and I cry for days on end. So I’ve decided to finally seek help. I think I’ve found a therapist that interests me but... What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but that’s all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? What’s the formality usually like for these things? And besides all this just to get the ball rolling, is there anything else I need to do that isn’t obvious? I just want to get better so my family isn’t so worried about me but I sincerely don’t know.

19,"Just a quick one because I'm at work currently. On mobile.

I feel like I have an average amount to be proud of, especially considering how far I've come in a short time. I used to be a failure, honestly. I was on medical financial benefits, boyfriend dumped me (not nastily I might add but he was my world), had no desires for my future because I think I honestly believed that I couldn't achieve anything.

Not gonna go into too much detail about my current partner because he's not reeeeeally the subject here. But I will say that he came into my life abruptly as a friend of the person I was staying with, and literally turned my life around. More than anything, I'm thankful to him for showing me that I am strong enough. I have a job through him (he moved from South to North of my country and dropped into a job, a few months later putting the good word in for me and getting me an interview) and has reminded me of what purpose of life means... We have recently reserved a new, gorgeous build in the town we have come to love, and the coming month we will be reserving it. I can finally get a corgi (my favourite dog breed, if the name doesn't give it away haha) and my life has some substance. I will have a house, a dog, a loving partner and lots of friends, as well as a hobby that I love. I can buy games for my Switch and have a generously donated, very decent graphics tablet to draw on.

So... ""Why it be like this""?

I have moodswings. I feel horribly low and numb and then just... Numb, which I recognise at the time is better than low. I get horribly self destructive (I have wished many times as recent as this last month to hurt myself out of frustration, I only don't because I cannot stand breaking my partner's heart), I cry, I feel hopeless. Yes, I have some happiness but I'm so used to feeling numb. Empty.

Why? I want to get off my meds, I want to feel at the very least normal, not nothing and empty. I don't want to constantly worry. I'm diagnosed with general and social anxiety with depressive episodes because of the aforementioned and it never ends. I have a wobbly relationship with alcohol, because it allows me some reprieve from the constant weight of worrying, but I have a tendancy to not be able to stop and get irritable, which is absolutely one of my biggest reasons to feel ashamed. I'm cutting down, I don't consider myself an alcoholic but I feel its lack of presence. I've been known to even go so low as to abuse a strong painkiller I was given from hospital for something unrelated.

I feel lost a lot of the time and it's come to a point where I'd rather talk anonymously to people on the internet than my partner or friends because, for once, I want to be the reliable one, the happy one. The one everyone enjoys... People love my energy when I have my good moments, and honestly... I do too! I want more of it! But fighting your own mind on a constant basis, introverted... Always giving what I feel is 110%, it's draining, so draining... I desperately want to hear ways people cope.

This is a new thing for me, I’ve never engaged in any sort of support group of public space like this, but I’m really running out of options so I thought I’d give this a try. 
I’m in my last year in high school and in Australia you get something called an ATAR score which basically dictates what universities and courses you can get into. I’ve had depression since I was 13, school is a massive struggle for me and all I’ve wanted is to finish, get my score, and leave. 
Now that I’m here I’m really struggling to get through it. I’ve barely gotten through the first term and now it’s time to go back and I just can’t bring myself to do it. 
I was barely able to get out of bed, and have had 4 fits of uncontrollable crying today. 
I’m always trying to make myself better. I take medication, I socialise with my friends, I see a psychologist, I’ve tried setting myself goals so I feel like I’m achieving something. I try everything that I can but nothing seems to be working. After a while I just spiral again. 
I’ve reached a point where my friends and family don’t know how to help me anymore. Today my mum had a breakdown because she doesn’t know how to help me and she’s scared that I’m going to kill myself. I cannot express how terrible I feel because I’ve made her feel like this. There is no heart break like seeing your mother cry. 
I’m doing this as a sort of last resort. I’m willing to try anything at this stage. I’m terrified that I’m never going to get better and I’m just going to be waiting around so I can feel happy again and just wait for it all to go away. I’m trying my best but I’m just losing all motivation because I know that this is something I’m going to have to deal with for my entire life. I really don’t want to die but sometimes I feel like that’s the only way I can stop myself from feeling like this.

I have confided to friends about my depression and many have seen me enter into a depressive period. When I’m depressed I close myself off and can honestly spend months not spending time with anyone except my immediate family,  but much of my day is spent alone. I am on and off with working, I am married and have kids in early elementary. I will drop my kids off and come home and cry even though my life to outsiders probably looks fine. My struggle is with maintaining friendships. Although friends (and even family) may seem understanding at first, depression for me is a cycle. I work hard to manage it but it eventually consumes me for a time. After a few periods of ups and downs I feel like I just end up losing friends and never really building lasting relationships.",23Apr2019,6
24,"I have been depressed for a while now. I think. Back on school life was really difficult with all the bullying. I was the top student at school but failed to find a social group. The most popular kids did include me finally, only to use me for assignments or to pick on me. Apart from this I had immense pressure to perform not just from my parents but also my teachers and everyone around. And I was picked on for being ""smart"". I had trouble falling asleep as I overthink a lot and I started having mood swings as an adolescent. So my mother started giving me tranquilizers at night. I didn't know it was a tranquilizer back then, later someday for some reason I googled it and found out it wasn't vitamin supplement but was a serious prescription drug. By then the pressure to perform was way too much. I sat for the final exams and did surprisingly well but no one was happy as they wanted me to do better than that. My parents keep bringing that up sometimes when they are mad, and when I go back to my old high school some of the teachers look at me like I betrayed them. Yes. I betrayed their trust. But why did you have to trust me?
Then I started prepping for University entrances and whatever little life I had was completely drained out, with too many tests and too much competition and just pressure. After all this in was never the same again.

I got into a decent uni, in a stream I don't really like but because others chose it for me, and now I struggle. Not just because I don't like what I'm doing. I don't remember that old self that enjoyed learning. Right now I am sad all the time. I tried to commit suicide but stepped back because I have a little brother who needs me as he might go through the same trauma as me. I gave no real friends, people constantly lie to me, I caught them lying. My grades have fallen I don't know what to tell at home. I have no sense of direction and I have nothing for my future. I feel like an empty husk of a self crying myself to sleep every night. I still tried to keep my head above water until last fall, and this spring semester I just gave up, and now I have failed. I actually don't seem to mind. Sometimes I think about the consequences, what I answers I have to give people, and then wonder why are we answerable for our personal decisions? There are people committing crimes on a day to day basis who have to be answerable. The governments have to be answerable. Instead I am taking the load of questions regarding my life choices. 
My boyfriend says it's a phase and it will pass.
I have panic attacks and I lose track of who I am. It hard to get out of bed, eat or even breathe. I think I need help, I want to take help, but my family believes mental illness is a scam (I apologise on their behalf). It's not.

28,"I've just been working nonstop, trying to salvage what work I have left (I'm self-employed), but I'm going to have to leave that behind and return to the job force. It's hard because I'm used to being isolated for long periods of time and now I have to put myself out there again. I'm not ready, but I guess I'll never be ready if I don't do try to turn my life around now. I just feel really alone because I don't have anyone to talk to. No friends, family, or partner. I just feel betrayed by everyone I've opened up to. I do my best to help them, but when I need help, I don't have anyone to confide in.",23Apr2019,1

31,"I transferred to a university (from a community college) last fall and an advisor told me the above quote. It's like I internalized it. Im an introvert on top of being depressed. 

It seemed like after she told me, everything went down hill. I dont know a lot of people. 

I applied for internships to get to know people. Here is the catch. There is mental health counseling on campus. I was doing fine for a while. Fine enough to apply to be a peer advisor in the mental health center. Now im afraid to talk to anyone there in fear it could jeopardize my internship. I applied elsewhere as well but I have no idea how to tackle it all with my mind trying to off me!

I just started Wellbutrin so I hope it helps. Any advice? Is the top quote true?",23Apr2019,1
32,"As the title says, over the past few months I've had a lot going on in my life. I'm graduating soon and I've been actively looking out for jobs for the past 7-8 months. Unfortunately, nothing has been working out for me and I'm very close to giving up. Getting out of bed every morning is a struggle and I just don't feel enthusiastic about anything anymore. I've always had issues with insecurity and now, with all the rejects I've been getting or all the times that I've been ghosted by companies, my insecurity is at an all time high. To the point where I'm doubting all my life choices and I'm wondering whether I'm in the right field of work at all. Literally every single one of my friends has a plan for what they're doing after graduating and all of them are so happy and excited to get their graduation photoshoots done and here I am, crying myself to sleep every night.
To add to all this, it's a very happy time in my family because my sister is pregnant and everyone at home is just so excited and I feel like shit for not being able to share the happiness. And also, I've obviously not told anyone at home about my situation because I don't want to be the person to ruin things. 
I just honestly don't know what to do anymore. It feels like I've hit a road block and I don't have any sense of motivation to get out there and do what I'm supposed to do.",23Apr2019,1
33,"It was really hard for me to reach out for help, but I couldn’t take it anymore. So I talked to my parents and they made me an appointment with the family doctor. I went and talked with him about how I am feeling and he gave me 37.5 mg dosage of Venlafaxine. If anyone has tried this and has feedback it’d be very appreciated.",23Apr2019,22
34,"I'm real tired and didnt really want to make a post but I thought this was real important. It could literally save your life.

I have suffered depression forever, never actively seen a drug work. Fluanxol® (Flupenthixol decanoate) does.

3 days it kicked it.

Works for my mom. She swears by it. Worked for me. Probably will work for you.

Also makes you more focused. Win.

Try it 

Good night",23Apr2019,5
35,"Ok so, it's been years since I've actually tried my best at something. I half ass everything in my life, I don't know if I just lack passion or initiative?? I just don't know. I don't think anyone understands how I feel. Basically, I feel stupid if I try my best, and just gathering the energy to do my best feels dumb. Like a joke. I've told my younger sisters, but they don't even know what to tell me. I can't even think about telling my friends. I used to be very competitive when I was in hs being in multiple clubs and going to competitions and placing first and everything. I just don't know why this happened.",23Apr2019,5
36,"So basically ima peace of shit... like really, I do a lot of fucked up shit to people I care about. Like for example I had this friend... let’s just call her Jenny, so me and Jenny were really close until something clicked in my brain and said “Jenny is a little to... weird right?” And me being the peace of shit I am said “yeah... she is isn’t she” so over the past two months I’ve been ignoring her cuz I just don’t know. And not only that but there’s this really nice boy I’m going out with and his family is so nice but... I honestly don’t want to meet them and idk what to do so I keep making up lies and when I do I just wanna fucking kms cuz I’m also a suicidal fuck.

Aight now enough of that now time for the actual problems I’m going through that’s starting all of this.

So I have bpd and that usually really messes with my personal life, it’s made me start self harming and even though I have someone who knows what I’m going through (my bf) I still feel like they’re going to backstab me due to past experiences. And he’s going to move this summer which means I have no chance of surviving it... HELL I CAN BARELY SURVIVE WEEKENDS WITHOUT THINKING OF KMS SO GOD KNOWS IM FUCKED ON SUMMER... any way please help 🙃",23Apr2019,2
37,"I want to play video games, I want to read a book, I want to eat lunch, I want to do so many things I enjoy doing but..

Any time I try to actually do them, I get hit with a wave of feeling like I don't actually want to do them.
Rn I'm just stuck because I want to play either Fallout 4 or Sims 4 but I know that if I turn on my computer and try to play either one, I'm just gonna feel demotivated and like I actually don't want to do them.

Any way around this? Any ideas? Anything I'm just straight up not considering? Help please?",23Apr2019,5
