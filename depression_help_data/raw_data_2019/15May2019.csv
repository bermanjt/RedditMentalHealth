2,"I am 23, and I live with my parents in order to save money. They don't mind, but they do demand that I either work or pursue higher education. Since I have already - to my parent's chagrin - dropped out of college due to mental health issues, I am now focused on work.

Since my parents will be retiring and moving back to our home country in about two years, that is the amount of time I have to become financially self-sufficient. My original plan was to earn money by freelancing as a web developer. The ability to create my own schedule and work from home was the primary motivation. Although I completed several paid projects as a freelancer, I struggled to find clients on a consistent-enough basis, and for this reason had to abandon this plan (at least temporarily). I then got a part-time job as a programmer. It was tolerable, but after a year, I was again forced to jump ship since I was severely underpaid, and my parents were growing restless about me ""going nowhere"" (which wasn't far from the truth; that job was a dead-end). Anyway, that brings us to my present situation...

About a month ago, I was hired for a full-time (M-F, 9 AM - 6 PM) programming job. I knew that I would hate the schedule, but again, I was pressed to get a ""real"" job. I anticipated myself feeling unhappy and frustrated, but I've arrived at my wits' end much sooner than I thought. Today, over the 9 hours of my workday, I sat at my desk, with one hand over the keyboard and another over the mouse while intensively staring at the screen. Externally, it appeared as if I were thinking deeply about some programming problem, but in actual fact I was running through different scenarios in my head of how I could quit and / or commit suicide. I did not write a single line of code throughout the entire day. Whenever I tried to focus, I would feel myself hitting a mental barrier, and hear a resounding ""NO.""

Please understand that this is not because of laziness. I enjoy working as a programmer, and I can appreciate the feeling of accomplishment after a hard day of work. It's not the work that's causing me to feel and act this way; it's the job, which consists of:

being chained to a desk and forced to glare at a screen for 9 hours straight having no time for myself or anyone else in my life after work, no matter how I structure my day open-office setup, devoid of even the illusion of privacy that cubicles at least afford, which constantly makes me feel like a monkey on display open-office setup and co-workers producing an environment so loud, that it's impossible to focus deeply on any assignment traffic-ridden commute pressure to constantly look like I'm being productive, even when there are no assignments to complete stale air and headache-inducing fluorescent lightning having to repeat this grind every weekday If I were doing the exact same work, but were allowed to do it from home and according to my own schedule, it would solve nearly all of my problems. In fact, when I did this as a freelancer, I would often work more hours per week than I do now. Was it tiring and stressful? Yes. Did it make me depressed? No, because I was in control. When I got tired of glaring at the screen, I would take a short break to rest my eyes and stretch my legs. When a friend would ask to hang out during a weekday, I wouldn't have to turn him down. I could simply adjust my schedule. When I needed to focus, my room was quiet to allow for it. When my room got stuffy, I could open the windows. Even though I was working longer hours as a freelancer, my schedule was flexible enough to allow me to do all of what I needed and most of what I wanted during a given day. I ate healthy, exercised regularly, got the proper amount of sunlight and fresh air, and kept a good social life. All of this made stress that accompanied the work very manageable.

My quality of life wasn't as good, but was still decent when I worked my part-time job. When I accepted this 9-to-6 job, though, my quality of life plummeted.

Whenever I discuss the above with anyone, I always get the same stock replies, such as, ""that's life,"" ""it's what being an adult is like,"" ""deal with it,"" ""grow up,"" etc. It seems that to the average person, the work-life problems that I described are just minor inconveniences. To me, they are soul-crushing. Living this life-revolving-around-a-job suffocates me, but allows me just enough gasps for breath to keep me alive, so that I can fulfill my obligation of being a ""productive member of society"" (read: wage-slave).

I am unsure of what to do in my present situation. My heart is begging me to quit and free myself, so unless somebody here can persuade me to somehow stick through it, that's what I will most likely do. Since my parents would not accept me quitting, I'm considering telling them that I got fired. They would sooner accept that. I don't have any plan B lined up, but I fear that if I continue working where I am, I will grow more and more extreme in my hatred for this job, and possibly end up doing something that I will regret.

What should I do?",15May2019,1
3,"Sorry if this text isn't comprehensible as English is not my native language.

I'm afraid that I'm slowly falling into depression, as my life feels like it's losing it's purpose every single day. I feel like i'm distancing from the people that I love for a number of reasons. I'm 18 years old, so the feeling that I'm going to have to become independent is not so bad per se, what is bad is that I can hardly see a future without my parents backing me up, I feel like a boy in a man's world, weak and uncapable, every time that I need to ask my parents for a favor the more I feel that my relationship with them is going to break the moment I leave as I feel like a weight to them. My 10 year old sister is the most precious thing that I have in my life, I'm kinda like a third parent for her and she has given me reasons to maintain strong and to be better as she'll look at me and try to imitate me, I love her with all of my soul but she's growing very fucking fast and I'm afraid that those days soon will be gone, she'll turn into an pre-adolescent and will start to lose the innocence I've always loved. The passing of time is killing me.

I'm venezuelan but I've been living in Peru for about a year and I haven't made a single friend. I really feel like I don't fit in and I haven't met a person that I'd enjoy being with. The people it's so different that I've slowly started to hate their way of being, to the point that I have zero interesting in making friends anymore. I know that sounds mean, but makes me angry that not a single person is like the people I knew back in Venezuela, since all of my friends are still there or living in another country and I'll probably never see them again. 

I've always been a person that never liked to be in a relationship in a young age, as I feel that no girl is mature enough to carry a serious relationship with me. But this time, my friends from Venezuela tell me that now it's the moment to look out for a girlfriend. I'm tall and fairly handsome so I probably wouldn't have a problem at least getting the atention of a girl, but I really feel like that won't solve the problem for me, I still have to figure out how to make myself happy in order to make other people happy. I've downloaded Tinder and it's a nightmare because I just keep swiping left because none of those girls look like they would help me getting out of this situation.

Now all of this collapses into one problem, I'm starting to distance myself from pretty much everybody, and I'm aware of that but in order to make myself happy I look for things that I know I would enjoy. This feeling is making me dislike the things that I enjoy and hate the people I loved. I used to love playing videogames but now I only get frustrated over and over again, I go to the gym but I'm starting to give up as I don't see the point of going anyway, I still have to focus in college but I actually don't care anymore.

And scared that this may lead to something worse. I get anxiety attacks when I think about the future or when I'm surrounded by a lot of people that seem to be having fun while I don't, my parents expect me to be happy but that's just more pressure for me.

What should I do? Should I worry or get professional support? I really need at least something, the right words in the right order, to at least give me hope or something

I dreamt I was crying and weeping a lot. Feeling so stressed and helpless. Hunched over, hands on my face, in despair. Kneeling down. There was a song on repeat, but I couldn’t remember it. People were kneeling down with me, asking me what was wrong. I couldn’t respond. What was I feeling? Trapped? Even now, I still feel the warm spots under my eyes. It’s as if they are ready to release tears, but I’m holding it back.

I wanted to hold something dearly, but knew I couldn’t; not anymore.

Maybe it was passing by the Middleschool I used to go to and the park I tried to kill myself at. Maybe it was the 5th cancellation of an appointment. Maybe it was all of it:

The bad memories, the abuse and neglect, the betrayal, the overwhelming pain and emotions, the inability to hold a job down, to hold my concentration to the real world down, the constant invalidation from everyone... I’m just sad, and really want to talk to someone I know and trust over this, but I can’t. I’m lonely. I keep thinking I’m a mistake, a bad fault in the sidewalk that everyone skips over or hides it with more pavement. It’s there. I know it’s there. But what difference does it make if no one believes you...

Why do I even have a mouth? Do I even deserve it? Is life worth living if there is no consistent frequent moments of happiness spread across it? I just want a hug. I want a hug and to know that things will be alright and not replaying that damn hypothetical scenarios of moments before I die. I want my pain to be gone, please. My fingers and hands are beyond broken from trying to dig out of this long tunnel that doesn’t show light yet.

Is it grief? Is it regret? Is it shame? Despair? Helplessness? Whatever it is... it isn’t good. My body is holding me back from the thing I want to do most: travel to space, anywhere, really.

I’m way too fucking hard on myself.",15May2019,1

6,"Names Mike, I'm 17 from a small ass town in the middle of the USA, never had a problem that deeply affected me. This year has been a bit different. The past twelve months haven't been the best. I get there are problems in life and I'm not saying mine are more significant than others but it's been more personal recently. I recently got friend zoned by a girl I've talked to daily for a year (which I get happens), one of my relatives recently died of cancer (smoked all her life, last thing she said to me was ""Mike I should have listened to you, I should have never smoked."" I always told her to quit every time I saw her). And I got a 3rd concussion during wrestling which essentially made it so I couldn't wrestle anymore. I get it, life happens but for all of these examples I feel a lot of guilt for them. Every time I think about being friend zoned, getting another concussion, and watching a relative pass I simply feel guilt. I almost get a voice in the back of my head telling me that I could have done something to prevent that. And no matter how hard I try to get that feeling out it comes back. I think I could have done something to prevent my relative from smoking, I think I could have done something to prevent my concussion, I think I could have done something to make a relationship work out with the girl I've talked to for a year. But at the same time I know I can't do anything about it. The guilt lingers and gets worse every time something like a picture shows up and I remember what used to be. It spreads across my mind like wildfire. Its come to the point where I just can't sleep because I feel awful. I recently talked to a few friends that I trust about this and they believe it's something depression related. I personally don't think it's depression. I'm not suicidal, never have been, and I thank God for that. I don't want to harm others, never have, and I thank God for that too. But I'm here to see if someone else is in this situation or has been in this situation.",15May2019,1
7,"I am a 32-year-old mother and life feels like too much. I moved my children to a new city for my LDR of 4 years, and I recently discovered he was involved with multiple other women. Although I’ve tried to make friends, I lack meaningful connections in this new city.  I feel endlessly tortured by my shortcomings: I am too depressed to be the mother my children deserve (and riddled with guilt for moving them here), all my romantic relationships have failed, I do not have enough money to move back home, and I feel alone.  I try to have fun with my kids and to be a present parent but I’m often distracted and sad. I am consumed with thoughts of suicide, and the only thing stopping me is childcare logistics. My children would be happier with their dad and his girlfriend, but they live far away. I have tried multiple antidepressants to no avail, and I’ve been in therapy for over a year. I feel totally out of options which is why I am on Reddit. Have you ever felt like this? And what did you do?",15May2019,2
8,"I'm currently 22 years old, I turned it on April 21st this year. I work a minimum wage job, I work it so I can afford rent and groceries so I can exist. I had a shitty childhood and teenhood as many people can relate to, so up to this point aside from a few enjoyable moments it was mostly crap. This post will sort of be a tldr version of my life since it would take a bibles worth of content to write it all out and I know no one wants to read it nor would I. I never had a father, but the person who got my mom pregnant left before I was born and also refused to sign the birth documents. He came back into my life at some point when I was little, probably around Grade 3. He was an alcoholic and during this time he did terrible things to my mom and sister but left me. I didn't even know any of it was going on at the time and I was just happy to have a father for once. Eventually me and my family basically all split up and I went back into foster care. My mom neglected me a lot as a kid, and I often saw her fighting with the other ""father"" figure, who happens to be the father of my 2 siblings. An older brother and a younger sister (the one mentioned earlier). I eventually got out of foster care in Grade 6 and moved to another Province (I'm Canadian) where my two siblings moved in with me and their father as well as their stepmom. For a bit more context he was also a part of my life briefly when I was in kindergarten/grade 1, he swore all the time and fought with my mom constantly. He even threw me down the stairs as a kindergarten student because I ""wasn't getting ready fast enough"" while living with him in middle school, he was the same as he was before and ended up beating me in grade 8, he threw me down the stairs again and proceeded to kick me over and over until finally I managed to get up and run. What followed was my siblings terrible step mom slapping me in the face as hard as she could and essentially telling me not to be a pussy. As a kid anytime I cried people would yell at me to shut the fuck up and to stop being a pussy. I can't cry. Back in Grade 6 I ended up in the hospital and was seriously ill. I wouldn't find out until grade 10 that I was born with a disease. I finally got a chance to move back to my home province after I completed Grade 9, and I took the opportunity. I got to live with my mom again and to this day still am. She changed as a person for the better and is an outstanding human being. Skipping back to Grade 10, I ended up in the hospital that year and literally died (but was brought back to life by the nurses there) I found out I have an incurable disease. It's an auto-immune deficit disorder so essentially my body can't fight off things the way others can. Despite this, I'm not even sure its what causes my suffering. After I made it out of the hospital, Grade 11 and 12 proceeded to be some of the worst years of my life. I wanted to die all of the time and was legitimately suicidal. I had a plan and everything, to drown myself, but never went through with it. I couldn't stand life, nor how awkward and stupid I had become or how I felt.  I graduated, and instead of going post-secondary like my few friends, I worked a shitty minimum wage job where I got yelled at all the time because the manager there was insecure and unhappy with his own life. After that, I eventually quit after a year and now I'm working at a decent job, its still minimum wage but my coworkers are all very nice human beings. Despite that, since a while ago (maybe a year or so now) I have lost my feelings. It seems it worsens by the day, and I have had constant visits with my doctor and specialists to try and figure out whats going on. I feel fatigued every single day and its difficult to do anything. I don't know if its depression again because it feels different. I feel like I want to cry but its still impossible. I can only think back to how it was when I was a child, and I feel it legitimately numbed me from being able to properly act out feeling sad. I feel numb now to pretty much everything, even people talking to me. I can respond, but I feel I am a robot now. I feel I just exist because I am. The feeling I feel most that I describe, that I wonder if anyone can relate to, is that of my brain melting. I feel like my brain has been melting for months now, and that Ive lost myself. I feel like I can never go back, because my brain is partially gone. I know its really not, I understand that. But it still feels like the me of before will never be back, and its difficult now that I can barely even bring myself to watch an episode of something or read something, as it all takes to much effort and my brain simply wont process it.  


Thank you for reading this anyone who did, I just needed to share my feelings. I know it was a long read anyways, despite me saying I would make it short. If you have any questions I would gladly share. If you want to share your own life or experiences I would love to hear. You deserve it to. I don't know any of you but you matter, even if you don't think so and even if I don't feel that way about myself.

10,"I’m a 28 year old female going through some hell. I think I just need to vent. I’m starting therapy this week that’s 6 weeks long because finally reached my breaking point. I had just turned 15 when my best friend, mom, died from stage 4 stomach cancer. My dad was already trying to find a new woman while she was in hospice. He moved in and impregnated a woman that same year after my mom died. He was absent, my siblings went their separate ways. I needed love so badly that I became addicted to toxic relationships. I couldn’t be alone, I didn’t know how and I had no real guidance. The first relationship was 6 years and he ended up passing away from a heroin overdose. I never touched any drugs. Thank God. Shortly after I met the next 6 year relationship with a guy who had deep rooted sexual issues. He constantly cheated and I became entangled in his issues so far that I completely lost myself. Throughout all of those years I remained persistent in trying to improve my life, I moved up in my job, bought a new car and got my own apartment when I was 25. But something was seriously missing. I had no fucking idea who I was and I was miserable. I’ve never loved myself or even felt pretty. My friends think I’m insane for feeling this way, but I can’t help how I feel. Because of that relationship I have carried the paranoia of mistrust to my current new relationship with a man I love so much. I met this new guy last year and hes a blessing. He’s helped me in so many ways but there’s so many times I can’t trust him only because I’m always thinking of worst case scenarios. It’s what I’m so fucking used to. I’m always feeling worthless and that every other girl is better than me and that he will eventually cheat on me. It’s fucking insane, I know. I feel so alone with this. I’m sabotaging a good thing that for once has come into my life out of pure fear and habitual patterns of destructive behavior from serious emotional abuse. My current boyfriend hasn’t done one thing to make me feel this way, it’s literally me causing myself so much unnecessary hurt but it’s become so engraved in my head that I can’t figure out how to stop it. I want to for once in my life love myself and feel worthy of real love. I want to learn and feel trust for once. I was lied to and cheated on by both 6 year relationships And the emotional abuse has scarred me. I’m honestly just tired of feeling this way. My current boyfriend tells me that I’m his dream woman, that he is embracing finally finding someone that loves him like I do. I hear this from him and it shatters me because I can’t understand why, I don’t feel worthy. I get these horrible negative thoughts that he’s lying, or he’s using me or just anything to talk myself out of believing that someone actually loves me. I know I sound insane and I really hope no one is mean on here, I just needed to vent.",15May2019,5
11,"So this is kind of going to be a long one. To put it shortly my boss claims to be empathetic to mental illness, but she's really not. She threatens to fire people and says that they're faking if they take a mental health day. She told me to get over it when I told her I didn't want to work with a person who was involved in an event I still have PTSD over. Basically she's not the most understanding person on the planet. So a few days ago things got really bad and I intentionally overdosed. I was supposed to go into work later and I asked in the gc if someone could cover my shift because I was vomitting. She said my shift wasn't until a bit later and asked if I could wait and see how I feel. I then PMed her and told her what happened and that I really couldn't come in. She seemed annoyed but said she would find coverage. Later I found out she was complaining all day that I made her miss her date. The next time I saw her I tried to apologize and explain that things with my mental health have gotten a lot worse and that I'm trying to reach out for help, but everytime she interrupted to talk about her new boyfriend. So I was supposed to go on this trip later this week, I got time off for it and everything, but after the overdose that's not happening. I was looking forward to staying home and recuperating. But of course since I'm not going she's like ""great now I don't have to cover for you.""

13," What does depression feel like? The most fearful feelings when it comes to depression, is the complete lack of anything. The nothingness overpowers your every thought, and everything seems pointless. A happy life, is without a doubt, doing what you want. Doing what is meaningful to you. If that doesn’t exist in your life right now, your life's content is nothingness, and at the very best, you're going on auto-pilot, day by day without any happiness. 

What then? In a sense, that's when you're giving yourself warning signs that you're going down a slippery slope to a dark place. Being in that place is awful in itself, but you do not have to be in that place all alone. That’s why I'm doing online counselling , because I know how it is to be stuck in that place.

14,"I plan on posting this to a few different subs so hopefully I can get as much help as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister is 13 and last Wednesday, she tried to kill herself. Ambulance came and took her to the ER and the next day they determined that she needed to go to a psychiatric hospital to their adolescent unit. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's been there since. And I feel that she is not ready to discharge home on Thursday but I feel they're going to send her home anyway. She is 100 percent compliant but I feel that she is not being completely honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's severely addicted to her phone and snapchat. We thought this was the root of all her issues but we feel that now, it may be only a symptom. We've learned since last Wednesday that she's attempted multiple times to kill herself and earlier tonight, my mom found suicide notes she wrote to her family. Myself included.

&amp;#x200B;

In mine, it said she viewed me as a second mom and that she loves me so much and she doesn't want to hurt me. But she's tired of being here. 

In the one to my dad (he's not in the picture anymore), it was hateful and told him she truly believes he's going to hell. My dad is a sick person and when I moved away from home, I cut him out of my life. I haven't talked to him in years. 

&amp;#x200B;

But apparently my sister is still really struggling with how she feels about him. She feels abandoned, hurt and ignored. She feels like he left her to go be with a better family.

I feel like her therapists might not be doing enough. 

I feel like they are not treating anything in relation to the addiction with her phone. She keeps asking me why can't she prove to my mom that she can be responsible with SnapChat? It seems that that's all she can focus on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that although this may be a symptom of deep rooted issues, we're not doing what we should be to help her be okay without SnapChat (she will most likely never have access to this again). I feel that when she's so distraught about not using her SnapChat, she may sink back into that depth of depression to where she feels there's no way out and has not learned enough healthy coping mechanisms. She also isn't learning independent leisure skills to turn to when she does not have her phone. I wish we could keep her there longer to give her more of a break from her phone because she is so so addicted to it and at the same time keep her safe and supervised, but that is quickly coming to an end and I'm terrified.  She has ZERO hobbies. It's purely her damn phone all day every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work and so does my mom during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

What is going to happen when she's out of school and neither one of us is available to be with her all day long? She lives in a sketchy neighborhood and goes to a school in a different city than where she lives so she has no friends around the area that she can just walk over and hang out with. It would take my mom or I driving her safely to and from these friends' houses to see them and then we worry that she would just get on SnapChat on their phones. 

&amp;#x200B;

She needs adult supervision every day while my mom and I are at work but I have no idea what is out there. 

Neither one of us have money to enroll her in summer camp or anything. 

I feel that the hospital has not been very helpful in giving us resources or help on what to do when she discharges.

1. I’m really into cars. Cars make me happy too, sometimes. I own a 1970 chevelle that’s a real basket case project. Been working on it for 8 years. And for 8 years I thought it was making me happy. Well it’s finally in driving condition, and I drove it to work(it’s longest drive so far), and it was nice. But it didn’t make me happy. I obsess over cars. I’m always on my phone looking at car stuff or cars for sale. My brain won’t shut off about cars. Can I stress anymore how much I like cars?! 😑

2. My job. I make $23.10/hr which is definitely above most people. I am a maintenance person at a factory. I suck at my job. I don’t feel like I belong in this position. Mostly I’ve gotten to where I am by other people. Former co workers or family that I’ve worked with and move onto other jobs and want me to work for them. I get that I must show something that they like in order to want me to work for them. But I don’t see it. I change jobs every 1-2 years. Longest job I held was for 3. After a year, I get bored or have a general distaste for my environment, management, or the job itself. I want a different job again, but can’t afford to leave. I stay because I need to provide for my family. I put them before me. I’ve tried to do things for myself as far as going to college and getting a job I liked. But college cost money I don’t have and a job that didn’t pay enough. I lost my first house because of it.

3.  Money. Of course money. I never have enough to do the things I want. Or the things I want to get. I want my house to look nicer, I want cool stuff for my kids, I want a nicer car, nothing fancy, just something nice that I don’t have to fix. I want a job that pays me more. Thing is, my current job allows me to have what I already have. But when I want more I can’t afford it. 

I feel like this is all typical things middle class people worry about. But even when I get the things I think will make me happy, I end up not being happy. I don’t really want to take meds. Can’t afford a life change. Can’t afford a therapist or doctor. Some days I have good days, but mostly just depressed. My car triggers a lot of it. Which makes me feel stupid. I keep pushing forward to the next day and try not to dwell. But even my wife says I need to get help. 

I feel dumb while typing this. Like get over yourself, welcome to the rest of us living life.",15May2019,50

21,"I'm thinking about taking a leave for a few months due to MDD and GAD. I've held myself together for too long and now I cannot anymore. I just need to let it go.. My parents will kill me I think... So tell me, how is yours going?",15May2019,7
22,"I recently was put on medication for my depression, and while my headspace feels a little better I still can't bring myself to do anything other than what is immediately required of me. I still sleep all day until work, and thinking about cleaning my house overwhelms me so I ignore it. Looking at a to do list makes me feel anxious as hell. Has anyone else been able to change their habits after a long depression period? How did you start out, make yourself follow through, etc?",15May2019,5
23,"12 years ago my dad went into my room at night, I was sleeping soundly in my bed,  I had fallen asleep an hour ago at 1 in the morning. He snapped my favorite in half. I woke up and screamed, terrified and tried to get out, out of my room, out of my house, away from him. I ran right into him and again he took one in his hands and SNAP. I could smell the alcohol on his breath. He did another. SNAP. I fell to the floor. ""Stop!"" I screamed covering my ears. SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP. My records lay in a broken pile on the floor. He said ""You little shit"" then he stumbled out of my room.  

I just remembered this. I had repressed it. I don't know what to do or what else I've repressed. I've had a subconscious fear of my dad for years and I don't know what to do.  I know he's never harmed me physically but still. If anyone has any advice it would be really appreciated.",15May2019,3
24,I’m home alone by bf is at work and I don’t want him to see me like this but I’m sick of prentending I’m ok. I just cut myself in the shower with my razor. I just want my baby and nothing I can do can bring her back to me. I want comfort I want to be happy my meds aren’t working and it’s currently 330 am and I want to call my parents but I know they are asleep what do I do I can’t cope.,15May2019,3
25,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. You do not have to have experienced suicidal thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in English can take part. If you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. The questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. If there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the link below. This will take you to the survey and study information page.

26,Every day I pretty much drop my kids at school and then lay in bed feeling like I can hardly move. Even when I complete some household chores I feel depressed while doing it. It’s like I am going through the motions but feel like shit and usually end up crying at some point. Then when other parents ask about my day I just make up some b.s. but mostly avoid talking much. I do enjoy being with my kids but even they notice when I am checked out and not totally present. I just hate that it feels so hard just to get through a normal day. I’ve tried to trick myself into thinking I’m just bored or it might be crappy weather but I know it’s more than that.,15May2019,13
27,"So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said ""speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you"" and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I can't get any girls and stuff. It didn't bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, I'm not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I should've done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didn't say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I don't know why she would have said that.",15May2019,3
28,"This is my first post ever talking about my depression anywhere on reddit, so I hope it's not too weird.

&amp;#x200B;

I suddenly got depression/bipolar type 2 and anxiety after puberty and it's only gotten worse from then on. I self harmed for 10 years and had severe anorexia for a couple of years. When puberty arrived, my chronic illnesses did too, but that's a whole other story.  This year I'll be turning 28 and I've finally realized that I'm never going to be healthy, neither physically or mentally. Things really went downhill after high school, when I tried getting further education but had to quit over and over again. I'm starting studying again in august, but online this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be healthy, be able to be social, to study and work. I've been on SO many medications and tried so hard for so many years, I just don't know what else to do. I've kept challenging my anxiety (and agoraphobia), started working out, meditated, fixed my diet, found creative outlets, have daily routines and good sleep ""hygiene"" but it's NOT ENOUGH. I've gone for daily walks in nature and just stared at trees because ""research shows being in nature can cure depression"", I have a job at a dementia care facility where I work every third weekend because ""it helps to help other people"". I've been in therapy for over 12 years. What else can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see any hope for the future at all, right now I'm just keeping myself alive and trying to be supportive to my SO, my family, my pets and the patients at work (even though I'm away because of my illnesses very often)

&amp;#x200B;

Since I don't start school until august, I'm at home every day except two days every third weekend when I work. My SO is worried about me because I just sit here all day. I go for small walks, sometimes play computer games, browse a lot of reddit or just literally stare into a wall. I'm so incredibly lonely. It's hard to keep up friendships when I cancel on plans so often than I'll go years between seeing some of my friends. At least they understand but it doesn't make it much better.

&amp;#x200B;

I need something to do but I'm always too TIRED. I know my chronic illnesses, depression and medication makes the tiredness worse, but other people seem to be able to do stuff still? I want to fill my days with something, but I'm not well enough to work. I feel a lot of guilt for not contributing to society, since I receive money from the state just to sit here.

&amp;#x200B;

No idea what the meaning of this post is, I guess I just needed to get some feelings off my chest?",15May2019,1
29,"So I spent a good portion of the past 3 years in therapy and trying to better myself.  I felt like I hit my rock bottom after a close friend and mentor took his own life the same day I found out my gf was cheating on me.  About 6 months ago my therapist told me she thinks I'm done with therapy that I've grown so much and made such huge strides in my life(spent a month in india with my sister in laws family and am now in school for 3d modelling and animation). However just 3 weeks ago my new gf cheated on me, and now I feel like rock bottom has caved in underneath me and inspite of a lot of support of my friends the loneliness this has caused feels so much more extreme than before.  I'd cut myself off from woman ever since my friend died, and finally opened up to her only to be betrayed again almost immediately.  Honestly I dont know what advice I want, or really anything anymore, my will to succeed feels drained.",15May2019,1
30,"i tried to become a better person but everytime i tried i would fall harder and harder.im 23 and i can't talk to girls in my class,i dont have any friends (rest of my brothers does) and my life sucks hard,im failing my college cause i dont study,if i studied like the other students does i would top every course but im always too lazy to study or read from my books( funny that im always watching tv shows on netflix and never said im lazy) my life has been a just fucking big failure,i wish i never existed,bye reddit,take care",15May2019,7
31,"I used to consider myself okay. I have been struggling with depression for several years now. Found a medication that worked, a healthy and stable relationship, and moved away from my troubling family.

Suddenly I found myself considering suicide. Genuinely, considering my options, time frames, etc. I've never fallen so hard before to the point where the police showed up at my door to see if I was still alive. 

I struggle with depression, anxiety, OCD. I have never struggled so hard before and yet felt like I wasn't struggling at all before, because when I really decided that I might just kill myself it was such a relief. This was just a couple days ago. I have since switched medication and am desperately trying to feel ""okay"" again.

I just want to be okay",15May2019,28
32,"Please please read I really need help. I don’t know what to do anymore. Last October, I got in a fight with my best friend and our friend group took her side. That left me with no one. Ever since then (it’s now may) I have been lonely and depressed. I’ve tried the whole make up thing, get in there with people, and be outgoing but it didn’t work. After months of trying hard, I realized no matter how nice and fun you are to others it doesn’t matter if they aren’t interested in you. There is another group of girls in my friend group that I tried getting in with but they seem to ignore me when I’m around. I sit on the outskirts and they always leave without asking me to come. Even if I am with one of the girls individually, I am super outgoing and try to get her to talk but she just sits in silence. But as soon as she is with others, she talks. It’s like I’m always the one trying to make conversation but only get one word answers. It’s like everyone is interested in themselves and wont talk to me because I’m not cool enough or worth their time. I tried to find new friends, but I go to a small school and there are no better options. Please help me it’s been months and I really need advice.",15May2019,4
