0,"My provider prescribed me Lexapro and Wellbutrin months ago (which I take consistently), but I just feel this constant tiredness and ache to just be done with it all. I have nothing to be sad about really. I go to a top 5 university, about to intern at a top 5 tech company, and have a loving partner. It's just that I feel ambivalent about living. At this point,  I'm going through the motions of living bc people expect me to. I don't know how to explain it. I can still enjoy those tiny aspects of life, but I eventually go back to a dark place. I secretly think about dying in an accident (not suicide), so that I can find relief. I've been sitting at home after a semester (where I only passed two classes) like a hermit bc I never truly made friends in hs. Just a lot of acquaintances. I'm so lonely yet I don't want to interact with anyone. I know my depression has started to disappoint my partner as I have started to sleep all the time. As such, she has a hard time getting in contact with me. I don't deserve her. If I didn't have any obligations this summer, I know most of my days would be spent sleeping. The world wants little to do with this queer Black gal. My twitter feed shows me that everyday haha",16Jun2019,1
1,"Hey all, I’ve never shared these feelings with anyone because I find it nearly impossible to say these things irl. I’ll apologize in advance for the length. I just want someone, anyone, to know how I’m feeling underneath the facade. 

I’m currently 21/M living in the US. I withdrew from college in 2017; the middle of my first year, second semester due to my health (both physical and mental) taking an unexpected swan dive. I became very isolated during this period and one by one I began to lose my friends, and eventually my SO of 2.5 years through infidelity on their end. After nearly a year of being paralyzed by severe anhedonia and talking with a psychiatrist, I mustered up every ounce of courage I had and decided it was important to get back into a social groove. 

Boy oh boy did I fall flat on my face. I took every rejection, platonic or otherwise, as an indictment of my personal character. The common denominator in each failed social venture was me, so naturally I came to believe that I was the puzzle piece that didn’t fit, truly too broken to make genuine connections anymore. I was a phony playing at being social and optimistic, when all I could really think about was the futility of it all. After maybe 6 or 7 months of continuous failure and a few pitiful “successes” I gave up. I was exhausted. 

For all of my socially anxious friends, I know you’ve heard the advice “You just gotta keep putting yourself out there!” a million times over. And since I was no longer in school, I applied that same advice to job seeking. Yet again I found rejection after rejection after rejection. Nearly all of these jobs were part time unskilled labor. 

Fast forward about a year and I have moved from my old college town to a new, bigger city where my relatives invited me to stay with them for free while I try to regain my footing. However I find myself grappling with the same pitfalls as before. I have no prior work history, a large gap between when I took leave from school and today, no friendships to confide or bond with, and now feeling like a burden with my family taking care of me when I should be becoming independent and a “real man” (in society’s eyes, not my own.)

Seems it boiled over today when I was rejected from a dishwashing position in favor of a “more appropriately qualified candidate.” My self-esteem is beneath rock bottom. The remnants of confidence I have left only serve to remind me of the person I once was and the potential that has been circling the drain for the past 2 years.

Idk that was longer than anticipated. Thanks for sticking it out. I would appreciate any advice or anecdotes, even if not pertaining directly to my situation. I’m just so so lost. 

TLDR: I thought I might be a late bloomer, turns out I’m just wilting away.",16Jun2019,10
2,"About a year ago my Fiance left me. 4 months ago he addmited to having Philophobia(A fear of love and intamacy) And has become distant. I love him more than i can take and was recently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Seperation Anxiety, and Suicidal Ideation. I'm struggling and honestly don't have the will to hold on anymore. I was dedicated to take my life before i met him. And we saved each other.

Im not very good at school, but maths are the worst thing for me, and if i dont pass my maths this year i dont have my certificate nd stuff(i wont graduate). So i just dont want to study, i dont care anymore but my bf is obligating me to study, but i just cant. So he gets mad and reproach me things which makes me so sad. im trying my absolute best to do stuff but he doesnt understand even if i explain. I just think he doesnt love me anymore, hes not interested in me anymore, and only asks me to do things, he doesnt talk to me about my day, or anything. I just feel like shit and im  ready to end it all, like ik im not gonna graduate and my bf will be mad af to me, i dont have any friends, no one wants to hire etc etc etc Anyways theres more things but i would like some tips about motivation and stuff.

6,"Having a really bad night. Left to call suicide hotline. Walked too far to walk back. I’m so dumb. Called my bf to pick me up and he did, but he took me to a bar. He told me to take an adderral and come in and have a drink or were over. Adderral is the last thing I need right now but I took it so I can have a place to stay and a ride home.

7,"Before I start the post I would like to clarify that I am not saying that seeking treatment ALWAYS helps but it doesn't hurt to try. Another thing I would like to say is treatment can be exspensive but there are plenty of places that'll give you treatment for low prices or even free. Excuse any spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes I'm writing this in a rush therapist said I should be getting good sleep. Please please please I beg all people reach for help if it comes in the way in a therapist or a friend please do it. For people who say ""well I don't think it would work for me"" give it a try I was once like you i never thought it would work but here I am and it worked out for me.So why not give it a try? For some people like myself it's hard to tell people you a mental illness you don't know what they're gonna think. But truly if the person you tell judges you for something that you can't change don't waste your time on them.

8,"I know a lot of people have it way worse than me and a lot of people would find themselves lucky to be in my situation but I just need to put myself out there and most of all I need advice from someone who has experienced something similar to what I have. I am 14 years old, my parents are divorced, and I don’t know what to do with myself. I haven’t been diagnosed because I am too afraid to tell even my parents but I am pretty sure I have quite a bit of social anxiety. I am drunk at the time of writing this so if this is just an unintelligible jumble of nonsense than I am understanding of that. Just today I was at a graduation party, when the graduate walked up to me and sparked a conversation. I tried my absolute best to think of anything to talk about but then my head went blank and I didn’t know what to say, and I don’t know why but I just said mid sentence: “ Alright, see you around.”. I don’t know what is wrong with me or how to fix a lot of the shit that’s wrong with me or if there is anything wrong with me at all and I am just making it up. A week ago, my mom found out I had been smoking weed, I lied about having done it just once because I did it five times before she caught me. Two days after that I started abusing alcohol, I don’t even like it but it lets me escape from the reality that I am a fuck up. My dad is also a bypolar mess and so is my brother. I was born deformed and have always been made fun of for it, everyday I rehearse comebacks so I don’t look like a complete idiot when I get made fun of at school. I always wonder what it’s like to be able to talk to someone for more than five minutes without freaking the fuck out. I have been having suicidal thoughts since the age of 10 and when I was 11 I tried to drown myself. I am too afraid to ask for medication because I feel I will abuse it. And even if I don’t my mom might think I’m faking the whole thing just to get high off antidepressants and that whole deal. Maybe I don’t need medication and I just need to stop being a fucking baby about the whole thing.

9,"I’ve been home from college for just over a month now and it feels like I’m just dead inside. I am currently in an internship at a local professional theatre doing photography/videography and it’s something I was looking forward to for a while but the only time I go out of my house is to go to that internship.

I’ve been invited out with friends quite a few times since I’ve been home but I usually decline or cancel last minute because I can’t bring myself to leave the house (the cruel irony is I hate friends canceling on me last minute so when I do it it just tears me sort inside). I’ve had a few times where friends literally come to my house and make me go out and I usually have a good time.

It scares the shit out of me. When I think deeper it sends me into a downward spiral of feeling lonely and unwanted.

I have a condition called hyperhydrosis. And it causes my hands to sweat profusely all the time. I’ve had it all my life. It fells like my hand are always wet(because they are). I’ve tried so many treatments to make it stop. Many painful treatments. There is a surgery that is supposed to make it stop, but I’m not old enough to opt for it. Even if it does stop my hands sweating, it will just divert it somewhere else.

It has made everything so difficult and is likely the source for all my problems. Touching certain materials is enough to make me want to throw up. 
I have difficulty making friends and the ones I have make jokes about it and flinch away when I accidentally touch their arms. They alway squeal about how it’s so disgusting. But I can’t do anything. I wish I could. I would do anything tho make it stop. I can’t use the monkey bars, or open bottles or make a real connection with anyone.

I just want it to stop.

When people ask me about what I want to be when I grow up, I make something up. But in reality I can’t imagine living that long. 

I have tried to make promises to myself, I have tried to start over and be different. Be someone who tries to be happy. But it’s just an endless spiral. And the smallest thing makes me breakdown.

I’ve tried psychiatrists and counsellors but I had too many bad experiences with them. 

My parents think I’m addicted to the Internet but I just use it to drown out the thoughts that won’t stop coming. They cut it off and all I can do is sit and think about how much I hate myself.

21,"I’m sorry if this is a bit all over the place. I don’t really know where to start or what to say. 

Things have been pretty bad for a long time. I [19F] have had depression for about seven years now, but I hid it from everyone until it got so bad a few of my friends became so concerned by how I was acting that the reached out to my parents in August 2017. My family is amazing and incredibly supportive and I started therapy right away then meds a few months later. This was during my senior year of high school, and nothing was improving and things only felt worse now that I had a diagnosis and everyone (parents and the few friends who talked to them) knew and I just wanted to die. I attempted suicide in January 2018, and although it was really my first try, it was the first one that was planned and really executed. I was hospitalized for a few weeks and then was in a PHP program, and none of it seemed to help. My problem was basically this: if I had the choice between magically snapping my fingers and my depression being gone and cured and me being happy and normal or me just being dead, I’d rather just be dead. No one could understand why I didn’t want a happy life and neither did I. I just wanted to be dead and nothing could give me the motivation to work for a change when I didn’t care for one. I was just so sick of everyone being so worried and concerned and I hated seeing the people I care about in pain when I knew no one could help me, so I started lying and faking it again. The meds gave me a little more energy so I was able to lie my way out of therapy and just pretend like it was all over. I got accepted into a great college and I was for the first time a little excited for a change in my life. 

My first semester didn’t work out. Even though I had great friends and amazing professors and had a perfect GPA after midterms, all the faking it caught up to me and I started ditching classes, ignoring old friends, not eating or sleeping, and really just laying in bed except when occasionally hanging out with friends. My advisor and psychiatrist from school reached out to my parents since I was failing all my classes with no attempts to fix it and was planning suicide again. When I went home for winter break they all decided that I would have to take a semester off and stay home. I was pissed because I just wanted a second chance or even a choice but because I have an illness I didn’t get either and I was going to be stuck at home all alone with nothing to do except the therapy that I had always hated and never worked. 

I started seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist, and for the first time it felt like I actually liked them and we didn’t spend every session with long empty silences where I answered everything with “I don’t know” (I think that it’s always been easier for me to talk to guys instead of girls for some reason and I finally asked to see male doctors instead of being too embarrassed to say anything). But after six months of working with them and trying new meds and rTMS, nothing has really changed. 

Even though I don’t really feel different, everyone is on board and planning for me to go back to school next semester, since that’s what I wanted and pleaded for from the start. But I don’t feel the least bit excited, hopeful, or even curious about going back and what that’s gonna be like. I just don’t care. Wanting to die has always been at the top of my list, but I’ve always pushed through by figuring out and settling with a solid number two is, if that makes sense. I guess I’ve always thought, “well, if I’m not going to die right now, I guess I’ll just do XYZ.” But now things just feel so empty and exhausting that I don’t want to settle. I just want to die and the feelings have just been consuming every second of everyday. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to tell my therapist bc I don’t want him to help me or try and stop me. I don’t want to stay home another semester or transfer or change any of that. I just want to die. I’ve stopped talking to friends bc I found myself relying on them too much to an unhealthy level for both sides to the point where I lost a few of my closest friends, so I just don’t talk about any of it anymore with them. It just feel like my mind is constantly thinking about and planning suicide. I’ve always felt like me killing myself is inevitable, but now it feel like how I did back before I was hospitalized. My brain is screaming at me to just end it all and nothing helps to shut it up. We’re currently on a family vacation doing super active things like hiking, but even during super intense exercise I can’t get my mind to just stop. I’ve gotten to a point where I start thinking about how, when, where, and other details a lot more seriously than I did when it was just my usual rumination. I just want my life to be over and I don’t care or even want the possibility of getting better. I’d rather just be dead. 

I’m sorry this ended up being more of a incomprehensible rant than anything else. I don’t really know what I’m looking for or want anyone can really say to help. Thank you for reading any of it, even if you don’t have anything to say, I appreciate it.",16Jun2019,3

26,"## [Is avoiding discomfort a sensible strategy?](https://www.johnglanvill.com/avoiding-discomfort-sensible-strategy/)

If you are of a certain age (early fifties) we can often find ourselves in an interesting phase of our life –  between the generation above us who are retiring and the generation below us who are at the beginning of their careers. From this vantage point, we find it fascinating to observe what is changing and what is staying the same across all generations, as times wanders by.

For example; the older generation grew up with a lot of physical discomforts, no central heating, outside toilets, limited food choices, fewer creature comforts etc.. Whereas, in comparison, the younger generation has benefited from plenty of food, warmth, computers and in general have had to endure less physical discomfort.

Although the younger generation seems to have experienced less physical discomfort we feel that both groups have equally experienced the same levels of emotional discomfort, although each is of a different paradigm.

So, we would like to explore **what is your attitude towards discomfort?**

Every mammal, animal, insect, fish and creature that lives ‘out-there’ faces a life of discomfort finding food, trying to not get eaten, finding a mate, building a shelter and generally staying alive! They don’t have any choice but to accept that discomfort, and just get on with it. They don’t have the luxury to procrastinate or be picky or choosy.

So, why do so many people try to avoid discomfort, or expect that the world should be a comfortable place? Surely that is pure naivety? Because if you could be comfortable with discomfort then you could get on and do anything!

We believe the difference between the creatures of the world and their ability to handle discomfort and ours can be simply explained: firstly, they don’t expect anything to be any different, and secondly, they don’t think! Whereas we humans do expect things to be different and we scare ourselves (to discomfort) with our own thoughts!

## Moving into your discomfort zone

Now, because this website is all about finding inner calmness, silencing the mind and freeing yourself from yourself – it makes sense to remove any hurdles to these goals as quickly as possible.

Therefore, the new question becomes – **How can I be comfortable with discomfort?** And if you are still not sure, a sub-question may be **Why do I avoid discomfort anyway?**

As people explore these questions they soon discover that what they are trying to avoid are typically bad feelings, bad thoughts or uncomfortable bodily sensations. For example, lots of people won’t eat fruit or vegetables – they say “I don’t like the taste!”

OMG! They won’t eat food that is essential for their health because the taste gives them a little discomfort! They won’t stop smoking because it may cause them some discomfort!!! Can you see at a simple level these beliefs just don’t pass the common sense test?

We would like to suggest that it may be so much more natural for us to just **relearn how to be OK with discomfort** and accept it as a part of life and get on with things rather than trying to control everything so we only get good sensations as that is just unrealistic and self-limiting.

## The trap we fall into by avoiding discomfort

If we don’t start to accept discomfort (as a normal part of life) then, we have to stay in the old paradigm where we need to try and avoid negative emotions and shut down our incessant negative thoughts – or we try to meditate them away, or credit card them away, or food them away, or alcohol them away – but you know deep down that they will keep coming back and you’ll keep on trying to avoid them! What a cruel, bitter, fearful and senseless game!

So what is the antidote? Begin to just accept discomfort….

* Just eat your vegetables even if you don’t like them…
* If it is boring,  just do it anyway…
* If it is cold, put a coat on and just get on with it…
* If there is conflict, just deal with it…
* If you want something go and get it…
* If they are annoying you, tell them to stop…
* Stop moaning and get on with it…

Will these things make you feel uncomfortable, of course, they will, for a few seconds, for the first few times, and then it’s all over and you will have moved on. Any other way leaves you stuck (and often miserable). Start to realise that we don’t need to avoid discomfort it is part of life! Embrace it and realise that being comfortable with discomfort enables you to do almost anything! How refreshing.",16Jun2019,1

30,"Hello again reddit

I've been thinking of ending it because I feel worthless. No one cares about me not even my parents. I spoke to my older sister about being depressed and how im even having a hard time even walking outside and looking people in the eye, i have no feelings over anything at all, i feel like an empty shell, she said I should read the Bible and it would help but that hasn't helped at all.

 I also spoke to my manager and she got annoyed with me and said people who claim to be depressed are just seeking attention and how her grandmother experienced war but she's never been depressed a day in her life. Later on i heard her and one of my co-worker talking about me and he said to her that I was retarded and they laughed, they saw me and felt awkward afterwards invited me to have drinks with them because I'm always alone, I told them no because I prefer to drink alone. Today they've been super nice to me but I just ignored them. When I got home last night I thought about ending it the only thing that stopped me is my fear of going to hell. 

I'm afraid to book for therapy what if it doesn't work? I've suffered abuse since I was a child and I'm not sure if I can be helped the therapist will probably think that I am weird and retarded just like my co-workers think.",16Jun2019,1
33,"I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some "" friends "" in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. That's when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I can't even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didn't overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.",16Jun2019,69
34,"Lastweek i had a psychological examination and the doctor said that i was depressed. For a certain time of the day, I will think things in the most negative way it could be, about my future, my life,... and sometime about death. The doctor advised me to share this with my family, my friends but I scared to tell them about it. I’m a Southeast Asian, where I think over 50% parents (include mine) are default that children become like that are because of the Internet or games. How about friends? You know Billie Eilish right? She is depressed too and a lot of youngsters in my country think thats it is very very cool to have depression. So it make people have a bad look about depression and think anyone who says he/she  has depression is fake and only tries to make themself cooler. Because of that, I have to go through this alone. Please, how can I go through this?

Ps: sorry if my english is bad. I wrote this when my mood in the best state. Thanks for helping me.",16Jun2019,1
35,"My parents put a lot of pressure on me throughout my childhood and essentially sent me the message that I needed to achieve something and have accomplishments in order to earn their love and respect. This has caused me to now have basically no sense of self-worth and it is completely ruining my enjoyment of life and making me afraid to go after the things that I want.

What are some good ways that you guys have managed to improve yourselves and develop a sense of self-worth and self-value?",16Jun2019,1
36," I am a struggling actress. Moved to LA with a few student film credits and took the risk because I thought some door would open for me. I used to travel to LA to attend some classes even. Now I ran out of funds. 

I keep applying for parts, get auditions but I do not get the part. A lot of times they told me about my European accent. I have been trying to change it, I really hate the fact that I was not born here. Then I guess my looks are not dazzling so I tried to get filler work done so I can fit but it is too expensive. 

I was attending this other class, teacher really took me seriously. So I just joined this other class and well, the teacher kicked me out for something silly and apparently that I sucked. I do not even think I am bad! I am more capable to express my emotions unlike before. So I went ahead to join this acting group and they did not accept me. Apparently my IMDB credits are weak, they want more advanced actors.

So I keep being judged and judged, from accent, to looks, to IMDB credits. I do not think I am a bad actress just because of lack of IMDB credits! But nobody accepts me, it drives me so, so depressed, you cannot imagine. Please someone out there to help me...",16Jun2019,3

40,"I'll keep it short.

I'm from UK. I've been let go from work due to downsizing in December and since then I've applied to 75 jobs, from what I did before to a simple cleaner. Not a single reply back. Not one. I've used up all my savings when I was taking care of my terminaly ill mother 2 years ago. I've applied for benefits twice and was denied twice. I have no living family. 

Currently I am in debt to my council £1200 and I've been summoned to court on July 4th. I did not pay my rent this month because I only have £31 in my bank account. 

I've cancelled Netflix and internet in general 5 months ago (using library internet). I've tried selling stuff and clothes online but no one wanted them. 

It seems like the universe itself does not want to help me and I am utterly done. I have no other options, only £31 to my name and debt I cannot pay. 

I now truly believe that some of us were born to fail in this lifetime and maybe next one will be a bit more gentle. I'll hang on for another 2 weeks, til July 4th.",16Jun2019,11
41,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 23(f) and I moved out from my narc step-father in August after living with him my entire life. I have a bipolar alcoholic mother that met my dad through prostitution but now lives several states away and I only visit about twice a year. My older sisters from her don’t talk to me (they live in 4 hours away) and my older step brothers “forget”to invite me to family functions now that I don’t speak to my step dad. I have struggled with depression for years but have been seeing a therapist since October and taking zoloft since December. I’ve lost a lot of weight, gone to ACA meetings (adult children of alcoholics), have friends and recently started graduate school for social work. I’m self supporting and have had a waitressing job for five years now. I’ve been trying to exercise more, eat healthy (weight watchers), reconnect with my higher power, drink less, budget, have a goal to work towards (graduate school), practice mindfulness, got in my first relationship and lost my virginity to a sweet guy (23m) and have been together for only 2 months. But yesterday narc step father and I got in an argument and made me want to kill myself. I tried to reach out for the sake of the family but it backfired so hard AGAIN. I feel so alone and I’m tired of being tired. Like my hard work means nothing. I’ve worked so hard but still find myself crying over this asshole. Will it ever end? How do you cope?

42,"Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone could possibly help me in what I should do in my situation.. I'm a 16 year old girl and have been struggling with mental illness nearly my whole life. Recently I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and in the past with generalized anxiety and social anxiety (although the therapist who recently diagnosed me says she thinks I have MDD with anxious tendencies or something, but not GAD). Anyway, I was curious as to if I should write a note to my mom trying to explain how I'm feeling. An hour or so ago, I completely blew up at her without reason and every time she asked what was wrong I would only respond with ""I don't know"" because, in all honesty, I don't know what's wrong. This has happened before but it doesn't happen often. I don't know why I am the way I am and I admit sometimes my emotions distort any logical thinking. So, I looked up my symptoms and found something about intermittent explosive disorder. Of course I don't rely 100% on everything I read online nor do I self-diagnose, but the symptoms (anger without provocation, tremors, palpitations, shouting, temper tantrums) are mostly all what I was experiencing. And now I just feel so stupid and embarrassed because it was all for nothing, I yelled at my mom who lives her day to day life taking care at me and that's what I gave her in return. So, should I write her a note about it (I'm very bad at explaining things through words) and about possibly talking to my therapist about IED?? I'm mostly asking on here because I feel like trying to talk to her about it makes me look like an attention seeker, so I wanted some unbiased opinions. Thanks in advance.",16Jun2019,2
43,"I have always had this feeling that I’d be happier once I found my “soulmate” but I’m starting to worry, what if I don’t find anyone? I have severe depression. I’ve thought many times about killing myself but I’m to scared of going to hell. I used to have many friends and then they all abandoned me in middle school. They became popular and now have tons of friends and I’m just a loser nobody ever wants to talk to. I’ve always dreamed of having someone who loves me and getting a boyfriend. I recently had a boyfriend and as soon as I started dating him I freaked out and broke up with him. We weren’t meant for each other at all but the thought of a relationship freaked me out. I’m just wondering if I will ever find someone who I will never get tired of and whole will make me laugh and who will always have something fun to talk about. I just want to not be unhappy or dig myself in a deeper hole. I’m 15 and I found someone online who I could possibly see myself being with. He never knew my age because it wasn’t on my Instagram bio. We talked on the phone and texted everyday and we always had the best conversations. He lit up my life when I needed it the most. But he’s 20 and lives two states over. He recently deleted his Instagram and hasn’t posted anything on his Facebook in a while. It worries me because he’s an actor and you’d think that would require him to keep a good media presence encase of possible scouts checking out his Instagram. I’m worried that I lost contact with the one guy who made me feel amazing. And I know he’s not going to be single for 3 years until I turn 18. So I’m scared to say the least",16Jun2019,6
44,"I’ve been suffering from depression for 4 years now. That means spending a lot of time in my room. The whole day in fact. I don’t wake up till 3 pm and go to sleep at 5 am during the summer. I spent a lot of time watching movies and listening to a lot of music from every genre. People are normally surprised at how much I know of movies and music. It’s made me see a lot. I’ve traveled the world through movies and lived different lived through music. I have discovered beauty, hurt, lose and pain. I’ve become a person. I’ve become me. Depression, you have taken a lot from me but you’ve given me the gifts of art. Sure you’ve made me hate my body, myself, other people, and the world but you made me discover an outlet to escape into. One day I hope we can part for good. I’ll never forget what you’ve done to me, but I’ll also never forget what you’ve given to me. Thank you",16Jun2019,18
45,"So I've been depressed since I was a kid and just kind of dealt with it because everything I have tried that cost money (therapy and  meds) has never helped me. I know that it may have just been the doctor I was referred to but I don't have the money to ""shop"" for help. I don't have health insurance so really therapy and meds are not an option (thanks US health care!). I am not suicidal. I do everything I can to try to be happy. Meditation,  exercise, reading, work, rest. I don't have negative thoughts for the most part but I am tired of feeling empty,  lost,  bored of life. The things that I used to enjoy no longer bring me joy. I feel as if I'm going through the motions of life but not really grasping the joy of it. I really cannot afford help. I barely scrape by as is. In addition I live in the middle of nowhere so there are no training clinics or really anything out here. I called 211 and the closest help I can get is 300 miles away. What can I do to help myself?",16Jun2019,2
46,"    I remember during the school year, I posted about something with depression and about me- but in the end, I never had depression-just Anxiety and stress?

     And now that I’m “graduated” from high school, it’s time for the next step right? College. And with that, an SAT score is needed (though I find SAT ridiculously un needed). And I guess, in my application my SAT score was alright, but they told me my math score wasn’t high enough- and they told me I needed to take the Accuplacer test (or just the math one) and MY MOM WONT STOP BOTHERING ME ABOUT IT! (My dad I ain’t innocent either!) and I’m about to cut myself at this point- today she already made me cry myself alone in the closset, she was trying to break down my door so she could beat me with a stick, just because I asked “please stop.”

     She doesn’t litsen to anything I say, every time she brings up this topic, I’m just about lost my patients, I kindly tell her to, “please stop.” But does she? No, she gets even more mad. She yells at me, screams at me by telling me how un great full I am, how their doing everything for me and I’m not being greatful. And that I don’t want to go to college!” 

For what? Because I said please stop!? 

I’ve just about had it. At this point, I’m about to run away somewhere in the woods, or freaking start cutting myself. I don’t know how to contain my stupid anger anymore. She’s been doing this for SO LONG AND IVE HAD IT!

PLEASE HELP, JUST SOMEONE JUST DO SOMETHING PLEASE!",16Jun2019,4
