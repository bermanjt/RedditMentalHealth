2,"Hello! Recently I came to realisation that I'm possibly suffering from depression, though I'm not sure about that. For major reasons I can't visit any therapist in a month. What should I (not) do in that timespan to make it better/not make it worse?

9,I've been separated from her for over a year now. We was originally dsting for 6 months. I loved her. Genuinely and she loved me. And I've never lived anyone before so it was a big thing for me. Anyway a lot of arguments started appearing and she told me she felt like it wasn't working. So I responded quite stupidly. Let's break up. I didn't want to but I could see she wasn't happy anymore and I didn't want to drag her down with me. I had become very upset in the last month of our relationship and I started drinking and doing drugs. I became distant. After this I felt like shit and tried to fix things. I went to her hosue and we talked for a bit. She asked if this was the last time that we would ever spend time together. Some thing in them words killed me inside and so I went to were she kept her prescription pills and tried taking as many as I could. She stopped me and made me leave. I was outside the door until she said she would call the police if I didn't leave. Just to clarify I know what I did was wrong and I've apologized and we are all good now. But skip almost a year later and I still love her. I still want to be with her. I'm not happy unless I'm with her she's been with people and so have i but I never loved them and they all ended sooner or later. I want this girl to be with me again and she always says maybe. But it's killing me. I don't really know what to do and I feel like my life is just getting worse and worse and I'm losing relationships with everyone around me because I'm just a hateful person now. I see her quite reguslry but we never talk. Every couple of months she calls me. She has me blocked on most things. She doesn't hate me or anything but I'm not sure she loves me. I want her so much. But I want to be happy again. Please if anyone can give me some advice I'll take it because I can't bare living like this anymore. Everytime I see her I get a pain in my stomach and I feel like I'm better off not being here anymore. Thank your for reading this. Any other questions about this feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer.,17Dec2019,1

11,"This is mostly a rant but I do kinda need atleast some advice here.

Life is just a bitch to me alot because whenever I try t ok make some kind of play the most unexpected thing happens and I'm just at a loss, cause of this I now have a few new habits. 1. I keep my mouth shut alot, I've been bullied to a point of crying from both physical and emotional pain and neither time did I want any one to know it pay any mind and made sure no one told a teacher or anything. 2. I've become alot more blunt with how I am with people I'm close to, this is a bit odd and honestly kinda fun since it keeps me from trying to wait forever for something that's isn't going to happen or for others to do something, BUT now I'm more impatient and I feel forgotten alot faster since I'm not thinking to myself about it much. 3. I'm trying to give up trying to plan stuff out because when I do I get screwed up at the very start or before I can do anything with said plans and that's has fed directly into my near crippling fear of the uncertainty that is the future. This is what I need help with, I'm legit terrified of the future at all and honestly with how impatient I have become after already being patient for another person for 4 years I'm pretty sure ima fuck something up. If you've got any advice on how I maybe able to cope or deal with that or maybe just some reassuring quotes then that would be greatly appreciated.",17Dec2019,1
12,I have depression and anxiety and have basically accepted that I will be repeating this year of uni. I haven't studied for my test in 5hrs because I don't see the point in trying to help when I'll just do bad anyway. However should i still show up for the test so it'll look better for the university that I at least showed up?,17Dec2019,1
13,I've been feeling better recently. I haven't cut in 2 months. I was finally opening up to a friend of mine and we're becoming really close. His therapist had him take a test for his depression. The worst you can get is 27. 20 is considered severe. He got a 24. I have personally scored a 23 but didn't tell anyone. He's being taken to a mental health hospital. He will be forced to stay 3-7 days and he's on suicide watch. I'm really freaking out and i can feel my anxiety and depression creeping back up. I'm afraid I'll cut again and I don't know what to do,17Dec2019,1
14,"My parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. 

It's been like this for me basically forever, I've constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldn't do, things I must seek out, thinks I can't touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and I'm sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that that's been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I don't know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because I've never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was ""more obligated"" to make decisions for me instead of myself and now I'm a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. 

But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th-8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out  of fear of being judged for being ""weird"" or ""awkward"" eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person I'd have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.

Now that I've been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else it'll just not make any sense when the person I'm talking to finally hears my response. Or I'll hesitate while talking and then it'll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I can't piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. I've slowly became more and more self aware at how many times I've had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think I'm crazy by now.

I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when I'm at work and the person who's talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like I'm not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 9/10 times I'm simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I don't talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda don't even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like it's getting really difficult to make a conversion work when I'm a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable.

I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever. Being in the presence of anyone makes my life significantly more difficult, like I have to play a role in front of them so I can't be judged for being myself.",17Dec2019,1

17,"I’ll try to keep this brief: basically i self-harmed a lot from age 12 to 16 or so, with very few incidents since. Im 19 now and, dont know what to do. I have tried every single anti-depression medication on the market (starting around age 13ish) with basically complete failure. Some stuff would “work” for a bit, but then i would feel worse, or just numb, which in turn made me more suicidal. Literally the last time i was hospitalized they basically said they couldn’t help me, at all, so i went off all medication, and actually felt better than before after a little withdrawal.

I also have adhd, anxiety, and ptsd so that doesn’t help my situation. I’ve tried therapy and idk maybe i just wasn’t with the right therapist? But that was no help.

Basically I feel like shit, but i dont think I’ll kill myself, at least not for a long time, but im afraid i might fall back into my old coping mechanisms if i dont so something, but i have no idea what to do. I got away from my parents, I’m in a healthy environment but i still cant enjoy life. I haven’t enjoyed much as long as i can remember. I just want to be content with my life and find the occasional joy in things.

21,"... found that I was doing things to increase it, and then stopped ding those things. I was:

1. keeping it inside, hiding the feelings

2. drinking to feel better

3. avoiding dealing with feelings (I thought they were silly or not valid)

I found a free counselor and began spilling my guts. It cut my depression in half just letting it out. I avoided alcohol and started feeling physically and mentally better -- happy for once. Then I found a cheap therapist and she is pointing me in the right direction. I'm almost there! You can do it too.   


Step one -- find a couple of things you can do to reduce unnecessary stress that causes depression. Two: get help. Cheap or free therapy is still therapy!",17Dec2019,1

Context: my father lost everything and thougt life wasn't worth living anymore when i was 13. 

I've seen first hand what taking your own life can do to a family but i dont know how much more of this i can take, and for thst i feel like a failure and pathetic.

Maybe a bit more context that i feel so much like shit is that i never really had much of a childhood after the age of 11 because i got diagnosis that i had inflammatory bowel disease and missed most of my school life, lost my friends, never got to go out as a teenager and make memories. All i have done is be sick and laid in my bed. And now im suppose to be an adult and get a job, because of my illnes i could not an education so even finding a job is already hard af.

30,"I posted this personal story and examples as a comment in response to another person commenting for help. I felt that it was pretty generalized to fit anyone going through it. That and I'm always overly specific and laid out what I've done to pick myself up out of the lowest lows: 

&amp;#x200B;

At 23 (currently 25) I had just lost my father to cancer (my best friend/ role model/ confidant), was completely broken by college and the feelings of inferiority even though I graduated, isolated myself from everyone I knew, and tried drinking myself to death and was suicidal. 

Then I final bottomed and realized that if I wanted to live, I needed to change. The first step is the hardest, but its actually doing something about it even though your brain is screaming at you saying there is nothing you can do and even if you do something it won't matter. Baby steps are key, and things won't change overnight. 

I started seeing a therapist, didn't work out/didn't feel like they were helping so I kept searching till I found the right one. Now I see my psychologist once a month, and fully trust her with everything and feel comfortable and open about saying anything. That and I found out I had manic depression rather than just depression, so I have been working on my medications for 2 years and finally just got a good combination/type that works.

After getting a DUI because I was entirly apathetic about my own life and any others, I stopped drinking and doing drugs (mind you I'm also an alcoholic and was introduced to rehab therapy groups/support groups through the court system). Alcohol and most drugs are depressants, stop taking them into your body as it only makes things work. And if you can't stop then reach out and ask for help because there are so many resources out there and people who understand all over the map. 

If your job makes you hate life like mine did for 1.5 years after school ( 2 different full time jobs in that span), start small and download a job app like glassdoor/indeed/ziprecruiter. Again, baby steps help and trying to do one small thing in a day, a week, a month like get your resume looked over/tightened up, put an application out there, etc. You spend more time around people at work than anywhere else, so surround urself with people who don't suck ass, gossip, and are constantly negative/poor influencers. 

For your personal life, try getting back into hobbies you haven't involved yourself with in a while (art therapy and video games have been huge for me). Try putting yourself out in the dating world if you haven't already tried. Plenty of apps out there with a low rate of no-ones likes me/ I must be ugly thoughts to creep in. Tinder (rough, but fun at times), Bumble (little better), and for me Hinge has been cool cause if you like someone you can basically just shoot them a message if you think it would be fun to go out sometime. Even if it doesn't pan out, realize you're still putting yourself out there and getting out and doing something. Literally anything and everything is better than isolating and being trapped in your own mind. The longer you sit, the further down tangents your mind can go, and trust me I have gone all the way down the rabbit hole and it isn't Wonderland at the end. 

Biggest and easiest takeaway is try something/anything, ask for help (it feels impossible, but its like lifting an elephant off your back once the words come out), and every morning/night b4 bed, right 5 different things you are grateful for (people, places, things, literally anything that comes to mind), and after those things you are grateful for do a self reflection on your day in a journal (I have a paperback &amp; I use the app Daylio to differentiate what I've done and how it made me feel with generalized daily mood and events that correlated to it) 

I hope this helped, know you are loved, and feel free to reach out it you need help or want someone to talk to.",17Dec2019,1
31,"yoyoyo guys and girls I have been depressed a looong time. Been in hospital twice and have taken various meds. I have some tips that are actually easy and may help you a little bit. These are all easy and small but can help snap out of it on a really bad day.

1) try to get up and brush your teeth and splash your face with water. I know sometimes doing this is hard but you can do this. If you’re feeling crazy also wash ur pits.

2) put on some music. I know you may not feel interested in doing it but just do it. Music can help with your mood even when you don’t think it will. 

3) if you have any samples from beauty products, use them. I get many from my parents and friends, I also ask for them. I don’t have the money for the products but using a fancy shampoo or creme of whatever can make me feel better and fancy afterwards. Collect samples if you like this stuff, they can be fun.

4) Get dressed. You’re more likely to stay in bed and at home when you’re not dressed. Put on some clothes!

5) go to the store and get a treat. Going outside is hard often but if you need a reason to go, go to the store and buy something you want (like a snack) to treat yourself for getting ready and going out.

I know it aint much but when you are really low  these tips may help. 

The hardest thing is just doing it. I often have no motivation but these are so small and don’t take any time at all so JUST DO IT. 

If you have more small easy tips please share.",17Dec2019,1

Yesterday, my mom and sister took me to dinner to catch up with each other. I wanted to take that opportunity to open up to them about my recent struggles with self-harm and negative thoughts. It has been bad. Long story short, the severity of these thoughts outweigh any positivity I have left in me. I've sought help and currently doing frequent appointments with my doctor. I think it's a start and I cannot wait to finally overcome this ordeal.

Please allow me to rant regarding the dismissive attitude of my sister toward this illness. All I wanted was to tell them. I was not expecting any form of help, no advice, nothing. Just the fact that I seriously thought I was going to at least feel better even for that just 2 hours we were out to dinner but surprisingly, I didn't.

My sister had it to a point to bluntly tell me that I am being coddled. That all these feelings are just feelings and it's not as deadly as cancer. That all I have to do is as simple as thinking positively. Her tone was condescending, her attitude was dismissive, and she completely downplayed everything I've opened up about. I could tolerate that maybe she does not care, but all she had to was to *believe* me. I wake up every single day with zero motivation, no zest and the desire to give up my dog to someone else then harm myself is strong.

I am extremely angry and frustrated at her until now. I accept that people have different opinions but all I ever wanted was them to not solve this crisis for me, but for them to just *listen.* They've asked me a few times about this and come the time I told them, I was met with, not an extreme reaction but an unwelcoming response, nonetheless. I wish I could just describe what I think and feel every single day into words but it's tedious. The only reason why I do not open up to my friends and family about this is I do not want to put a damper on anyone else's day. This whole ordeal is so negative I fear people are going to stay away from me once aware of my situation.

I don't expect anyone listening to me to act like my psychologist, but I just wanted someone to listen to me. My sister's attitude has completely crushed my hope and faith in my healing.",17Dec2019,1

Hey guys, so I have this friend who is very dear to me. When I have relationship problems or anything bothering me, I would always talk to her. And vice versa, if she was having relationship issues or troubles at work I would give her advice or things from my past experience. And I apologize, here’s a little context we’ve been working at the same job for the past five or six years, been really good friends for the past five years and we used to talk really often, but lately she has been depressed and I haven’t heard from her as much. I’ve reached out to her a lot though, either text or phone call. When I do hear from her it’s kind of short and I just sounds like there’s a dark cloud over her. I think she’s having issues with her relationship because she has Trust issues. Honestly I think the guy that she dates is not on her level and I told her that all the time. But no matter how much I tell her she still deals with him. I stop telling her because it’s up to her she already knows how I feel about it. Well I’m on here to ask about what I can do for her. I’ve given her my advice ok depression because I’ve dealt with it in the past.   And what worked for me was cutting out toxic people, I ended a mentally abusive relationship and focusing on goals, small goals that led to my biggest goal ( buying my first house on my own ).   What I just said was what I told her. I told her to set small goals that are working towards a bigger goal. Every time you accomplish a little goal step back look at the big picture and see that you’re making progress toward something. I told her she should cut out toxic people because you don’t need anyone in your life like that no matter how hard it might be to break it off in time you will feel a lot better and it will be good for you.  Was just seeing if anyone had any other suggestions or advice I could forward to my friend. She’s a great person, a hard worker and has had some bad relationships that she didn’t deserve.

We work together and he can till I get my work done but I’m falling about everyday a little bit more . I’m going to contact my doctor but he does just write my prescriptions. I’m just rather lost what to do. I’m ugly crying and having a hard time keeping it together at work. I had one “bad thought” yesterday and was instant guilt and shame and just hurts more that I see myself going down the hole and I’m trying to cling on to something so I don’t reach the bottom but I’m scared .,17Dec2019,1

42,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm too depressed to do anything. I can't even get up and water my houseplants. My Bonsai tree has died and I'm too sad to throw it out. Even my cacti are dying, and they don't even need a lot of water. I lay in bed all day and do nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm living in a crappy city where I have no friends and where everyone is bitter and mean.",17Dec2019,1
43,"I need some help. Some advice. Anything. I’m broken. I’m severely depressed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been taking meds for the past month and a half now. They aren’t working. I’m starting to shut down again for like the 15th time in my life and crumble and fall apart. I can barely keep it together at work and do my job and I’m getting hella shit from my boss for it. All I want to do is just be at home and be by myself. I’m extremely suicidal man and sometimes it really makes me tear up. I’m so existential. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. Everything is gray to me. I’m becoming so sad that I’m LOSING my MIND. Like have you ever just felt like you were going crazy? Everyday I just feel like my heart is breaking and I’m losing my mind. The main thing I’m focused on right now is switching my meds out with something else. The psychiatrist I saw recommended I wait until January to change medication because she wants me to still give it a chance. At this point though, medication is my only hope because that’s the only thing that’s going to save me.",17Dec2019,1
44,"This month marks the ten year anniversary of when I can remember first feeling depressed. I was 12 and didn't quite understand what depression was. I just knew I was sad, and that there wasn't seemingly a reason for it. I told myself it'll pass, and in a few weeks in the new year I'd be happy again. I was sure of it. A few weeks passed, and I only felt more sad. Sad at the fact that I was still sad. Sad I was alive. Just sad. I started to think about how I wouldn't care if somethinf happened to me that would cause me to die. I recognized that that probably isn't normal thinking for a 12 year old, but what did it matter? Nothing felt like it mattered, so why should that? I was in 7th grade at the time of this, and two years later, shortly after turning 14 and entering high school, i started getting bullied. It wasn't as bad as other kids I've heard about. Heck, we watched videos about bullying in middle school, and I felt like what I was going through was nothing compared to them. But it still hurt. And it made me even more depressed. Why should I feel so hurt over what I was going through when there are plenty of kids that have to go through so much worse? But when you already feel like you have no worth, and then practically being shown by others that you have no worth, honestly just sucks. And then this is when things really took a turn for the worse. I was 14 years old, not even half way through my first year of highschool, and I was already willing to say goodbye to the world. It wasn't my normal, I wouldn't exactly care if I died, type of thinking. It was taking a bottle of pills to my room at night after my parents and siblings went to sleep type of thinking. I legitimately did not want to make it to another year, just for things to get worse. I wrote a letter for my family and kept it with me every night, hoping I'd finally just end my life and end my pain.",17Dec2019,1
