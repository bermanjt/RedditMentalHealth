1,"I have recently been told the reason I’m persistently depressed despite medication and time for over 7 years, with one episode of hypomania tied with dissociation events I get more frequently than hypomania, I have dysthymia, but along with that depression and generalised anxiety disorder and avoidant personality.  I don’t really want to continue, I just hope anyone I leave behind knows I did love them. Just never myself.",13Apr2019,1
2, Never had any friends in my life. Never even felt that I need to be friends with someone. The only thing that bothers me is the people that judge me for not having anybody. Is it normal not to have any friends? What do others really of someone like that? Why does it bother me then?,13Apr2019,1
3,"I have a tendency to not be able to let go of people and all negative past that's associated with them. It seems that I am even obsessing about them and depend on their view of my life. However, I am not ever showing signs of any negativity or anything that might be hurtful to them, I just try to ignore them and to avoid any type of contact with them because inside I am ranging from anger, excitement, and I become a pile of mess for a long period of time only because I saw them somewhere.

4,"Hi... I don't really know how to start this... obligatory ""I'm on mobile"".. also I'm a bit descriptive, not good at English.... etc etc warnings

So, a few years ago I started to see a therapist after trying to cut my throat with a razor, then trying to jump out a 3rd story window, then almost walking right in front of a car. In and out of the hospital a lot. I was diagnosed with depression, as well as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 1. Don't forget gender dysphoria. My medications for all of these things make me feel like I'm sick. Like I'm just a thing to be dragged around, like I don't have a choice. Everyone will hate me if I go outside, everyone will hate me if I stay in. My arms and thighs are covered in scars. I hate them, I hate myself, I hate my body. I'm not supposed to have this body. In an attempt to find something to love or to love me, something I could live for, I have found people are physically and emotionally draining, and I can't be relied on to take care of pets. I can't find any reason to wake up in the morning, and after an incident (sexual, don't want to talk about it), I've had no reason to get up. I see constant hallucinations and I sometimes don't eat for days. I know I need some way to stay alive. I am not scared of death, but I'm wasting oxygen and I feel like I'm in debt to the world to do something. I know I'm not supposed to think like this. I know I'm not supposed to be like this.
I'm sorry for the long post. I don't mean to waste your time.",13Apr2019,1
5,"Every day is torture, I am constantly ridiculed with thoughts of worthlessness and suicide. I feel like all I do injure people, waste time and money, and only am a hindrance to those around me. I have no support, have no one to talk to, have no social skills or friends, no skills. I am so lonely. I have no one to blame but myself. And yet I am constantly told to not kill myself, that things will get better, and the human body is surprisingly resilient when it comes to dying. Everyone ""wants"" me to live, but it truly does not matter if I do. It hurts so much. I see no reason to not end my life.",13Apr2019,3
6,"I've started to notice that I have extremely self destructive tendencies when things are at their worst for me. Sometimes it will hit me out of nowhere and I just want to start burning bridges with people who closest to me. It's like I know what I'm doing. But at the same time I can't stop myself. I ignore them, I don't want to be around them, I barely want to talk to them. I want to burn the bridge to bad they'll leave my life forever. It's not because I want them to ""fight for me"". I genuinenly want them to fuck off and I want to go back to being a recluse. I don't know why I do this. I don't really know what I'm asking for at this point.

7,"Depression is a particularly nasty disease because it has such limited visibility. I can tell my best friend about some of the physical side effects and they can sympathize with that to an extent, they can’t comprehend the connection between my body breaking down and an ever worsening mental state. I’ve attempted suicide before, something they’re aware of, in an attempt to just escape from the pain, and as this depressive funk I’ve been in is worsening, I am trying to explain to my friend what exactly is happening inside my mind. And my words cannot do it justice. So I’m asking you all, are there books, movies, paintings, speakers, anything that was able to describe what is happening to you in a way that felt truthful? I need to find some way to show him what’s happening without romanticizing it or only looking at the surface level issue. Thank you for any help you can give me.",13Apr2019,1
9,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. I just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile.",13Apr2019,38
10,"I'm undiagnosed, but I'm almost certainly suffering from depression. Both of my parents have suffered with depression, if that means anything.

.

I don't want to live, and deal with suicidal ideation a lot, but I can't convince myself that I should commit suicide (too lazy and stubborn, plus I don't want to screw up my 11yo sister).

.

I'm incredibly dumb, and before you think ""maybe she's not..."", I am *incredibly* dumb. 

At work, I have managed to screw up **correct** work and waste time (because I'm dumb).

.

I don't have a motivation to do anything, and I'm not good at anything that I can think of. 

So I can't really quit my job (I'll probably be fired soon though, because I'm a pain to such fantastic people), because I don't have anything that I would be able to do.

So all of the people that told me I was dumb, who bullied me, were all right.

.

Also, I'm almost certain that I'm a trans woman. I wouldn't have any support (bigoted family and no friends).

My family have been incredibly bigoted to me, for as long as I can remember.

Telling me, when I was 11/12, that they would never accept a gay son -- monkey's paw, I guess (bi trans daughter); refusing to let me paint my nails; forcing me to have my hair cut... the generic verbally abusive shit.

.

Also, I do have a therapist, who I see for an hour on Mondays, but there's so much to talk about that it's overwhelming.

.

**TL;DR** I'm dumb (useless), deal with suicidal ideation, and Bi &amp; Trans with bigoted family.

11,"A few days ago I deleted my social media apps as it was becoming quite toxic. I also increased my meds today, on schedule. 

I am feeling so isolated and disconnected. I feel like because I’m not active on social media I don’t exist. 

None of my friends or family have reached out to me to see where I’ve gone. 

It’s stressful. I guess I just need some advice on how to handle this transition period of becoming basically non-existent",13Apr2019,7
12,"I’m just so off. I don’t feel right in the head. I feel so dumb all the time. I used to be a smart kid, what the hell happened? 

I can’t even talk to people. What do people even talk about, how do you get started? Even new people at work make friends with each other, but I feel like they all think I’m just weird or perhaps a bitch simply because I’m so awkward and probably say the wrong thing all the time, or maybe I just don’t say anything when I should. 

I’m so clumsy too. Like REALLY clumsy. Constantly spilling things, hurting myself, fumbling especially when I know I’m being watched. 

I don’t know who I am. I feel like I have no personality, so sense of individuality. I find myself trying to mimic others so I can have a personality but it always backfires. If I were to truly be myself I feel like I’d be a 22-year-old 7 year old. Maybe I miss being a kid that much, like I want to go back and fix it. I know I didn’t have an awesome childhood, neither of my parents were people I could look up to. No role models. 

I’m just so bad at life. I don’t know how to be normal, sometimes it feels like there’s no way to fix it and I wanna just leave for good.

13,"I know i have a few people to talk too and i know i have some of my family and a couple of friends that love me, but i still just feel so alone. 

Does anyone else feel like they can't talk to anyone about how they are feeling because the other person will think that it's a stupid reason for you may be feeling that  way. 

Okay well first ill say I'm 28 and single. Now. 
A few months back, my mom and i were talking about the possibility of my brother and his girl being pregnant. (They weren't, but there were signs that they could be).
He is 2 years younger than I am. When my mom and i talked about my brother, i kind of started crying. She looked at me like i was crazy and asked what happened. I told her i would be happy for him and would love my niece/nephew more than anything in this world, but it would hurt so bad if they really were going to have a baby. She looked at me and kinda giggled and said that is not a good reason to be crying and depressed. That really hurt me. Since then i just can't seem to come back from my depressed episode. 
Since i was a little girl i had always dreamt of being married and having kids. Now it just seems like that's all it was a dream because the last time i had a boyfriend i was 15. 

I just feel like i can't talk to my parents about this. Or my bestfriends. One is married with kids and the other engaged. I am absolutely over the moon happy for them. It's just i don't really have them to talk to any more. 

I don't know, it's hard. I don't know how to come back from this feeling of severe loneliness. It hurts so bad and all the time.",13Apr2019,5
14,"Just really depressed and anxious. BF of 7 years went through a bad year last year. He’s an alcoholic and did some pretty bad things and we broke up on and off. When we broke up he would kick me out of the house. Like, I’d go to my sisters house and when I got home I wouldn’t be allowed in. I’m on the deed, but the cops couldn’t force him to let me in. Anyways, every time we broke up hed lock me out with nowhere to go. And keep our daughter from me bc he didn’t like my options as far as where I was staying. I don’t even have a front door key right now. 
Probably an unpopular opinion but since we got back together I kind of refuse to pay my half of the mortgage. He makes 3x as me and I am paying my way through school. I will buy whatever we need day to day. Anything tangible. I have bought any big purchase that comes up. 
But I can’t shake the feeling that I had last year when I felt homeless. Locking me out of the house and forcing me to go into a shelter. He only let me see my daughter bc “she really needs to see a doctor, she hasn’t been breathing right for a week”.
I make 25k a year. I have student loan debt. I tried to buy a house but I can’t bc of my income and plus they take into account my student loan debt. I can’t get an apartment bc I have to make 3x as much as rent and I make a couple hundred less on paper (I’m a server).
So now we are fighting bc when we were broken up he claimed my daughter. I’m doing my taxes today and he expects to get it. I’m saving it just in case we break up again. Even if it’s 10 months from now. If i have 3k to put down on an apartment they’d probably look past my income a little bit. 
I just got a second job and right now I work 7 days a week. I pay for everything day to day in this house. I have bought 3 area rugs, 2 entertainment centers, threw the bday party for our daughter, bought a couch, etc etc. I give my bf money for day to day things.  Because at the end of the day, i can’t forget the feeling of having nowhere to go. Not having access to any of my things and not being able to see my daughter. I am not trying to be a free loader. 
I want this relationship to work but if he ever wakes up and starts strangling me again, or walks into our daughters room naked and touching his penis while blacked out, I don’t want to feel trapped. If i don’t have money I have to go to a shelter and he will keep my daughter from me. Maybe I’d win custody in the long run, but he’d have her for 180 days to himself. I just want my tax return as an emergency plan.",13Apr2019,1
15,"I'm 17 and am in my first year of 'further study' doing A-levels after graduating secondary/high school. I have always been 'anxious', blowing things out of proportion in my head which anyone who suffers similarly would understand becomes a 'life-altering' thought when it keeps circulating and you can't do anything about it. My parents split when I was 10, but my Dad is my role model, he is incredible and I honestly don't know how I'd carry on without him. I don't get on as well with my mum due to the fact that we are different people but she is irrational and unfair with her comments and requests 3/4 of the time and in a house where I am the oldest amongst my sisters and her I get the anger and blame pointed at me for anything and everything that happens.

Recently I have begun to feel very isolated and have realised that I have fallen out of love with life generally. I don't wake up and get excited or feel happy about anything other than my girlfriend. We haven't known each other very well but she is also incredible and supportive and we have serious chemistry to the point where I am wanting to consider a futue with her, as is she. I haven't been diagnosed but my anxiety becomes very depressive and I have serious emptiness and blank feelings which were terrifying but also comforting at the same time. I talked to a counsellor on and off for 3/4 months a couple months back but to be honest they don't really come up with any kind of solutions or support even though I was very forthcoming and open.

I thought that going into 6th form would make me feel free and happy after GCSE's (which I managed to pass all of btw) but it hasn't 3/4 of the people in my 6th form are toxic and I can't stand being around them. To sum it up the main words I'd use are: self-obsessed, fake, boring and selfish. I've looked at other options but it's only a ten minute walk from my house and makes the most sense, I'm not sure I could handle a transition now anyway. I'm starting to struggle with my studies as I simply can't focus. It's not that I don't care, it's that I physically can't in class and I had a near panic attack in class recently which I have never experienced before, even though I have a year left out of two of these studies until my final exams.

The only things at the minute keeping me going are my dad, girlfriend and interests like football and my rediscovery of pokemon which I grew up with and was absolutely obsessed with until I was about 9/10. Watching videos online of the games and cards make me really happy and idk why. I have gone for a couple of jobs and had an interview at a coffee place about a month ago which went well and which the manager and my friends and parents told me I'd get, only to find out 2 weeks later than promised that the position had been filled, and I'm not socially awkward but doing that took a lot out of me and has really affected me. My family have never been rich and I've moved house about 5/6+ times in a richer area of the country and feel like my future is constantly uncertain, all I want to do right now is see my girlfriend (but shes away for a week) or lie in my bed and watch youtube. Money has always been an issue and I'm by no means spoilt as I don't ever take or get hand outs from family or friends, and so I'm trying to sell my pet lizard which I saved up over £200 for (half from family for birthday/christmas) in order to get money which I'm upset about, I only have £20/$25 to my name and I save my money which I feel says something.

I think that's everything, I would be extremely grateful for any form of constructive response, I just don't know where to go from here, I just know that I can't lose my girlfriend as a fault of my own or my dad because that would be the absolute end of the road for me.",13Apr2019,1
16,"**Just a bit of context first:** my ex Girlfriend broke off with me 3 months ago because of her major clinical depression. I fully accepted her decision and told her that I still supported her. I told her that the depression didn't really change anything between us. She loves me more than anything but broke off because of feeling awful for ""not giving me what I deserve"", wanting me to ""live a happy life and not be dragged into her mess"" ect. Over the last 3 months we saw each other a couple of times and it was always really honest between us. I always reminded her, that I was there for her, even when she canceled on me last minute for feeling too low. 

**Now my concern:** after asking her if she wanted to catch up with me? She texted back saying that she doesn't think that it is a good idea, because she feels too low at the moment. She doesn't want me to experience the burden of her feeling low, whilst we speak. I responded by sending her a 2min voice message explaining that this was completely fine, I was still there for her and that I was doing well ect. Then I talked for a bit about what I was up to in the next couple of weeks.

Now, she has **not clicked on the message** in 3 days and I am asking myself: Could it be too much for her to even listen to my voice? Could she be scared that I badly responded? Does she feel awful when hearing from me? 

I am fine with this whole situation and I am not too worried, but sometimes these small things do confuse me a bit. **Does depression make you unable to even click on a voice-message from a loved one?**",13Apr2019,3
17,"I'm 28, I've never had a real relationship, I've never so much as kissed a girl I've had a crush on. People often come to me for advice and for support but often disappear from my life the moment they start feeling a bit better.

Yesterday I was told I may have asthma on top of the other fuck load of other chronic conditions I have, and the anxiety meds have been on for the past few years have probably been exasperating it. So I wanted to meet up with some friends and complain a little, but the entire night ended up being about focusing on everyone else's problems, and then I had to leave my friends to be on the phone for about 5 hours to a drunk suicidal friend trying to talk her out of doing anything she'd regret.

It just left me feeling that almost no one wants to help me when when I feel low. Honestly I just want someone to cuddle with when I'm down, but  every time I start getting hopeful about a girl something always happens, normally it seems its them getting bored of me, and it just feeds into the insecurities. Am i really that worthless, that the only thing I'm any good for is helping people with their suffering to be abandoned like a used bandage

18,"Hello, have posted here several times, both in support and seeking it, but today kind of hit like a ton of bricks.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a job where, well, abuse gets hurled at me on a daily, even hourly basis (I'm a bill collector at a call center).  And after a string of bad calls, I started trying to take steps to improve my life - namely, seeking better employment.  I'm a college dropout; I have some technical support experience as a Printer technician but beyond that my strengths are pretty much customer service related.

I looked around, and finding not much if anything where I'd be paid adequately to continue surviving the way I am now; I thought about something my roommates (two lawyers, an engineer, an IT/Webdesign professional and a teacher) had told me - getting work as a paralegal.  I looked into the courses necessary for certification, $5000 price tag.

I couldn't get approved for a baseline credit card from my bank, and my inheritance from my father ended up washed down the drain of life expenses as I went eight months without a job last year.  I'm unlikely to see that much money in my hands ever again, unless I go on a budgeting regimen that forces me to stay in the job I can't mentally handle the abuse from, et cetera et cetera.

It was at this point, I went to lunch and got a note from my roommates about a house meeting, specifically to discuss what we're going to do when our lease is up.

I owe almost $9000 to a property management company for screwing me on the lease of my old apartment.  I'm not sure I can \*get\* another place to live, considering that.  And our landlady is abjectly insane, threatening and refuses to do a great deal of maintenance on the place she's required to by law.  It's been hanging over my head that my roommates will want to find a new place, likely without me.

And at that point, I considered killing myself.  Clearly.  With either a sword I purchased with pride as a part of a sword school I was part of years ago, or a machete I keep in my room, given to me as a gift by a dear friend.  And the idea didn't disgust me; I didn't recoil or fall back into my usual mantra of such things as ""Your friends love you and you need to stay alive for them."" 

I thought, ""Well, it's a nice run.  I always figured I had come to this state to die.""

I'm scared.  Still at work right now; can't leave.  Forcing myself to complete the day; don't know how well I'll do once it's over.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm actually going to go through with anything, and I'm going to make plans for my roommates to take the weapons I know about and get them locked up or at least away from me.  I'm not sure what more I can do that will actually help me, and I honestly just feel like one of the people that some would say are ""meant to die or fail"" because I didn't pass some bar of requirement for continued existence as a human worth anything.

20,"I’ve struggled with depression since childhood. I’m now a junior in college and I feel the exact same I felt since about 5 years old. Every single day I feel like shit. I feel like I’m desperately trying to express how I feel but it can never come out correct. I’ve seen my school’s counselor regularly, but it seems like his only purpose is to let students rant to him and not actually help them. 

Every single days it’s a battle. I’m constantly trying to push away the suicidal thoughts, but it seems like the only logical path to take. I’ve tried almost everything and nothing helps. Even when I’m well fed, physically active, and social, I can’t keep the self destructing thoughts out of my head. 

At this point I’m starting to give up. I spend nearly all my time closed in my room to avoid the outside world. I’m starting to turn to drugs because it’s the only thing that allows me to escape myself. I so desperately want to end my life but I know my parents and brother would be hugely disappointed with me. I hardly eat anymore and have lost a ton of weight. My grades a dropping, and the adderall I take for add doesn’t help anymore. I am completely unable to focus in class and I have no motivation to complete assignments. 

I hope my time is near. There’s no reason for me to live if I constantly feel this way. I’ve tried my best to change but no matter what I do it cannot happen. I feel like I’m constantly crying for help but no one ever listens or cares.",13Apr2019,2

So I have a school club I'm desperately trying to start, I talked to my principal last year and after explaining he gave me the rule list and the document I'd have to fill out just to see if I could get approved. But you see, I've hit a road block and have for quite a while, it's been almost an exact year since I asked for the document, I'm only in school so long you know. My problem is finding a supervisor and getting a school facility for it to take place in. Of course, you can't help with that but, still being 15 and trying to run this club by myself with only my cousins help not even help from the school board is frustrating but, I refuse to give up. So, any ideas any thing would be of good use, thank you.

(Using burner)
Sorry if my grammar is bad and if I have spelling issues

Hey... I need some help, I am a male and I think I was taken advantage of when I was younger, I have never told anyone and this is the first time I am confronting it and writing it down somewhere, when I was younger in a middle-class neighborhood in the middle of nowhere. When I was younger my sister had a friend next door and she would go over there a lot but since I was a younger sibling I went there to. The place is hell to look at now, I would go over there and that’s when I met my abuser, he was considerably older than me and I was about 7-9 ish I don’t quite remember and he was about 17, I would go in his room and watch him play video games on his Tv. He then would take out his dick and show me this progressed more and more till he tried to make me suck it ( I had unknowingly been jacking him off all this time which during that he tried to make me eat his cum, I never did) I didn’t and the play date ended, next time I went back and he had me take my dick out and he just looked and then that play date ended. thank god my sister had a fight with her friend because I fear he would have done way more.



Today I am a teen and I am having a hard time coping and I feel like shit every time I reflect on it, I have thoughts like “what would happen if I kill myself” and stuff but I wouldn’t call myself overly depressed. the guy in awhile ago had stalked a celebrity and got caught and put in jail he got out a year ago and this has made it hard anytime someone brings up his name... 
I am just asking for some help, please if you know how to help, I have been to a therapist only once and it was for ‘anger issues’ or something like that.",13Apr2019,1
28,"2 years ago me and my ex split up, and few days after (when it finally sunk in) I almost committed suicide. After she talked me down we went about our lives and moved on. 

Today I have decided I will do it. I have set some rules for myself just to make sure it's not just a in the moment thing. 

Rule 1: I have to wait until the end of summer.

Rule 2: I have to make an effort to connect with people. To go out and meet new people.

Rule 3: No more alcohol or drugs of any kind.

Rule 4: I have to save up enough money to deal with my passing and set up a Will.
 

Please advise...",13Apr2019,1
29,"So...I'm a 30 year old male, recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background about me. While I didn't have a very bad childhood, it was far from good, my dad has/had very violent outbursts and issues with my mother and work stress, which then he will end up releasing his anger and frustration with his childs, mainly me being the younger of 3 sibblings. His violence was mainly emotional, he would always tell me how much of a disgrace I was to the family and a costly mistake of a son I was, he always made sure to remind me that I would never amount to shit in my life and nobody would ever love me. Sometimes said abuse will be accompanied with physical violence, via punches, belt and sometimes even a wet wire.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother wasn't any better, she would always tell me she was dissapointed I was born a male, I was a shitty child and dumb, sometimes she would also use physical violence towards me. My siblings would also bully me and blame me for every time my parents had a fight. I was always thought and made sure to never cry, because men don't cry, because I don't have the right to be weak, if I cried for any reason I'd get punched or beaten for it.

Abuse was part of my childhood, the feeling of being an unwanted, unfit and incapable was something that my parents made me feel constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up being shy and akward, always thinking I was a mistake and always wondering why I was alive. I really have tried to prove myself that they were always wrong, that I was a worthy person, a person that would never end up being like them. I had relationships that helped me feel I was a good human being, a person capable of helping others and that I finally had something for me, something to strive and work harder for, but my first relationship ended up after 7 years. I fell really hard, it hurted me but I knew I had to be strong, I knew that I made mistakes and I had part of the blame for why things didn't work, even then I was devastated.

I got into another serious relationship, right after being diagnosed with depression. She loved me or so I thought, everything was working, I was happy and working hard, working to improve and to be a good person for the both of us. She always said I was her priority, the person she would never leave behind and would always be there for me, things were going amazing and I really felt alive again, loved and wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after we decided to take a step further into a serious relationship, we told her parents about it, everything changed. Out of nowhere, she decided I was no longer the person she loved, I was no longer someone she wanted to see, she decided that I was no longer to talk to her and to ever see her ever again. I did what I had to and followed her desires. It broke me. That day I gave up on life.

And now I am here, it's been 3 months since that happend, I dread every day, depression is slowly killing me and I no longer have a drive to keep going. I don't consider suicide but I don't really care about life anymore. I feel like my dad was right, nobody will ever love me, no matter how much I try and how much I put into a relationship, I'm unwanted and unfit, I'm a mistake and I will never amount to shit. I have a career, a good earning job, but even then I don't feel anything, I'm numb and tired, all I want is to know if I will ever be good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is out of place or doesn't make any sense, I'm having a really bad breakdown and I needed to vent.",13Apr2019,1
30,"Once upon a time, I had dreams. Goals. I wanted to go to school for acting and take it on as a career. Every acting coach/professor I ever met and performed for said I had something really special. Maybe I could have done alright, if I tried.

Then I got depressed, and with that came the loss of joy in something I loved. Rehearsals started to feel like a chore, or worse. I started to hate it. *I’m not even a good actor*, I would think. *I just like the praise and attention. I don’t care about the craft. I’m a shitty and selfish person.*

I majored in the dumbest major ever in college, even dumber than theater. Thank god I at least got a full ride or I’d be in debt over complete stupidity. Now I’m just in an extremely low paying job with a worthless degree, over complete stupidity.

Lol. I got a full ride to college. I was salutatorian of my high school class. I really had whole entire goals. Lol. What the fuck happened to me?

Now I’m in a low paying job that is still meaningful and a good job nonetheless (one of those community based non-profits). And I fucking suck at it. I don’t do any work to learn about the history of the community I’m serving, or about any political action happening, or anything. You know why? 

Because I don’t fucking care.

That’s it. I don’t care about anything. And I don’t do well enough to ask for a raise so...guess I’m gonna be making shit money forever. 

Which I could maybe get used to if I was passionate about what I was doing. But here’s the problem — I’m not passionate about **anything**. I do not want to work. At all. Period. **I hate working and I don’t want a career.**

I enjoy lounging around and just waiting to die. I have been depressed for so long that I don’t even know what it’s like to not be. Every day feels like a fight to even stay alive, and I’m tired. 

So, what can I do? I’m seeing a therapist, but it’s with Kaiser and they’re really shitty...but I can’t afford anywhere else. I feel like I need a purpose, but I don’t know how to find mine.",13Apr2019,2
