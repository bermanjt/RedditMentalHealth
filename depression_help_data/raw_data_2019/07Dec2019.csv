1,"I fell into a mental breakdown for over half a year due to surrounding stressors and workload. I isolated myself from my friends and became completely withdrawn. Now, that I am slowly trying to pull myself back together. Everyone is gone. The relationships aren't the same. I feel bad because it was my fault. These were people that were heavily invested in me and were always helping me. I shunned them away and isolated myself. Now, that I am slowly trying to pull myself back together this is acting as a vicious cycle because realizing they're all gone and missing the times I used to have that I threw away is making me more depressed",07Dec2019,1
2,"I've been lonely ever since graduating high school. I used to be bright faced and sociable, but now I don't talk to anyone besides my best friend, who I used to skip school and get stoned with, every day. 

During high school, we'd hang out every day, searching for more and more money to blow on drugs. It was fun until after graduation when everyone went to college, and I was left alone with nobody to talk to.

Sometimes, I wish I would've just traded in my relationships with all of my friends, who did drugs, for a girlfriend or something.

I had a crush on this one girl, but the two of us never spoke face to face. I still have a crush on her because I don't really see anyone, anymore. I can only sit around, lonely, and think to myself about how things could've went differently if I had never started smoking. Maybe, I'd be married by now with a nice paying job.. It's been 7 years since graduation.

She's in another state now, and probably has no interest in me, whatsoever. I sit around depressed with no girl to talk to, and even my guy friends disowned me for my mental instability.

I'm on Social Security for this mental illness called schizo-bipolar disorder. I've lost my cool on Facebook a few times, and now I'm too afraid to see anyone in person.

The girl, who I still have a crush on, would be embarrassed to be with a mentally ill 25 year old like me, who still needs his dad to drive him to the store because he's too afraid to drive in the winter. She's already graduated from college like a majority of the kids I went to school with.

My best friend, who I smoked with every day, has rich parents that baby him, but as for me, I have no one to help support me financially. My dad is a single loser like me, who basically surrendered his whole life after my mother divorced him. He sits in the same apartment complex as me on his own terms of disability after falling down a flight of stairs and hurting his back.

I've never been a baby during my entire life, but now I feel like I could just cry myself to sleep, every night, and not even think twice about it.

I try looking into the future, but then I always stop to think that human success just isn't good enough for me after all of the fantasies I've had throughout my life. My dad is devoutly religious, and he talks about being a Jehovah's Witness, non-stop. I get insanely pissed off at him for talking so much, but whenever I'm lonely, I think about stories that he's told me about being picked on for his religious beliefs in school when he was younger than I am now. I cry every time, thinking that maybe the Bible is just another fairytale and false promise.

Sometimes, I wish I would just die in my sleep and wake up as one of those angels that my dad told me about while I was growing up. I would sneak up on that girl from high school, and impress her with my angelic appearance and share a story line for us, both. I would be able to show off to my friends that my father was right, and I wouldn't need to feel embarrassed about the only religion that I've ever known, anymore. I'd be able to joke around again..

I just don't know what to do with myself..

Even if I had a successful business, it still wouldn't make me happy. I feel as though I've missed out on the girl of my dreams, and all of my friends will never return, even though we live in the same small city.

Please, help lift me up into some higher way of thinking.. I just need someone to talk to.",07Dec2019,1

4,"My online friend wants to commit suicide, she has scared me more times than i can count and she has said that she wants to die tomorrow, the good news is she is having doubts about going through with it which is a good sign but im still scared for her, this has been going on for a couple of weeks and its taking a toll on me i have a lot of problems of my own to deal with its hard to excessively worry about someone else to you know? But i feel trapped i feel like no matter what i do im hurting her, if i stay im apparently causing her confusion and stress but if i leave i would be such an asshole....at least thats what i would feel like i have said just about everything i can to her idk what else to do, i cant keep doing this its to hard on me, its so much pressure on me because she constantly says things that make it seem like in the only one keeping her alive and im pretty sure i not even enough for that sense we dont know each other irl and to her im just someone online which makes sense....i kinda am. Sometimes i wish i hadent been put in this situation, im not a therapist idk how to help her everything i do annoys her because im not telling her she can die im not telling her what she wants to hear and i will never tell her what she wants to here im just so trapped",07Dec2019,1
5,"I am a very emotional boy

Sometimes my dad says things that make me sad and upset. he will be really judgemental towards me and that makes me angry alot. he tries to talk down to me like im a lesser person than him

When i cry, he asks me what's wrong. but it's not in the comforting and safe way you think. He says it really judgementally and unsafe way, and he's usually shouting when he does it. it takes him a while before he starts shouting though.

He doesnt even attempt to console me when i am crying. he scolds and shouts at me when im in public, like there's something wrong with me, when he's the one who made me up set

Afterwards he will make fun of me for being a baby and crying over everything, and i shouldn't be acting ""like a 2 year old"" anymore",07Dec2019,1

7,"You know we live in a different world today. These days I believe that depression is over looked. It’s liked a homeless person that ever person walk by not noticing that they exist. Even when you tell doctor these days they look at you as if you don’t exist. But one thing Im thankful for is this site! To find out that I’m not alone in life with the struggles I live with in the depression world make it a little easier for me. It makes so much a difference that people in the world go through the same things I go through each day in life. The video, the post, the reality of each person story is true life events makes life come reality in regards you your own life. It’s like that saying. Life is a struggle but it how you deal with those struggles in life that truly defines you as a person. How you over come those struggles in life no matter how much your back is against the wall. If you believe you can achieve anything because you know your better than who you are now! Live life today for tomorrow may be our last. Love your self and believe in the ones that trust in you!",07Dec2019,1

12,"Yes I know life has ups and downs but I'm tired of this....I'm so fucking tired of the ups and downs. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal behaviors since I was 16. I just turned 24 and I'm so sick of it. The last two weeks I've just felt like coming home and killing myself each night. I've been crying on the way home from work every day. I just hate that I will get through this and then again I will get bad again and it won't ever go away. I just can't fucking take it. I posted a couple of weeks ago I almost killed myself but didn't and I wish I did at this point. 

I keep looking up the easiest ways to do so. I don't think anyone else really knows how bad it's getting either. I just want these thoughts and feelings to stop and honestly this is the only way I can see it happening. I'm just so fucking tired and feel empty. I even binged and felt nothing. Not even the guilt or shame that comes with it. Everything just feels unreal anyways where I feel like I'm dreaming.",07Dec2019,1
13,I wouldn’t so much as call my issue depression but maybe. I am not upset or sad and I’m not mad or anything but I’m also not happy I’m just here. I feel no emotion towards anything or anyone and I’m normal out in public and have a personality but once I sit down by myself it’s back to me. Just empty and I feel just so fucking bored or something I have honestly no idea. I don’t cry or anything i just literally sit here. I’m not sure what to call it but I can’t figure out how to fix it. I’ve been this way for a long time although my girlfriend was a good outlet until she cheated so I’m just back to good times... I didn’t even get upset about the break up because I couldn’t really feel upset Idk why. I’m kinda just rambling at this point but it just sums up about how I feel and I can’t seem to express it. I refuse to like another woman becasue that just gives them the chance to hurt me or for me to be somewhere I wish to never be again it is just not worth the effort. I’m just dead inside I guess is the best description and idk what to do I’m sorry for the shitty explaining and all but I just had to say it somewhere so this was my best option.,07Dec2019,1
14,"Hello depression help. 
I wanted to share a nice treat my co worker did for me.
We talked about comfort food since it's that time of year again. Rainy cold weather makes you want some stew or hot soup.
She said before going on lunch she would bring me back something.
I come back from break and she literally gave me a whole meal to take home with me. She knows the holidays are tough for me. 
She does such amazing sweet gestures I don't know how to thank her. I'm thinking of getting her a gift for Xmas.

So in the end be nice to everyone. You don't know what that person is struggling with. But doing something nice for them will mean the world to them.",07Dec2019,1

16,"Hello, it’s me,

I live within your soul.

Night without stars, is all I see.  


I was only twelve years old,

When I was left in here in the unknown.

Why only me? The one with the heart of gold.  


That’s what I used to yell

When you talked to the screaming monkey instead,

Who made you see the world as hell.  


You never heard my voice.

I guess my loudest shout was soft?

Or perhaps it was hard to make a choice?  


What did I shout?

Hmm… Let’s see, it was always “You’re kind, you’re brave”

and “Hope can kick that ugly doubt!”  


But I understand that such choice was hard to make.

You did your best you could,

You didn’t know, it was not a mistake.  


So why are you here now?

Are you sad or worst, hurt?

Or having no feelings was that monkey’s vow?  


(I knew it was that monkey!) 

Ahem… Remember, that monkey is mean,

That monkey is good,

But that monkey is well… just a little misunderstood.

  
That monkey’s crazy will increase,

If you feed it,

But accepting and watching it, would surely bring peace.  


I know it won’t be easy,

And I know I sound confident

But give yourself time, deep breaths! It’s no good finding a solution while queasy!  


This journey may take years or centuries,

Of hardships and regrets.

But you’ll learn to love and create great memories.  


However, you won’t be alone!

I’ll carry you on my back!

Don’t worry, I’m strong as a stone!  


There, there, you’re allowed to cry

Do not hesitate,

You can hold my hand, or at least try  


Because I am your friend,

And no matter if you can’t see me,

My presence will never end.   


Who am I, you say with a little glee?

The answer is quite simple!

When hope grows, I'll finally say ""Hello again, it’s me"".",07Dec2019,1

22,"My (M19) friend (F19) wants to kill her and she does not listen.

I have a small group of friends. Some come and go, but some persons stay. She is one of them.

Recently I discovered her self hatred. And I was shocked that she had it for a long time but did not tell us (her friends). She thinks that her problems take too much space in our lives, that her problems does not matter. That she is unwanted, she is rubbish no one cares about. And all that despite the fact that she is the person we all rely on in the first place. If something comes up, she is one of the first persons to be invited.
She works hard on her friendship. Always makes more than should be done. For instance, I wanted a separate monitor for my console (I didn't have a TV). And she said she could give me her's. And it is darn expensive. I refused although she tried to convince me.
We make her presents. Little things, bigger things. We all like to discuss what she brings to a table. We genuinely care about her.

Since we discovered her self hatred, we knew we had to do something. She did not want us to help her: ""It is not worth it to care about me"", she said. I came up with the idea that we all show our fears to each other. To show her that it is not scary to tell friends the ugly truth about yourself. And that friends are made to help you out in hard times. Geez, I even had a meltdown after that, and she participated in making me feel better. 
After that she said: ""this is so cool that you're THAT honest"". But... she does nothing to be that ""cool"". She sees sing a of friendship and love, given to her, but her mind ignores it.

She wants to kill herself. And I don't know how to convince her that she needs to get help. We are her friends, but we have not much experience to actually HELP. We will do our best, but it seems like we are only a supporting team. 
In fact, I cannot even convince her that what she is feeling is HAVE to be cured.  She still says her problems does not matter. She still don't like to talk about it. 

And I noticed that she is silent when does not understand what we are saying. Like show she did not watch, or game she haven't heard about. Like... just ask. It is so much pleasure to tell people about your favourite things. 

""Like, do you enjoy telling people what you like"", - I asked her.
""Yes""' - was her reply.
And why she does not want to hear anything from us?

The last thing I heard in that conversation is that she ""wants to be normal"". And we all saying this to her. She is normal. Feeling pain is normal. But declining all sings of help, decline help itself is not.

I know that she has to come up with something to herself. We cannot put our own thoughts in her skull to make her want to live. The solution must be given from inside. But I don't know how.",07Dec2019,1

I cannot stand myself anymore and living has become unbearable, I know that I am not doing any good neither for me nor for the people who are around me. I cannot kill myself because I don't want to hurt anyone, whilst I walk around like a zombie, not living, just spectating life, watching it passing by; I want to take part of it but it feels like I was not born to enjoy it.

29,"At the moment I'm trying to understand if I'm depressed anymore or not.

I have posted before too about me joining a guy and it helping me reduce depression.


But now I'm not so sure, I meet up with my friends, and trust me they are the best of the bunch, like I will give my life for them, and they will do the same. I feel awesome with them.

But then I go home and my routine of  watching Reddit videos on YouTube starts, I really like those. But I feel really alone..

I exercise in the gym , and I also stay happy or arrest I try to , but this is genuine happiness not some bs cover to hide myself.

But lately I feel so tried, I have been sleeping the entire day on my off days, because I don't feel like doing something.
 
At times when I'm not sleeping I actually through my social media to find no one to talk to , 
(The friends I was taking about before, have full time jobs and don't really have the time use social media other than maybe post some pics.)

I feel really lonely. When I get up from sleep I and look in the mirror while washing my face, I look at myself and and think of what I'm experiencing (like feeling that I'm not depressed, searching for hope, trying to get in the front seat of life)

That these are all futile, or maybe I'm just faking it all and I just don't know it yet.

Idk , maybe I'm just thinking about it too much.

The thing is that I'm an ambivert , I need to social interactions when I'm outside of my house.

But the moment I enter the house I  need to stop taking to everyone and alone, (I start having social instructions of any kind. I love to stay alone and focus on myself.


Now I have been like this forever, but now  the time when I focus on myself I start realizing that maybe nothing is right, maybe I'm faking being not depressed..


I also focus on myself when I'm alone , outside my house. (The moment I become an extrovert)
When I don't get any social interactions, I feel sad and start focusing on myself , while swiping though social media again see that I'm all alone....


I don't know maybe I'm just bragging, but I seriously have no other place to say this.

Some background info:
I don’t think I’m super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but haven’t followed through yet.

I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did.
Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can “get help,” but the psych ward hasn’t helped me before.


The stuff I need help with:
I promised to “get help” yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They won’t let me rescind my promise, and I desperately don’t want to break it.

I am fairly certain I’m not depressed. Even though I’ve attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt.

I ended up failing all of my classes and I moved back home to get help with my mental health. I stayed for about a year and a half until I felt as though I had a handle on my mental health. I moved across the state to live with some friends, got a part-time job, and continue my education. That was all good until about two months ago.

22 year old failing college miserably for past 3 years of my life, found a $14/hr IT job this year but had to give it up for school. My family would think I’m insane to give up college and work this IT job and work on myself (going to gym everyday, spending time on video editing, hanging out with friends). 

Here’s the long version if you could please read this I tried to explain how useless I’ve been for past 3 years of my life. 

Did great my first year of college, due to friends in my classes motivating me to study with them. Friends left for different college, I moved out of state for a physical therapy program in a different college. Played ton of video games and smoked weed everyday, failed 2/4 classes first semester. Couldn’t bring myself to tell my parents, faked being in school for few weeks till everything blew up and moved home and became a janitor for my dad. Probably worse state of mind I was ever in, no phone no laptop just cleaning toilets and shit but that was the upside of my day. Doing nothing in my room except push-ups and crying. This for 6 months till I had huge fight with my parents because I was staying up late laughing with friends online and I did not laugh with my family like that (I know this doesn’t sound real). Ended up packing essentials and lived homeless for about a week, crashed at some friends for two months and then finally moved in with my aunt. Parents wanted me to be happy but at home so still major tension about me leaving, anyways I stay with my aunt and got a frontline chef job while in classes. Failed out of my classes at community college, didn’t tell anyone again. Took same classes and only passed 1/3 the next semester. Parents don’t see a different path besides getting a bachelors but they think I have been completing most of my classes. I know, I’m a major failure and the only thing I’m good at is lying. They offer to pay my tuition if I go to a University but I try to suggest to them that I’m not mentally okay for college right now and I think working for a year or so may be able to help clear my head. They don’t believe in depression or any of these mental disorders and think it’s just laziness. I’m not denying it is laziness but am I that fucking retarded that I’m so lazy I can’t even bother to do any schoolwork or pass any classes? Idk. Keep in mind, I try to smoke weed everyday throughout this time period and to this day. I take their offer to go to university which I know is bratty to even consider or whatever but I go and take the same classes I ‘passed’ last year. failed. Shit has just been breaking me down so much I get insane anxiety about actually attending class and will let it build on top of itself until I’m successfully missing every single fucking class like a retard I am. So I have now failed the same 3 classes, 3 fucking times. Here we are. My IT job from earlier this year called me and asked if I can come back and I really would just like to work and learn as much as I can from the job as I was earlier this year. My parents think I’m gonna graduate by next spring so idk what the fuck to do. All I do is hide stuff like this from them and I know everything is going to blow up again and it’s just gonna be the same vicious cycle of me moving back home, getting to some dark mental states, moving out again since I’d rather be homeless and then failing more school. Suicide has been on my mind for too long and it just feels like I’m rotting inside. Like I can’t do this shit anymore and I know the simple answer is ‘Man up and tell ur parents and then straighten up and finish school’. By the looks of things I’m not finishing school anytime soon and I will probably kill myself if I have to go down that path. Anyways I know I sound like a huge fucking brat and people would be soaring with opportunities my parents have given me but why can’t I just work my IT job and enjoy my life video editing as a side income and actually going to the gym consistently. I know people do these hobbies while in school but I have ‘tried’ for the past three years and I just give up half way in semesters and fail so I don’t know what to do anymore. If you have read this far, you have done enough already honestly if you have any advice or what you would do in this situation please leave a comment. I can’t really ‘cut’ off my family because I’m the youngest and all my older siblings are VERY successful aka doctor, surgeon, etc. A lot of my cousins live within 15 miles so cutting off family ties would probably be the stupid thing to do and wouldn’t work but I can’t come clean to my parents as you can tell from my past and I just wanna work and be able to dedicate time to the gym and video editing during my after hours. I can’t do that stuff how I want to while in school, I’m just rambling, please leave a comment idk what the fuck to do anymore",07Dec2019,1
35,Most people with depression have suffered from a injury in life or something bad that has happen to them. What a lot of people that are spouses or living with a person that has depression or anxiety must understand is that person is always going to have ups and downs in life. Probably more downs then ups. True love begins with excepting the person for who they are and not judging them for who they used to be. Being supportive with the person that you love or even with a friend that has depression or anxiety goes a long way. They may try to push you away for no reason but in reality it’s the depression doing it. Not them their self. The best support system is always being there for the person for the good times and the bad. For example I have a friend that tried to end his life. I was always supportive to his situation because I’ve lived with it for so long. Due to my injury and having 5 spinal surgeries. So when it came down to it. He reached out to me telling me he was done and tonight and said it was the night! He said he was going to try to end my life. Because of the signs I knew I had to take action. That’s what I did. I saved his life. He was on a breathing tube for 5 days. When he woke up I was in the chair saying I love you and I’m glade you reached out. He never thanked me but I knew I’m his heart he was thankful. Today he a beautiful daughter and a wife and he is a changed man. What’s even more funny is it’s been a reverse role now! He is now the one checking up on me trying to be a role model giving me positive feed back. Always saying just think positive in life and positive things will happen. He took something that I always said to to heart and revered roles. That’s what’s life is about. Not giving up on a person because of their condition. So many people suffer from these conditions and are judged in the wrong way. It hurts me to see how many people are going through the same struggles I’m going through today but it’s also uplifting to see how many people are reaching out for help. It actually gives hope to me that I’m not alone in the journey to become a better person in life and to continue to push my self to new limits. A good quote I would say to end this story with is! “True life events are in the past. We must focus on the future to become great people and to prove everyone in life that has doubted us that we are better than life it self”.,07Dec2019,1

37,"Hi,

Just posting this for some reassurance or as a sounding board. I feel so lonely and I have for a while. I feel like I’m so uninteresting and boring that nobody wants to get to know me. 

I’m 29 and had friends that I’ve drifted away from and one amazing friend who lives across the country however she is a social butterfly and I don’t want to bog her down with my shit. It recently got so bad that I was seriously considering suicide to escape the pain. I told myself I would give myself ‘one last shot’ so I moved to another country in order to change my life and make friends; however I just feel more lonely and isolated than ever and the bad thoughts are coming back.

Thanks to anyone who read my ramblings and to anyone who could impart some wisdom.",07Dec2019,1

39,"I feel like a large amount of my depression is tied to my current apartment. I recently moved to a very large city in a different country and ended up just taking a place close to my school. I have nothing in common with or know the names of anyone who I live with. Their lives seem completely different than mine and I feel really alienated and trapped (there are a lot of other issues I'm having right now that are a part of this.) What can I do to makes this better? Other than decorating my room, spending as little time there etc.",07Dec2019,1

41,"Nothing is particularly wrong with my current situation. I live in a very nice home with my loving and supportive husband. I work somewhere I love with kind and supportive co-workers, benefits, and pays. I have two pets who are so easy going and loving that taking care of them is a breeze. 

But I feel like I’m about to drown or in the process of drowning. If I don’t get the dishwasher loaded that night or I don’t do the laundry when it needs to be done instead of waiting a week to fold piles and piles of clothes. My husband understands and says that it’s fine we can do it later. 

I can’t enjoy anything hobby without getting overwhelmed by the idea of things I have to do. Go Draw? Nope.  Read a book? Absolutely not.  All I can do is lay down and sleep. 12... 16 hours a day on some weekends. 

A few years ago someone told me that if I just do those things that need to be done right away I won’t be overwhelmed later and my god it makes so much sense and echos in my mind over and over. It is so true but, for me, so so toxic.  

I just wanna lay down and I am probably just going to lay in bed with my heated blanket and cat and not do the dishes or the laundry, and my God do I feel sick for doing it.",07Dec2019,1
42,"51f, single for several years, 2 adult kids, daughter lives with me and her 20mth old baby, who I adore.

Struggling with spiralling debts and lack of work. I'm a supply teacher who left mainstream school after mh breakdown and bc of elderly family illness 4 yrs ago. Since then I've become more and more isolated, no work colleagues as I go place to place, and my other friends either all moved on into relationships or into busy, time-consuming jobs. I go months without any social contact.

My house is falling apart with several thousands needed to rectify it and I have no way of finding that, esp with my unreliable employment status.  More and more often, I think about ending it - except I couldn't do that to my kids or parents but I feel like I'm drowning with literally no-one to talk to about it. 

I have no self confidence to reapply for a full-time teaching job but no idea what else I could do.  My kids are both in happy relationships and my parents elderly (only child) so one day soon I'll be truly alone and then I probably wouldn't carry on.

I know I need to see my GP and get back on SSRIs and hope they work this time. I just can't seem to find any happiness in situations that previously I would. Usually, seeing my grand-daughter lifted my spirits but even that isn't working now and I feel so detached from the world. I wonder if anyone beyond my immediate family would notice or care if I left it... Sad balance sheet of 51 yrs to leave no impression.

I'm sat crying in my car as I write this. Today, I went for a stroll with daughter and baby to the park, a cold but sunny day with blue skies. Although I remember smiling and laughing with baby at some points, I also know that the thoughts of suicide kept on poking up and I'd have to try shut them down. It's not like I've thought about how, or when... More that I keep feeling that I don't want to carry on. I recognise these are, thankfully, two different things but that I still need to seek help.

Rn, I just want to feel someone listens and understands bc the burden of carrying this all alone is so heavy.",07Dec2019,1
43,"Where should I even begin to give sketch my situation right now? I'm 21 and I think as of right now I've been depressed for the past 5 to 6 years.  

In high school I never got help for me being shy and showing a general lack of interest in people and really anything at all. The only people who even noticed at all were substitute teachers who I didn't even know. I never accepted their help, I always told them I'm fine and that's that.  

Two years ago I had to redo a year at college because I was too scared to do a mandatory internship. I couldn't do it. I couldn't because I had such low self esteem and so little energy left after pushing through for the past few years. My family didn't notice AT ALL. They were too busy with my brother (who honestly did need that amount of help).  

I had to redo the same year again for the THIRD time. The second time I redid the year I at least finished some classes and got further ahead somewhat. The third time though I didn't even put any effort in at all. I stayed in bed, talked to friends as little as possible without losing them completely and in general just closed myself off.  

At the end of the school year something happened which seemed like a possible way out to me. I talked to a friend at a party. He told me he was seeing a psychologist because he was depressed. Before this I didn't even know exactly what it meant to be depressed. After that night I thought of a way to get to a psychologist on my own. I went to a general practitioner (where I went multiple times to the years before to get help for my lack of energy and motivation, but nothing came out of it btw) and said I thought I was depressed and wanted a referral. They gave me one and at home my mother helped me call to make an appointment. She didn't even believe me at first. How could she not have seen it before? My lack of motivation and energy. Me staying in bed all day and only getting up to play games in my room. I felt incredibly sad as I realized that this is the most effort she put into me for the past years.  

I went to that psychologist for half a year and honestly, I did feel better during it. He diagnosed me with an Avoidant Personality Disorder and I worked on that whilst also working on getting my energy in general back. I began leaving my room more to do stuff with friends. I quit college. I started working a couple more hours a week. But that's it. That's where the progress ended.
Now we're back to where I am currently. I still leave my bed to go do stuff with friends. I still work a couple more hours a week. I'm glad I quit college cause I do not believe I was still in the position to finish it, I knew nobody anymore and I basically forgot most of the stuff I learned.  

I decided I should search for a new full-time job or go to college again, but I just can't put myself to it, I'm too scared. I feel like I stopped way too soon with my psychologist because I felt like I had made enough progress to start making my way towards feeling happy again but I didn't. Nobody in my family cares about my situation. They're all busy with themselves so I won't get any feedback about how to improve my situation. A week or so ago my dad told me he wanted to talk with me and my mom about me. He told me they were getting concerned about me. How dare they. How dare they, after 6 years of ignoring my problems mind you, fucking tell me they're getting worried. Oh now you're getting worried? Just because I'm getting so old that I shouldn't be living at home anymore? Because I'm not on path that leads to me leaving the house? How DARE they act like they're concerned about me when NOTHING has changed the past 6 years from their perspective.  

The last 3 years I haven't made a single new friend. Not a single person who I've talked to, felt like they wanted to keep talking to me. I've only lost friends. I barely speak to some of them, and when I do it's because they wanna talk about their shit without even ASKING about me afterwards. I find it so incredibly difficult to start talking to friends because of this. Sometimes I don't talk to them for weeks on end.  

I just don't know how to progress anymore. I have so many possible steps I could take but every step forward I take will just eventually undo itself and I'll be back at square one.  

A job, college, a girlfriend, friends, hobbies, sport and the thing that ties it all together: my social anxiety. These are all things I could work on but I am unable to collect enough energy to even fix one of them, let alone fix enough of them to feel like a normal happy person.  

I don't even know why I wanted to write all this anymore. I guess there's just this tiny bit of hope and energy left in me. I don't think it will be enough to change me though",07Dec2019,1
