This morning I woke up with drawing on my mind. I had an idea that I wanted to execute.  I had everything ready. My heart yearned to sit down and draw. So I did. I got out references, turned on music. I finished the drawing that I had started the day before.  Then, I began with this new idea. I sketched everything out on the new paper I got for Christmas that I swore to only use for special things. At first I made a mistake. But I kept telling myself to sit through the struggle. And I did. I sketched and sketched for a few hours until I was happy. Then I lined everything, I felt like I could do anything. I felt that this drawing was going to be great. I felt for the first time proud that I felt that it was going to be great. I felt proud I was thinking positively.




But then I took a step back. And slowly reality sank in. It looked horrible.  Messy. Inconsistent. Everything I didn’t want it to be. That moment of light was gone. That moment of happiness had vanished. I don’t even know why I thought I could do it. Or why I bother trying. Because in the root of it all, no matter what I do, its all. Just. Crap. 



I still remember that day a year ago. I had gone to the teen art class at the local art center.  I was already so scared, but I had a little bit of hope in me. But at the end of the day, I had a mental break down. I couldn’t even draw. My arm was frozen. Everyone else was doing still life’s with charcoal. Everyone else is doing portraits of people. Or abstract. Or sculpture. But no matter what there doing, it’s accepted. They have a chance. They can do it. I remember the art teacher calling my parents. I remember me crying in the car. I remember me hating myself so much for being different. But at the same time not so different. Because so many other people are doing the same thing. And what is that thing? Drawing anime



It hurts. I feel like I’m crying over nothing because its hopeless isn’t it? I can’t get into any art schools. I can’t without being criticized. “So all you draw is anime?” .  Anime. Anime. Anime.  




I feel like I’m just being whiny, and I’m sorry if I sound that way. But in reality, it hurts a lot. I don’t even know why I’m writing this, I don’t even know if anyone will read this. I don’t even know anything anymore. I just wasted a whole day on drawing. And even if It was a “success”, it wouldn’t be. Because. I. Draw. Anime. And apparently, what I draw is a shortcut. Apparently, what I draw doesn’t matter. I hate myself. 





I’m sorry if nobody understands what I’m talking about. I just don’t feel like explaining right now. I hate myself so much right now for being me. I’m sorry. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Thank you",31Dec2019,1
2,I struggle every day to get out of bed. I always feel like I bother everyone I have contact with and I just don’t see how other manage. My friends always try to tell me to talk to someone about it but I can’t face to face. I know everyone judges others. My life has been far from perfect and I just can’t openly talk to a stranger about it.,31Dec2019,1
3,"I try to help people as much as I can. But now I'm tempted to just die. Some of my methods make me smile, even, with sadistic humor. It makes me laugh to think of my brains and body being contorted and deformed. It's honestly the most retarded thing- I sit there and laugh in front of a bunch of people and can't explain it without pissing them off. When alone, sometimes I just cut fun shapes into my body. Not saying it's good, it's a weird frame of mind. One time I tried making weird scars on my hand for fun and people still ask about them and it embarrasses me but I still do stuff like that.


I'm messed up. Got meds, talking to the doc soon. I was better a little while ago, but am in a bad environment. Tryna get out. Life is shit sometimes. I find humor in ending life. It's messed up. Idk.


Whatever. I'm here. Hbu?

4,"I’m getting depressed and everything is starting to hurt even more. I don’t know what to do to keep myself up.  
I’ve been better recently but every now and then I experience this kind of episodes, in the past I just try to keep myself busy but today I don’t have anything to do and I don’t want to do a thing either, I feel really unmotivated and I can’t get myself do anything to distract myself anymore. Suicidal thoughts are coming back and I feel so alone and useless. 
I know that letting depression win will make me be in more pain but the pain that I’m feeling is making me feel more depressed. I wish I could go out for a walk but my knees are killing me and if I want to go out on new year’s eve I have to save some energy. 
I just feel so old even though I’m just 25. Depression took many years of my life and I don’t want to be in that place anymore but it seems like something inevitable, because every time I feel like I’m falling into that hole again. 
I don’t know why people have to live with this kind of conditions, this illness will never go away, why do I have to live like this? Why I just don’t die if this pain is always going to be like this? Going to therapy is expensive, going to the doctor is expensive and meds are expensive, so if  I lose my job  and stopped getting the help that my parents are giving me, how could I afford living like this? Why do I have to live like this? I don’t want to be a burden, I feel like I can’t stop being one...
My brain is broken so the rest of my body and I don’t have any control over it.",31Dec2019,1
5,"Does anyone have any crisis lines you can reach out to that don’t require a phone plan? I’m a 16 year-old runaway and mine was cancelled the hour I left, so now that I’m here months later (housed, warm, and safe but currently) in major distress (suicidal ideation), everything I try to look up requires a phone plan or is a email service not meant for suicidal people/people in distress. I have an iPhone and was hoping there’d be some for iMessage but so far, no dice.

TL;DR: Need a text or talk line compatible with iMessage or otherwise functional through the web and not a phone plan

7,"Hey all, I just want to get some stuff off of my chest. I come from a well off family and am the only child. This is a huge problem mainly due to the fact that I am a closeted homosexual. With both of my parents being devout christians, my father more conservative than my mother. I grew up getting everything I could ever want, a brand new car, good clothes, good shoes, everything. Growing up around the 7th grade, I was very overweight, like 200lbs, 4'11"". a total mess, and I was  bullied to the point where I saw the counselor every day, to the point where she refused to see me (she didnt do anything to help) this is where the problem started, and my suicidal tendencies began. my parents were furious, they sold the house and we moved, which made my mental state considerably better. 

everything was okay.

during my freshman year I met a girl who was just like me, we connected easily and spent a lot of time together, and with her twin brother who I actually looked up to more than her. He was a super outgoing, flamboyant socialite, total opposite of my friend. 

and then they moved, which meant I lost 7 good friends in a span of 2 years, out of all of them this affected me the most.

Things took a turn for the worse during my sophomore year, tough classes mixed with shitty people and teachers takes a toll. It got to a point where I wrote a suicide note, but never went through with it. I sat and suffered. I was figuring a lot out during this time.

it was beginning to diminish until November, then it just got to the worse state its ever been. I'm being more reckless and taking more risks that I wouldnt normally do. Whenever I'm driving I speed up and want to crash into the trees at top speed. I wake up every day and end it in the same way as ever, upset and angry. I dont want to talk to my friends about it because I dont want to truly open up all the way. I'm done yall, I have everything I could ever want, but that just makes me more upset.",31Dec2019,1

10,"They talked about this in health class, and said it was “normal”, but I’m not really sure.  Right now I’m in one of the ‘off’ periods, where you feel a bit better, but I’m starting to get anxiety with school coming up in a week.  I hate this.  I want to feel like I did when I was younger.  Now that I think about it, I believe it all started when i was 10.  I was sleeping in my parents bed, when I woke up to them fighting.  That’s when I heard the words that tore my heart out and threw it in a wood chipper.  “I want a divorce”. That was the first Time I had ever heard my dad cry.  It wasn’t until the summer of this year that they got divorced, but you could still tell that something was off between them.  I just want this to end. I want to be happy.",31Dec2019,1
11,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm kinda new here so I'm sorry if I'm not at the right place to talk about this but I need to get it off my chest.

Basically, for about a year now, I've been having thoughts about stuff like body decomposition and 'life after death'. I'm afraid of the fact that death is inevitable and can happen at any given moment. I know once it happens, I won't be there to witness it but knowing that it'll happen really bothers me. I constantly go on the web and look up pictures of bloated corpses and whatnot. Like it fascinates me but also makes me even more depressed. I honestly don't know why I look at that stuff because it does nothing but worsen my mental state.",31Dec2019,1

13,"It’s not that people don’t want to be my friend, I just don’t trust anyone. Everyone I’ve ever been friends with has ended up stabbing me in the back. Being manipulative and making up lies about me. I thought I was making friends at work (not like, outside of work friends. Just work friends) but come to find out people just talk shit about me behind my back like they do everyone else. I’m in a relationship, been together 9 years. We have two kids and I’m 26. I feel like I’ll never have anyone besides my family that I can talk to. And it sucks because there are some things you don’t wanna talk to your s/o about. Or maybe you need to get away sometimes, but I have no one. I haven’t had a friend in over two years. My having children is always a problem to other people. I don’t trust baby sitters with my children so they’re always with me or their father. (My husband)  so I just end up cutting people off who constantly try and get me to dump my kids in someone else so we can hang out. 
I just feel like I’m at a dead end.",31Dec2019,1
14,"I've experienced severe depression for the last decade. It's gotten worse over the years, and since my brother passed it has been especially bad. My family can't really seem to help or understand, and I don't have many friends these days. 
I moved to a new city from Florida last year to start a new life and things were good for a bit. Then it was the same old. 
But it got worse, as I started having panic attacks at work. Crying, sweating, it sucked and was very embarrassing. I live in a segregated city and I'm not always around people who feel like me, and that can hurt too.
I feel so lost and so gone already. I can't shut the voices out. I lost my job again. I used to dream of providing for my family and I can't even take care of myself.
I'm at the point where rent is due in two days and I don't know what to do. My roommate is a very kind person and she doesn't deserve that burden. I am planning on killing myself tomorrow, but she doesn't deserve that burden either.
I'm just so tired of hating who I am and I can't get help. I'm in therapy. I even tried going to the suicide chat lines tonight but the ones I checked out were full. I'm so so tired and it feels like I'm screaming into nothing.
So many people have done so much to try to help but it just keeps coming back around. I can't keep doing this. I spoke to my Dad but it came back to religion as usual.
I love him so much but I wish he was really listening to me. I put so much effort in the past few hours into convincing myself that it's my time to go but I'm posting here because I don't want to be alone. I always feel so fucking alone. I can't keep being here.
In college I spent so much time with people who made fun of my weight. I let them say whatever they wanted about me as a black man, and it really really fucked with me. I can't get their voices out of my head either.
I love improv and for awhile it kept me going. But I've missed so many shows and disappointed so many people, I feel like I can't even show my face in the scene anymore.
I keep thinking about how angry people will be with me for killing myself but I just can't anymore. I keep imagining myself in people's arms being hugged and feeling loved but it just doesn't happen.",31Dec2019,1

16,"Both my parents are Unfortunately likely not going to be with us soon. I promised my mother 30 years ago I wouldn't do anything to myself while she is alive. I think she believes I grew out of the way I've since childhood. I just don't talk about it. My wife knows I take medication for depression. Maybe for awhile I didn't want to with the kids and her love. Last month in a casual conversation with my wife. She said ""I loved her more than she loves me"" she didn't say it out of I'll will or malice.  Since then though the only positive thing I keep on thinking is I am a man of my word with my mother.",31Dec2019,1
17,"I am a 19 year old male. This is a throw-away account. I could go on for hours talking about my feelings and emotions that might have let me to feel like this. I am very confused on my sudden ""depressed"" state (I don't know if I should call it that). I won't be going into an enormous story of the potential causes of this as that would need me to try and comprehend all these factors that I myself can't even comprehend. I am sorry about the sentence structuring, choice of words and grammar as this is more of a rant and I am very out of energy. I just need some help.

This whole thing strangely started 2 days ago after an event called the ""contact music festival"" in Vancouver Canada ended. Before then I was fine mentally. I go to college and love the subject I am studying (although I do question sometimes if it is worth the risk pursuing this career path as it is very competitive and a financial and social and mental risk to pursue). I liked doing certain activities and interacting with people. To be honest, I haven't been the happiest person for a bit as I did have a very rough academic semester, but I have been fairly good mentally.

The festival was for two nights and I did happen to take MDMA for both nights with three hours of sleep in between (I say this because it could be a cause but I don't know). I had never taken MDMA before in my life or any other hard drug, and barely drink. I do smoke weed but not very occasionally. I had fun both nights, although I was very tired from the lack of sleep on my second night. At the end of the second night when it was all over I basically went home because of jaw pain (side effect of MDMA) and just a lot of neck pain from carrying people on my shoulder.

After I got home. Something just felt off about me. It's so hard for me to comprehend or even describe, but I got home and just had a sense of immense sadness (this may have been from the side effects of MDMA as it is common). It felt like that event was a 2 week escape from reality and now I snapped back into it. Though I was very tired so I just went to sleep.

The next morning (yesterday) was such a terrible day for me. I don't know why but I woke up and felt out of energy, not in the mood to do anything and I kind of just layed in bed for a couple hours. I had a good amount of sleep. I was completely disinterested in everything. I don't remember much of it even though it was yesterday, but I did nothing until my friend wanted to go shop so I decided to go just for the walk and see if that would make me feel better. I am usually a very social person so my friend noticed when I was silent for most of our time going shopping. I said it was because I was tired. I was indeed tired but also just at a very saddened state and I felt like returning home and letting all these impulsive depressive emotions out.

After I finally got home I went to my room and everything hit me

I spent many hours there just crying. I had completely lost interest in everything in my life. I felt confused in life now and was unsure of what I want to do. I felt so worthless and tired and I feel like life is so meaningless. All my hobbies that I enjoy and my subject in school that I loved for many years; I am starting to lose interest in everything. I spent about 4 hours crying spontaneously about many many thoughts and emotions. I've had some suicidal thoughts before but they were pretty mild compared to now. I pretty much cried until 1 am and was so tired that I fell asleep.

I woke up this morning feeling really good actually. I was confused on why I was so sad. I figured all the crying must of helped flush out some toxins and the MDMA long term side effects must have been the cause. I don't know when it happened, but I was on my computer and all these emotions from the previous day suddenly came back, and it was just as bad. I cried a lot just as before, and my suicidal thoughts were back. I would like to note that although I do get these suicidal thoughts, I would never commit it because I couldn't imagine what my parents would go through if I did it. Anyways, now here I am at night typing this out because I am scared that this is going to continue.

My side effects/feelings/emotions have been:

\-Constant sadness

\-sense of loneliness

\-constant fatigue/laziness/lack of motivation to do anything

\-anxiety

\-spontaneous crying

\-loss of appetite/nausea (I have not ate much for the past two days)

\-difficulty concentrating

\-constant negative thoughts

\-occasional suicidal thoughts

I'm sorry if this all sounds so stupid. It's probably so confusing to you reading this. I know two days isn't a long time at all but for me it has felt like a week. There is so much more I could talk about that might fill in the gaps but I won't bother unless you want me to since I could go on rambling about my mindset. I just thought it would be good to post this to make myself feel better. This might seem like I am going through an existential crisis, but I wouldn't categorize it as that since I have dealt with that before, and it was more of a chilling idea than the breakdown I am having right now. I am going to sleep after I post this. I will update my state if anyone wants me to. But if you actually did get this far, thank you :)",31Dec2019,1

I have been with an amazing person for almost two years now and I cannot shake the thought of them not really loving me or them really being with me just for themselves.

30,"I'm sure if I was some hunk I wouldn't be complaining about this but it just upsets me that people see me as less than because of certain surface level characteristics.

I read an attraction forum saying that women first look at a guys face. I don't have a chiseled face. I have a chubby face with a below average complexion. Even one girl says she checks out a guys hands. My hands are skinny and long and feminine, not big and manly. It just hurts to think that people look at me and think ""nope, next"" without even a second thought.

When I go out with my friends who are all better looking than me I already know that any girl that approaches us would see me as her last choice. I have good redeeming qualities but girls will just assume the good looking guy is more funny, interesting, and overall a better person. I hate it. It's even worse in college where everybody is even more  immature and inconsiderate.

Even if I found a girl to hook up with I would just think about how many other guys she would rather be fucking or how I was just at the right place at the right time

My only real friend (besides my wife) is a military veteran with substance abuse problems and PTSD, and hasn't been talking to me hardly at all lately.

I mean, I get that he's busy with work and his own family, but I feel like he wants nothing to do with me. 

I've had a dream about him telling me that there only way he can put up with me is with lots of, well, an illegal substance. Obviously he hasn't said that IRL, but the worry is there. If we physically hang out and visit, he seems okay, if a bit occupied on his phone, but he ignores my attempts to check in on him.

I burned out SO quickly at this job. It pays well, it's a huge office, but I don't do well with the 9-5 grind. The commute drains and stresses me out, people are confrontational on the transit, and my job feels monotonous.

I know I'm making a great decision for myself, knowing I am making some sacrifices. The only thing I feel guilty about is leaving my ""work"" friends behind. I've only been communicating with my boss via text about things after taking off from work for the past week.

I received a text yesterday from a work friend, and another one today from someone else with them voicing their concerns for me since I didn't text them. She was even ready to send someone for a wellness check, since she knows I'm out here all by myself with no friends or family.

 I consider many people I worked with to be some of my closest friends since moving here. How do I maintain friendships without burning bridges for quitting? I have so much support &amp; love from and for these people. I just can't work those hours with my depression. :(",31Dec2019,1
41,"2019 needs to die already this year has been nothing but hell on earth. Lost my aunt Bebe. This woman raised me and was always there in my time of need, she was my rock my fondation. Lost so many others as well. So much other shit as well, to much to talk about.

Die

42,"I am part of a 7 ppl group and we are fri 2 ends since 2 years and I considered them my close friends, 2 days ago, because of my mistake(unintentionally) indirectly misunderstanding happened between 3 of the people in the group, now I have apologised from my part but they verbally abused me, blocked me from social sites and told me to not talk to them. I had kept them really close by my heart and made them feel special everytime. I am really emotional at heart and I have never been through such hurting. Please someone help me.😣",31Dec2019,1

Im bleeding hard right now
I took lsd last night and feel like i don’t have a single drop of serotonin in my body
I hate to admit this but 2019 BEAT MY FUCKING ASS, and so did i.
I worked so hard in certain areas of life and so little in others...
The way i started this year was chaotic and stupid and i brought that energy through the whole year between friends family and someone that i cared a lot about. And now my dumbass is sitting on the floor just thinking like man......is this it?
Is this what i risked going to jail, sleepless nights, PTSD,  and so many other things for?
Just to still feel stuck and outta place......sus...very sus.....but at the end of the day i’m the only one who can fix my life....i want to go into 2020 humble....a new level of humble....not even a new level fuck that i just want to put more thought behind my actions because 2019 taught me how much the consequences hurt 
I miss my friends, i miss being younger and i miss j****
I hope i look back at this at the end of 2020 and know all my pain didn’t go in vain",31Dec2019,1
44,"I was doing so well. SO well. I mean, I’d feel down or stressed her or there, but not the kind where I couldn’t get out of bed or anything.

I blame the holidays. Or the post-holiday. Or maybe not. I dunno.

My husband and I didn’t really do the Christmas thing. We exchanged stockings but agreed on no gifts. The family (my husbands) agreed to no gifts among the adults, just the kids, and instead we’d take a trip as a family. It was 4 days, 3 nights with the in laws. All things considered it went well.

But we got home yesterday and I was exhausted. And disappointed. Like, Christmas isn’t how it was when I was a kid and it never, ever will be again. No magic, no surprises, no excitement. Just stress and money. And my own family will never be together because my parents split way back when I was a teen.

I just feel... disappointed. In holidays, in adulthood, in life. 

Tonight is a friends NYE party and I just want to stay home. But they’re also my neighbor so I can really get out of it.

My husband doesn’t know what to do. I’ve been crying since yesterday morning. I had trouble getting out of bed. I’m fine one minute, laughing at a joke, the next a wave of sadness hits me and I start sobbing.

I’m anxious about the future too. Stupid things. Like, what if the world ends? Kind of things. What if I die young? What if I never get better?

I had one more week until I go back to work and I beat myself up every holiday break I get that I didn’t spend any time relaxing. And now here I am fretting and my husband says it’s ok, you have the whole week. But to me it’s like omg I only have a week!! 

Sorry this is all stupid. I just wish I knew where the sadness came from. I was doing SO well.",31Dec2019,1
45,"I was hit by a drunk driver in November. I got some bruises, shock, and my car was deemed total loss, but it still works just fine thankfully. Since my accident, I went for a run in a violent snowstorm in St. Louis, slipped and fell on my back and hit the back of my head on the ground. It hurt a bit but I continued running. The knots on my head healed up eventually. I've seen like 5 different accident scenes around the areas since my accident back on 11/22. These past like 5 days, I've felt incredibly emotionally unsettled. I'm not in control of my emotions, and I feel so emotional inside my head, I can't speak that well. Today I feel is the worst because I'm extremely emotionally unstable, I feel out of control of my emotions, and just powerfully depressed. I've noticed I've been waking up around 6-630AM or so every morning even though I want to sleep more and refresh my mind, brain chemistry. I'm going to Finland in a week or so, for a week or so. People have been cold and rude to me in public recently as well, as well as over the phone unfortunately. I've been trying to keep marching on, but I don't feel interested, lively, confident, and vibrant like I usually do. Do you think this is depression genuinely or something else medically? Tell me your thoughts and thank you for listening and for your concern and human empathy. I care about you and your feelings too. I do hope you have a wonderful happy new year for yourselves. :).",31Dec2019,1
47,"I’m a mess. Everyone says “oh your doing great! Your doing so much BETTER than last year! You should be proud!”. But I’m not. I just pretend to be happy. I just pretend to be ok. I just pretend to be great. Well, I’m not great. I’m not ok. I’m not happy. I’ve never been happy. Everyone else my age isn’t thinking about the past and is so down they don’t know what to do. . Everyone else my age isn’t in a therapeutic school because they tried to end there life at 12. Everyone else my age isn’t stuck dwelling on the bad things. I could possibly be wrong because you never know, and if I am wrong and there is somebody out there like me than I feel you. I hate myself. Why can’t I be happy? Why can’t I reach my goals? Why can’t I be happy about the new year? 



I want to cry. But I’m not because I still have that invisible mask on me, making sure I pretend. I want to take it off, but if I do, then what will happen? If I show that I’m not doing well what will happen? I know what happens. People get upset. People walk around me like there on pins and needles. People want to help me but just make things so much worse. I don’t know what to do. I wish someone would just acknowledge that I’m 13 and I need help. I’m not doing it for attention! I’m not doing it to make you upset! I truly need help and nobody understands. 


I wish I could talk. Like really talk. Talk about my feelings. Talk about how I’m doing. But I can’t because I don’t want to worry anybody. I went to the therapist today but I acted all happy and I hate myself for it. I wish I showed my true feelings, but at the same time I’m glad I didn’t. 



I’m sorry for ranting. I just don’t know what to do right now. Thanks for reading this far. I appreciate it.",31Dec2019,1
48,"I've always had anxiety. I've never been officially diagnosed, but it's extremely obvious I have it. My mom also has it, and she has a history of depression as well. I think for me it's been building for years. I've always been the person to blame myself for everything, I always think I'm a failure somehow. I think my friends only hang around me out of pity, and that my family doesn't really like me (although I know these things to be untrue). Lately it's been getting worse, and I can't focus on things as well, I can't fall asleep at night, and I've been thinking about death all the time. I'm not suicidal, but everytime I go somewhere I think I could die in a car accident, someone could kidnap me and kill me, a bomb could go off, things like that. I often think the same things about my friends and family. My anxiety has also gotten much worse. While I'm not exactly tired, it's hard to do anything but the bare minimum like shower and eat. I don't know if all of this is because of my anxiety getting worse, I'm just going through a rough patch, or if I really do have depression. Any help would be appreciated.",31Dec2019,1
49,"I go from being really happy, smiley, laughing, and enjoyable most of the time to being angry, irritable, and depressed. My most common low is irritability and anger. Sometimes I’m flat out mean especially around those close to me. One of the lows I hate the most is that I’ll get these impulses of absolutely needing to buy something and I’ll go out and spend a bunch of money, then I’ll get super depressed later. Like today I had an urge to spend money around 4, went out and everything closed at like 5 so I didn’t buy anything and got super depressed and irritable.
Does anyone else ever feel like these? 
I used to get horrible seasonal depression, but I have moved and have been living in the south for about a year and don’t feel as bad in the winter like I used to which is a win. But I still get these random highs and lows. 
I’m diagnosed with depression and am on medication.  
Anyone else get like this?",31Dec2019,1
50,I just want to kill my self. No one cares about me and they don’t want to fix or help me. They always do what the suicide hotlines do which is tell me to seek a therapist which they aren’t helpful either. I just can’t get rid of my problems and no one else will either. I just don’t get how other people have overcome this stuff besides suicide. I might have aspergers and that’s something that can’t get rid of. I just don’t have any other options besides killing myself.,31Dec2019,1
