0,"So here is a list of techniques that I’ve noticed can really help..

- earplugs, or transparent flex sleep earplugs, to be specific. (If you’re self conscious or easily distracted by noisy people, Road noise, then these help with focussing on your own space, you can zone in your thoughts and focus on work you need to get done) really great if feeling low or helpless. You can still hear people talking as well, it just gets rid of all the other distracting noise.
- drawing, now, I draw faux album covers for bands, or future art, any sort of pencil drawing just makes you feel good, you feel like you’ve achieved something and it brings you into the moment, pretty cool.
- laying on the ground and starring at the sky, especially at night, but on a sunny day as well, it sends you into a meditative stage almost immediately, because the sky is endless and your eyes/brain can really focus on the 3D Beauty more so than you would realise until you try it.
- dressing well, semi casual, cool work pants, nice shirt, nice jumper, something to put you in a feeling of “being productive”, even if you feel down.
- rationalising your thoughts, so if you are thinking “this is going to be terrible”, changing that to, “maybe this will be alright, I’ll give it a go, alright let’s go!” “Handclap”, So being aware of thoughts, watching yourself as you think and changing the thought when needed. This takes a fair bit of concentration, but can help!
- deal with any urgent problems that you need to solve, that’s pretty important, because the urgent stuff is usually what is causing the depressive states. You feel anxious or worry and it could be over urgent things that need mending, now that’s hard, but writing down what needs urgent attention and then working to improve those things.
- ambient or chill music or radio instead of the news, or instead of any sort of low frequency media, can help with feeling more calm.
- water, sun, healthy food, just try it out, might find it helps!
- creating a busy schedule, now you might be thinking, if I’m depressed how will this be of any use right ?? Well, often having a lot of things do to can help in a few ways. You suddenly build a network of people to approach, even if you don’t like each other, and also, you are so busy that it could help you forget about your own depression or the causality of your depressive states.
- get a dog or a cat, if you can’t do this then obviously this won’t he’ll, but if it’s possible, get some pets, humans need connectivity of some kind.",03Dec2019,1

I'm not in debt or anything, I had a relly good time in school, and I made good grades in all my classes. I never really had issues with making things in college, I've always been able to do somthing even if I was having trouble with certain projects. After graduation though ive struggled with anxieties about my future that eventually turned in to depression. Im struggling to make any art, once I get started on a project I enjoy it but having the energy to just start somthing seems like too much for. I cant even seem to come up with as many ideas as i used to in college. I dont get it, It just seems like I'm struggling through life right now. I don't know how to start my career and I'm really doubting my self even though I've had colleagues and local professionals from a portfolio meet up say my work looks promising and I just need to keep making things. I'm starting to get to the point where I'm immobilized by my thoughts and I just want to stay in bed all day. I just feel like im giving up on my career before ive even tried to do anything.

I'm tired of not being met half way. I'm tired of being restricted just to keep the peace so things don't get worse. I'm tired of having to do everything alone and feeling lost. I'm tired of being trapped. 

I have come so far with these stupid diseases, and I pretend I'm doing ok because it's so pointless to try anymore when I know what to expect from the people around me. I try to pretend everything is ok because I get criticized if I say anything.

I'm okay in my room, but I can't sleep at night, I feel this constant emotional pressure on me, I don't have any friends, I never feel safe here, I don't like eating, I can't walk outside my room without some sort of music playing, and every time I walk by someone in the halls, even if I see them coming beforehand, I jump in fear

I’ve been agnostic for like 10 years because in my mind an atheist technically can’t prove a god doesn’t exist, anyway, I understand an atheist rejects theism, but I guess I’m just mad they don’t even really care what I am faith-wise, and my fiancé has not quite got my (lack of?) faith right either. 
My fiancé has otherwise really had my back and he said he will clear up my beliefs and he bends over backwards to help me feel like we will be ok. The Mom is actually sending me flowers and saying the dad will soften but I just feel like they suck because I’ve paid a lot of dues in life and I just don’t appreciate the bullshit. 
I understand paying your dues but I’ve battled all kinds of poverty and physical sexual and emotional abuse and years of therapy and have become a very successful engineer with advanced degree and been kind to these people.
I guess some people in my position could deal with this but I was abused for 17 years by alcoholics and I never wanted mean people around again and that family, they use their wealth to be mean, and it sucks. I’m sorry I’m terrible with words when I’m sad.

15,"I've been struggling a bit lately, my depression is getting a lot harder to control. When my mind is in a bad place, I tend to conjure up a bunch of hypotheticals and fantasies in my mind to put it in an even worse place. It never starts as a conscious decision, but once I acknowledge it happening, I pretty much just let it happen. I know it's bad for me and I don't actually WANT to do it, but it's the only thing my mind seems motivated to do, so I keep thinking that way as if it is something I want to do. I imagine my friends and family getting fed up with me and turning on me. I imagine getting in a heated argument with them that leads to hurtful words. I imagine strangers saying and doing awful things to me. I imagine teachers humiliating me in class. It's getting really bad. Does anybody else have a similar problem? When you're upset you come up with absurdly awful scenarios in your head to make you feel worse? I've never hurt myself physically, but I worry what I'm doing mentally may be a form of self harm.

16,"So I'm going to see a therapist (via my university) for the first time in a few days and I'm nervous as fuck. When I first made the appointment (a month ago), I was in a really bad headspace. Barely functional, skipping class, not eating. Honestly I really needed help then but they didn't have any slots available until a month out. 

Since then I've been slightly better, but now I don't know how to clearly vocalize how I'm feeling. But at least then I had a clearer idea of what I wanted to get out of my session. Currently I'm functional enough to (sometimes) work out, and at least attempt better eating/sleeping patterns. To be clear, I don't know if I'm depressed; I can be functional enough when I absolutely have to be. I don't really feel 'bad' right now, I just feel 'neutral'. Is that something even worth talking to a therapist about? I feel like I should cancel if I can't figure out how to say anything tangible.

This is what is eating away at me. I’m severely depressed and am struggling to love myself. I’m incredibly anxious all the time and everyday it’s getting harder to put on the mask of pretending I’m ok. It’s just tough because I’m scared to talk about my depression because of the worry it will be dismissed off as a “cutesy” problem that’s not truly realized for its severity since on paper my life is great.

Recently it’s gotten so bad I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, which has made me even more scared since death is one concept that makes me extremely anxious. Furthermore spiraling me out of control with my depression and anxiety.

I'm just gonna jump straight into it as I'm not very good at talking about this type of shit (like most of us probably)
I've been more or less depressed for about 4-5 years, with good and bad periods. In the last year I've been on a couple of long trips to other countries (around 3 months x2), ans during those trips I've been almost constantly ""happy"", or at least not depressed. Both times when I've come home I've felt like shit though, and last time I relapsed into some self harm. This is a year ago and I've been clean since and haven't had the urge so that's not the issue.
Today my therapist said he thinks he should try medication and told me to talk to a doctor.
I don't know whether or not to do it, on one hand I definitely want to try it, I'll do anything to tell better. On the other hand it feels a bit stupid to do this because I know when I go travelling again in February I'll probably feel better.
Please, if you have any tips or advice from what helped you I would love to hear it!

25," Tl;dr at bottom

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so.

I wish there were more people out that feel the same way I about community groups in local area. Don’t get me wrong, life was great when Becky was around she made Mind feel tolerable and when she didn’t we would have a right life in her flat about a few people as we got higher it became more funny 😁 but that horrible person K arrived on scene I knew her a previous client and then she started taking piss of clients in really bad way in a way that was public and not between two close friends and she started saying stuff like I wish I was anorexic, I could never be anorexic I love food too much, perhaps I should stop eating or “you look too fat” to someone who spent 2 years in a psychiatric ward trying to recover. She would also say hurtful things Bulimics,  schizophrenias, psychosis, addicts, alcoholics you name it she would take the piss when staff weren’t around or tell some with scars who embarrassed, ashamed etc Instead of buying a cover cream she would give them videos (to make it worse) or give them tools suggestions etc or instead of directing someone to saying she would direct them to a train stn knowing what they would do. 

Anyway it’s now. A couple of years since I last went and I am still feeling that’s it’s having a psychological impact on how I feel, but I still see her in the high street she’s never reprimanded only for carrying weed etc as in her Christian community she is saint and doesn’t say those things to people, she helps out at learning disability groups as she has one herself. 

But since she mind has gone now forever people have all disbanded and what was a nice positive community of people with mh went sour very quickly the art cafe group I went never believed what i said about her and just felt left out and then community in my area went down it was no longer a place I felt at home or felt safe, it’s a place I would avoid and I even do my shopping elsewhere now. 

The people that did remain friends just in sainsburys in the afternoon and talk mindless nonsense and if L arrives then expect to wanting a bottle of wine or too many glasses of cherry afterwards as her voice is extremely emotionless flat like they’ve switched off her brain or she doesn’t have one to begin with. I always find myself yawning,nodding off everytime I see in. 
I tried to respectful and understanding but says every thing that comes to her like she’s reading a shopping list or reading the numbers of the bar code and has hours chat in her flat voice over weekly grocery shopping, what she got when she I got, what day time, it’s bar code, special offers and a running commentary of her day.
