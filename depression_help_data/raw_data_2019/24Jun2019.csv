1,"My story is...my father had a stroke last year and is now paralyzed and in a nursing home.  Hes 80 yrs old and we all know he will eventually pass away living in that nursing home. My issue is the fact that today he cried when me and my mother left,she is also 80 yrs old. It is always heartbreaking having to leave him there feeling like that. I feel so guilty that I'm not able to take care of him myself or afford an in home care provider. Its sooooooooo sad i swear. What do i do,how am i supposed to feel. It literally makes my chest hurt thinking about it and i think about it all the time. I'm only 40 yrs old and i know that one day i will be here without him but i think it's harder knowing that he's here and i cant help him. Dads are supposed to be super heroes, why did this end up like this? Plz tell me how to overcome this guilt of being helpless and the unbearable feeling of sadness....",24Jun2019,1
2,"I'm having severe coughing after meals. I called a 24-hour nurse's line, and I got a rude nurse that kept telling me I wasn't describing my symptoms properly. It can be hard sometimes to find words for your symptoms! Why'd she have it be rude? I wanted to shout expletives at her, but of course I didn't. After the end of an uncomfortable phone call that last for about twenty minutes, she asked me what I would have done if I hadn't called the nurses line and when I reply ""I probably would've gone to the hospital"", she rebuked me, saying Emergency Room's are for ""Emergencies only.""  
When I'm having these coughing fits, it makes me feel like I'm about to die from choking. I'm also having ear pain, stuffy and tender nose, globus sensation, and a whole host of other symptoms. I went to my PCP about my cough, but she basically called me a hypochondriac and said I need to ""calm down."" How can I calm down when I'm having all these unpleasant symptoms??? I want to go to the Emergency room, but I don't have a way to get there. I'm so angry at myself and the world. I actually went to a walk-in clinic down the street about the cough, and they diagnosed me with strep throat and gave me antibiotics. My PCP could've swabbed my throat easily, but did she? No!!! SHE THINKS I'M CRAZY!

On top of all this, I can't find a job and I can't find a place to live. My lease ends soon, but I don't know where I'm gonna go. I don't want to stay here, because the apartment is infested with cockroaches. I don't have any friends. I don't have any money. I don't have any self-esteem. Why can't I just die already? Why can't whatever is causing these symptoms KILL ME ALREADY??! I don't want to live anymore. I'd rather be dead than live like this. Nobody cares about me. My father hasn't been in my life since I was five. My mom and step-dad are verbally abusive. My grandfather helps me financially, but he also clearly resents it. 

I don't have the courage to end it all, but by God I wish I did! It's not that hard if I could just get over the fear and do it. But no, my survival instinct prevents me from even attempting to end my life. So I sit in my apartment and suffer. I've been applying to jobs, going to interviews, trying to go out and socialize, but nothing ever works. What's wrong with me? Why am I such a failure? Why did I have to be born? Why couldn't my mother have gotten an abortion or something?",24Jun2019,1
3,"Posting this so people know they are not alone. I experienced depression a few years ago and honestly, the world does make you feel like you have to hide it. God forbid you’re not happy or “get over” troubles in a timely manner. If you’re feeling depressed or know someone who is, be patient. Depression makes you feel like you are lost in the darkness. All your hope has been taken away or lost…….but you have to know there is always light and you need to find it. There is always something or someone that can be your light, your hope, your focus. Mine was my son because I knew he needed me; needed me to be strong. So many times I wanted to give up, give in and let myself become consumed. You have to stand up, brush yourself off and punch life in the teeth, give it the double middle finger. Know that there are people who love you and couldn’t imagine their life without you. Life is hard; it’s a straight bitch sometimes. We all struggle, make mistakes and deal with things we never expected. Don’t hide your pain, get support from friends, family, a therapist: whatever it takes. Don’t feel ashamed; it’s ok! Take it one day at a time, one step at a time. Your small steps will all add up to changes toward feeling better. The important thing is to be there for each other and give hope a fighting chance.",24Jun2019,1
4,"My anxiety and depression are really bad these days since I returned home from college (summer break). Weirdly enough, I miss the noise of people talking and hanging out, specially in my dorm, and now that I've come back home I feel pretty depressed with all the silence. My dad is working, my mom is pretty quiet, they both go to sleep before 9pm, and my house is pretty far away from the city (no buses, and I don't drive) so nowhere I can go. I'll be here for a month and a half, and I think the silence and lonely feeling will drive me crazy.

Ok, finally the question: do you guys know of any streamer or youtuber (gaming or studying) that is not over the top like most? Just a chill person to watch while I'm doing my own thing?",24Jun2019,8
5,"It’s been roughly a year, I recently moved out of my parents house around this time last year. And it’s all gone to shit... I guess I rushed into adulthood faster then I should. Was promised a job from my mother in law. That only lasted 3 weeks. I’ve been bouncing from warehouse to warehouse job for the last year. I feel disconnected from my own life. Worthless... like I don’t belong. 

My relationship with my SO is rough. There’s days where it’s the ideal relationship, and days where I feel like I’m the only one loving and actually trying. My relationship with my own family is little to none. I don’t have the courage to say what’s really going on. Idk I would rather people not care about me. Not worry or pressure me about what’s going on. But I’m at the end of my road and my last options are dark. I can’t keep a job, can’t keep a place, can’t hold a conversation with family and friends. I’m so numb and hollow. I cry randomly throughout the day, suicidal scenarios play out in my head all throughout the day. “What if I wasn’t around? People wouldn’t have to worry. I wouldn’t have to live a life I feel like I don’t deserve”.  I’ve contemplated actually doing it numerous times. Just can’t choose on how and where as in stuck babysitting majority of the days.  I feel like I’m rambling all over the place but it’s how I am at this point. I have no structure in life. My schedule consists of doing everything for everyone else and then sleep. I feel useless and more importantly worthless.",24Jun2019,1

9,"I've had depression for about eight years now. I have a lot of self-esteem issues, weight issues, and self-image issues.

11,"It's my first time posting here so please excuse me if I'm doing anything incorrectly.

So to start, my girlfriend is currently pregnant for at most a few weeks. The pregnancy was unexpected but she wants to keep the baby because it's a miracle since doctors have told her throughout her life that she will never have kids. Because she wants to keep it, I tell her that I will care for him/her with her, despite my inconvenient current situation and me not feeling like I was not ready to be a father. Despite all that, I was motivated to make sacrifices and change myself. We had planned a week ago that we would move in together in January.

She told me today that she wanted to break up because she felt like I had a mindset that everything was important except the baby.  I was confused and shocked by the fact that she thought that. We talked it out and it turned out to be a huge misunderstanding of some things I have said that came off the wrong way through text.

I thought everything was resolved after that talk but she tells me about an hour later to not talk to her tomorrow and that she needs time to herself.

I'm really anxious right now and I've never been so upset with a relationship mishap before. I'm probably overthinking it but there's just that little part of me that thinks the worst of the worst.",24Jun2019,1
12,"I have this horrible self esteem issues and I'm very self conscious about myself. I have a very plumpish figure, i compensate the lack of exercise with IF and calorie count. The reason why there's a lack of exercise is due to insecurity, embarrassment and fear.  The fear of people making fun of me, judging me while I clumsily exercise and get out of breath. 

My psychiatrist has been trying and trying to push me. Questioned me if it really matters if they judged, when my health is concern. I know what's right and what's wrong. I know that it shouldn't matter. I know that my health is much more important than what others think. I just can't manage to bring myself to do it. Its a struggle. He lost it and calmly said he won't see me until I do something. After the appointment I left and I head to the restroom and bawled my eyes out. Hes somebody dear to me, and I always look forward to seeing him every week. I'm so useless that i am unable to muster the courage to exercise to the extent of him not wanting to see me. I am beyond useless and hopeless. It's better to die than to confront the person who listens to you when you have let them down.

13,"I need help.

17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. 

I've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. 

I've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. 

I've always felt alone.

When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.

As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. 

My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. 

Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. 

I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.

Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.

I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. 

I've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. 

I started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.

I've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.

I'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. 

I fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down. I fear I'll lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick. 

I contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. 

The hurdle of death is my prison.",24Jun2019,16
14,"My name is Michael, I'm not a blogger nor am I a writer but I  wanted to share my story.
 June 2015 I suffered a stroke and before this happen I had a heart attack(congestive heart failure) in January 2009. At the time of the heart attack I was working in law enforcement which I think contributed to me having this along with poor eating habits. 
 I was in the hospital for the better part of a month and many of you know being in a hospital that long can lead you to having some pretty bizarre thoughts so I think that was the start of my first bout with depression. Never having dealt with it I didn't recognize or understand  what I was going through so I never got help with it, but I knew something wasn't right. Moving along to June 2015 as I mentioned I suffered a stroke which paralyzed me from my upper thighs down and I had no feeling at all and was wheelchair bound and most of the time bed ridden and it really took a major toll on me and my life. After being told 3 times that I'd never walk again and really not being able to do anything for myself, it put me in a very dark place and that's where I  started recognizing what I felt in 2009 but on a different level. I was hearing things, I was seeing things and having vivid dreams about death and I  was the killing myself each time. I also felt physical pain, inside I was so afraid but didn't wanna tell anyone about what I was going through so I put up a fake smile and pretended to be happy when I really was dying on the inside. What brought everything to the point where I wanted to end everything was one day I was home alone my son was at school and I was very thirsty so I rolled over to the fridge to get water but it was all the way to the back of the fridge. Keep in mind at the time I was in a very small wheelchair because I couldn't afford one for my size, and when I reached to get the jug the chair tilted forward and I almost was thrown out of it. Filled with anger and disgust feeling like I was burden to everyone I rolled the chair to my room and I was crying I couldn't see straight my head was fogged up I went to my closet and grabbed my AR15 and rolled back to the kitchen table put 2 shells in the clip, put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. To my surprise the gun didn't fire so now I'm really crying and pained I pulled the trigger again and the gun didn't shot again something it's never done before. I felt so low because I  said I can't even do this right, took the gun threw it on the floor and went to get all my pills I knew that would work as I'm coming down the hallway something said look up and when I did I saw a picture of both my kids and I  screamed so loud crying thinking about what I almost did, still holding my box of pills. I almost took myself from my babies!! Not even 20 minutes after all this happened my mom walked in my house and I grabbed her crying I've never hugged and held onto my mom so hard in my life. I started telling her about what I was about to do and what I had been going through I INSTANTLY started feeling a calm come over me. For years I was embarrassed to tell anyone my story and how God spared my life that day.

And a couple off times I have had panic and anxiety attacks in front of everyone and some people have said I do it for attention and I hate it I wish I could just say go fuck yourself but I just can't sometimes I won't talk for days and I'll just hmm my words

17,"I hope this isn't ...trivial? for this subreddit.

Basically I've always been lucky with my teeth in so much as they grew straight, I haven't had to have had my wisdom teeth taken out, and they've not caused me pain.

On the other hand I seem to get cavities fairly easily... even when I was brushing regularly(?!). I had many filled in my teenage years.

**It's kinda embarrassing. I know I have to, I know it's gross not to, but even after having had so many fillings (I don't know how many), something will happen and I stop brushing my teeth often enough.**

Usually it's ... ... well the point is, at least a year ago (but IDK how long really) I went to the dentist in the first time in ages, and had a few fillings, and was warned that lots of other spots were showing early signs of decay, but if I looked after them, used the right products et cetera, that they wouldn't necessarily become cavities, if I was lucky.

So for half a year to a year, I brushed my teeth thrice a day (after I woke up, after lunch, &amp; after dinner), flossed them twice (morning &amp; night), &amp; used mouthwash at least twice a day. Both the toothpaste and mouthwash were fluoridated.

Lots of things happened in my life, but I kept it going. I then made the, in my case spectacularly a stupid decision, to stop taking my antidepressants.

Some time after that ... focus shifted? I was so determined to function without them, after all I was hoping that maybe the negative effects of the antidepressants were blocking me from success? IDK it's a long story. I was out of money and leeching off like seven people to just get by...

*Anyhow, somewhere along the line ... I simply stopped taking care of my teeth entirely.*

***It's been six months.***

I've since started performing all my dental hygiene again, but the damage is done, and I'll pay the consequences, whatever they are precisely.

I don't think I'm going to lose any teeth, but...

***How on earth am I supposed to ensure that future!me won't mess up again so horribly?***

*It wasn't as if I hadn't formed a habit, I'd been doing it all properly for months and months.*

*So what do ... how do I actually ensure I follow through with basic hygiene in the long term?*

I've had nightmares for the past week about my teeth falling out, and I've made sure I returned to proper dental care, but... long term...

I don't know how to explain how my mind works when my depression is at its worst, at least not in text; but I'm hopeful that some people here have some, well, advice, on not breaking a habit. Or creating one properly...

21,"My cousin/best friend, Angie, is studying overseas right now. She's feeling a little down because she has to retake a paper. 

Yesterday, my aunt (Angie's mom) called me to ask if Angie was ok. My aunt was losing sleep because she was worried that Angie was depressed. My cousins, John and Zoe, who were studying in the same country as Angie told my aunt that Angie seemed depressed. John and Zoe meet Angie around once every three month. My aunt chats with Angie everyday, but Angie is the type to always present a nice front to her mom. 

I was perplexed. I video chat with Angie once every few days and while she complained about the weather and shitty roommates a little more than usual, she seemed fine. However, Zoe is clinically diagnosed with depression so I'm inclined to believe that she may have seen some signs of depression that I didn't spot.

I'm seeking advice on how to proceed. Should I:

1) *Tell Angie what is going on and ask if she's feeling more down then usual.* Angie and I are straightforward people and I'm sure she would rather someone just ask her if she's depressed. The flaw with this is that she would 100% be pissed that people were whispering behind her back, especially since her mom was so negatively affected. Plus, John and Zoe might be blamed and I can't see that being good for Zoe. The good thing is we can clear things up quickly and help her if she's depressed. 

2) *Keep quiet and observe.* The flaw with this is that we'll all be behaving based on assumptions. If Angie is depressed, it will just fester while we do things behind her back to try to help her. The good thing is, if Angie isn't depressed, this will blow over without a fuss. 

I'm wondering which would be the better course of action?",24Jun2019,3

I have a few really good friends, a full time job which I don't mind and a super loving family.
I'm tired, I am tired of being tired. 
I can't go more than a couple of days without feeling absolutely worthless, I know I have people around me that care but that does not stop these feelings ocuring constantly, some afternoons I'll lye in bed crying for hours, recently even at work on my bad days (which is almost every second) I can't help but cry
A few months ago in our old rental there was a rope dangling out the back from a gazebo we had set up, I wrapped the rope around my neck whilst looking at myself in the reflection crying pulling it tighter and tighter to the point I couldn't breathe, it hurt like fuck but the tighter I pulled the better the hurt felt.
I don't want to kill myself, but most days I feel like not being here would be so much easier than having this pain inside my head.

24,"I have quite the tale. Since this whole situation is so complicated I'm just gonna tell the whole story:  
It all started about 8 months ago when my friend added a someone on Discord. My friend was part of a ""clan"" for an old retro game, the person he added was actually the best at this game, not one of the best, the hands down best player, so my friend really looked up to this person. I'll refer to this person as ""Tofu"" for the rest of the story

Recently due to drama their clan had dissolved but my friend kept talking to Tofu, after about a month Tofu made the confession that she was a woman using a male identity on the internet, because she didn't want people to treat her different just because she was a woman. Up until this time nothing had been out of the ordinary, though after this things just started to get worse and worse. My friend started staying up really really late to play games with her, he told me he couldn't get himself to say no because he looked up to Tofu so much.  
Then she started getting angry for no reason and my friend would have to beg for forgiveness. She then started having him call her mistress and she would call him pet. At one point she started telling him all these weird things like that she wanted my friend to follow her guidance because ""she knew best for him"" and other really manipulative stuff. She even told him how he should design his Steam profile and what his profile picture and Steam name should be.

For reference this is really out of character for my friend, he's always talking about how much freedom means to him. He's never taken relationships very seriously before, in fact I think he's even told me he didn't want a relationship to take over his life because it would ruin his freedom. This... Thing he had going with Tofu technically wasn't a romantic relationship because she was a lesbian but she definitely still got off on this power thing he had over him.

My friend was really embarrassed about this whole thing and how much it ended up meaning to him. I was the only one of our friends he had told about all this. He wrote to me regularly during this time and told me stories about all this stuff that happened to get it all off his chest. I tried multiple times during these conversations we had to tell him that Tofu was taking advantage of him and that this whole thing was only gonna get worse. Sometimes he actually agreed with me but he never wanted to remove her from his friend list.

Then a few days ago my friend was talking to another one of his online friends. This guy he had been talking with on and off with for 6 years or something like that. Then he told him about Tofu and because the guy got angry over something he then contacted Tofu and told her that my friend had leaked her secret about being a woman. Then she got mad, blocked my friend and my friend has been absolutely ruined since then. He was at my place for a few days right after this happened so I got to see how bad it is. When he's sober he literally doesn't think about anything but her, he relates everything back to her and when he talks he just wants confirmation about how he feels. He'll say stuff like ""this isn't fair is it?"" or stuff like that. He got drunk twice in the few days he was at my place and when drunk he somehow is able to think a lot more clearly. During those times he's actually able to talk about what happened rationally. I can actually get through to him when he's sorta drunk, though obviously alchohol isn't a healthy way to deal with problems. He says he's laying off alchohol currently because he said he didn't wanna be an alchoholic at age 18.  
He took home yesterday. An hour or so ago he wrote to me, something about that Tofu hadn't deleted literally every single message she had sent him and that it might be a sign that she is going to unblock him or something like that. I'm worried that he's just going through their messages all day and getting even worse. I've told him a billion times that he's just gonna get worse if he keeps focussing on something he can't control anyway but he's in this state where he doesn't want to get better, he just wants to talk to her again. Any help? Can I do anything for him at this point? I'm starting to doubt that there's more I can do for him, but I'm open to any suggestions.",24Jun2019,2
26,I (21M) have not  been feeling like myself for the past 2 years and it seems to get worse every month. Back in high school I always felt super liked and motivated to do well. Now sometimes I feel like there is no point in living my life and I always feel like people don’t like me including my best friends and people I just met. I also can’t stop using drugs on the weekends and can never have a good time with my friends without getting super fucked up on alcohol which always leads to me using other drugs. I want to quit but I never do.Sometimes I get angry when I’m drunk and have these episodes of me freaking out. I have cut myself 3 times all when I’m drunk and was mad and made a irrational decision. I did the other day and I feel like shit because all of my friends know about it and I don’t know why I did it. I want to know what’s wrong and how I can feel like my old self again.,24Jun2019,7

28,"I have been suffering from depression for the past 5 years since i was 12.At the start of this year my depression got much worse the difference this time being that i had all the usual symptoms except i lost my appetite(lost over 10kg)and felt this very intense sadness that made me want to kill myself just to make it stop.I felt emotionally exhausted.i told myself i wanted to stop feeling any emotions at all.well i regret it,it feels so much worse when i am “numb” than when i am sad because i feel like myself at least and not like an entirely different person.To get to the point,for the whole past two weeks i have been feeling numb and am unable to cry and all of a sudden every event and failure  in my life that used to make me cry suddenly dosen’t make me feel sad/like crying as it would have in the past.i will say though that my anxiety has gotten worse as i am unable to let my emotions out and express them i get very anxious and am unable to stay still.i feel like i am going crazy.I haven’t fixed my problems and am definitely not happy.any advice would help greatly.thank you",24Jun2019,5
30,"Hi guys, it's the second time that I'm suffering from mild depression. The first time happened some years ago after a break-up, and now the cause is my job.
I'd like to know if it's normal that it is so physical, I mean, I usually feel a sudden oppression in the chest together with the anxiety and I have to stand up, or go and drink some water. I'm finding it strange.
I'm also losing nights of sleep and I began to wish to drink alcohol to stop thinking (but I didn't do it).
Thank you.",24Jun2019,1
31,"This is probably gonna be all over the place. I haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional because I'm too terrified to tell my parents, but all the hallmark symptoms are there. General sadness, loss of interest, unmotivated, always tired, self-loathing, urges to self-harm, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 16, homeschooled (somehow managed to get incredibly behind, which adds to the depression), and I have no friends irl. I have online friends, and I trust them with just about anything. I've been half-tempted to give my address to one of them incase I end up doing something uh...rash, if you know what I mean. But anyways, they're good friends at heart, but a majority of them are absolutely AWFUL at helping. I don't blame them. This isn't something you can just slap a band-aid over. Most of the time they'd end up arguing, going something like:

  
""tim needs this""  
""no, he needs this instead""

""that wont help""  
""you don't know that""

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually just...shut down for a few weeks. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't interact with anyone, I was offline on multiple places. This caused my friends to get worried, and a few of them started some discord intervention group chat thing. I only know about it because one of my friends there actually understood what I meant, what I was talking about, etc. So he joined just to tell me what was going on. It ended up being an argument between two of my friends over what way to best help me. Despite the fact I told them about 40 times that I just wanna be listened to. Now, this was MONTHS ago, but it still frustrates me somehow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should tell my parents, I know I should get up and do something, I know it doesn't magically get better, but this immense amount of fear and anxiety prevents me from doing so. It doesn't help that my family constantly makes half-serious remarks such as: 

&amp;#x200B;

""Tim you're no fun"", ""Tim, stop being boring"", ""Tim just hates fun"", etc. But they wonder why I don't wanna be around them. Its frustrating. Every time I try to do something, it seems to do absolutely nothing, or I just end up failing. I've tried getting out more, spending less time on my PC, etc. but at this point the only thing that could maybe help is a therapist, and I'm too terrified to say anything. At this point, theres only three things keeping me from jumping off a nearby bridge:   


1. Christianity. Say what you want, I don't care, but its one of the few things keeping me alive.

2. My friends. 

3. Causing my family the same pain I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its infuriating knowing what I should do but being too scared to do it. My step-dad yells even when he doesn't mean to, he starts arguments over almost nothing, he can be sensitive, he's the biggest hypocrite I know, but at his core, he's a good person. My mom is too over-protective, she gets too worried and too panicky over everything. Before they let me move my PC to my room, any time I laughed anything, my mom would ask ""what are you laughing at"", ""what are you playing"", etc. Shes paranoid. And I don't like the idea of telling her about depression because of it. My step-dad is more relaxed when it comes to issues like this, but I'm afraid he'll just tell my mom, and I can't trust my siblings either. They'd all go to my parents despite what I say. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.   


My brain is always foggy, I can never think straight. I feel like I locked myself in my own brain. I don't like being edgy or depressing all the time but I can't help it anymore. My friends get worried if I make too many depression or suicide jokes. I'm getting sick and tired of waking up to self hatred, tiredness, and general sadness. I'm frustrated. I've been like this a full year already and I see that number increasing unless I either kill myself or actually get help. It doesn't matter how well my day goes or how bad it goes, I still hate myself and end up almost breaking down at the end of the day regardless. I'm just lucky I don't think I'm ugly I guess. I hate everything else about me, but my looks? Nah thats fine. Apparently.

32,"Every since my grandad died (about 2014 I think) I’ve been in a state of sadness at first I thought it was just grieving but it’s gotten worse over time as my parents have split up, my brother’s turned to drugs and is hurting his girlfriends. I feel useless. There’s nothing I can do to stop this, recently I’ve started cutting myself and I can’t stop now, I can’t stop feeling so useless and such a mistake. I have friends who have done the same before but they keep on saying I shouldn’t do it and I always say I won’t and I feel like if i tell them they will be disappointed in me. No one knows I cut except myself (hopefully) and I always put on a fake smile, laugh and all that for my friends and family. Just today my brother had gotten arrested for domestic violence to his recent girlfriend and I never thought it would come to that but it did. I feel even worse as if we had stopped him earlier he would be better and I can’t stop feeling like it’s my fault. I listen to depressing music while cutting because it makes it better (if you know what I mean) Well I’m gonna go now before it gets too long.

35,"I'm reaching out for help here because I really don't know where to turn to. I'm 44 and have 3 young kids. The last 5 years have been hell and I don't know how to get out of it. The situation with my wife is in limbo due to infidelity on my part. We are basically staying together because we can't financially raise the kids alone. So we live in the same house more like house mates than spouses.

I have been staying at home for the last 1.5 years to watch the kids because we can't afford child care. I have been only able to work part-time only when she comes home from work and this has added to my depression. I have been clinically diagnosed and have been committed because of a suicide attempt about 3 years ago. I'm trying to turn my life around now. I just got into a coding bootcamp and will be starting next month full time for 9 months. There is a lot riding on this because if I get through it, I can provide some financial stability for my kids then I can currently. This will be a full time commitment in addition to part time work at night. From my past experience, I know that stress and other factors that cause stress will send me into a deep depression. To remedy this I have implemented the recommendations that Jordan Peterson gives about making a schedule, having a routine, and watching my diet so that it helps my mood regulation. But I suspect that I might need the help of anti-depressant medication to stay on course for this one. I have resisted medication in the past because I always associated the need for medication as a sign of weakness and also I didn't want any of the side effects of taking them. But history has shown me that this might be foolish because I haven't been able to deal with life so far without them. 

The problem I have now is that I don't have insurance and I can't afford to go to a psychologist. Are there any avenues for  people in my situation to get help?

36,"I have suffered from depression since I was 14 and had a tough time in school and Sixth Form. There were several things that happened during this time that I’m still recovering from and in the past I’ve made a lot of decisions I regret and wish I could change. 

Last night my snapchat memories brought up a photo from a particularly tough time and it kinda brought back a lot of past feelings. I’m now in my 3rd year of my degree and managed to move away from the peers that caused me this distress and into much healthier friendships. But I’m home for the summer with no local friends and I’m having a tough time of it. 

Being home is a reminder of everything that’s happened. When I’m at uni I forget about it and think I’m okay until something brings it back and then I get so angry and upset about the things that happened that I think I’ll never be okay again. 

Does anybody have any advice for letting go/moving on from the past so that I can fully embrace the future?

37,"Hello beautiful people, I'm new here and i see a lot of good and awesome people si I'd like to share my life with you guys.

Since I was a child was very hard to me to interact with other and to integrate in society mostly because i come from a poor but a decent family that have thought me to respect and be decent. I always bullied and I've lost all my self-esteem, since high school I've started programming and look my life in front of the computer, had just a close friend, in high school i had only one relationship with a girl that dumped me. That and a ton of shit of events in family like losing the house we lived in made go even lower with self-esteem and trust in me and the other.
After the high school my parents decided to take the risk and made me go to university, since i was passionate in programming I've decided to play along with that, since year 2 of university a teacher saw me and employed at his small business as a PHP developer (forgot to mention, I've always helped people and put them on the first place over me, sometimes they even use me, teachers and olders always thought about me as a small, good and smart child, even tho I'd feel like no one cares and i was pretending to smile even if i was crying and screaming inside). 
Anyway, he employed me in second year, and the third year i wal all over the place i had little to no time job and as a student, had to take the bachelor degree, projects, i wanted to read psychology, was all circles around books, depression, music, job and sometimes by the university to take exams.
After the bachelor degree, i meet with old colleagues from 4th grade, and there was a girl with that i drove home and started talking... After that we continued to meet and talkas friends, after a month or so i found myself attached to her and really liked her a lot and i still do. I've told her that and he rejected me, saying that I'm not her type.. And now we speak rarely and get out once a month or so... Even now i look in her eyes and want to kiss her amd hug her but i can't... Now he is seeing another one... Still can't move over
Now I'm 23, living all by myself in a small rented apartment, having one remote job and one full time job, no friends, no relationship, no one to talk, only in weekends i go visit my family and help them with what i can.
I find myself in a circle, wakes up, coffee, shower, work, home, work crying reading books or listening to music sleep and all over again... I find very hard to interact with people, finding new friends, i have trust issues and i look at the mirror and i see a ugly face that i hate more every day.

38,"As the title says, I dont feel like myself at the moment. I have a good job as an assistant teacher at a local daycare and absolutely love my kids, they're everything to me.

I called out of work friday and today for what I say is menstrual cramps but it's not, I mean a sliver of it is but I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I get in these moods where I feel like I'm worthless and cannot do anything to make myself feel better. I cleaned the house today just to feel like I'm productive since I didnt go to work. I just dont know what's going on with me, i feel like my family has disowned me ever since I was honest about a sexual assault within my family, my step brother &amp; I, ever since that has come out I feel hostile from my family. I try to be brutally honest and my father doesnt even want to hear it. I dont feel the need to self harm or do anything I would regret but, its eating me from the inside out &amp; I dont know what else to do.

39,"For the last year my depression has got worse and my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse after my attempt to kill myself. I have been through a mental hospital, been put on meds and been through therapy and am seeing a psychiatrist. Every time I make improvements, I feel happy, hollow and disconnected from the true me. I have stopped being honest with these people and I have cut ties to some of my friends and limited access to others who were helping me. Either I wasn’t feeling like myself or nothing was happening. Even if things did improve, something eventually happens that brings me back to the same or even a lower place.

The therapists and psychiatrist think I’m doing ok, I think I’m myself again. I am feeling things with passion and raw emotion, I can cry, I can dream, I picture the end of my life more than having a happy future. These are all things I could not do while I was happy and hollow.

I was built to be sad, and I intend to stay this course so I can feel like myself. Life is not worth anything if I feel hollow. I would rather constantly be depressed and suicidal than hollow.

Now that I finally have some positive momentum, I'm having some trouble letting go of feeling numb or worse. I'm diagnosed PTSD and depression for a few decades now, it's been a constant struggle. I've dealt with homelessness and becoming a single parent and moving from one town to another and never putting down roots or making and close friends that weren't exclusively online pals...

Well, I've been working for a while and I'm in my own place and things are going kind of okay, better than they have in a while. I'm even dating again. I just.. I still can't seem to feel anything. I want to be ""all-in"" but.. I'm still just a shell.

It feels like it's all been for nothing if i can't ever get better. At least, better enough that I can pretend to be normal.. I don't remember what that feels like anymore. I'm just stumbling through in a daze. I'm on meds, I've been a damn guinea pig it feels like. I've had so much therapy that it doesn't help anymore. The suicide hotline just doesn't have answers. I'm not religious. I'm so lost, I just want to be able to love and feel anything.

42,"My name is Lily, I’m 18 years old. It’s been a rough past few years now. It all started when my family and I moved when I was going into the 8th grade; I had finally found my solid group of friends and was so happy to fit in finally and be myself after a lot of bullying in elementary school but that all quickly came to an end and had to say goodbye to them. It was an awkward transition and the town was somewhat close to my old town but didn’t feel right and was so crushed from the news. My parents had told my sister and I that it was to be closer to work. When it came to entering high school, everything was somewhat smoother and a little less hectic than the transition into 8th grade and I was somewhat grateful for that. Towards the end of the year it all got very confusing and rough very fast. My mom had told me that the reason my dad was so stressed was because we didn’t just move to be closer to their jobs—it was because we had lost our house. I was devastated and started viewing the world very differently from then on out. I had also heard that our uncle whom we’d rented our house from was moving in with us because he wanted to send his wife to the Peace Corp and didn’t want to waste money on an apartment in the city. So he moved in with us and that became hell right away. He wanted to push us all around and make all of these unnecessary changes to where we had our things in the house. Because we were renting from him, we did what he said but then it just turned into being too much. He started threatening me and my sister to turn down the tv downstairs or he’d kick us out and throw out all our belongings in the street. He had also threatened my mom by saying “I’ll shoot you in the head with a shot gun” and started fist fights with his own brother (my dad) over who knows what. We were in a bad financial state and my dad couldn’t just afford to move us out of that house so we were there for a good 2 1/2 years. He’d even “spy” on us eating dinner by coming into the kitchen pretending to do things. So I had to juggle being a normal high school teenager and dealing with this, I later on had weird things happen with my friend group and most people started moving away that I’d hung out with. Then I became close with my one friend I’d been friends with since freshman year who’d apparently had a huge crush on me. We’d FaceTime and text all the time and he was an enormous part of my life because I could really confide or just goof off with him. Soon i learned that he was starting to talk about me to his friends (who were always talking rude or hated me for absolutely no reason at all, I’d never even met them/hung out with them before), he started texting me way less, started sounding bored, refused to talk about our conflicts and I finally broke up with him about 8 months ago after being on and off again so many times. Throughout high school he was mainly who I talked to and was friends with and then he started having new friends and doing his own thing, like I guess I have baggage but I thought when you care about someone you’ll never be bored of them and want to spend the same amount of time with them consistently. Maybe I’m just a young naive person but that really hurt and I definitely put up with a lot from him and thought he’d do the same for me. And since I haven’t had that many friends in high school it has only gotten worse for me. I used to be chill with being alone but the quiet swallows me up. I see everyone from school going to parties, having bf/gfs, traveling/hanging with huge groups of friends and I just relate in no way to them. I feel like high school was such a waste in my life and that I wasn’t able to have or make good connections, it’s all hurt and no happiness, no ability to feel it seems like. On top of things with dealing with my uncle at the time, my mom decided to leave us all to deal with him and now I don’t have a good relationship with her. Even my sister is distant because she has shut down in some kind of way. My life seems so confusing like all of these bad things have happened all in a row and keep happening. I just seem to be some kind of waste of space. I mean I didn’t even go to my high school formal graduation ceremony because there were some girls that randomly started stuff and then proceeded to harass me. It’s just never ending honestly.

When I close my eyes I think of ways people could kill me. It's comforting, it really is. I've been sleeping on the living room floor of my parents house every other day- i'm currently unemployed. I imagine hammers hitting my head and my mind going dark, or someone shooting me just right so my lights go out. Just so I lose consciousness. I started antidepressants, but the truth is I would just like to die. They helped in that my mood is ok, but the situation I'm in is the same. Just imagining nooses, hammers hitting me, and falling. I didn't understand the phrase sweet release of death until recently. I've never attempted suicide before. I'm turning 29, have been in relationships, graduated from college, have a couple of friends, and a family that cares about me. I got injured on the last job I worked, I have bad legs. During my undergrad I would get so stressed from studying that I'd cry in the shower, dryheave when going to study my chemistry book, and have panic attacks. I really dont want to fucking be here anymore. The only reason I am is I'm honestly too big of a coward to find a tall building to jump off of, and because my mom loves me so much. It would completely devastate her.

I'm even going to a bible study to try and find peace, but i don't know, man.

It feels like I'm backed into a corner.

High cost of living where I'm at, legs that don't work all the time, anxiety that keeps me from studying, and a fucked up jaw that's given me tinitus, jaw pain, a malaligned jaw, and blurry vision. Like, people jump in front of trains for less, right? My quality of life will likely not be great as I age, and I'll just end up losing family as time goes on. Then I'll be really, really alone.

I'd be working two part time jobs to make ends meet, limping, hoping to keep my jobs and struggling to make them on time.

I've lasted a long time since first being depressed, i've made it pretty long.

This pretty much sums up my thoughts for the past several months. I can't trust myself for anything.

I don't want a temp job because I can't keep it (I had one before and worked well, but they didn't want to keep me. Also, I don't like having to keep finding a job after that job ends). I have tried doing YouTube but I loss my ability to earn money and even when I did earn money, it wasn't a lot of money coming. And I tried starting over again but it isn't working. I keep on trying to make something work for me, but I can't help to feel like a failure and I don't have the support to make things happen or grow for me.

I'm not in a good place right now. I don't understand why is it so hard getting a job or being hired. It's like I did something wrong or how I look like that people don't take me serious. I can't get hired no matter what (that is not a temp job). I have got to be the most unluckiness person when it comes to getting a job.",24Jun2019,1
50,"Ever since I was little I was always struggling with my physical appearance. I have been told throughout my life that I was overweight and that just screwed over my image even more. Here I am feeling guilty cause I had a bit of grill chicken and honestly I'm just tired. I'm tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. I'm tired that I can't enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesn't help. My family all says I'm lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off. I've been active and even trying to just eat healthy foods but I still hate myself. I think my thoughts have screwed over and long for the underweight body. At this point I think normal looks fat.",24Jun2019,3
51,I am talking about books that are science based and preferably written by industry professionals (not so much the 'feel good' new age type of books). Books that can be similar to therapy or counselling sessions. Please let me know if you have personally benefited from any book like this and also how it helped you. Thanks.,24Jun2019,18
52,"Hi you guys.

I have been trying to beat depression for 2,5 years now with my own forces but life just doesn't get as great anymore as a few years ago. I was always the sunshine girl who made everyone either really happy and confused or really irritated and annoyed with my happiness. I had lots of friends, I was one of the popular girls, I did all the activities I could, took every chance, I just lived so much. Then I went on anti-preggo pills for half a year and bang! depression. diagnosed and all. I feel like the worst is behind me (for now) but I still don't feel like I am living. I got over the phase where I was scrolling in bed all day, didn't sleep, didn't eat or only ate junk, was suicidal. Now I just feel like I am doing what I am supposed to be doing. I am cleaning, cooking, studying, getting my drivers license (it is quite hard in my country, half a year process), doing something that is supposed to be fun every once in a while, but I am still not happy. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I just feel so stuck in my life right now, feel like I am supposed to be happy but I don't know how to be happy anymore. I appreciate everything that I have but everything just feel so old and boring. Nothing is exciting. Growing up is hard you know. 20 isn't old but I feel like 60 honestly.",24Jun2019,1
