0," Tricks to stop compulsively looking for that special someone when you need time to heal from elaborate heartbreak? Wanting to stay single for awhile and just focus on healing and recovery straying clear of stupid dating apps and aimless rebound. The hardest part of heartbreak sometimes rests upon the ''false concepts'' about relationships, and being a sentimental and passionate person, it triggers memories and emotions that get me depressed. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Who else, and what have you done to step out of that for good to benefit yourself in the acceptance of how this stuff takes time?",04Jun2019,1

2,"So basically I’ve been struggling with depression since 15 when I was falsely accused of sexual assault but when they found out she was lying and I was proven to be innocent a lot of people still think I did it. I had this girlfriend at the time and she helped me through that and was the only one there for me like I did for her a few years before when she was put in foster care. We’ve talked each other out of suicide a couple times. I eventually pushed her away and kind of went off the deep end. I’ve thought about killing myself so many times over the past 3 years, came very very close last year. I even wrote 3 suicide notes and left my house with a very sharp knife and was gonna call 911 when I was away from my home and then cut my wrists so my family wouldn’t find my body. I got a strangely timed text right before I was about to do it and decided to not do it that night. No body besides one person knows about that and no one even knows I was/am that depressed. I hated my life so much I had nothing to be happy for I was 310 lbs and an asshole. I eventually got myself to get my shit together slowly. I’ve lost 70 lbs and I’ve been trying my best to be a better person and help people when I can. I’ve been better these past couple of months but my ex gf came back into my life 3 months ago basically divorced and with a baby. We’ve been talking a lot almost every day for these few months (like 8 hours on the phone isn’t uncommon) and it’s been nice but terrible at the same time. She keeps giving me these mixed signals that she still has feelings for me and what not but it’s probably just cause she’s lonely from the divorce. I’m a Virgin and she one night offered to take my virginity. I declined because like I mentioned I thought she was just feeling lonely and I didn’t want to take advantage of that. Days later she confirmed that’s why she asked. It’s killing me cause I love her and I want to be with her but I also don’t think I could handle being used then thrown away when she realizes I’m just a short term answer to her problems. I’ve known her for 10 years now but haven’t talked to her in like 1 year and change until now and she’s still the only person I’ve ever enjoyed talking to or am willing to talk to about very personal things. She helps me keep my shit together most of the time and makes me happy. Like a lot happier than anyone else can make me but at the same time I feel like shit cause I love her and I’m not sure she’ll ever feel that way towards me again. I just don’t know if I should try to distance myself from her or keep her in my life since she’s basically my only true friend at this point and the only person who I can usually turn to if there’s no one else unless it’s about her.",04Jun2019,1
3,"I really need help before I do something I might regret. I am too scared to ask for help out of fear of judgment. I have tried asking my parents for help before but they said that as long as i dknt do anything stupid i will be fine. I actually believed them fir a while. I kept waitikg for this to go away for about 3 years now, but it hasn't.  My mom has bi pilar depression so I figured her first priority would be getting me help, but I dont think she even remembers. I recently started self harm, and I really wish I could stop but it is the only thing I can do to relieve myself, even the tiniest bit. I have many conditions that I should have already gone to the doctors for (such as scoliosis) but she says that they arent serious enough. She is technichally not doing anything wrong according to the law, as we do not have the money to go to the doctors for every little thing, but our doctor offers free checkups depending on ypur income. My medical/mental conditions goung untreated and the verbal abuse from my brother are main causes for my depression. I know hotlines that I can contact, but I also have anxiety so I am too scared too (it is hard to even make this post). I really just need something, but Idk what that simething is. I have friends I can go to to talk about this stuff, but all they can really do is just tell me to cheer up. I am really scarred of what I might do in the future, as I have severe depression, anger issues, sometimes even (rarely) homocidal thoughts. Whenever I am, say, holding my cat, I will out of nowwhere get the sudden urge to gouge out her eyes, or woth my chicks I feel the urge to rip off their heads. I no longer listen to these urges, but it makes my anger issues way worse, as all I can do to stip me from doing these things is to bottle up my emotions, and I cant tell abyone about these things bc no one will support me. Every night I cry myself to sleep, thinking about ending it all. I fear that maybe one night I will listen. I just really need help. I have no ond to turn to. The legal system wont help, my friends dint know how to help, my parents just say to suck it up, m y brother ignores me... No one will help, and those who will dont know how.",04Jun2019,12

5,"I’ve been working on myself for the last two months or so and it’s been going great.. or so I thought?? I’m not really good at putting my feelings into words but it’s all coming back. I feel so numb yet so upset and I don’t know what to do. I can’t function as a student and my room is such a mess there’s nowhere to step. My bed is also full of stuff I sleep in a corner of it and put my legs on a chair which is also somehow messy. I push shit aside to make room when necessary. I’m doing great socially. My family seems happy to see me “happier” my friends.. are still questioning my sanity but I thought I was doing good. Perhaps the fact that I smoke weed at least once a day is affecting me but it’s how I get myself to sleep. I’m so so lonely despite everyone that’s willing to be by my side. I feel like a burden once again and I regret ever telling anyone about what I’m going through. I smell gross from forgetting to shower? I guess? And no matter what I do and how optimistic I trick myself into being I can’t see a future for myself. I can’t see an ending in which I don’t kill myself and it’s just so frustrating that I have to keep going when I feel like it’s all going to end the same either way. My heart feels jumbled and my tears are teasing me but not quite willing to come out. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this anymore after I realized it made everyone sad that I was sad and suicidal and all that shit. I tried so hard but I feel like I’m back to square one. I just want to fucking kill myself and end it all. I have no desires. I have no hope for my future. I can’t look forward to anything and drugs are the only thing that makes me stop thinking so damn much and feel ok. But I’m starting to build a tolerance and I don’t have the money to support this drug habit of mine but I know I’m going to spend every last penny to keep it up and kill myself all drugged up when I completely run out of money that I made when I was better. All seems lost. Advice or someone to just talk things out with would be very much appreciated.

6,"So I got a job with T-Mobile and I'm fucking miserable, I worked at At&amp;t for 2 years and Verizon for 3 years, I had hoped to go back to school and be on my way to becoming a teacher but was denied financial aid and student loans,

I was fired from my last job as a parts delivery driver so I started looking for a new job and since the bulk of my experience is in sales I looked for work with that even tho I really didn't want to

I found a listing for assistant manager at T-Mobile and I applied thinking it would be better to at least not be actual sales and went for the interview and found it wasn't for assistant manager because they don't hire managers from the outside but they put that to ""attract ambitious people""

But I had no choice but to take the job because my wife is pregnant with twins, so now I'm 28 and the oldest person in my location starting over in an entry level position for a job I have 5 years experience at ( more than all the others combined) in a field I never wanted to go back into, and making substantially less money, oh and the temporary manager is planning on promoting someone so he can move but it's been made extremely clear that I'm not being considered for that promotion, but again I need the job because I'm not qualified for anything else and have not other options and we have twins on the way and need a house because our current one only has 2 bedrooms

I hate it so much because I feel trapped and I can't talk to my wife about it because I don't want her at all to think that I blame her or the twins because I truly don't I'm overjoyed that we are having children I just wish I had some control of my life...",04Jun2019,5
7,"My friend posted some really concerning self made memes about his friends (me and others) not liking him and that life is hopeless. He has started isolating himself from others all together. He also posted something to the depression sub on how no one cares unless you are about to kill yourself. In the past he has struggled with depression but it has gotten so much worse.

Now I do not know where he is getting these ideas from. We talk to him on the daily and my friends are all very respectful to each other’s feelings. Many times I have said to talk to me if he needs to but he always says sure then never reaches out to me. I think he’s just in a bad place right now and he is not thinking rationally.

But this is making me really concerned. He has never said anything like how he would be better off dead. It seems like he is crying for help but is having trouble opening up. But what concerns me most is that he might have access to a few of his stepdad’s guns at his mom’s house. 

I want to confront him about this but odds are he will not tell me anything and say everything is fine. He is uncomfortable with sharing his feelings due to social anxiety and antisocial disorder. I casually asked him how he is doing and he gave a one sentence answer. He knew that I had seen his reddit posts and he thinks I am just talking to him out of obligation.

If he deflects the conversation and things get worse I am probably going to have to let his parents know. He seems like he is on the edge and it scares me.",04Jun2019,25
8,"Hello, I'm new here, although sadly not new to depression. I've had depression, along with a good mix of other fun disorders, for as far as I can tell since I was 7.

I know hotlines exist, and I've called and texted before, but they don't work for me. I'm just looking for a reason to stay, because im running out of them, and there aren't many safe alternatives left. I take meds and go to therapy, and yet it hasn't gotten easier.

9,"I work at Zaxbys and it's a great place to work for it's like a wholesome family sometimes. I recently had to work a double (an 11 hour shift) and the dining room was packed so full there was no where for people to sit and I just did what I could my fellow cashiers were doing their jobs but they always called on me for something. The tasks we have are the following check tea urns check ice check the coca cola free style machine wipe tables get trays get salad bowls wipe trays wipe booths sweep floors of tables are moved out them back check trash cans restock lids ketchup and straws as well as napkins and let me just say I was all over the fucking place. I ran so much without a second to just relax and drink so my e water at the very least i mean i was sweating anything i had eaten which all I had was 3 donuts so it's all I could do for breakfast. After the rush of doing all those tasks and keep in mind I still have to take orders and expedite food to the guests drove thru asked for a bucket of ice I ran as soon as they said something. So this is all going on during a Sunday rush of church people that don't put back tables or leave a clean table so I ran around everywhere sometimes we have to pull cars in drive thru its called a pull up car and I had to run those to basically I do my job and I work but after the rush finally died down some I ended up being the only front counter cashier because the other one was on break which meant I had to stay upfront and well I couldn't go in dining room to get the 4 trash cans full of trash so me thinking there's no guests I'm just standing here wasting time decided I'm gonna go change all 4 of them 
Well while changing 2 I get called up front there's a guest I take there order wipe trays expedite clean a table change a trash can get called back up front. It got annoying because I know how to do the job and what I need to do but this one cashier let's call her May she's the cashier that kept ordering me around so much along with the other 2 but May was told to tell me to get back up front because they said I wasn't doing my job so she tried to keep me in line even though I was busting my ass working so hard it got annoying I got stressed and when I finally got a chance to make cookies which is another task we do I knew I needed 12 chocolate chip and 12 cosmic cookies they're like cosmic brownies but cookies it's a limited Item we have they're really good but that aside I had trays for both of them but one cashier told May to tell me we need cosmic she knew I knew this but she told me because someone asked her to I got really pissed off when she went in the freezer and said we need more cosmic and when she left I told her there's a tray for them right fucking here just fucking look it's right there fuck you I know what I'm fucking and I cut myself off and my hands started shaking I felt hot and cold my face was red my left eye was crying my right eye felt dry my body shook my head ached I just couldn't control my emotions or anything I was really stressed I even asked my friend there what he thought and he bluntly put it as yeah dude you looked like shit I ended up I the bathroom ""taking a shit and I just "" needed to breathe i just I waited for my body to just get under control I got something to drink finally and just tried to calm myself.

13,"So for a bit of background I am a 25 year old male currently doing my major in college. 
I have probably a minor depression every now and then but once I get put under pressure especially academically it gets really bad. I was on meds a couple of years ago but not when it was real bad. Right now I feel it coming and I know the next 6 weeks will be torture. Getting worse everyday. I am already thinking about calling my doctor to set up an appointment next week to get back on the meds and finally find a therapist. 

Anybody experience the same? I have suicidal thoughts in that time and don’t feel like I will succeed in life. I feel like a failure whenever I think about potential careers and so on.  I just can’t  imagine myself as a successful functional member of society.

Any thoughts ?",04Jun2019,3
14,"Today I want to talk about spirituality and the idea of whether spirituality helps or hinders recovery from depression.

I posted that question in a particular subreddit, and I was surprised to get a lot of negative commentary about how spirituality is the scourge of the world and comments like that.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I find interesting about that, a lot of my basis for recovery is built around spiritual practices, such as being grateful on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering what other people think about that?

I live in a major city in the New York area and rent alone was 2700k 

Throughout the caretaking process my parents turned their back on me - “they couldn’t understand why I would waste money on someone in need” - their greedy attitude and justification came from the fact that this is not a close family member so who cares not use 

Their not wealthy but they could have stepped in and helped me when I was working 96
Hours a week to help finance recovery but they didn’t. Besides that I also was surrounded by fake friends who showed who they were these past three years 

I feel deeply hurt and as this is drawing to an end I can’t bear the thought of seeing anyone or anything in this city anymore

20,"Hi, I'm 17 years old. I have silently been suffering from numbness for id guess around 2 years now. It's odd, but this 'mental state' puts me in a more or so, 'neutral' position where I don't feel happy, but I don't necessarily feel sad either. With this condition has come many consequences, all of which I've covered up since it started. One of which is hope. I've essentially lost all hope in everything that is 'fun' or 'good' because I don't really get any gratification from anything I do. I've began to start as to why I'm here if I can't feel or enjoy anything. Because of this, every day feels like a hassle or a chore, and when I go to get out of bed, I'd rather just sleep forever. Another consequence is motivation. Due to me not being able to find any enjoyment from anything, it's hard for me to be motivated to do anything, including living. This has affected my grades, and my relationship with my parents.

Is it even worth living anymore? Because I try to justify living by thinking that maybe something good will come my way but it's been so long since anything good has happened. 

I can't do this anymore. The amount of debates I've had with myself on what to do are countless, and I still haven't reached a final concluding answer as to what I should do.

I got meds and I've been see my therapist without fail since the diagnosis and I thought I had made a strong effort and possibly knocked depression back enough to where I could ween off the meds and maybe be a somewhat functioning adult. 

In between my battle I have had a failed 3 year long distance relationship, came to grips with being a survivor of sexual assault (who still unfortunately has to bump into the person who assaulted from time to time) and forgiven that person, left college with one class left to ho to graduate, and found a new job and new place to live with my mom. So I've had some bumps... but recently (within the last year) I feel like I'm stuck again and just existing.

I feel like a failure quite a lot and I can't seem to kick my own ass in gear. I feel so ashamed of how I look because I gained 100 lbs during my battle in college with depression and couple that with the extreme loneliness and being abstinent (due to no sex drive and/or relationship) I'm amazed I haven't just completely lost all hope again.

30,"I have a debilitating phobia of lightning; being someone from Florida, it impacts my daily life. I’m someone who’s slowly coming into terms with adulthood- into terms of independence and the like. Ngl, I really enjoy the thought- being finally able to come together with my peers and get out of the problem. There’s only one problem- because of my debilitating fear of lightning and because I live in Florida, I can’t drive. It’s literally the only thing I can’t do as an adult but it affects me so much. I live far from the university I attend and it can be quite an encumbrance on my parents to take me there. I try to make it as convenient as I possibly can and take classes at reasonable times as well as minimizing the days I have to go. But still. My parents constantly blame me for not overcoming my phobia and my friends sometimes belittle me for not being able to drive because of this reason. They don’t understand- my phobia is so intense, I want to vomit when I see its flash; even pictures and videos of storms make uncomfortable- sometimes I can’t look at them. I freak out when cameras flash because it reminds me of lightning so much. It really is beyond a burden- it makes storm days hell and it makes me extremely lonely since I don’t want to bother my parents and make them drive to meet my friends. Sometimes it effects my studies; I can’t tell you how many times my study time and even test taking times were impeded because there was a storm outside and I could hear that god awful thunder.

Life has never been good for me. My life has never been above average, always just getting by. The only thing supporting my will to live is my good grades and family. This story of the last year and a half is to explain my situation and how i feel. Writing on mobile so excuse grammar. 

My mom is the carer of three kids, me being the youngest child. Depression has never been an issue for me and sadness usually passes over in a day. Upon finishing middle school we moved to a nicer neighborhood with a really good public school. My brother and sister had already graduated from high school and left for college. The move was so i could go to this school. This was probably one of the happiest moments in my life as i got to choose what high school i wanted to go to. The first semester ended with me having done well. The second semester is where the issues began. The first quarter went by as well as the semester, but in the second quarter i contracted my issues in the form of viral menigitis. As mine was a really severe case i was out of school for a month. If you dont know what viral menigitis is it basically attacks your brain to put it simply. The aftermath of this led me with major issues, some of which are a terrible memory, partially changed personality, completly physically destroyed in terms of stamina and strength, and depression. I ended the year with a 2.6 gpa, the worst of my whole life, and included a  few of my first c's.  My terrible memory left me unable to succeed in any of my classes like before. I can barely remember what i had for breakfast yesterday. Its almost the 1 year anniversary of this event and it remains in my corrupted mind. I have had depression since this event and i wasnt sure about it. I revealed to my mom my issues and they said it was normal teenage ""depression"". I didnt know what to think after this point. I contemplate suicide almost every day at this point. I ended the first semester of sophmore year with a 2.4. The school year is basically over at this point and i have a 1.7. I know i am a disappointment to my family due to school. This destroys the things that held me together. I don't know what to think anymore

34,"I recently saw a quote about depression that hit all  too close to home, “Depression is such a cruel punishment. There are no fevers, no rashes, no bloodwork to send people scurrying in concern. Just the slow erosion of self, as insidious as cancer. And like cancer, it is essentially a solitary experience; a room in hell with only your name on the door”
To all of you suffering from depression, I love you and want you to know that you matter. It’s no small feat just facing the world. Being alive hurts some days more than others. And I’m proud of you for fighting. Wish I could make you see how beautiful you are and the difference you make. Depression is a liar. Don’t believe it!!!!!",04Jun2019,3

37,"Last Wednesday I checked myself into the hospital. I was sent an hour and a half away from home. I wanted to die...I didn't want to be. The Monday before I didn't sleep, the Tuesday after that I was alone to deal with myself, and leading up to my drive to the hospital I was hateful to everyone. This isn't how I wanted my life to be...I didn't want to be so in debt I can't eat. I didn't want to spend every day panicking about how I was gonna make it. I have two toddlers...and last week I was ready to leave them for good. Because they wouldn't remember me right? Someone else would become dad. Someone else would love them to the extent I worry I'd never be able to reach. For two years I didn't stop. Work and school full time, and then it stopped. I had all this free time I didn't know what to do with. Wednesday I checked myself into the hospital. Yesterday I got out...and I'm terrified. I think maybe I should've just stayed in. But I don't want to go back...",04Jun2019,3
38,"I really want to stop, but I have no idea how. I dont cut as I dont want the scars to be noticeable, so I burn myself on my chickens heat lamp and cover it with markers. I really really want to stop, but it is the only relief I get. There is no one I xan talk to abput my depression so all I can do to help it is to hurt myself. Does anyone know any ways to help me stop? It'd be greatly appreciated.",04Jun2019,2
