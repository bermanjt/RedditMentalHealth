0,"As the title implies, I am not the one suffering from depression. My friend has had depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her which is about two years now. I don't know how long it has plagued her life but all I know is that it is SEVERE. She sleeps long into the day, she has a really bad problem making eye contact (especially with men), she's very quiet in social situations even just one on one, she has had drug problems in the past and so has her immediate family, she was physically and emotionally abused in her last relationship, she got a really bad diagnosis regarding her health that apparently is doing okay but not great and she has pretty severe executive dysfunction.

I'm not sure why but I seemed to be the one that got her out of that shell. With me she was always animated and we would talk long into the night and it was always so seamless and easy and she very quickly became one of my best friends and I hers. For about 6 months now tho it hasn't been the same and she kind of treats me (imo) badly. We don't really talk much anymore, she moved about 2 months ago to get away from her family and by her own admission to escape her problems and while we used to talk all the time now she never responds to my texts and does things that almost feels like she's slighting me on purpose (for example I messaged her and about 30 minutes later she replied with something that didnt make sense and she followed that up by saying ""oh sorry that was meant for someone else"" like oh okay ignore me but talking to other people? Ouch.) Something else unusual is she'll text me something out of the blue one day and I'll respond and then not hear from her again til weeks later...?

I want to be clear I'm not trying to save her from herself or be a white knight but I deadass just miss my best friend and am hurt at the way I'm being treated. I admittedly don't know a whole lot about severe and clinical depression but I know enough to understand it's not about me if this is indeed her depression manifesting itself. And that's my question: Is her recent behavior towards me a sign of her depression seeping into her and I's friendship or is she just blowing me off? If so what can I do to help? Why is she treating me this way all of a sudden? Has she lost trust in me? Should I tell her that I feel mistreated? Thoughts.

TLDR; Friend with a history of severe depression and anxiety has been treating me kind of shitty and I want to know if this is a symptom of her depression or if she's treating me badly for unknown causes and what I can do to help?

I know this post may come off as a bit selfish but I miss seeing her happy and from an outside view she always seemed to be happy when she was around me.",01Jan2019,1
2,"I’ve had depression since I was 11.  I’ve been medicated for quite some time and recently my mental health has been slipping.  Journalism has been recommended before and I want to try it out.  I’m not the best at writing by hand though, I get easily distracted and it’s hard to commit.  Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can get things going?  So far all I’ve been able to write are things I want to focus on with my therapist.  ",01Jan2019,1

4,"Its hard to overcome because it specifically effects a persons thought patterns, feelings, and perceptions; the MIND. Especially if someone has suffered with it for years; the longer one has it, the more engrained it becomes in ones psychie. The thought patterns of a depressed person doesnt work like a healthy persons. The depressed brain is sometimes deficient in certain brain chemicals, or, has an over abundance of certain chemicals. It also has to do with the persons family history; if they were abused in any way, suffered thru traumas (PTSD), substance abuse, and the family’s history of substance abuse and other abuses.

Many people who are depressed dont just suffer with that by itself; often times its a dual diagnosis, such as doing drugs to self medicate, and escape, anxiety, OCD, psychotic features, personality disorders (BPD), etc... Depressed people internalize social cues, people's intentions and actions, behaviors and comments. They often times take things the wrong way, are over sensitive, think people are always talking about them, think people automatically don't like them, feel rejected often, and think of themselves as being different, weird, and outcasts. They blame themselves for other people's perceptions and opinions of them, and are almost all the time pessimistic. It's a flawed thought process that is systematically self destructive. All of this is hard to change.

There IS HOPE! Therapy/dr, Jesus, medication, a support system. All will help the person overcome, but…the person has to WANT to change, and work on it WITH a dr/counselor, God, a family member or friend. Research your type of depression, study and learn about it. Find out WHY you have it, and how you can help yourself get better.

14,"Hey guys, I recently caught up with a close friend who confided in me that he was suffering with depression. 

We don’t live close enough together that I could see him as much as I’d like, but I’d like to send him some stuff to show him I’m thinking about him. 

For reference we’re both mid 20’s and male. What kinds of things might you want to receive ? And how else can I support him?

15,"First of all , happy new year. The happy part is what concerns me. Lately ( one month ) I have been feeling blue. I haven't told anyone . I know that if I do they will just blame it on puberty ( I am 15). I cry easily, always did , but lately I find myself crying over the least important issues. I eat a lot. It's not that I am hungry and that I feel the need to stuff my mouth with food, I just walk to the kitchen and lose myself. I am a good student I care about my grades but I have started to fail every exam, every test , everything. Instead of trying I just quit because I know that it won't make a difference. Most experts say that I should talk to my family and loved ones but my mother will blame it to puberty and try taking me to an expert something that I don't want because we are not able to afford it . My father is an asshole. He never takes me serious and keeps talking with that baby voice that makes me go mad. My brother is a person who takes everything too realistically , he won't help. I like my friends but I don't want to worry them with my first world problems. I see people having depression over their dead loved ones, over not having anyone. REAL PROBLEMS. And here I am crying over bad grades and a few extra kilos. Something else that I often think about is jumping infront of a moving vehicle. It's just the easiest way. But then I think about my mom, my brother, my friends, my big crazy family. All my aunt's and crazy nephews. I don't want them to worry about another dump teenager that ended this life. I don't like blood, I don't like being sad I need help. I don't want to tell anyone , I want to keep the quirky, weird girl mask for as long as I am able to. But I fail. I have read lots of articles on this subject. I know I am not the only one facing this problem. I began this post questioning if I am suffering of depression or not. But I think I am. All though I hate hearing that this is just a phase , I am hoping it is. I want to go back to who I was. I want to laugh and mean it , I want to cry over important issues, I want to see memes and smirk because I found that dump enough to smirk not because is something that I am used to smirk at. 

While I am writing this I hear my mom saying to my brother that wearing deodorant is important. Why can't I have that kind of problems? The funny ones , the ones that could easily be feautured at Modern Family. 



All though nobody is going to read it , I felt better now . Thank you for you time.",01Jan2019,1
17,"I mean I have, I can be very angry or very sad but both these emotions lead only to the feeling of emptiness and not being able to do anything. It's not like a crazy anger or emotional sadness. I can't even cry. I would like to but I just can't. All I can feel is just some kind of emptiness.

I don't have any positive feelings. There are situations that make me happy but at the same time I don't feel being happy the way used to feel. I don't feel being happy at all. I'm happy but at the same time I'm just inert.

I don't know what to do, I just can't stand it, I can't live like this.

Can anyone help me?",01Jan2019,1
18,"Hi all, just wanted to vent as I don't really have anyone to talk to right now.

The last couple of months I've been feeling increasingly apathetic and generally lacking in hope or motivation. I've been through this before, but it seems to be making a big comeback lately.

I turn 30 in 5 days, and I'm still living at home, the last one of my siblings here. The rest all moved out in their mid 20s. I'm the last one left single, and it's been a little over 9 years by this point. I'm fortunate in that I have a comfortable home and a decent job as a university lecturer, but the rest of my life just seems to be falling apart into stagnation.

I don't really socialize due to severe social anxiety, and thus I have one or two people at most I consider to be friends, and they really don't socialize at all either. If I spend time with one of them, it's just sitting in their house with them. They're not exactly adventurous. 

Planning for Christmas and my birthday this year has been predictable as always. My siblings are all out seeing friends, so Christmas day was just me, my parents and my grandmother. I've become pretty much the spare sibling that's just wheeled out at family events because the rest are all off living their life.

For my birthday, my parents asked what I'd like to do a couple of months ago. I suggested maybe paintballing with the family and some family friends, then a trip to a pub for anyone who didn't want to do paintballing. That rapidly became just a pub trip as nothing was planned in time. That's now become just a dinner out with my parents because nobody wanted to go to the pub or were all busy. They asked which restaurant I wanted to go to. I picked a steakhouse. My parents said they don't want to go there because they're vegetarian, and so we're going somewhere else. I don't know where yet.

I don't really get to make my own choices any more.

A couple of years back I decided to join a club, so I took up archery. Nobody at the club is within 10 years of my age, so it didn't really go anywhere socially. My parents took pity on me and joined too, so now the club has become just a weekly session with my parents at the range. I can never seem to get away from that, everything just devolves into me and my parents.

I can't afford to move out, and I won't be able to any time soon, so I'm stuck here for the foreseeable future. My social circle is just stuck in a state of zero expansion or opportunity too. I'm just kind of lumbered.

I talked to my parents about it last night. One went to bed immediately, the other couldn't come up with any suggestions other than join another club. He did at least throw in that when I try, I look ""...OK."" He really had to think, and that was the best he could come up with.

Fantastic.

Here's to another lousy year.",01Jan2019,1

22,"Everyday I'm dealing with suicidal thoughts and feelings. Not every moment of everyday but just about everyday I get strong feelings of emptiness. I'm 21, I am attractive, have a good personality and sense of style. I love my family and my boyfriend but don't have many friends. At 4 years old my dad beat my mom and I. He was sent to jail, I never saw him again. I met him at 14 and saw him a few times. He sent me a picture of his dick when I turned 18. I was freaked out, he apologized but I haven't seen him since. My mom married my stepfather when i was 5 and although he was always good to me I had a chip on my shoulder and life at home was tense. I didn't like him for reasons unknown. Ive moved around 15 tines in my life but did live in what I consider my hometown for 5 years. I would make friends and people liked me but I could never keep relationships with them due to moving so much. I got married at 18 to an army guy I met on pof. I moved from wa state to Texas to be with him. He was abusive and I racked up lots of debt, went to jail a couple of times because of him. I had laid hands on him but he had done me much worse before I just didn't ever call the police. After that my parents kicked me out, I was 20 and my uncle and his wife said to come live with them on the east coast. Now I'm living here with them, working a job as a waitress. I have a boyfriend, he's 27 and grew up here. He was the most popular guy in school and he is home while I feel as if I'm totally out of place in this new state far away from anyone I know. I want to sleep whenever I'm not working. When me and him hangout it's always at his place and we don't go out much because I don't have friends. It's hard for me to make friends, coworkers are all much older and different from me, we just don't have much in common. My life feels empty &amp; pointless. I am always unhappy and think about ending it often. I don't know what to do. Depression has made me lazy and unfit. Not fat but my body is tired.",01Jan2019,1
24,"My depression seems to be getting worse and worse lately due to things going on with my family and in my personal life. I want to reach out to my mom and ask her for help but whenever I even think about reaching out and telling her what is going on, I just start crying and can't get the words out. I wish she would ask me what's wrong when she sees me moping around or hiding tears but she doesn't so that means I have to find away to tell her. My mom is very caring and would help me but I suspect she doesn't know how to reach out to me either. Can anyone help me ask for help?
