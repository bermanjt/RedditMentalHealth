0,"I've started feeling like this when I was 6, poor relationships with my parents, sitting in the shadow of my older brother. I've always told myself I am never depressed because i can always smile and joke around when I'm in a had situation but as I grow older, I realized that it was just a lie I told myself. When i hit my teens, I started to lash out at my mom because we didn't agree with anything. That caused my mom to kick me out of the house multiple occasions. So to avoid any contact with my family I only played video games. I didn't want to go out with them, I just wanted to stay home. Eventually it lead to many more arguments and I slowly started breaking on the inside. Not wanting to go to school and even got a job to avoid going home because I felt like I didn't belong there. I never told any of my friends because I felt that I didn't have any and just knew them cause I they were either in my class or I heard their name. At my last year, junior year, everything started to get worse. My phone was taken away, my xbox and computer were taken away eventually getting smashed. I had nothing left to smile about I guess except for having a job but that got taken away too because my mom called the police on me for runaway even though she had locked me outside of my own house. Which eventually lead to one more when she called the police for domestic abuse saying that I threw my mom on the floor even though i was playing tug of war with her trying to keep my phone so I can listen to music because that was the only thing left. I wasn't sent to juvenile detention center but I was assigned a councilor from the police to monitor me for until I turned 18. Eventually I just kinda snapped. I locked myself in my room with just my thoughts. Only eating maybe one meal a day or just starving myself for 2 days. I had nothing left to lose because I couldn't go to work because my mom had called in to fire me. I graduated from my high by barely making the required GPA but it didn't matter. I didn't even show up for my graduation because I knew no one was gonna show up to it. After that I locked myself in my room for the whole summer until my kicked me out for the last time. So I got a plane ticket and left to go live with my dad. I somehow found a way to make money for a phone and ended up going to community college and here i am now. Failing at life, no job, failing every class, barely making money every month to live, and I see no future. I don't feel happiness with anything j do nowadays. Not with games. Not with friends or family. I just wanna end it all. Just call it game over so everyone else can get on with their lives. Might as well empty the trash so they'll never see me again",07May2019,1
1,"I had a dentist appointment today and I had 4 cavities all over the place cause I can't seem to take care of myself in any way for any reason anymore.

Anyway I went to get them filled and I was driving there and realized that I wanted to die, just so that I wouldn't have to get all these cavities filled. Death seems like it's easier than any minor inconvenience these days.

I guess I just need a little reassurance that it's alright. My life isn't all that bad. I'm having a rough time in college but I'm exactly where I wanted to be when I was a kid. I have every reason to be happy.

I'm sitting in bed drinking and I can only feel it in half my mouth and I just want to bite half my cheek off so I can feel. I think it's funny, you can extrapolate that to any kind of self harm. But I used to cut cause I felt too much. Anyways I'm rambling now. Idk.",07May2019,5
2,"Here’s the story. My friend has been working for the company which belongs to my dad who’s the boss for more than ten years. And out of nowhere she’s fired just now. Just got a text from my dad says she doesn’t have to come to work anymore 
Now I’m probably just a silly teen who can’t see through the whole thing but i have a guess or two

My dad divorced my mom when i was young because of the manipulation of my relatives for money and all
My mom became a successful woman and is stronger than ever. While my dad grows to but remains a fool
Years later many girls starts pop up in his life and any fool would know they’re trying to get his property by marrying him and all. There’s one specific bitch with a kid that just bites on to him like a fucking wolf in sheep’s clothing. She interferes his job and say whatever she has to to take hold of the company through my dad’s hand. And the first thing she has to do is get rid of her obstacles. One of them,a big one for sure. Is the friend I mentioned who got fired. My friend and I strongly disagree that bitch’s whole excising. Though my friend hid it well since my dad is totally falling for the bitch
But i made a mistake. Or so I think. My friend has been warning me whenever the bitch came to my house(the office my friend works at is just at the first floor). One day i got another warning so i came home looking pissed which I totally am. I saw her trying to keep my grandpa company so I rejected talking to both of them and went straight upstairs and slam the door so hard that everyone from the first floor to the third hear it. I guess the door slam triggered the bitch and she starts getting rid of my friend which is her enemy on her way to my family’s probably. And probably complain to my dad which he takes action immediately by firing my friend just like that
Now I know this could be illegal but he don’t give no fuck. He’s fucking brainwashed. And this whole thing is not about my hate for the bitch but more is i’m tired of my dad being the silly fuck he is. First my mom. Now my only loyal friend. I had to do something to get her back. She’s old. Her husband is a sack of shit as well and my dad only treats me like a child say I won’t understand or this is none of my business 

Fuck me I feel so useless please help me find a way to stop my dad for being a retard of else I’m gonna be the next guy leaving his life",07May2019,2
3,"Lately I've felt really horrible, the person that makes me happy hasn't had much of an effect lately, I feel like a horrible person and friend, for some reason I constantly get sad and I fell so worthless, I'm not sure whats wrong and idk what to do",07May2019,1
4,A couple years ago I stopped taking my antidepressant and learned how to manage my depression because I don't have the money or the insurance. Lately I've become more hyper and outgoing and I don't like being around people and whenever I am around people I feel the need to make them smile and laugh a lot even with total strangers and my boyfriend thinks I'm weirder now. When I'm alone I feel like I need to stay busy or else I just want to cry and sleep all the time my puppy keeps me on my toes for the most part. I'm trying not to the thoughts anymore and sometimes it's hard. I know I don't have a reason to be depressed and same goes with anxiety. My resting heart rate is between 90 and 105 so I can't even tell now. Hopefully someone can make sense of my wild rambling,07May2019,1
5,"Hello, I am a long-time lurker and first time poster... I have been on remeron for a month for depression and in that time I have gained 15 pounds. I am a young, active individual with healthy eating habits so this has been very shocking to me. I plan on speaking to my doctor about discontinuing/trying another medication, but in the mean time I was wondering if anyone here has ever had a similar experience? How did you lose the weight? There's not much more that I can do to change my diet/exercise habits, but I'm afraid that just not taking the drug anymore won't cause me to shed the pounds. 

I hate myself so much more now than I ever did... and the thought of having to see myself in the mirror coupled with the constant thought that I now have 15 pounds to lose is agonizing. 

Thanks in advance :)",07May2019,7
6,"Everything I do to try to make myself better doesn't help even when I succeed. I still have this deeply pitted feeling of impeding doom. Even when things are doing really well. So what's the point of succeed? There's never any satisfaction. There's still just a cascading urge to punish myself for anything and everything. Sometimes I prefer when bad things happen to me because it feels like its what I deserve. If anything doing well makes me feel like a guilty, cheap imposter.",07May2019,3

9,"My boyfriend just broke up with me and all of my traumas seem to be flooding back to me

Over the past two/three years I’ve had to handle the fall out of an abusive relationship, losing all of my friends, my dad passing away from pancreatic cancer, moving to a whole new city, and my grandma passing away.

I’ve done well getting through these things, even though some of the stuff still haunts me. I attend therapy every other week and I have a very supportive mother and a few friends. 

I’m just hurt because it took me forever to get comfortable enough to get back into the dating world. I thought I had found someone who was a great match and was my new best friend. I feel like a fool and like no one will love me. 

I did not handle the breakup with my abusive ex at all and this new guy really didn’t go about breaking up with me in the best of ways. I’m scared I’m going to relapse and go into a deep depression again. I don’t have many people in my life I can talk to about what’s happening and I just feel like I’m going to be alone for a long time. 

I know it may not seem like much , but it’s really affecting me because it took everything in my power to get back out and open up again. 

Just some moral support would be nice. Finals are coming up at school and I’m really nervous for it. I’m feeling alone in this new city and I’m afraid of staying alone forever...",07May2019,1
10,"I was diagnosed with depression late last year and I feel like I've gotten past the worst of it. I just started a new course today  and after I got home, I randomly started feeling incredibly down for no reason. I don't know why but I feel like im about to break down or have a panic attack and I don't know where these feelings are coming from. How do you cope with this?",07May2019,1
11,"Idk what to do. Frankly, if anyone gave me concrete steps of what to do, i‘m not even sure i‘d bother doing them. Not even my autopilot or subconscious wants to get me in a better place. I honestly feel like theres just nothing in my heart, and sometimes it hurts as if it was some black hole or smth. Sorry for the bad metaphors lmao. I‘m just on my phone every day, i play mindless video games, i do nothing and i cant get myself out. I feel absolutely nothing about anything. I am so numb and dont care to better my situation, and time just goes on and on and looking at my life, i‘m aware of how much i fucked up, how much life i‘ve wasted, and i dont want this life that ive ruined, but then thinking about what to do about it i just go numb and dont care and let time go on again. I dont know what to do anymore. I dont care. About nothing. Sometimes i remember who i used to be, how much i cared, and i just... idk, i feel nothing again. I dont wanna waste my life. But god i dont know how to get out of this. I dont even feel myself anymore, im just on autopilot 24/7, i dont even feel me responding to people. Im not aware when i do things, and suddenly i‘ve wasted another 5 hours on my phone, without ever looking up and remembering „i gotta do this and that“. I dont think i‘m alive and theres nothing i can do about it and im freaking out honestly. How can i get my feelings back? My motivation? Anything honestly? I‘m dissociating so hard most of the time, that my head just feels weird and detached and nothing feels real or important and i look at my life going to waste feom somewhere else",07May2019,2
13,"I have a pretty dark history. I was born into this world from violence. My mother was held at gun point by my parents in a forced adoption. I was the child to replace their dead son. I was taken into their care. They let my mother be apart of my life till I was four. She wasn’t a good person either. She liked to play mind games. Like this one. She always asked me to lie to her. She taught me to respond I love you. Then she asked me to tell her truth. I would respond it’s the truth. When she left I was forced to stay with them alone. They already supported violent tendencies. For my birthday I received a cat I grew attached to it naturally. When the time came and I had developed a bond I was forced to strangle it till it died. I started having bed wetting problems. I was beaten and tortured for it. My face was rubbed into it like an animal I received horrible punishments. The older I grew the worse it got. To the point of where I didn’t speak, I would secluded myself to avoid their detection, I would live in my head. When it came time to come to school I accepted for awhile in most areas except social. After a while the want to be there stopped. I didn’t talk so I was ridiculed and alienated. I didn’t know how to take care of myself. If I did well I was punished, and when I acted violently and cold I was rewarded. My father thought it was funny to pit me against my cousins three to one. His philosophy was if you get beaten and come home. I’ll beat you and send you back out until you win any means necessary. I lost the ability to feel it was too painful; physically and mentally. I was around six or seven. I wanted to disappear, to die. I tried hard. I studied poisons like arsenic and belladonna. I tried cutting, asphyxiation, drinking bleach, sleeping pills. I was always taken care of in time. Then having it taken out on me. Strangulations, starvation, isolation, beatings, toenails ripped off, breaking bones. My pain tolerance is immense. My fathers goal was never to kill me although he did have a life Insurance policy for me.Their favorite thing to say was we brought you into this world and we can take you out of it.  It was to break me. I was his pet, dog, servant. I took care of Meds, cleaning, and other things. I was taught illegal things. The problem was I was defiant. I hated them. I hated humanity. The cruelty they taught me I began to enjoy. His wife had major anxiety and Stockholm syndrome. His elder children knew but refused to help. I wasn’t allowed at family functions or around the other kids.  Playing wasn’t for me. So therefore I didn’t develop bonds with any of them. At eight I took a fascination to studying people since I didn’t know how to get close. My school let school let the teachers treat me poorly and the teachers let the children do the same. So I decided to play less fair. I stole all of their science fair ribbons to fuck with them. They searched the entire day. I made it out. I burned the ribbons but I was caught due to my neighbor. The school was contacted. I was brought in I stared the principle emotionless, he asked questions I just stared him in the eye. He said I show remorse so I put studying to good use and let tears well in my eyes and stream down my cheeks. I unnerved him and he left the room. He called my parents saying I needed help. There was something wrong with me. They acted amiable pretending,playing, toying with the school. I was suspended for a week. That week I could do whatever I wanted. It was like a vacation. Father abstained from torturing me for a job well done. The more I was treated badly; the more I hated and wanted to die. After a particularly bad session when I was around eight he threatened to kill me and I returned the threat. I told him I’d overdose him on his insulin if he kept up the threats. Shocked for that day he left me alone. He always love doesn’t exist. It’s one person using another person. People don’t matter we all have a shelf life. There are two truths to the world we all live and we all die;everything else is bullshit. Middle school was shot the teachers and kids the same. By this point I was unapproachable.  I continued my study of people. I watched how they interacted, studied their social groups and ques. I learned about them children and adults. By highschool I had mastered people I realized that people don’t like blame or fault. They liked to be told what to do. Encouragement and disapproval is a powerful thing. So I worked on myself in front is a mirror. I imitated and practiced speaking.  The next year I walked into highschool. I told people they my friends and they followed me blindly. People don’t ask many questions. I never really talked about myself. I let people assume. I let a guy chicken with me using fists. Let him hit me as hard as possible. I didn’t flinch budge or make a sound. After my lack reaction when it was my turn he ran away. I protected my friend group. It was expected. I was cruel I didn’t fight I attacked. Most people fists. I grabbed people by their throats and strangled or used objects to bludgeon. It wasn’t even a thought process by that. I thought my family was normal. Until I stayed the night at a friends house. They didn’t understand me or my emotionless face. They learned some of the truth and tried to save me. In the end it was futile I took a beating on their daughters behalf when my father tried to hurt her. When I was sixteen I had a horrible beating and the life was being strangled out of me. I snapped. I fought back but I wasn’t  little anymore. I beat him to a pulp almost unrecognizable. I didn’t remember it to well. My mother was screaming at me I’ll have your brothers kill you. After that my father didn’t make attempts to beat me anymore. I met my brother that year we had a lot of similarities. I grew to somewhat trust him. In the end he ended up drugging me and raping me. My parents didn’t believe in psychology but they believed in medication. So they had my doctor put me on anti depressants. I took them diligently. The first day everything was alive and moving. The more I used the worse it got.  Excitement turned to irritation, irritation turned to anger, anger turned to psychosis. I had a problem with being touched. My friend grabbed me in a pool and I about drowned her. It was reactionary, no thought. I didn’t remember it. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd after that. I’ve stayed more towards the manic side. I try to actively stay away from depression because it causes mixed cycles and for all of my creativity during them. I’m more like to be suicidal. I checked myself into a ward. They put on so many meds. It was enough to tranq a horse. I met interesting people. I didn’t talk about my family or the abuse. I was charismatic enough to stay under the radar.  I was forced to marry a narcissist. I watched the death of my three children. I finally escaped the narcissist after a few attempts of leaving him and being dragged back. They wanted another child like me to raise.  Fast forward- 
I was 27 I met a guy. I wasn’t interested in him in any way at the beginning. His intelligence and kindness drew me in. At first it just fooling around. He was in a polyamorous relationship with his wife. She from first glance hated me. Over the months I started liking him. Eventually after a fiasco his wife started liking me and we grew together as a triad. Their relationship wasn’t stable. They eventually started to get me to open up. I was considered a family member. We lived together; I helped them take care of the kids. It stabilized them for awhile. Their marriage grew more rocky. She has issues. She screams and berated. Attacks. She said she hated her children. With how I was raised I found that abhorrent. In December of this last year she snapped and attacked me verbally everyday. They were always fighting over something. I tried to stay out of it but I managed to get dragged in. She only said I was there to fix her marriage if I couldn’t to get the fuck out. Then wanted me to cuddle her every night. Be friendly. He had developed strong feelings for me. He lost the connection to his wife.  I cared for them both equally. They were my family. I was told I was family. During my stay with them my father died. I didn’t know how to feel. With everything going on and that I fell into depression. I took her abuse. Eventually everything blew up she decided to assault me by pushing herself into me. I didn’t assault back but I very plainly told her what I thought of her actions. I protected their kids from the arguments. That night she broke up with us they all threatened suicide. So I showed them what that meant. I sliced myself with a knife to my bone. I didn’t feel it. Blood was everywhere. They didn’t know what they threatening. I bandaged myself.  A week later I left. I work nights and sleep during the day. I go to school in the evening. She called to go do something and wanted me to babysit. I was asleep and didn’t answer. So she said I was never a friend or a lover or anything to her. She stole a child who needed meds and bludgeoned her husband in the head. Traumatized their children. I went back to clean up the mess. That night. The next day she attacked him again. I watched their kid while they went to therapy. I was a bad for watching the kid. I wasn’t a friend for it. She was obsessed with me. After that I became the enemy.  Now after everything. She has persuaded him I’m the enemy. He justifies her actions. He rejects me as anything. The problem I’m having is I haven’t been able to get the emotions to go away. It’s like gaping hole. The more cruel he is the more painful it gets. I just don’t have any meaning or reason to exist. I just want the emotions gone. I exercise, eat healthy, seek therapy, have art to channel emotions into, even with all of this I can’t figure out why I love him so much. Why it hurts so much. How we went from a ridiculously strong attachment to nothing. Why I am taking the blame for their failure. Why he’s so accepting of what happened. I don’t understand why he’s so cruel to me. He wears the bracelet I gave him everyday. Tells me I am nothing to him. I don’t know what to do or how stop feeling again. Help?! I feel like a black holes settled in my chest.  I don’t want to exist anymore.  Sorry this so long I just wanted to explain my emotional background. Up until last year I didn’t feel. Now I can’t get rid of it.",07May2019,2
14,"It's my first time here , i don't think anyone would even care to read this but i have been dealing with loss of friendship and family...

I gave myself 1 year to move on from the pain and also for the insurance.policy to kick in. So far , the idea of killing myself still lingers at the back of my head.

sometimes i feel numb
but especially today , i felt pain like i never felt before like its getting hard to breathe, someones strangling my neck. At times the antidepressants make me cant feel anything.

I don't know why i am writing this just feel like expressing myself. Up to a point where i don't even bother to write my life story ...

Sometimes i wonder if theres another world out there whereby we get to see our loved ones again...

15,"I’m a first year university student who’s taking architecture, I’m an international student and have made barely any friends after I came here. At first everything was ok, I wasn’t really enthusiastic about my course, but overall I did quite well and I hung out with my friends quite often. After a month or so, I started feeling really bad, I started skipping lectures (I still listened to the recorded lectures) and feeling anxious whenever I go to the studio. Everything started to get so much worse in February. I haven’t attended one single lectures after that and I don’t listen to the recording either. I’ve spent the majority of the time in my room, not talking to anyone else. I feel demotivated most of the time. I know it might sound dumb, but whenever I tried to study I either ended up crying bc of the stress or I’d have trouble falling asleep at night. I know I should’ve studied but I don’t know why I’ve become so emotionally weak that I couldn’t even do the bare minimum. I spend most of the time watching comedies to escape from the reality. It’s become so bad that sometimes I’d even feel scared to walk out of my room and meet people. 

I actually did quite well during high school. I finished the IB and got a total of 38. I know that Im capable of doing work, so I feel even worse watching myself failing everything in uni. My parents have high expectations on me, so do I. I once told them I don’t really go to classes anymore, they told me I have to bc it’s my responsibility as a student. I agree with them, so I feel really guilty.I’ve applied to another university near my home country using credit transfer, but I don’t think I’ll get accepted since it’s a nice university and my grades are bad. I feel worthless, and not until recently have I thought about I might be better off dead. Just to clarify, I’m not suicidal, I’ve never tried to do so and I understand that people should live for their loved ones, but I’ve come to a point where I don’t know how to recover from. I’ve heard other people talking about getting C’s or getting sick of social events due to their depression, but I feel like they can still recover from that with the help of their teachers or friends (I’m sorry if thats not true, I’ve never been in that situation) I don’t know what to do, maybe I should retake the first year but I don’t think I’ll feel happier, or maybe I should take a gap year, but then that means I’ll become a first year student even tho I should be in year 3. I know i probably sound really dumb, but please help me if you’ve been in similar situations.",07May2019,1
16,"hi person who decided to read through this, **I hope you click away now**. I'm just gonna be ranting a ~~little bit~~ to let off some steam, I felt it was better to do this on reddit because I am always doing this on word doc and it makes me feel a little lonelier than I should. Even though I should be, I'm not having a good time. I just deleted like 4 paragraphs talking about how I was bullied in grade 4-6 , 8, and 9. all VERY harshly, it was humiliating to break down crying in front of those bullies. I also had a massive bulimic and anorexic eating disorder through grade 8-9 and got bad anxiety and depression from that all, the amount of times I've cried in the toilet stalls... it wasn't just sadness though It was the feeling of being empty and numb, I didn't want to go anywhere and just wanted to sit down in a corner and think about nothing for days on end, no distractions. I never felt so sluggish and during that time I had also insomnia and was terrified to fall asleep cause in my dreams I had to experience near death encounters and it was horrifying. anyways... I had overdosed once during school and the teacher I told gave me a hug and sent me to sickbay where they didn't understand and thought I had a headache so I had to sit there literally *slowly dying in pain*, I ended up saying I was all good and just resumed the day hoping so bad I would just collapse and be sent to hospital to get away from everything. I was maybe the average body for a 13 year old but I hated that, so I began working out and dieting and I felt really good, but I always had days where I binge ate so much I felt so bad and ending up self harming so much worse. I'm a little over all that depressed and anxiety crap, but I cant help now but feel like a failure, its so hard. I always stress ate so much in my life and to stop bingeing was really difficult, I have more self control but I don't like the results I'm seeing, I'm not losing enough wait fast enough, honestly went 55.5 kg to 53.5 in a *MONTH.* I needed that in a WEEK. I'm so desperate to be 47 kg before my birthday in June because all I really want for my birthday is a nice body. maybe a month ago I had self harmed on my wrist , but only 2 cuts and I promised not to again, I always had the urge to because relapse is hard, but I mostly ignored it. but its nights like these, where my heart rate suddenly picks up and I'm feeling anxious, all I can think about is cutting line after line after line on my wrist. I already have so much, from one time I remember cutting maybe 15 times on my wrist because I was having a breakdown, I still have so many scars, even on all around my thigh, cause one time I didn't care if other people found out, ""what are they gonna do? support me and help me mentally??"". so yeah. I did try to flick rubber band against my wrist, this one time I got so anxious about going to whole school assembly, I waited for class to go ahead and slapped that shit against my hand so hard so many times. it doesn't fulfill my cravings though. and I honestly want nothing more than to cut my shit up once again tonight. this is why I made this post, just to vent a little, it helped.... a little. Please note that I tried to not include the details, just know that if you think you know what happened and how bad it was, times it by 15. Thank you fellow redditor for listening to my story, you don't have all the miserable details but I hope you got a gist of it... time to be a failure once again, its not really an option. *Thank you fellow redditor, have a nice day.* just gonna humiliate future me by posting this, hah.",07May2019,2

But i do this shitty thing when I get into a relationship -- I put all my friends on the back burner. I've been trying to fight this, esp. in this relationship, but I haven't seen any of my friends in a while. It's not that I don't care, it's just  that i kind of only want to spend my time alone or with my partner. I don't want to fuck this relationship up, but I feel like I already am somehow? Even though we don't fight, and there's open communication/etc, I haven't really told him (because im embarassed) that after we hang out, I usually just lie in bed on the internet, smoke pot or sleep, and go to work /school when I have to. i don't really do anything productive. My house is a mess, I can't bring myself to clean... I also don't really eat unless we hang out. If I do hang with friends I end up just getting drunk. 
I know it's bad to depend on one person for your happiness, but all I want to do is be around him, because I don't feel depressed at all when I'm with him. Sometimes I feel like I'm borderline obsessed... how to i deal with this? I don't want to scare him away. He is really proactive with his mental health, which I why I feel like shit about my inability to do the same.
So I guess I'm just wondering how to deal with all of this, or if others can relate?",07May2019,2
26,"I worked late on an assignment yesterday. Fell asleep and slept through two classes, one of which was a quiz so I failed it automatically. Now that I know I bombed the quiz and I'm already not doing well in that class I am starting to figure out the most efficient means to kill myself because I'm utterly convinced there's no way to better anything.

I hate academia. I fucking hate it. I spent my entire life trying to prove myself worthy through it and anytime I made a mistake or screwed up I became worthless. So now the only thing I want to do is cause as much harm to myself as possible for screwing up.

I know it's only going to make everything worse though, but I'm not sure what else to do. I just keep making mistakes aftee mistake and I'm isolated and it's making everything worse. I'd rather be dead than spend another fucking semester becoming more indebted. How do I stop spiraling?",07May2019,1

28,"Hello everyone. First time posting to this subreddit, so forgive me if I don't know much about the community. 

I've been dealing with depression since middle school. Over time I've grown as a person and now I'm in my freshmen year at college. Although I now live a life with good sleep, exercise, support, communication, cleanliness, hobbies; I still find myself falling into the pit of repetitious self hate. I've now come to understand my desires in life and am happy with my stable comfortable life, but deep down inside me the depression switch is still on. I know my inner disparaging isn't true and I think in positivity, but it feels like the chemicals in my brain aren't on the same page. 

How do you deal with your receptors being crapped out even when you've ""climbed the hill""? 

Is it the passage of time?

39,"I was diagnosed with Dysthymia (now called Persistent Depressive Disorder) back when I was 19. I'm turning 29 in less than a week, and in that decade of highs and unbelievable lows, I feel as if I've made absolutely no progress. By the time I was 20, I got kicked out of school, fired from my job, maxed out my credit cards, and totaled my car in an attempt to end my life. My first serious relationship ended, I lost a vast majority of my friends due to neglecting them, I gained a ton of weight, and I lost any plans I had for the future.

Now, 10 years later, despite the strides I had made, I'm finding myself right back where I started. I'm in an unhappy relationship, I graduated from college with a degree that's gotten me nowhere, I'm still unemployed, my credit is still terrible, I'm still broke, I still live in my parents basement, I still unintentionally neglect the few remaining friendships I have, I'm regaining a ton of that old weight, and I still have absolutely no plans for the future.

And there comes a point where you have to ask yourself: is this it? Is this all I have left to look forward to? Is this all I can offer life anymore? 

And when I think if it that way, I GET it. I completely, 100% understand all over again, after nearly a decade of promising to never consider it again, why people want to take their own lives. They shouldn't - I personally don't think anyone should - but I get why people want to again. Because I just feel so incredibly unimportant, and yet here I am, stealing air and space and time from people who have the energy and mental drive to keep going, to get up every morning, who want to be more than they are. And the guilt, coupled with the boredom and worthlessness and weight up all of my past and future disappointments, just makes me feel like a body that isn't even living in the first place. 

If this is all there is to look forward to, just 30-50 more years of self-loathing, wasted potential, and crippling nothingness, then why the fuck am I still clinging on to something like that by the skin of my fingertips?",07May2019,1
40,"Second question: Where do I start changing my life?

Mildly put – I’m wasting my life. Can’t seem to find enough energy to do anything.

Some of my bigger problems as a summary: 28 years old, never kissed a girl (noone knows), cannot get a bachelor’s degree for 11 years, haven’t worked for 3 years and only leave home for 50 minutes a day. I had only one real friend left last year, and this year I’ve only seen him twice since December (that’s 5 months) even though we still live on the same street. So I’d say I no longer have any real friends.

Eh.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, the bigger story and details:

I don’t trust people that much. I’ve experienced betrayal from my best friend when I was a teenager, I’ve also had two ""kind of"" bad encounters with strangers when I was a minor, not enough to make me a misanthrope, but generally I distrust people.

&amp;#x200B;

Studies and work:

At the age of 17 I passed university entry exams pretty well and got scholarship. I chose the faculty of business administration (I didn’t know any better at the time). On the second year, I thought that business administration really wasn’t for me since I was kind of an introvert. Also, the level of teaching was very low and also becoming a businessman didn’t require getting a bachelor’s degree here at all. My motivation was all gone. I got so disillusioned by the faculty that I gave up studying, failed all my university tests and instead dived into immersive but useless fantasy literature. I would go out during lectures put my headset on and listen to audiobooks. It was entertaining, for 3 years… Then my university mates (with whom I had decent friendly relationship) all got their bachelor’s degrees and I had 3 years’ worth of failed subjects.

I started working for a cool sounding “office IT job” (for others to hear), that in reality was a pretty low-income, low-skill job. I worked for 4.5 years, continuing to pay for my university studies with my salary, hoping every new semester that “THIS TIME! I’m going to ACTUALLY study and pass all subjects! THIS TIME!”. Which of course didn’t happen, I only passed 2 subjects during this time and got expelled/transferred from 2 universities for failed courses. Then I wanted OH SO REALLY WANTED to change everything. And I quit my job. During my work time I didn’t party at all, wasn’t spending money, so I had enough saved up to pay for 2 more years of university. I did but I still didn’t study anything, failed all. Now I have enough money to last through the summer (probably) and then I won’t be able to pay for the university and will have only some pocket money left.

&amp;#x200B;

How I waste my time:

I’m playing videogames. WoW, LoL, EU4, the huge timesinks. I have 120 days (not hours but 24h days) /played on one of my WoW characters, just one character of one game… When I get bored of games, I usually read things about world geopolitics and sociology. I actually got some decent knowledge in them simply by reading stupid articles and listening to podcasts. I masturbate on average twice a week. Go out for a walk once a day for 50 minutes. Never see my friends. Get up at 12:00 midday and go to sleep at 04:00 at night/morning.

I used to play the guitar when I was a teenager but have only played several times last several years because I feel like the songs I knew are a bit childish and can’t muster enough motivation to learn new songs.

&amp;#x200B;

My intimate and comrade life:

I actually had friends when I was a teenager, then I got more and more self-secluded. 2 months ago one of my old friends called and invited me to his 30 year birthday, I said, “eh, you know? Ok”. And then I didn’t go there, sent a message as if something came up. But actually I was at home, playing some stupid game or other. Really didn’t want to meet new people or even him. I get really anxious, especially when I’m home for 3 years straight only going out for 50 minutes a day.

I went to teen camping sites 3 times when I was a teenager and I remember coming back home a changed person. I was really independent and wanted to go out all the time. On the opposite, staying at home makes me want to stay home more.

So, since age 20, my friends used to call me and I was searching for reasons not to go out with them. Now I got no friends. FUCK ME.

I have decent looks, some might even call me handsome, though I’m tall and don’t like being around a lot of people since I feel like everyone is looking at me since I’m usually the tallest.

I was idealistic when I was young, I wanted to marry a virgin, so I wanted to stay a virgin myself too and have an ideal family of forever lovers. My friends started whoring at around age 15, I said “no” to them. They asked “why? Are you a gay?”. I said no, I want to marry as a virgin. Then I fell in love, was so inexperienced that I couldn’t get her to love me back. I got frustrated and blamed my choice of staying a virgin for my failure. Angry at myself, went whoring at age 19 and guess what? I couldn’t get off with a whore. My erection died on me. I tried 2 more times 2-3 years later. The same problem. I never have erection problems when I masturbate, so it must be psychological. I might be too nervous with whores or maybe I lose erection because I don’t feel love or passion from them, just money.

Believing I have problems with sex, I avoided close contact with women, since I was (and still am) afraid that some girl might offer me sex, then my erection will die on me and I will burn with shame and the girl will go tell everyone. :D

I remember hints from at least 3 girls who probably wanted sex. But of course I didn’t escalate and chickened out. Last 3 years, the 50 minutes I go out every day, I’m so unshaven and uncared that I don’t dare talk to people (don’t like my pride being hurt when they say “I don’t want to get to know you”). Though I’ve tried hitting up girls when I was around 20-23 and get to know several, but didn’t go deep enough to have sex.

I’m rambling.

&amp;#x200B;

General thoughts:

I’m from a white collar family. Everyone my age (my old friends, children of my parents’ friends) got their degrees, got pretty decent jobs, most of them already started their own families, some of them even started businesses. And I’ve wasted what, 20 to 28 years? Around 8 years minimum. Worked useless job, payed for university without studying there, spent all my time immersed either in stupid fantasy audiobooks or repetitive videogames. People my age got so much experience compared to me, they got actual stories from their lives to tell, they’ve travelled a lot, met a lot of people, partied a lot. I feel like I’m blank (and I actually am). Got nothing on my mind other than videogames and some geopolitical situation in the far corner of the world that doesn’t even concern me.

I haven’t told my parents that I’ve wasted so much money on my “studies”. They see that I only go out for 50 minutes a day and are really concerned (mildly put) that I have no friends, no bachelor’s degree and no life. It pains me when I think about their concern though I’m good at avoiding uncomfortable thoughts, I’m master at immersing myself in things and escaping reality.

During last 8 years I had 3 trials to change my life but my enthusiasm only lasted for one month. First try, around age 22 I went out every day and hit up random strangers, girls, talked to them about music (which I enjoy), went on several blind dates but gave up after around 1-2 months, don’t remember reasons. 2nd try, around age 24, wanting to get a better paying and decent job, I studied programming for a month, actually managed to make myself a foundation but then my motivation waned off. 3rd try was this January, everyone was partying for Christmas, only I was alone and friendless, so I was so anxious and nervous that I couldn’t manage to escape from reality in my games and actually studied programming for 1 more month, whole January. Then I clearly saw that even with my vastly superior cognitive ability, I’d need around 4 more months of all day studying to actually get a decent programming job, and I was so anxious and nervous that I immersed myself in games again and only just woke up, after 4 months. Asked myself again, what the fuck am I doing with my life?

Don’t know where to start. I had enough experience and good enough status at the age of 22 to hit up random girls but now, without a job, without a degree, with a wasted 8 years and no experience or stories to tell, I feel like I can’t hit girls up or hold a proper interesting conversation. Not for more than an hour or two.

Last 8 years I’ve been telling myself: “Tomorrow, I’m going to get up early and actually change my life”. I set my alarm early. Then, every morning, I turn off my alarm and continue sleeping through the morning. Not changing anything. I don’t even trust myself anymore.

Well. It’s too long, don’t think anyone would read it. But maybe writing it down and reading it myself would give me some insight into what I might be missing.

…

Ok, I read what I wrote

…

and I don’t think I have depression at all. I think it’s “simply” a form of anxiety whenever I try doing things outside of my routine. And hopelessness that I’ll eventually give up anyway, so why go for another try? I feel like I’m into habit of breaking promises that I give to myself.

Not principled enough? Not a man of my word. And it weighs on me hard.

41,At school I am always the funny joker who is friends with everyone but inside I just feel so alone and numb all the time. I don’t remember what it’s like to feel genuinely happy. It’s like nobody understands me so I’m pushing people away and I haven’t met with any of my friends in months now outside of school and I’m never invited to anything. When I am home I just feel sad and want to cry or kill myself but I know I  can’t do it because of family. My mum took me to a psychologist a few weeks ago but I just smiled like I always do and pretended everything was okay but I feel like everything is falling apart and all my grades are dropping dramatically. I always have huge mood swings so if me messaging a “friend” and be bubbly one minute but the next just be on the verge of tears asking life questions for no apparent reason. My best friend has joined a new group and left me behind I just don’t know what to do anymore and I have no real friends. I’m just a complete failure and hate myself so much I can’t even look at my own shadow without feelings of pure self hatred. I don’t know what to do and I probably sound like any stereotypical “sad teen” but I need advice because I don’t know how much longer I can keep the smile on my face without breaking at school.,07May2019,2
