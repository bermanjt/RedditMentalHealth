I stopped going to college at the end of 2017, I didn't go back for the fall semester. I found two pretty good jobs until they both laid me off, due to the fact that they were only seasonal. After that I havent felt like filling out applications, instead I've been pursuing my dream job. I want to be a journalist and lately I've been so far down the rabbit hole of story writing I feel like I nearly lost touch with reality. 

I know in order to learn you have to fail over and over and that's how I feel. At the same time I feel like I've been spending way too much time writing and researching I forgot when the last time I talked to another human being. Im not that close to my family and I only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time.

When I'm not obsessing with writing I catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where I go out on the weekends and have fun. I have never really experienced that and the thought makes me feel alone or that this humanity. People are just words on a screen now.

If anyone has any tips please let me know!",16Feb2019,23

2,"This is my first post so it may be presented kinda odd. So i have recently come to own up to my anxiety and depression and decided to seek help and really battle whats been bothering me for so long. Over the past few weeks, its actually been pretty good. Im focused on school again, and also focusing on other things i need to that i put to the side as i became unmotivated and loss care for just about everything. However, one thing that i have been really torn about is how to interact with people i cut off as i was going through this phase. Some of them were really close friends and i just dropped conversation with them completely, and now that i'm posting on social media again they're reaching out to me and liking my posts and such. I want to reach back but i don't even know where to begin. I cut them off with no explanation and i'm not sure how they'll react.

3,"Hey there Reddit, 

It's been a shitstorm of a year for me. I had been trying to pass the GRE to get into grad school, I studied every free second I had, and I missed it by 2 points. During that time, I lost my first long-term girlfriend and the first person I ever truly loved. Then, the only thing keeping me going was working at an escape room. But I just got fired over petty bullshit yesterday. I have barely any money in my bank account, I live paycheck to paycheck, I have $22,000 in student loans that I can't afford to pay off. I'm suddenly swamped with this deep apathy. Nothing matters. I have no money, no job, no prospects, I have nothing. I am trying to apply for jobs, but I don't want to put the escape room on my resume because I was fired. I've never been fired in my life, I loved working there. It's almost the end of the month, and I need to pay my bills again. I can't get into grad school, because I can't seem to fucking pass this bullshit standardized test, and I can't ever get anywhere until I get a real job, and I can't even seem to hold down a fucking minimum wage bullshit job. Does anything matter? I'm at such a loss I don't even know what to do. I am terribly lonely, and I went to work to fulfill some kind of social needs, but now I don't even have that. I know some of you have been there before, I'm just looking for anything to make me feel like a normal human again. The only way I feel remotely okay is when I'm high, and I really don't want to rely on weed (although that won't be going away anytime soon). Does anyone have any tips? 

P.S. I'm not suicidal or anything, I don't want to hurt my family or the few friends I do have. ",16Feb2019,1
4,I’ve spent a lot of time thinking. I used to be suicidal but I went to a decent amount of therapy and it helped for a while.  However as time goes on I’ve started to become very apathetic. I don’t want to kill myself but I want to be dead. I know this isn’t normal to feel but I can’t help but feel it’s right. I’ve started making riskier decisions and crossing roads without looking in a slight hope that that’ll be the end. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like a drain on anyone I have to talk to. ,16Feb2019,6
5,"Hello! I’m looking for advice from people who have depression. I’ve lived my entire life surrounded by family members with depression, and am not depressed myself, so I must ask from people who know about this from the inside. This is a long read...

I currently live with a depressed sibling who goes to therapy and takes their antidepressants as prescribed. Enjoys their job and their romantic relationship. The most prevalent problems are self-esteem related (many come from issues growing up); they give up on every diet, change therapists every few months, buy and discard clothes constantly, and does no housework after making a mess.  

I don’t know how to support them anymore. I feel as if I’ve tried everything to encourage them and defend them from our critical parents... and it’s only making me feel worse and more exhausted time after time, and to boot I have a really really big exam coming up, but I can’t study since I have to care for them, for the house, for her child and for a parent who came to our house to recover from surgery. 

If I wasn’t as stressed, I might have been able to keep everything going as I have been for the last ten years, but I need help now.  I avoid being selfish like the plague, but this is the most important thing I’ve had to do since I decided to enter this career... and I’m worried about my own mental health lately. Maybe there’s something I can do to help that is much better than what I have already tried! I don’t want to fall into depression and join my family, especially since that means they’ll also lose me as their support. 

About what I’ve tried: I have tried shielding them absolutely from our parents (lying a lot), covering all their house chores and helping out at work. I have tried to push gently for them to follow the therapist’s instructions, and have also pushed a little harder. I tried pushing hard once and it ended up in their self-harm (not doing this one ever again). I have tried not pushing at all and not defending them nor doing their chores, and that one massively backfired as well. I have tried being very soft and very assertive. I have tried being angry and bawling my eyes out. They either ignore me or react angrily, making a bigger mess and wasting money out of spite. I’m not even gonna get started with the self-harm passive-aggressive threats. 
I have never stopped listening to them when they come to me. I have tried pressing to know their feelings and also not asking at all, but either of these make no change at all (that I’ve noticed). 

I’m sorry if this is too selfish (or is the wrong subreddit). I’m a pretty bad empath and don’t have friends to ask for advice, but I try my best daily and support my family the most I can. The thing is, research by lurking only does so much! I’ll take any advice and criticism and adapt it to our situation the most I can! I must learn from this!

Either way, at least I get this off my chest. I hope my English is ok enough. Thanks for reading! I wish you all the best!",16Feb2019,1
6,"I spend most of my time worrying about others, and now, I tried reaching out to the people that I consider my closest friends. I’ve found that everyone is busy with their own stuff. I feel incredibly alone and let down. I swear I try hard every day. I try to exercise, I’m finishing college, I’m trying to make something of myself and in the in the end, none of it even matters.",16Feb2019,3
7,"I’ve suffered with anxiety my whole life but depression never crossed my mind. My therapist recently told me she thinks I am depressed and wants to look into medication.

I just don’t feel happy. Or proud. Or excitement. Or just anything positive really. I feel pain. I feel sadness. I feel contentment sometimes. This is the only way I know how to live and I’m so tired. I’m tired of not enjoying myself. I’m tired of feeling like a bore or like a burden to everyone around me. I’m tired of feeling worthless. I just want to be happy. I so badly want to feel something other than negative emotion. 


My only thing with trying medication is, I’m scared it won’t help me and it’ll spiral me  further into my depression thinking I’ll be stuck in this state forever. Someone please say I’m not alone. ",16Feb2019,7
8,"I’m a 17 year old male, I recently saw a doctor and after telling her I had given up on life, don’t care about anything and have considered suicide she tried not laughing at me. She smiled and put her hand over her mouth. Can someone explain to me what she could have found funny about this? This has just made me completely give up on getting help, thinking that people like her find males with mental illness amusing.",16Feb2019,1
9,"Hey guys. 

I’m really struggling right now with SAD and I know I need to place what I’ve written to myself out here so I’m not hiding it. It’s personal and obviously depressing. I just need to do something. So here goes. 

Why do I feel like this? Why does this overwhelming sadness come over me? Why does it feel like no one wants me? Why do I feel so unloved?
These questions race through my mind. Logically, I know they are all untrue. But a large part of me reasons with myself that they are. 
I should be better than this. I have all the knowledge about these sort of things. After all, I am in the process of becoming a counselor. I’m such a hypocrite. 
Who am I really? I’m no one’s best friend, no one’s first thought, or the best at anything. 
I’m just mediocre and insignificant. 
A part inside me is growing. Telling me everyone would be better off without me. That I wouldn’t be missed. I entertain the thought. It might be better. My parents wouldn’t have to worry with my medical bills, friends wouldn’t have to include me in anything just because I’m the pity friend, my own boyfriend wouldn’t have to worry about giving me attention like I always want. Not like he wants me anyways. 
It feels like everyone around me is just acting, pretending like they’re my friend. The moment I’m out of sight, I’m out of their mind. I wouldn’t be missed. There’s only one “person” who would miss me and that’s my cat. He’s the only one I truly feel loves me. He always wants my attention and to be with me. Maybe he knows I’m sad. Maybe he knows I just want to go home. I feel so alone in everything. ",16Feb2019,1
10,"I have daily periods where my senses go dull, my mind sort of... dissolves and my thoughts start being a bit less coherent. Everything feels hazy and dream-like. I'm also extremely lazy and unmotivated, to the point where I really want to die because I'd much rather die than do actual work and actually make an effort to live. 


I have absolutely no reason to be depressed. I feel emotions, I laugh, I feel happy, but my when I'm not, I'm in a permanent state of emotional nothingness. I also suspect that I have the Schizoid Personality Disorder as I have 0 interest in sex, love, or any relationships non-familial and have very toned down and dull emotions when compared to friends and family. I've lived a nice life, grew up in a nice house, nice parents, nice siblings, good grades, good school, no bullying, whatever.

11,"Sorry if this is a long post, I've never dealt with this stuff before and I don't know how to help my friend. My friend (23f) is definitely depressed right now, she has gone through a huge series of unfortunate events such as: her cat became ill (better now but it started things), then a guy hit her car while she was driving which financially totaled it (she just recently got a new one with the insurance money plus some of her own), then her boyfriend that she lives with and has been dating for 3 years broke up with her and told her she was leaning on him too much for emotional support and that he kissed a coworker while he was drunk and mad one night (she says he still keeps in regular non work related contact with this coworker too) and now last night her guinea pig that she's had for three years and loves more than anything died from seizures. I literally don't know how things could get worse for her, all of this has happened in the last month. She also has really bad anxiety. She still has to live with her now ex because neither of them can afford to break the lease of their small one bedroom apartment until June. I would obviously let her come stay with me but her cat has FIV so its not recommended she stays with someone who already has cats like me but it seems like all of her friends that she could turn to also have cats. She also can't move home because apparently as she described it her dad is a drunk and drinks until he yells (her words). I know she's gone to one therapy session which I heavily encouraged but I don't know if she's been to the follow up appointments. All she does anymore is cry so hard she shakes. She hasn't said she wants to kill herself but she does keep saying things like she just wants everything to stop so she can sleep for a long time. Whenever I try to be encouraging and say she just has to keep pushing through she just says that she can't and she's not strong enough. She literally thinks her life is over and she's even said to me she never thinks she's going to be happy again or ever meet anyone again because she's not good enough and that her ex will be so much better without her and find some hot new girlfriend. I just have no idea what to say to help her anymore, I've tried to be encouraging and listen and give the best advice I can but I've never dealt with depression like this. I don't know how to tell she just has to keep trying even though things are constantly going wrong. Any advice would be helpful.",16Feb2019,8

15,"I’ve always been prone to anxiety and depression, recently I’ve realized it has a lot to do with my hormones and I’m pretty sure I have pmdd. Lately it’s been bad all the time. Right now I feel 100x worse bc I went out with some friends and drank last night and I have the dreaded hangxiety. My dad isn’t doing well. We’re sure he has dementia and has probably had a mini stroke of some sort but he refuses to go to the dr and me and my sister are in the process of getting POA. My mom died when I was 22, and honestly me and my sister aren’t very close. My boyfriend is literally the best thing in my life and I am terrified of chasing him away. We’ve been together for 7 years but we’ve known each other way longer than that and dated previously in college. He is very caring and supportive and always pushes me to be my best. I am terrified of chasing him away. I know it’s not healthy and it’s a lot of pressure on him so I need to get help. I feel like overtime I’ve gotten way worse. I want to sleep all the time. I think about how easy it’d be to take all of my Xanax and just sleep, or if I could just die in a car accident, it’s not like my dad would remember me anyway. I have no plans to do these things, but I can just tell it’s escalating and I need to do something. I’m trying to repeat to myself I have a loving bf, I have friends, I have a great new job opportunity, I’m healthy, I’m financially stable. But it’s just this constant feeling of “you will eventually be all alone this will never end”. Idk what to do anymore. I’m trying to get help but I have to wait for my new jobs insurance.

17,"I (F, 19) am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family-- my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know I'm very lucky for that. 

I grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. We'd go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends I'd grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away.

I've since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away.

Our house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isn't the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. 

I fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin. I want to hear the native languages I grew up hearing, but not understanding, in school again. I want to go back to the nights when we didn't have enough money to pay our electricity bill and my mom and dad would bring out the oil lamps and our domino set and we'd play games and read by the lamplight and just enjoy each others company. 

I miss my dad coming home from work, bone-tired and smelling like the propane he would fill train cars with for transport and the way he'd give me a big hug and a snuggle before he went to bed. I miss the tiny town I went to school in and the way I believed in the church I went to whole-heartedly. I miss going to the Fourth of July Rodeo a few towns over. I miss my mom making us oatmeal pancakes and homemade buttermilk syrup on mornings we'd go out to the juniper stands and cut wood for the winter. 

I go to sleep at night hoping that when I wake up, that is where I am. I wake up in the morning devastated that instead, I've woken up in my apartment to an alarm clock and have to get ready for school and then work. Absolutely devastated. I don't know how to get over it. I am just existing. I can't find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I'm just going through the motions. I'm terrified of the day that one of my family members dies. I'm scared that one day something will happen and we won't see each other again. That I'll come back to the farm and find that everything we'd built is gone and that I will never find comfort. I am at a loss of what to do. 

I don't know what I want from this post, but I just needed to put these words down and get them off my chest. My parents would be distraught if they knew I was so sad. I just really don't know what to do. If you're still reading this, thank you. I'm sorry for rambling.",16Feb2019,3
