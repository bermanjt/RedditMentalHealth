0,"Im not diagnosed, expenation is at the end. 
I was never the kind of person to be depressed for unknown reasons, i litteraly know 100% why im depressed. 
It has been way to long, and I am getting really suicidal. 
I dont want to die, but i also dont really want to live like this. There are times where i lay im bed and imagine im dead.
Now, i have pretty thick skin, things like ""kill your self"" or ""you are a moron"" are litteraly meaningless jokes to me. These things dont scave me, i can take way more than other people could. 
But, and here are the reasons for my depression, i have been taking shit for way to fuckin long. 
Ill go from light to heavy.

0. Im really concerned for the planet, other humans and animals. The consumerism problem is a fuckin terrible thing, im so sad about the fact that soon water will be a lux thing.

1. Im failing at school because i was in bed for 99% of the semester, skipping classes, feeling like shit, not learning and being a sad goof. I guess that you could say that this is a efect of my depression, but it is also a cause. Lets just say that i will have to repeat the whole jear.

2. Im a dissapointment to my parents. 
Since i was little i was pushed to sing at singing contests and shows. Every time i would say no, my dad would get mad at me and call me useless, lazy, an idiot and a whole bunch of other nice things. The people pleasing singing at shows still lasts to this day... im 22 now. I cant say no. 

3. My relationship with my dad was litteraly a hellpit from the age of 10/11 and just recently, in the last three years, since i moved out got better. It is all thanks to MY effords, and the fact that im trying to do whatever he wants. 
Now here is the catch, even now, that our relationship has gotten almost ok, it is enough for me to express a differing opinion he doesnt like for him to either get mad at me or ignire me. And i HATE when people dont want to finish a conversation and tell everything that is on their mind, belive me, i see that i do the same by not telling anyone im depressed. 

4. What ever im good at is not even important, since that is what is expected of me. Im good at music (i love it too, except the part where i must go to dumb political rallies i dissagree with and contests i dont care for), i speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th one, but thats just nothing... thats also the reason my english is bad lol. I work my ass of for my money, but... oh well thats just how it should be. 

5. Im going to do an apsolutly disgusting and mentaly toxic job... im going to work in a home for old demented people, cleaning them, feeding them, washing them... and they all have dementia, im fuckin scared of dementia for this reason. It is litteraly disturbing. They are screaming, crying, shitting, hitting, and i am genuanly sorry for them, like really sorry, that is no life. They litteraly have NO idea what they are doing, and the ones that are confused are the sadest ones, it is fuckin horrific seeing them.waiting for their family thst isnt comming, while they are trapped in a home with overworked workers who see them as... well i dont know how they see them... and now im crying, nice. But i really need the money, for at least a bit if authonomy and freedom. 
My parents still suport me, since im in school. 

6. I love my mom, but... she gets really anoying with all the talk about how i should wear more makeup, how i should dress more nicely, how my almost constantly bloated belly is fat, and im 63kg on a hight of 172cm... so im pretty normal and rathr tall... and allso the fact that she doesnt aprove of my relationship. She also pushes religion down my throat, altho im an atheist, but i cant tell that in her presence. 

7. But why dont i just fuck off and end my relationship with them? Well, i still love them,they have really lovable things about them,and im 100% aware of how short and quick life is, so i dont, like really dont want any bad blod, especialy not with people i love, altho they tend to hurt me. Ill just take the shit cause i know that life is finit, and it slowly burns me alive that they dont see that i love them like that, altho they hurt me. 

8. Im a litteral door matte and push over social failior who acts all tough and strong. I have litteraly worked so hard on my social anxiety that i look really chill, normal and come off as a fairly ok human. 

9. I have a fullblown internet addiction, youtube is my biggest problem. It is so easy to escape to another world and keeping your mind numb when you watch it, and i hate that, but i cant stop it... i dont know why i cant go without if for more than a few days without binging. My usual watch time is at least 17h since it runns also when i sleep. See, i hate being alone. Im mostly alone. 

10. I cant be with the only (besides my sister, but she doesnt know everything, and wouldnt suport everything, especialy not this part) person who understands me. See, he is 40 years older than me. I love him. I know he loves me. I know that people are judging us. My mom found out last summer, she went on a no eating, imaginary frog in throat phase of extreme depression because of our relationship... and i cant break up with him. He is the only reason i studied for the few exams i passed, my best friend, my everything. I know that our relationship will be ended in a obviously sad way, but i just want to spend all the time i can with him. He is so good to me, there is no reason for me to break up with him except for socioal and familiar reasons, and given that my entaire life is rooled by that, i really dont want this part to be controled by that shit as well, especialy when my partner is so lovable and good to me. I dont think its daddy issue, honestly. I tought about it, it might be slightly influenced, but his personality is a way stronger part of it. Please dont judge me on this one. I have never been in a healthier relationship, he is the only thing that makes it better. I made a post about our relationship, it is on my profile. 

The bible is allmost over, i promiss. But here are the other small things that are a thing:

So, my partner knows about my suicidal toughts, he has pointed out that im using way to many derogatory terms when speaking about my self (things like: moron, idiot, dumb, evil, stupid, terrible...) and has been helping me to not talk about my self that way. Im really selfaware and self concious... 
He is constantly (altho he is a hipercritical person) trying to compliment me and help me. Today was really sweet since he told me that he was proud of me for doing some things to save my semester lol. 
I simply cant do things like end my relationship with my parents, and i sure as hell dont want to end my relationship with my beautifull partner. 
I dont have the money for a theraist. 
I just watched a video of a chold getting run over by multiple cars. 
My depression has lasted about... like on and off, but mostly on, fir about 8/9 years.. so, nice. 
I dont have the money for a therapy, and if i had, the social stigma is... terrific here, i dont even have money for better help. Im from bosnia, so... 
The people here are terribly religious while doing terrible things.
Also, my avocado plant dried up.",26Jun2019,1
1,"Hello, I came here to seek help or at least to know that I am not alone in this journey. I think I did well in terms of my career. After I graduated from college, I worked as a graphic designer then I self-study to become a flash animator and game designer. From then I became a web designer to a web developer to mobile UI designer and WordPress theme developer. So as you can see, I had the motivation to improve myself and my career. 

This loss of interest started last year in my last job. I no longer have the patience for office politics, my co-workers have this employee mentality, and if I do not join their club they will make things difficult for you since our work is connected to each other. The commute is hard too, it's 2 hours going to work and 2 hours going back not because of the distance, but the traffic is heavy, I work 9-5. I left my job to give time for myself because I feel so burnt out and this is the first time I had a chronic fatigue. I still do some freelance (work from home) and this lessens my stress of commuting and dealing with toxic people. 

I am single and I am thinking that could this also be contributing to my problem. The last relationship I had was 3 years ago and it is good that it ended because I was with a narcissist, actually, I didn't know that until I went to counseling. So good riddance. I did not look for a new relationship because I like the peace I had after the breakup. I was able to focus on my own needs instead of the other.

I spent my single life studying psychology and philosophy and I get to learn more about what's wrong with me and the myth I was living. If you are curious, I am reading Nietzche, Jung, Joseph Campbell, Stoicism, etc. It helped me understand about the human mind but it also makes me don't want to go back to 9-5 rat race.

So I am lost, I need to find a new stable job soon to survive, but I am having anxiety that by the time I hit the big 50 my chance of getting employed will go down. I will be working with people much younger than me and will have a generation gap. I already experienced this two years ago, the younger generation (20's) co-workers were so PC (politically correct) and don't have respect for the wisdom of the ages. They were also commenting on my white hair. I am proud of my white hair because I earned it. But having to work with shallow people can be frustrating sometimes. 

I recently enrolled in JAVA Android Development because I want to do software engineering. I have experience designing UI for different mobile devices and I think it's time to go beyond pushing pixels and learn the backend. But all these issues I mentioned above are holding me back. For the first time, I do not have the motivation I used to have before, I hope this only temporary. I like to learn but something inside me doesn't want to and it is winning so far.

So what shall I do now? I do not know what road will I take because I will wake up in the morning with no desire to study and look for work, although I know I have to.

I am hoping to see answers from people who've been into my situation, especially someone over 50.

I am lost at 49. Please help.

My situation reminds me of the conversation between George Constanza and Kramer of Seinfeld: [https://youtu.be/WaokRFqsdUM](https://youtu.be/WaokRFqsdUM)",26Jun2019,21
2,"I'm in a much better place and generally more content and healthier mentally. I no longer feel like jumping in front of a train or hurling myself off a building. But I feel ok if my plane were to crash for example, I feel that's fine n peaceful. Also when thinking of ones who have passed away, I have a tinge of 'death envy', like they have moved on and no longer deal with the trivial things in life. I still want to live tho.

Is that healthy?",26Jun2019,80

4,"my motivation has fallen apart in recent months. ive had ups and downs my whole life, i havent had help from a doctor or therapist in maybe two years now ? i thought i was better over all, but after my mother passed last year i have motivation and laziness issues. I cant keep my room clean or look after my animals or show up on time without feeling like im pushing that giant rock up the mountain. im supposed to be moved into my next place , i had a month gap in between my last lease and the current one and ive been staying with my boyfriend. i wish i had kept it together at least while i was living here with my animals but ive all but fallen apart , i feel so messed up but i just lay in bed all day, mostly on my phone for hours. i can hardly remember life outside my bed and dont understand why i cant step up for him at least. i hope i am strong enough to move past this but live in constant fear of this lesser state of existence.",26Jun2019,1
5,So recently I have been struggling with major depression and suicidal thoughts and self-harm. I have a friend who recently lost her father to suicide and I was initially trying to be present for her and provide support but recently it's just  felt like too much and I just don't feel like I am the right person or in the right place to be supportive to her. But I feel like an awful person for saying that and I don't know if I need to just power through and try to continue being supportive or if I need to back away and recognize that I am not in a good place to provide the level of support that she needs. Thoughts?,26Jun2019,1
6,"Recently my father passed away suddenly, I was close to my father so losing him broke me. Now that it's been two months I just feel worse than ever, I can't seem to find the courage to move past it at all. During the time my dad passed away, my boyfriend (we dated for a long time) was being controlling and mentally draining. We fought due to a lot of his narcissistic remarks, so i decided to end it for good. But I recently found out he had been hooking up with women and living his best life doing crazy adventures while I am at home grieving, he would even hook up with the same women he would tell me not to worry about during the time we dated. He was so controlling to the point where I had very little close friends, I just had school and family. I just can't seem to figure out how this all happened to suddenly, I feel like im losing control over my life and everything is slipping away from me. I don't have friends to open up with or just take my mind off things. I just don't know what to do to cope.",26Jun2019,14
7,"Hi Everyone,

I feel like I'm running out of time. I've tried four antidepressants: Prozac, Abilify, Zoloft, and Welbutrin. So far, I have had no positive reactions to any of them. I'm about to switch over to an SNRI...I of course don't remember the name. Probably because I doubt this one is going to have any effect either. Has anyone had any luck on SNRIs vs SSRIs? I want to just give up at this point. I don't remember ever feeling happy or positive. I want it to stop. Life hurts too much.",26Jun2019,0
9,"I have a history of depression and anxiety, the last time me and my ex broke up I went down a hard spiral of depression. It was bad enough that I had to spend couple of days at the hospital. My ex and I somehow got back together again ( I know the dumbest thing I could have done to myself) but this time it's a long distance. This time we didn't really define the relationship mostly because we didn't know where each of us would end up in about a year. I'm doing my Master's in a different country.  Things were going pretty well but we had a really bad fight a couple of days ago. Because we never defined our relationship based on the things that were said during the fight I think we are broken up. But this time I don't feel anything and that is scaring the shit out of me and I know that sounds crazy. But I'm really scared that my brain hasn't processed what happened yet and when it does the depression is going to come back full swing. I'm still have depression sometime but it's not as bad as it was a year ago. Even as I write this I know how crazy I sound but I really don't want to go through what I went through last year ever again. I know I should be happy that it's not affecting me as much as it was before but Im scared. What should I do?",26Jun2019,1
10,"This is going to be a long post, but I don't know what to do anymore and quite honestly just need to vent. I don't usually do this stuff because I feel like that's guilt-tripping others into being sad about me and my life, but I just don't know what to do anymore.  


I've struggled with anxiety my whole life. Never to the point of medication or anything, but just something internally that has always been something I've had to internally and externally deal with. It got really bad in my early years of High School around 2013-Early 2015, and I started getting some pretty bad panic attacks. Those honestly horrified me, but thankfully around Mid-2015 when I started being more comfortable talking about the things I like and am passionate about and made some pretty incredible friendships and also became more popular, my anxiety wasn't as bad as it once was and honestly kind of went away, or at least the most hardcore parts.  


But 2019 hasn't been great. I started off the first few months of this year honestly depressed after a pretty tough breakup and school, work, and personal stuff just wasn't something I was as passionate about or focused on as I was before. It was really rough, and although I had some great times with friends, those great times were always overshadowed by me being sad and feeling lonely. Thankfully things once again got better though in around April, though.

Thankfully things once again got better though in around April, though.

&amp;#x200B;

However recently things have started getting bad again, and my anxiety and stress are worse than ever, and I fear like I'm slowly starting to become depressed all over again. It's why I always go out and about and choose to hang out with friends to a certain extent (because I'd rather be out watching movies or hanging out with friends making memories then trapped in my room feeling lonely, scared, and not knowing what to do). Maybe resting at home is the better option, but I guess I don't see it that way, even if I see it mentally to a certain extent.

&amp;#x200B;

My car keeps breaking down and I've had to use my personal credit TWICE to fix it now. And not only that, but a few weeks ago I discovered that my door won't shut right and it swung open TWICE today while I was driving down the road and straight up terrified me. I talked to my dad though, and we can't sell my Jeep. And not only that, but apparently it's somehow ""my fault"" that the Jeep is broken all the time despite the fact I don't drive crazy and keep it pretty clean. It's not like I go drifting on weekends and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I've got my parents, who I love, but lately there's just been a huge disconnect. My dad and I have had multiple fights due to stupid stuff, and it always ends with them not understanding where I'm coming from or me apologizing first when in reality that shouldn't be the case at all. Not to mention that they've have said some pretty stupid things the past few months. It's made me question a lot: my personal political views and even my faith. I don't know what I am anymore. I think I'm still a Christian, but I just don't know anymore. I'm very confused and all of that internal conflict has meshed with my external conflicts and it's caused my anxiety that I've held off for so long to come back into fruition. I've been getting bad headaches because of this too, and sometimes it's hard for me to fall asleep at night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm not where I'm meant to be. I feel like financially I'm in a tight spot, mentally I'm beyond being in a tight spot, and I feel like sometimes I just jump the gun and can be emotionally unstable due to all of the unrest I've been getting and all of the stress I have from my finances, personal life, work and whatever else, so although I love spending time with the people I consider friends and best friends, when I come back home everything hits me like a brick wall again and brings me down even more than it already did.

&amp;#x200B;

I just...I guess I just needed to get all of this off of my chest somewhere. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared and nervous about so many things. Watching movies and shows, listening to music, and hanging out with friends are the only things that really give me joy anymore, tbh. Nothing else really matters. And that bothers me. I don't know if this subreddit is the right place to post this stuff, but I just needed to type this out, I suppose.",26Jun2019,1

14,"Recently I started reading a series, and this guy meets a girl out of his league, which makes him want to improve himself to the point that he excels in everything.    
I truly believe I am capable of achieving great things, but I do have a terrible personality, in the sense that I am not charismatic at all, I am also never trying my best, and when I do, it is at the last minute which in the end does not make a difference. I know it is childish to think this way, but after reading that story, I feel like the only thing that would make me push myself and be the best version of myself possible, is love (I know cheesy/childish as fuck as well, I apologize), I'm not even asking for that feeling to be reciprocated, I just want to feel something that will make me want to improve myself. Nothing in my life so far has pushed me to the point that I am trying my best for more than a day that I can recall.

I have no drive in life, I do not know what I want to do in life, I'm about to get my bachelors in something I do not even care for, my depression always makes me want to just stay home in bed, and I am always procrastinating, I only have 2 people in my life that I would call friends (it's so few because I have low self-esteem which makes it hard for me to approach people confidently, but also everyone always lets me down, which leads to me having a lot of people I consider acquaintances but not real friends ), and my parents are the only people I trust. Other than wanting my parents to be proud of me, there is literally nothing I can think of that makes me want to work hard.

As of right now, I earnestly believe that falling for someone and

There’s nothing a therapist could say that would make me hate myself less or view day-to-day life as anything more than just a pointless series of nothingness.

So I would like to start from the beginning. I was abouz 15 when I met a girl, she was perfect for me as I thought. She lived in Transylvania (800km from me). Long story short, we spent every school vacation together from the beginning to the end. There was only about half a year until she came to the university that is not far from me, so we planned everything.(later on she came to that uni anyway.. so she's still not far from me.) So... after 3,5 years she broke up with me, and after that  in 1 or 2 months became a gf of my mate, who lived there too. I became depressed because I lost her, I was bad in high school(not my grades tho), so my teacher told me I should stop behaving like that, or I will be expelled. So I decided I will move away from everyone, and be myself, thus I won't do stupid stuff again. It worked, but on what price. I became depressed like I couldn't even tell you. As I read the comments I felt the same. Everyday was a STRUGGLE...It was hard to get out of bed everyday. The only accomplishment I had was going to the gym twice a week and changing my diet. I felt like I lost my memory.. I couldn't even memorise simple tasks.etc.. you know ehat depression is like... I lost my will to live. But then...

I felt like my task is to first find someone...and that's what I did. I registered to Tinder(sounds lame I know, but given that I had no social life and friends how could I meet anyone?).. so after months of rejection I found this girl.. I immediately gave her a superlike and she liked me too. So we started texting and then met her irl. After about 3 weeks I started to realize that the very thing I thought would never happen to me, which is to fall in love again(because in my depression I felt like nothing... like it was a hole inside me) has happened. So she was the same.. she.. went through a lot... had a rough past(like most of us) but at the end she became someone who fits perfectly to my soul, like a puzzle. She gave me back my happiness....

What I have learned from that depression is a very tough illness to endure and overcome. You must take small steps with time.. doesn't even matter if it takes you years... but at least you are still alive and fighting. Find the purpose of your life. If you don't have it yet, don't worry, you will! Take one step out of the fog everyday. Other people won't see the accomplishments you made, but then you can come here and write about it, as I see Reddit is really supportive(fortunatelly).

If you need any help, feel free to write to me anytime. I will help as fast as I can! We are here for you! You are not lost! We fight the same war!",26Jun2019,4

24,"Tw: self harm, suicidal thoughts ect ect... (I know this is literally a subreddit for depression, but you never know who is reading.) 

I've posted a few times on several different accounts about my struggles. I'm 16(M), and I'm close to committing suicide.

To me, my 'adventures' with this experience don't happen at 3am,when I've had huge fights with my family or anything (although it has happened, and I'm sorry if those happen all too often to you.) Right now, I'm sitting in an empty bathroom, because I need to be alone. These moments of strong suicidal thoughts can come at any moment at all. I remember once sitting at home, and thinking how it was the perfect moment to end it.

My relationship is very shaky with my entire family, and I've gone through so much, sometimes it just bubbles over and kills me. My significant other probably doesn't care about me as much as I care about them. My grades are fine, my parents don't think there is anything wrong, but my sister is the only one who knows my struggle. 

I used to escape from these moments by self harming severally, and I've been doing this since I was 10. Outside I genuinely seem like such a fun person, but there's no one I can be raw with. I'm not even open with myself, if that makes sense. This is just a vent. I'm not gonna commit suicide anytime soon, because my family wouldn't be able to handle it... 

So stranger who stumbled onto this post, I hope you're doing well, and you shouldn't do anything rash if you know you're leaving people behind who care. I know it's pretty easy to say something like this if you haven't been in someone else's shoes, but maybe someone needs to hear it.",26Jun2019,5
25,"Hello friend. Thank you for reading.

I’ve always loved my career field. In 8 years, I’ve switched working at different areas &amp; organizations while keeping the same line of work. I partially counsel people that i work with (I’m not a counselor), i speak publicly, I plan events for the organization, etc. I have a lot on my plate, occasionally causing me to stretch my work and time to the weekend, when I’m supposed to be away from work.

While i love my job, the leadership team is being difficult with me. They told me to do six things. I did all six to the best of my abilities. But they are still not satisfied for some odd reason. So, from what it seems, my boss is playing the middle-man in everything. I’m doing everything he says because the team told me to listen to him. I do what he asks and they are mad at me. I feel as if i cannot please this team.

Overall, the picture is my new workplace is toxic. I love the people who I work with, it is simply the difficulty with my boss and the leadership team. I haven’t found any peace about what i do. I have a fiery passion for this job, but relationships with higher-ups causes me to celebrate any victories of my job. I find myself staring at the ceiling in the morning, wondering if this is worth the effort. I question whether or not this is what i am suppose to do. None of my loved ones can help. I feel stuck. Simple as that.

Is it worth staying and damaging my emotional health? Is it worth the stress and the fact that I am struggling to find joy in what I do?

Or am I over exaggerating everything? Do tough times happen to others in their workplace? I feel like the only one.

*note: they threatened to fire me last month. Improved whatever it was they asked from me, but i don’t feel as if that satisfied them. I reached one year, they have a review of me and i don’t think it will be good...",26Jun2019,2
26,"In our state of mind, it’s difficult to determine what’s good and bad for us in the long run. While drinking a copious amount of alcohol can temporarily numb the pain for some, it’s highly self-destructive. While it feels relatively good, it’s not good for us in the long run.

The same can be said for the people around us. It is difficult to be a judge of character when we are down. Some people are like beer, which intoxicate is for a night, but ultimately makes us worse later. Some can be like medicine, which may taste bad but cure us of our ailments the next week.

So the question arises which the answers can possibly save lives. Who should we look for to help us out of our slump? What qualities in a person are good or bad in terms of support? What are important qualities that we should strive to share for others as we receive in kind?

I can’t answer this question myself, but I can start a conversation to get people the help they need to analyze their own relationships and perhaps find the missing piece to the puzzle. If there is anything that has been a tremendous help for you, by all means share it here.",26Jun2019,11

33,"I'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. Everyone I know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. Your life matters. I know it doesn't seem like it does, I know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to force yourself out of this. I know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? I don't think any of us enjoy it. Do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease?

September 2018

When betrayal knocks at your door and surprises you, when pain and sadness are your companion, when you feel that life just isn't fair, how can you stop and give thanks?

How can I take a breath and reflect? Can I be thankful for the storm while I'm still in it?

Yes, I can.

Truth is like a boomerang. It will always do a 360 degree turn, come back and show its face. Because asking to live in honesty and truth doesn't mean that it will always go my way. It means I will need to face the difficult questions, the hard situations. I will stumble in search of my anchors. Those same anchors that keep me sane, keep me humble and remind me that in my time of need these anchors will not waver.

I give thanks to the storm that forces me to recenter myself and forces me to revisit my values, reaffirming that I choose not to pretend. To ask one simple question:

""What am I made off?"" 

Knowing my worth is one giant step forward, it's a major anchor that will help me through the flames, the high winds and tilde waves.

When times get rough the weak will leave you behind but beside you will emerge and stand true friends. Some that have always been there and others unexpected.

Today, I wish to give thanks to those that stand with me during the stormiest time in my life. These friends and unexpected friends that are telling me, no reminding me, the strength I have. These people who reassure me saying,

You will survive this and come out of it just fine. After all, that is what rocks do.

I wish to give thanks to the truth that has hurt like nothing before. Thanks to the moment of betrayal shattering my life...

I know this is just a moment, a bump in the road. We all know that storms don't last. It is the start of something new. A cleansing. A testament to my true character. It is a gift of affirmation. After all, don't they say things always look up in the end. It is possible to find peace admits the storm and see a glimpse of the sun shining further on.

And so, now I stand.

I wasn’t hurting myself to edgy or fit in with someone but I’m worried that it looks like that. I was doing it because I wanted to punish myself every time I upset someone. I don’t hurt myself anymore but it’s really hard not to and every single day I think of hurting or killing myself. Sometimes it’s just like my body just really wants to destroy itself and it’s really bad right now because I’m doing the whole “your life is going no where and no one needs you anyway because you’re a pain.” Type Of thinking but I have this part of me that constantly says I’m just feeling this way because I need attention but it’s not like that’s my normal intentions in most things.",26Jun2019,1

But day by day, my inability to find a job in the field I am interested in and resorting to look for temporary odd jobs is taking away my motivation.

37,"I got rejected in 2017 and look at me now, still battling depression. My main point of fighting depression is just to try not to think about dying or anything like that. I can relate. It hurts really bad. Even after my rejection the friends (at the time) bullied me with the text messages I used to send my crush. That made it a whole lot worse. They would be like: ""Why would you send this and that? It's so cringey."", ""Why would you even go for her? You have no chance."" and ""You deserve to be rejected.""

Just to make it clear, i've done absolutely nothing to these people who decided to bully me out of the blue. Whether they were my crush's friends or not, I couldn't take it. I took it as jokes at the start you know, just some teasing, it's normal. I told myself it would stop. It didn't. They kept going. She had a twin sister who was in the same class at me. She wouldn't stop embarrassing me. She told my friends. I lost all of my friends. All of them. I had nothing. 

Before I confessed, I found out my crush was spreading my secrets to everyone through her private Instagram account. It broke my heart. I don't even know why I decided to give her countless chances of getting my trust back. She kept promising she wouldn't do it again and since she's my crush, I didn't want to argue with her and do anything to make the relationship worse. She explained that it was her friend that was spreading all the secrets. I found out it wasn't. She lied.

Now, I wouldn't say i've moved on but i'm trying to stay at the level I am at. I've lost complete trust in the people who used to be around me. I've switched up to new friends whom i've met in a new school (my crush and her sister are in the same school) and we've got closer to one another as we are facing quite the same type of depression. We share tips on how to live a healthier lifestyle and how to make the right choices, how to handle depression and more. I just hope that everything gets better for me and my friends.

And if it wasn't for me reaching out to other people (my current friends), I wouldn't be here.",26Jun2019,1
38,How do I convince my wife that watching the news first thing in the morning is hard on mental health for the day. It’s like as soon as we get up the news is on and it’s just negative negative negative and it can sometimes ruin the rest of my day. Like this morning they kept showing a image of a dead father and daughter face down in a river after a failed attempt to cross the border into the US. I know conditions are shitty down in the boarder towns and it’s a real humanitarian issue but I can’t take it first thing in the morning. It just makes me think of the dead kids I had to clean up in Afghanistan and the daughter I had that passed away. It’s a lot to just jar up and push myself to make it through the work day. She says she is able to separate her self from it but I can’t. She complains it’s the only time she can watch it without distraction from our children to know what’s going on and staying in the loop but I think she obsesses over it.

39,"So I (21f) have been struggling with depression since I was 8 years old. Or at least, that's when I was diagnosed with clinical depression.   


I've gone through a LOT including (but not limited to) bullying, sexual assault, domestic abuse, a miscarriage, and the suicide of my baby sister.   


Sometime last year, I took some recreational drugs and my symptoms of my depression completely disappeared. I genuinely knew what it was like to feel happy again, without having to take meds or go to a therapist. That only lasted about a year.  


Now I'm at a point where it seems like nothing is ever going to go the way I need or want it. I feel like I'm constantly struggling every day in every area of my life. I have no one who listens to me or my feelings. I have no support. And I currently can't afford therapy.   


I never truly envisioned myself making it to my 20s. I always thought I would have killed myself or would have been dead by now. But here I am. And now, when I try to think of my future, I don't see anything other than struggling and pain. I'm not sure how much more I can take.   


Its also hard for me to reach out to people about how I feel because I've always been the strong one. I've been the one that EVERYONE leans on. I'm constantly looking out for others and helping them through their problems because it genuinely makes me feel good. But when I try to tell people how bad things are for me right now, they don't take it as seriously because ""well you've been through so much, you can get through this."" But I'm tired of 'going through so much' I'm tired of being the strong one. I'm tired of having to bite my tongue on how I feel about things so I don't upset others.  


People keep telling me it'll get better. But there literally hasn't been a single year that I didn't have something major happen to me. I'm just wondering when things will ever get better? Is there a point in continuing when I can't see a viable future ahead of me? Will I always be this depressed?",26Jun2019,1
40,"I'm 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. 

I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again?

I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why I'm so undesirable. It's been like this ever since I was 16. I was always a secret. An embarrassment. 

I was doing so much better with my depression and now I'm back at square one. I'm randomly crying at work, I either feel intense pain or numb, I relive the act of being dumped and my stomach drops all over again, and  I'm seriously wondering if life is worth it if I never have someone love me.

I take meds, go to therapy. But it's not helping. I'm overweight so I cant help but think some of the reason why my dating pool sucks is because I'm ugly. I havent been eating really and when I do I purge. I've lost almost 4lbs this week.

43,"I'm worried about an online friend of mine, who's been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since before I knew them. I know as a friend - and a friend trapped on the other side of the world at that - all I can really do is support them. But recently I've been feeling completely at a loss as to how to do that. I've been trying my best to listen to them when they're down, to let them know they can message me if something's troubling them, and to actively ask how they're doing. I've been trying just to be with them as a friend too - gaming, chatting, sending them memes, etc. 

The real problem is, they obviously need more help than a well-meaning but somewhat clueless online friend can offer - and I'm not sure how to (or even if I should) encourage them to seek it. I'm also not quite sure what resources are actually accessible to them, given their circumstances.

Their family is screwed up and abusive. My friend is frightened to reveal the true extent of their depression to them, as past attempts have been met with anger, accusations, and threats of having them institutionalised if they attempt suicide again. Their family is unsupportive, abusive, and a major source of stress in my friends life, but as their problems make them struggle to find employment (and their family forbids them from looking into any welfare they may be entitled to), they're stuck living with them for the time being. Their problems also mean they currently only have online friends, none IRL. 

I know they've tried therapy in the past, but have had their faith in it shattered after experiences with bad therapists - including ones that no-showed for appointments, and one that breached patient confidentiality. Additionally, whilst they've tried it in the past, they fear they won't be able to afford therapy at the moment - as well as having a fear of being involuntarily committed to an institution if they reveal their suicidal thoughts. I've tentatively suggested online therapy to them, as a possible option if face-to-face therapy is out of the question, and they've said it's something to think on. 

Frankly, I'm terrified. I'm absolutely shit-scared that my friend is suffering like this, and that I'm going to lose them. I've had nightmares about finding the body of someone I've never met in the flesh. I don't let on how scared I am to them because, well...it isn't about me, and I don't want to add guilt onto everything else they're going through. But I do want to do everything I reasonably can to help and be supportive - whether that's gently urging to get help, or just holding my tongue and listening when they need me.

We've had an issue for a while that I don't think I can get over. But he's the one that I was most comfortable talking to, and I never thought I was bothering him. But I'm so angry and hurt and resentful. Who will I talk to if we break up? I have other friends, but him and I spoke every day. Not like we're talking much right now because I'm upset at him. I'm home alone sitting on the couch drowning in depression. I'm trying to last till I see my therapist but it's too hard.

i met up with some former work friends at the weekend and like clockwork i proceeded to get very drunk. when i was alone, due to various reasons, with an idividual i dont know particularly well i told her of my unfortunate mental predicament. i dont have the greatest recollection of events but i woke the next morning with a text telling me if i ever needed to walk and talk to someone then she was a metaphorical shoulder to cry on. i said that would be nice and didnt read into it. she responded that she liked me and we should get together this weekend and i now feel i am in a bind as i dont know if i feel the same way. i dont really feel anything unless im pissed and this person is really nice (but also straight edge). ive been fucking up my already irregular sleep schedule thinking about this until the sun comes up.

48,"Lately, I've found myself not wanting anything anymore. I don't wan't to do anything, I don't want to get anything, I don't want to make anything... 

... I don't want to live... 

   Life has completely lost meaning to me. Everything's boring. I wake up, go to school, get back, watch youtube/play games, go to sleep, repeat. When it's the weekend I do the same, but without the school part. 

   And sure, there's nothing stoping me from doing something I love, because there's lot's of things I love and would like to do. 

I love drawing, and would love to learn to draw better and maybe even learn animation

I love music, and would love to make my own. Maybe even learn how to sing. 

I love filmmaking/editing/acting, and would love to make little films of my own, maybe even post them on Youtube.

I love video games, and would love to learn to make them too. 

I love nature, and would love to go out more. Maybe even work out and get some muscles 

   But what's the point if I don't have the will to do any of that. I *want* it, but I can't. I just don't feel like doing any of that. Whenever I get some inspiration to do anything in my life, I lose it instantly. Here's some examples:

I suddenly feel the urge to draw something, so I get out a sheet of paper and a pen. I draw a few lines and that's it. I don't wanna do it anymore, so I go back to watching youtube or other useless activities. 

I suddenly really really want to play/learn piano, so I go and sit down. I play one note, and that's it. My inspiration just flies away. 

   Why is this happening to me?? I don't want this. I **want** to do something with my life, but at the same time, I don't.

Maybe  to start this thread imma introduce myself. I am a 17 year old German  student that works in a grocery store. Since around Nov-Dez 18 I an  feeling strange. I started isolating myself more than before and I'm  still doing it to this day. If I am alone I'll always think about myself  and how I am not who I was nor what I wanna be. Often I am crying in  the night. Some people saying that I started being awkwardly silent  suddenly and that I seem kinda depressed (their words, I don't really  like to call myself it). I opened myself and talked about my problems  and got told that I should just see a doctor and that it would be much  better. I declined that offer saying it will be better/easier and that I  can deal with it alone. For a month it was actually fine and my  mentality was better til 1-2 weeks ago. I was starting to think about my  ""problems"" and that I just can't face them

My laziness. I am struggling to commit to anything that could be useful  for me or my future. I rather sit around thinking about what I have to  do or I'm just going to sleep in the evening. I cannot focus on anything  and ""fall back"" (dunno how to say it) and sink into my thoughts. E.g in  class if I'm getting told something I prob forget it in a minute or didn't even listening the first place. I cannot speak fluent. I am  speaking while not even proceeding what i am thinking and what i am  about to say which makes me stutter. I am missing many words that I  normally use. I am not the kid i once was and it hurts. I was always  smiling and having fun. Every time I am thinking about this a quote from my father gets into my head belong the lines of ""There is a difference  between you and other kids because  you are always smiling at it makes  my day every time"". Nowadays everyone tells me that I should smile more  and I always get asked whats wrong with me/my life cuz I always look  sad. I am about to do my A-levels after summer break and I know I can do  it so easily but for what? It feels like I have to be something big,  maybe something that I don't have to be. Why cant i just be a average  person? Why do these thoughts haunt me every night? I have a easy life.

Around  3 months ago we were doing a trip with 4 school classes in which my  mental just boomed. I held myself in a background as best as I could.  When i was in my room on my own I started getting paranoid. I heard  knocking from every side of the room and it felt like the whole room was  moving. I thought i was not alone in the room and that something wants  to kill me in there. Til this day i never had such an experience again.

All  these things hit me all the time. I always tell myself that suicide is  so stupid but the fact that i have to tell myself that just hurts.

I am feeling off and tired of living but not wanting to die. Lately i just sleep a lot and sometimes don't even have the energy to move

I  wrote this text to share my thoughts and my hopelessness and to maybe  get some help from u. I don't want people to tell me that they feel  sorry for me. I just want people to understand me.

52,"I am 21 years old and have experienced 2 major depressive phases in my life. The first started when I was 15 and lasted roughly two years. The second began towards the end of my Freshman year at college (about 3 years ago).

I have yet to find a medication that works (Prozac appeared to work during the first phase but has had little to no recognizable effect during this phase) or a therapist that feels helpful. 

The last few months I’ve barely gotten out of bed, eaten, or done anything at all really. I’ve been ready to die, to just sleep life away until I can’t wake up. It seems rather peaceful, within these walls barred off from the evil going on in the world right now. My dishes piled up and spilled out of my sink to be stored in my bathtub (embarrassing but honesty here), boxes of my belongs lay around  my apartment that I never even opened when I moved in months ago, I almost never shower or do daily hygiene rituals anymore and there’s trash everywhere in my room, living room, bathroom, and kitchen.

I don’t know what happened but somehow yesterday miraculously (with no extra therapeutic changes and with no medication) I found the spoons to clean, dry, and put away all my dishes. I also unpacked most of the boxes in my apartment and threw away a lot of trash. I felt so proud, but then again, pathetic, because I felt proud of myself for doing normal adult things I neglected for so long. I also took my dog (ESA) for a walk which is something he usually only gets every other day if I can muster the energy.

Today I woke up, took a shower (now that my bathtub is no longer is full of dishes!), brushed my teeth and hair and put up all my clean cloths (which were just sitting in piles for weeks). I felt good again because of my productively though still a little pathetic due to my paradigm of thinking explained earlier. So I decided I had some spoons left to take my pupper for a walk today too. 

On my walk a beautiful and sweet girl I had never met stopped to admire and pet my [dog](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rz4q3Cx). When she looked up at me she said my hair was beautiful and that I looked good. I sheepishly replied my thanks and commented that my hair was “all home grown”. She laughed and said “you have a good dog, thank you for taking him on walks” and walked on past me.

That compliment has put me on a high at the moment and really considering the implications of small changes and actions in my life. It also makes me thing if I received compliments from pretty girls more often I might actually be able to do this life thing.

This was sorta a ramble of things I felt I needed to say, so thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far. And know I’m here for you too if you ever need to talk.

54,"I suppose it started about a year ago. I was suffering from anxiety at work which got progressively worse until I had a panic attack. It was then I realised I had to make a choice. Stay and hope that I'd find another job before things got worse, or quit and use the money I saved to spend some months getting back on my feet.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

I was scared. I wanted to quit but naturally I was worried that it would hurt my chances in the long run of being employed again. I talked it over with my family and friends. My family was supportive, but live 250 miles away (in the UK that's quite the distance). My friends' support is what really made the difference. I was living with them, and if things got bad I could turn to them for support. In the end that was all I needed.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

I quit my job and took the time to relax and casually think about the future. Problem is that I have a fear of failure, and the longer I was unemployed for, the worse it got. I was able to ignore it for a while, but over time my friends started to resent the fact that I was 'comfortably' unemployed whilst they all had to keep working. As such any initial good will that had been sent my way quickly dried up. I understand why, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt me.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

About 4 months ago my best friend and I had a falling out. We had a heated discussion about something in the news and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I didn't realise it until months later that my best friend isn't the forgiven type. They remembered every little thing that I had done wrong over the years, all the way down to my unconscious mannerisms. They didn't deal with these problems by confronting me about it so that I could learn from my mistakes, instead they kept quiet and let their feelings fester. I didn't know this at the time, so for 2 more months we lived together 'happily' with our 3 other friends.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

2 months ago, when I told them I wasn't planning on moving out after all, my former best friend told me that my presence made them anxious, and that the longer I was living there the more anxious they would become. Now I cared a lot about this friend, and trusted them implicitly. As such I believed what they said about me. That I was an inconsiderate monster, and I also believed that I would have to leave because I cared about their well being.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

Now by this point I was deep into my depression with no job in sight and my friends slowly seeming to want nothing to do with me. Then this bombshell hit me. I wanted to do the right thing but I also knew I couldn't just move out with no place to go and no job. There is no way I'd be able to cope with that in my current situation. So I said that I would try extra harder to find any job now just to pay the bills, and start looking for another place to live. If all goes well I said I would leave at the end of August, and in the meantime I would stay out of the communal living spaces to minimise any anxiety on their part.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

Now again at the time I didn't know that they weren't happy with that, they didn't even hint at it. Also over the past 3 years I had lost touch with my old friends, instead choosing to become closer to their friends, who then became the people I now live with. As such I could now no longer talk to my friends about the turmoil I was going through. I had voluntarily isolated myself and it took me another month before I decided I couldn't take it anymore. The loneliness and continued difficulty finding a job had destroyed all I had gained from taking time off work.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

A month ago I talked to my friend again and said that I was sorry but I needed to spend time with my friends. It was then that I found out just how much this person now hated me. Using what I was saying to reinforce the belief that I was an inconsiderate monster they then told me that they want me gone asap, even if that meant me living on the streets.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

It shocked me, hearing them say that. It was the first time my faith in them was shattered. They had never said anything like that to me before, and hearing it sort of washed away the fiction I had created for myself. My friend wasn't selfless and kind, they were selfish and cruel. The shock meant I never did go back to spending time with my friends, it was like a punch to the heart. It felt like a betrayal of everything we had been through, everything I had done for them out of friendship. I hated them now, and that hate pushed me harder to leave this house, to get away from the person who has hurt me the most.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

That drive fizzled out, as it always does with depression. None of my friends ever tried to reach out to me, whether because they thought, in the absence of any other news, that I was doing fine, or they just didn't care. I don't know.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

I did have a good heart to heart with one of them recently after I had a bit of a moment on our group messenger chat. I found out he didn't like the situation, and that he disagreed with me being forced out because of someone else. He was one of 2 who wanted me to stay, but was the only one to try and help. I also found out from him that one of the others supports my former best friend because me moving out would mean they would get 'a big bedroom'. Not to mention that when the others question my former friend over their actions they justified themselves by spewing all the things I had done wrong, but through their own filter. Everything was made worse, and apparently I actually hated all my friends now and talked shit about them behind their back.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

Weirdly the talk actually helped pull me up a bit, learning the truth about a few things. Then I found out my former friend was going away for a week on holiday. I was happy, or as close to it as I can remember. I would be able to spend time with my friends again. Or so I thought.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

I've spent time with them this week. I've tried to engage them, talk to them. They're either too tired or so uninterested I might as well be talking to myself. At least most of the time. Occasionally I sort of have a good time with them. I don't know if it's because of the situation and they're trying to avoid thinking about it, or they believe what they've been told about me. How can I undo any damage that's been done?  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

I'm now sitting in front of my computer, screaming in my own little way about all of this. I'm horribly lonely, I'm depressed, and every day I think I make progress I just slide back that little more instead. 2 months more of this is too much, and it won't even end then.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

For the longest time I didn't regret my past choices in life, even the bad ones, because they always lead me to the people I loved. Now those people are avoiding eye contact with me or telling everyone I hate them. If I could go back a year, I would do so many things differently. Sadly I'm at my lowest point in life, with nothing but a long struggle ahead of me to even get back close to the kind of life I had before.  

 \&amp;nbsp; 

TL;DR Quit my job with support of friends. Friends became bitter over time due to my unemployment. Me and best friend fall out, then they hurt me more than anyone else ever has. Can't spend time with my friends then when I do they seem indifferent to everything. Now life crumbling around me and I'm barely keeping my head above the water.",26Jun2019,1
55,"I’ve been depressed really bad since the beginning of the month. I’ve drank and used a lot during this time period. I haven’t gone to work or done the things I like to do. If I don’t pull myself together I could jeopardize my living situation in the next week or so. 

I’m planning on going to do one of my healthy passions tonight with some friends. I’m going to be trying to conceal my depression and am like going to wear an outfit that makes me look well kept in an effort to hide my reality. 

I just wanna get out of this horrible mental space. It’s been almost a year since I’ve fallen down this bad. 

Idk it sucks. I don’t wanna lose my living situation.",26Jun2019,1
57,I am 45 and female. I have been struggling with depression for most of my life. It has increased intensely since turning 40. The truth is I have failed at everything in my life. I wanted to be an actress/artist but ended up as a lifelong office assistant. I have never been married or had a decent relationship with any man. No kids. I feel like life is over and done. Any feeling of hope for the future that I had in my 20s-30s is gone — along with my rapidly aging face. I wouldn’t label myself as suicidal but I do think of it a lot. How do I get out of this deep hole when I truly don’t believe things will ever get better? How do I not hate myself and my failures so much? Thanks 😕,26Jun2019,1
58,"I just want to see, does anyone else get more depressed in the summer? I’m not sure if it’s reverse SAD or not because I have been consistently depressed for about 4 years, but over the past 3 years my depression gets significantly worse every June. Particularly after the summer solstice. Is that weird?",26Jun2019,11
