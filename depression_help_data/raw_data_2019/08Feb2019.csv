0,"Im young, dumb, and broke. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Lately, I've entered the world and am trying to be a productive member of society. I find myself down all day, tired, sick, and can't find joy in anything. When I was really active in the music scene, I found a shred of happiness working on projects and sharing things I've made with my friends, and was diligently working on gaining a following. Now, every time I try to work on something new I find myself doubting everything, every phrase, every sound, every arrangement. Most days I can't bring myself to work on anything. I just, can't. Not that it isn't good enough, but its so emotionally hard for me to do, well, anything. 

When everyone leaves school, some stay home instead of moving to new cities to pursue higher education. Everyone I was close with is gone. I went with my best friends family to send him off to the military. He was the last one left. My support system is gone, and my family is no help. The school I go to isn't fulfilling either. I picked my degree thinking it'll help me. It'll be okay and I'll get a good job! I really hate going. I find myself disinterested, distracted, and waiting until I can go home and drown in my albums and youtube channels. Meeting new friends is nearly impossible in these classes where I'm by far the youngest person in nearly every class. I hate the subjects and the coursework. My jobs are unfulfilling and barely keep me afloat, putting myself though college and paying bills. My coworkers aren't exactly the people to party with, they're all older than me by a lot and just no. The money isn't even good, I can't afford my school, and had to move back home to focus on paying for school. I hate going home to people who make most everything worse. I hate being alone every day. I hate my brain for making me doubt everything and recess into the abyss. I hate being so anxious I can't talk to my parents. They are the only people I avoid because they think they're helping but what they think is helping is actually suffocating and blatantly insulting.

I feel like every attempt to change is futile and another dead end. I tried meds, but I had an adverse reaction that left me in the hospital for a week. I have not and will not go back to the clinic. I feel hopeless. Nothing brings me joy anymore. I like making music but can't bring myself to do it. YouTube was a big source of happiness for me, but I can't bring myself to make videos, and the culture of the site has become bastardized to me. I wish I could either die or press a reset button to infancy. I'm writing this on the floor trying to bring myself to do something productive before I start thinking about ending everything again. The first time I thought about it, to scared me so bad, but now it feels like it might be the only way out. I hope something better comes along. 

I've read some posts on this subreddit my question to whoever cares enough to respond is, what should I do? What would you do? What is the meaning in all this pointless suffering?

For those who do not know I used a black scorpion as my ""depression's"" form. It appeared in my dream and I looked in my dream book( cause I own those things..) and it talked about stress yaddy yaddy ( I do not actually remember). But I took it as it was my depression taking a shape.

Any ways.

I have been stung by my depression pretty hard and I hate putting blame on people but my boyfriend caused it this time.

I was having a decent day and around midnight he had to bring up our only issue in our relationship. Sex.

I am a asshole when it comes to this but I also feel harassed as well. Here comes the intimate ish details.

So my bf and I do not really have sex, like at all. Mainly because I am a person who seems to only really be into that when I first start dating someone. On top of that I have been having break downs start during, I start crying and hold off as much as I can til he leaves (cause we sleep separately too do to his abusive snoring and hitting me all night long).  
I do into breakdowns after words, my sister thinks I am having panic attacks because I am being talked into something I do not want to do. But I do not think so because I don't feel anxious or anything. It is that deep heavy weight in the chest as if someone just broke your heart. I have no idea why it has started.

But anyways, he came in my room and asked if we could do stuff and I said no. He went on excuse after excuse. ""We only did it 10 or less times last year"" It does not matter. ""It is a normal part of relationships"" It does not matter.

I did not listen to anymore after that I just cut him off saying it does not matter, because I said NO.

I told him that this is going to end our relationship. That if this is something that is bothering him than he needs to leave. That I am not a person who needs or wants sex in my life.

But it does make me feel like shit, like I am not normal and just being a bitch even though the affects of sex is apparent.

He also likes to keep bringing up, ""You used to do this you used to do that"" talking about the beginning of the relationship.

I told him he is really starting to piss me off because I told him I am completely different during that ""honeymoon phase"" and he just keeps bringing it up.

But it is bringing me down because I duck up everything.

And my best friend hasn't really been around and I just do not want to bother with it anymore. I do not feel like trying.

I feel like the negative thing in everyone's lives. That I am the reason the rain pours out their sunshine.

I just want to drown myself in the rain I cause.

I strangled myself the other day. I have been beating myself, and only cut that night he came to my room.

But the scorpion's poison has yet to leave my body. And it is going to leave some permanent damage.",08Feb2019,1

3,"So, I've been struggling with depression since I was 13(I am 20 now), I can never figure out why I feel sad. I have thought about suicide, I have moderate to severe anxiety, even with medication I will still worry about everything. I used to be happy when I was younger and extremely outgoing. Then I guess somewhere along the way I became unhappy and worried about what others thought about me. 

I'm barely staying afloat in the rough seas that are depression.  To add to the list of my worries and feeling of worthlessness, I had a long struggle over my sexuality and finally came out as gay recently. I have received nothing but unconditional since I was born and adopted into a loving family at birth yet, I feel as if I'm a hindrance to them.  

I feel unloved when that's far from the truth. There are days where I actually whisper to myself that no one loves me. I won't lie and say that I haven't tried to distract myself by playing video games, and create a somewhat false reality that keeps me going barely.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm constantly drowning with no end in sight.

I want to feel happy again, I hate feeling numb.

TL;DR I'm constantly sad and feel numb, would appreciate support, advice or anything really.

4,"So I joined this server that I really fit in in Discord. I talk there almost everyday and a lot of people there known me. But I've been having a really tough time these past few months or weeks. My household is abusive in the manner of body-shaming and manipulation. There are times I vent in the Discord server because I had a bad day. However, because of this, I ...usually get warned for doing that. If I'm honestly having a bad day, or just a bad week, is it okay for the server to possibly ban me for talking about it? It feels like the one place I can really relax and just get support from friends, but apparently you're not...really allowed to talk about your bad day in it. 

I know that following the rules is a good thing, but for some reason, I feel frustrated when they tell me to go elsewhere. There is not a lot of places I *can* go. I have good friends there and it's a relaxing place. 

Though I'm probably at fault for venting ""a lot"" or ""excessively"". I know it doesn't help me. I know talking about my abusive situation will distress others. I know I'm at fault for getting warned around two to three times. I just...I just feel like it's not fair to keep pushing away those who are in a bad situation. There was this one Discord user who had been beaten up by their father and was planning on escaping their situation, and they weren't warned, I don't think.

But I get warned. I get lectured. I feel rejected and maybe it's all my fault. Maybe I should just stop telling my friends about my situation because clearly they don't want to hear it. I'm at fault, I'm shit, and I wish I stopped venting so much. It's just the situation I'm in is constantly stressful and I'm sick and tired of my family. ",08Feb2019,1
5,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 15 (I’m 31)
I saw a therapist for an eating disorder I had when I was 15 and that’s when I learned I had anxiety. I didn’t share with my therapist that I was depressed (teen...)
My depression wasn’t as bad for the past 10 years or so, but recently it’s back and it’s been awful. Because of the shit that’s happening in my life (not important), I spent 50% of my time depressed. Can’t leave bed. Don’t eat, don’t are for myself... and then I somehow snap out of it and am ok for a few days.
I’m worried and my partner is worried.
I haven’t spoken with a doctor or any professional since I was 15.
I have a doctors appointment next week with a new doctor.
I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know what I’m looking for, I just know that I’m not right and I need help.
I don’t know if I want to be on medication.
What should I say to the doctor? “I’ve been depressed for years but never been diagnosed?” Doctors hate that (self diagnosing) and I understand why. But I know what I feel. And I know I struggle with it. 
Thanks ",08Feb2019,1
6,"I don’t know who I am anymore. Everything in my life is changing and I want to talk about it, I want to scream about it. I’m so angry and I’m finally coming to terms with the horrible childhood that I had, I used to be so ashamed but now I’m full of anger.

I can’t exactly say what I’m dealing with online due to legal issues and also the fact that I am so ashamed and dazed about the repercussions years later, but I am absolutely lost.

I’m in my second year of university and I want to drop out due to just not feeling alive or capable anymore. 

My friends don’t care, they’re happy. Nothing I could say would make them listen or care, which sucks because I’ve always been there for them to talk to.

I feel like I’m bugging my boyfriend when I talk. 

I don’t see my therapist enough. 

My mom stopped talking to me. 

I don’t know, lately I’ve just been feeling more and more like I’m fading out and I’m just okay with it at this point.

Nothing feels okay and I am not me anymore. ",08Feb2019,1

11,"Lets face it… many of us were born into this dysfunctional world into dysfunctional families… surprise, surprise, we developed dysfunctional coping mechanisms. For that we should not feel bad about ourselves,  but be proud of our ability to adapt and survive. But guess what? Now that we're adults the world is even more screwed up and dysfunctional, so guess what, to survive we still need dysfunctional coping strategies while becoming completely self aware of our true selves.

The fact is, we can reintegrate every aspect of our fractured suppressed true selves, true likes, dislikes, opinions etc… we can become the most enlightened and emotionally and psychologically balanced person in the world, but guess what, you won't fit in to this world because this world operates from a dysfunctional perspective with many self centered, self opinionated, ignorant people that we have no choice but to interact with. And so it becomes clear that the only way to deal with living in a dysfunctional world is to remember that you're living in a mental asylum. You can't have perfect normal relationships with crazy people. 

So remember who you are… don't forget your true self… but when it comes to going out into the world, be prepared to put on few different fake versions of yourself so that the crazy people don't notice you. Like, if your boss or teacher is a jerk, you can't just be your true self and tell him how you really feel, we all put on a fake version of us when we need it. Similarly, when you are with other safe and sane people like you… yeh sure, be your true self, have your own wants, needs, opinions etc. But as soon as you leave your safe zone, be prepared to act like the rest of the zombie population out there, otherwise you'll find a whole bunch of them coming after you like some sort of post zombie apocalypse …. Lol

Some are family members, others are friends, others workmates, schoolmates, teachers, employers and employees… they've all grown up in this retarded dysfunctional world and most of them don't even know that they are dysfunctional and not self aware… yes, all the crazy people in the nut house think they're normal, but in reality most lack compassion, kindness, human decency….

On our own, we just can't change the world we live in, but we still have to live in it. So while we have to live with the zombies that don't understand what it's like to suffer from severe anxiety and depression, just play along… find a safe place and a friend or two that knows what its like to be you, ground yourself in who you are, what you want and like, your opinions (this takes lots of soul searching, inner child work and shadow work… read my other posts) Then, when you know who you are, you are then free to empower yourself to go out and put whatever mask on you want to function with anyone anywhere. 

As survivors of childhood trauma, many of us have made a life of being a fake version of ourselves to fit in… often we do such a good version of our fake selves that even we believe that our fake selves are our true selves. Once we realize that we're not, and discover our individuality, and ground ourselves firmly there in that place that is our true selves…. At that point we are the best actors in the world… once you know what the dysfunctional people around you want, you can play any role you want so as to blend in while at the same time not losing yourself in the lunatic asylum of a world that we live in.

This doesn't mean compromising our true selves, or saying yes when we mean no, it just means playing the game that's trying to play us. Stay true to yourself, don't waste time trying to change others you who are ignorant and want to stay ignorant. Be firmly grounded in your own self awareness, and play the game or the game will play you.",08Feb2019,1
12,"My wife of 23 years has a degenerative health condition since she was only 12. My heart went out to her the moment I met her because I felt she deserved just as much that life could give her as anyone else, she was cheeky, sarcastic, not a complainer about her serious health issues, and pretty damn hot in the looks department. Unbeknownst to me and her, at age 20 I was a codependent people pleaser. The scene was set, the end inevitable. 

Don't get me wrong, we had good times, but my perception of marital life and relationships were totally screwed up as a people pleasing, validation seeking, codependent person. Whereas she was a self sustained self motivated person. 

Now, 23 years later she's had both knees fully replaced, hip replaced, shoulder replaced, ankle fused… she's been on a lifetime of immuno-suppressant drugs that degrade all her organs, including her mind. As a codependent, it's been so soul destroy seeing her happiness decrease steadily over time, so deeply cutting into my own unhappiness as a codependent.

Now, even if she wants to, she mentally can't cope with more than a few minutes of my true self. You see, till 2 years ago, I maintained false people pleasing version of myself since childhood. This all stopped two years ago, when the wheels on the bus stopped going round and round and just fell off with severe social anxiety and deep depression.

2 years later I now know my true self but my wife is too physically and mentally limited to enjoy sharing this new life of mine… after 23 years of getting use to me, its just too overwhelming for her because of her pain meds making her operate in a mental fog, not to mention her deteriorated brain function.

So how the hell do I cope with this impossible dysfunctional situation? Here's how I'm planning to…

Compartmentalization.

Compartment Number 1:

•	This compartment contains my true self. I generally only enjoy it on my own. I listen to sad songs, jaded songs… sounds depressing and yes, I do cry, but for me, listening to painful songs helps me to feel like I'm not the only one to have felt emotional pain, it feels self nurturing, like its ok to feel what I feel…validating. When I'm on my own in my separate bedroom for health reasons, its my emotional safe zone, where I can be who I want, need what I want, want what I want, be sad, be happy, be jaded, frustrated, angry, any feeling is ok… I'm in a state of complete and total self awareness and emotional allowance of any and all of my feelings without judgement, criticism, ridicule… just me being fully present and allowing of all feelings and emotions… my true self… the thing is I have the power to close this compartment, and open compartment number 2.

Compartment Number 2:

•	This compartment is devoted to my wife's happiness and emotional stability with only slivers of my true self. It's where I become whatever she needs and wants me to become to please her of my own choice and free will. However, my true self makes me refuse to watch lengthy television programs with her just to disfunctionally people please. But I try to listen to whatever she wants to say and talk about and share with genuine interest… but when she's done I put my headphones on with my empowering music which stops me from wanting to share my true self, new personal interests like a funny YouTube video I liked… because she hates it, begrudges it, in her eyes I'm a bottomless pit of want that can never be filled so it's way too much effort for her to make it worth it… it's true, I'm needy… I wish I wasn’t but I am… oh yeh… she's menopausal now too. This strategy, although totally dysfunctional keeps me emotionally safe and gives my wife what she needs.

We live a dysfunctional life, in a dysfunctional world… extreme degenerative sickness and pain is dysfunctional, and so… less than ideal, empowering dysfunctional coping strategies are necessary for me… rather than automatic subconscious dysfunctional coping mechanisms.

This being the case I probably still need a non judgy confidant friend for this to work to supplement my need for meaningful emotional connection with things that interest me personally. Perhaps this is unrealistic and unsustainable, especially if I don't have that special friend to lean on… gets lonely, and soul destroyingly sad in this messed up world we live in…

13,"I cant tell anyone I know IRL. I'm that guy that no matter how hard or bad things get, I seem to hold it together as long as possible. I thought the hell was over with the new year and that life would get better. Well I was way wrong. It's getting worse every day I breath. A bit about me. I live in northern alberta and I live with my parents because I cannot afford to move and what I can afford goes to paying my parents bills. I live in pain every day from disc degenerating disease, spina bifida occulta and a disc in my back that is really easy to slip out of place. I also suffer undiagnosed depression. I tried once to get it diagnosed but it turns out I am unable to tell people face to face what my true feelings and issues are. Even my own doctor. 
This last few months have gotten worse and worse for my family and myself. My dad owns a small trucking company that is going down way to fast. He owns 2 trucks and a set of trailers that we owe on. Both trucks have blown engines as of late last month. He has not worked since. My parents bills are way behind and I don't even know how to deal with that. I'm dealing with my own debt that I have. My credit is bad and I cannot do any kind of credit with the agreement I made. I'm the orderly payment of debt to get all my credit paid off. I have been unable to pay my bills and cover my parents this last while do to multiple breakdowns with my car. I live beyond paycheck to paycheck and I have a decent job.  My car wrecked last year and I got another but the work required costed more than the car. I bit the bullet and got it done as it was not alot of work. Total between work and car costed 4000. It runs good now and I hope it stays that way as I have no fall back plans left. 
Yesterday was what I would call a it all goes wrong type day. Did not matter what I did somthing broke or in this case a pile of stuff broke. I am just tired of this crap happening every freaking week. There may be more to come but I gotta actually get out of bed and get going to work",08Feb2019,1

15,"I feel like I'm failing my family. I'm the mother of two young boys and pregnant with our third boy who's due in April. I've been depressed for a long while and it's been a lot of ups and downs (a whole lot of downs) and it really became bad after my first was born 4, almost 5 years ago. Then my father died 3 months after and not too long after that I was sexually assaulted. My fiance has stuck by me through everything and was an amazing support for a long time, but now they just aren't able to anymore. I think I've worn them down and let them down so much they just can't anymore, which is painful. They also have a lot they're dealing with and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible. But things feel like they just keep going backwards and getting worse because of me. We were in an argument the other day and just seeing the pain in there eyes, that I caused was really hard to see. It was an unbearable feeling and I have so much guilt for ignoring them for so long because *I'm* sick. Aside from this, I've lost a few jobs now for various reasons so they're the only one providing for us. They often get mad because I'm unemployed and I don't blame them for that. I'm not even good at being a stay at home parent. The dishes often pile up for a long time, the floors are horrid and we have a large amount of bed bugs because our land lord won't treat the apartment building and it gives me even less motivation to keep things clean, I feel disgusting. I feel like my family could do so much better without me, and I have thought of just dying but I have no active plans for it. They just deserve so much better than I give them and I think soon they may just leave me behind because I keep failing them. ",08Feb2019,1
16,"Hi all, new here. I have a very long story about myself and battling depression. Everything seemed fine when I was young until about age 17 when I found out my father was cheating on my mother and I showed her the evidence. At that time my life went down hill from that point on. I’m now 51. In the middle of the process when my parents were getting divorced my mom and I moved to a new place. Shortly afterwards, my father died in a single rollover car accident on a highway. Through the chaos, my long-time girlfriend at the time broke up with me when she went off to college. Though I worked my ass off to help my mom with expenses she decided that she needed another man more than she needed me. This guy was a total asshole and told me all kinds of lies so he could convince me and her to get a place and move in with him. Before I knew it my life not only did a complete 180 it also started to spiral. I started using drugs and going through jobs like crazy. I ended up working for him and that was a nightmare. I managed to get myself kicked out of the house and was living in my car. I stayed with various friends around town and ended up making friends with a gal and we slept together a couple times. She told me she couldn’t get pregnant, but she did. She was also psychotic, and I got away from her. I met my current wife not to long after and she let me sleep at her and her two young children’s place. I say we met but actually we knew each other casually, small town. She was recently divorced and had a 5 yr. old that she had at a very young age and an 18 month old. She wanted to have me stay but she said no more drugs and I had no issues with that and I stopped cold turkey.
Mistake #1. I wanted to be with her and was desperate to be part of a family. The problem is it became a savior type situation and I played the beholden person because she helped me out. 
Mistake #2. Though she came into the relationship with two children that I adored she was adamant about not wanting a man that had any kids, so I lied about the pregnant one.
Mistake #3. I started working a steady job and allowed my wages to be comingled with hers and she did all the banking.
The crazy gal I got pregnant had a baby girl. She wanted me to be with her and because I wouldn’t and she started harassing us and took me court for child support. I did not believe that she was mine, so I had a paternity test and it came back that she was. My current wife suggested that it wasn’t about the baby but her wanting me, so we agreed to pay child support, but I wanted to see my daughter. This was a mixed message because she was furious that I had a child. The crazy one decided that wasn’t worth it to her and stopped the whole process if I agreed to not come around. After that took place and was over there isn’t a week that goes by that this situation doesn’t get thrown in my face. I contacted my daughter when she turned 18. She’s my child and I was hoping everyone would be mature about it 18 years later. Though her and I get along great the rest of the world went into turmoil. Her mom and dad freaked out, my wife freaked out and now I do not contact or talk to her or visit when in town just to keep the whirlwind of bullshit aftermath to a minimum. My wife gets into fights with me and starts saying things like I want to be with her mom and shit. I don’t understand this. I just want to know my daughter.  
Mistake #4. We eventually got married and had a child between us. This would all seem to be good, but he was treated differently by her and compared to the other two. The other two also picked up on that and started doing mean and hateful things to our son and most the time got away with the things they were doing. He quickly became my world because I started to resent what I had done and was determined to bring happiness to his life. Him and I were very close when he was growing up and I guess you could say I was co-dependent on him because there were many, many days that I got out of bed just because of him.
My wife and I would have very bad fights because I started developing anger issues with regards to how my life was going. Through it all I reassured him and stayed by his side when he was frightened I was going to leave. I was also determined that he wouldn’t come from a broken home as I did. 
Fast forward to ten years ago. Everything in my life started to melt down after all the years of crap. The first kid who was now in her 30’s, had popped out 6 kids, and also had a ruined troubled marriage, couldn’t take care of herself and all her kids so we had started to “loan” her money all the time. (She’s had 2 more since) I say loan with quote because sometimes it wasn’t a loan but more of a handout every other month. The middle child who is my wife’s favorite and is treated as such by never having to face any consequences was in and out of the house because he simply didn’t have the brain capacity to take care of himself. He had wrecked every vehicle he had in one-way shape or form including being drunk and falling asleep at the wheel and completely flipping his car three times on a major highway.  What made that even better is he was also smoking pot and his bong and weed was found at the accident scene. Our youngest between us started acting out for reasons I don’t know till this day. One day we were connected and the next he closed himself off to anything related to me or family. I was devastated. Then he signed up for the military and walked out my front door and hasn’t returned since. He went to war in Afghanistan and I found out his unit and sent him a care package. I got a msg a couple weeks later that he didn’t want me sending anything to him and he was going to take what I sent and throw it in the fire pit. He since has finished his tour, came back to our town, got married and hides from me not wanting anything to do with me. This is where the serious depression sank in. 
I felt alone, betrayed by my own blood with my son and my Mom (another long story), debt up to my eyeballs, miserable job that is too late for me to leave because I have too much retirement invested to leave now, taking care of adult children that have their own children, and a miserable wife who is demanding, controlling (still controls the money), menopausal so no sex, and is a bitch in general especially when I decide to stand up for myself. I sit here typing this now with yet another one of my things broken because she decided to go postal over the fact that I wanted 20 bucks to go out to lunch while she was in another town taking her needy son to the doctor because he can’t do it himself. I have a busted hand because I could no longer take the frustration of such a huge fight over an insignificant thing and decided to pulverize the hallway closet door. I haven’t hit anything in over 25 years.  
Am I depressed? Damn right I am. I literally have to look for things to live for and wonder from day to day if I’m just too much of a coward to end my misery. On the Christmas after my son left I still hadn’t really got a handle on his state of mind and found out he came to town to visit and didn’t tell us because he was done. At the same time the oldest decided she was going to bring her crew of kids to visit. I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to go on meds. I’ve been on sertraline ever since. And though I was calm when it kicked in I never really felt less depressed with my life. I decided to go off it several times because I don’t feel its really doing anything for me and I have also gained a ton of weight. Close to 80 pounds. But I get violent withdrawals even if I’m just tapering down. My doctor put me on alprazolam to help me taper going off sertraline. I almost lost my job because I started going ballistic on my asshole boss. So, I stayed on the sertraline.
I wrote this long post because I don’t really know what to do with myself anymore. There isn’t a single thing in my day to day life that brings me joy. I feel like I’m just living from one disaster to the next with no end in sight and life seems more of a chore than anything else. I wonder if my expectations of what my life should be gets in the way of just how things go. I don’t know. I’ve posted tidbits in various places around Reddit but never to this degree. I don’t really expect any revelations to come about when people read it, so I’ll just say thanks for letting me vent because I have nobody to talk to.

17,"My boyfriend (my best friend of four years, we are now in a LDR) has always suffered from severe depression. I always try to be there for him, but due to events that happened prior to our relationship are- essentially- the source of his pain. It kills me how badly it affects him because he doesn’t like talking to me about it anymore due to having hurt me before with how he wanted to blame me but couldn’t. Now he bottles most of his pain, only sometimes letting me in to talk to him. 
Through all of my relationships, he has been there as my best friend. Four years ago when we first became friends I did like him- however he was definitely someone whom could get whoever he wanted and did so for a while. Five months ago, he admitted to having liked me through all these years while I was in my last relationship. I admitted the same, having thought he genuinely had no real interest in me, believing the flirting of all the past years had only been out of fun or because he simply could.
We were very happy for a while, knowing we both had feelings but I didn’t want to break up with my current boyfriend, plainly choosing someone else infront of him. We waited for the relationship to- ultimately inevitably- end before getting together. 
However, I had only one long term serious relationship in the past, of which he thinks about constantly. Due to stories he had told me about his active casual sex life, I felt comfortable talking to him about the details of my year and a half relationship. He knows everything about everything, and it kills him. He gets horribly depressed about everything that happened and we’ve both gotten in small arguments about it because he knows it’s not in his place to be upset, but at the same time he is. 
He once told me that he didn’t know what hurt worse, that I wanted to be loved so bad I let myself be hurt in such a toxic relationship, or that I wanted to be loved and I just hadn’t chose him. 
He had been hurting so bad while I was in that relationship he almost committed suicide multiple times, got super into drugs trying to forget, got with a bunch of girls, etc. and I feel horribly responsible for being so genuinely oblivious...
He talked about how he used to have standards for girls if he ever wanted to date them twice... how I made him throw all of it away the first time, the second time he said “I always had my standards for girls high if i was gonna date them. Because usually I would only date a girl if I really wanted a future with them and like actually loved them. And like I guess now i'm starting to realize my standards were about the wrong things. But i said Id never date a hoe or a girl who would let herself be used. I always wanted them to be clean and if I was gonna be serious with them I wanted them to be a virgin. Even if it wasn't fair I figured if I was gonna let a female hold me down they had to be a really pure one ig. And now I'm just. Idk because it pulls me apart bc i know you're the one and no one else makes me feel how you do and you're the one I'll always want for life and I won't throw that away, but alot of things in me are telling me to push away”
It tears me apart I’m not any of that some times, despite what he’s said before about how I made him throw all of that away. He’s said “he’ll never get to have me in the way he wanted to” and it shreds me even more. Because I know how he loves me, but it hurts to know how horribly I’ve destroyed him and refuses to open up to me for fear of hurting me. 
I don’t know what to do... if anyone knows things I could say in support of him to help him get over this, his depression, his anxiety, anything, please help... ",08Feb2019,1

21,"I go to a very Hugh performing grammar school in England and all my peers are rich as fuck. I lack any motivation and am falling behind and my parents know it. It sucks because my dad Uber’s all day to keep the family running and my mom cleans gardens.i feel like a disappointment and all my fucking family hate me. They tell me that. I am so done. I can’t talk to girls and I go to an all boys school. I can’t perform in any social situation and even my extended family know I’m a little bitch. I get money but if I spend it I feel guilty knowing how hard my dad worked for it yet my brother and sister spend as they please. I go days without showering and I am just sick and fucking tired. I try and I mean well but anything I do goes to shit. Watching my friends have fun with drugs and alcohol makes me insane because again I feel guilty for my parents. I miss out on trips that are more than a tenner because I don’t tell my parents , they would pay but it would fuck up the money situation even more.

I’m just done and so fucking tired of my shitty life. I don’t know what to do",08Feb2019,1
22,"I have been depressed for a long time. many years. However, I would always feel like there was hope somehow. Now I'm 26, majestically failing at my job (which I dislike in general), unable to sit and work through it to finish my undergraduate thesis and at least graduate. It has been 7 years already since I started my career. 

My strength has always relied on my intelligence and potential artistic skills, but now I'm a failure who has spent his 20's laying in bed getting high or eating, trying to chase away thoughts. Every time I open my mouth I discover I am not as smart as I thought I was, nor I am as talented as I suspected. 

Right now I'm at the bottom. Have been for 2 years and can't seem to get out. Lately, everybody has stopped believing in me and I will probably lose my job in a couple of months since my performance is so bad. This week I've been sleeping all day long as soon as I come back home in order not to think about shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am convinced I am a failure. Even my friends and family have told me that. I have no way of not seeing my current life as a product of my laziness, but I can't also find a way to put myself together and fight back. I did for some weeks, but it was gone really fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. To be honest, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because my parents would suffer a lot. I am doomed to be trapped in this unhappy life which I cannot seem to be able to escape from. 

I can't escape from myself. I dislike myself. I am a loser. ",08Feb2019,1
