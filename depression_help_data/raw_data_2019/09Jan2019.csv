0,i actually need to talk to someone that has been in the same boat as me and got help. I started taking birth control for my endometriosis with my period (endometriosis it like having cramps that feel similar to labor pains ) to numb the pain. Birth control is known to trigger depression; to make a long story short i was already not doing super great and i‚Äôm a very emotional person. I took this pill for four weeks and  now i have so much anxiety and depression and i‚Äôve never had actual anxiety attacks but now they‚Äôre coming left and right. I can‚Äôt feel any emotions;  i feel numb and i never felt numb before. I can‚Äôt feel love or happiness. (i am off the pill now) all i do is worry and overthink  ; so if anyone has ever gone through this can you please message me because i seriously don‚Äôt know how to get better from here on. thank you. ‚Ä¨,09Jan2019,1
1,"In August I called 911 to my house because I thought I was having a heart attack. It turned out to be my first anxiety attack. From that day onward I have experienced fear and sadness that I never knew existed. My doctor started me on Buspirone/Buspar and Propanolol. The Buspirone helped at first. After increasing to the highest dosage my anxiety and depression overtook the pill. He added Mirtazapine to my
medication regiment and I‚Äôm scared to take the first pill. I can‚Äôt have my son anymore because I have uncontrollable outbursts of extreme sobbing and I‚Äôm just always sad. I‚Äôm crying writing this right now. I‚Äôm alone every day after work and every weekend. I moved to California and I have no friends or family here. I would appreciate any advice or similar stories. I contacted a therapist today and am waiting for my first appointment.

I used to be a confident strong person. Now my life is in shambles. 

I am here to talk to anyone anytime. Talking to people is the only thing that seems to help. ",09Jan2019,1
3,"I am low. I‚Äôve been here many, many times. Normally I would lie in bed and sleep, but I can‚Äôt do that now. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm older and unable to sleep as much now as I did in my younger years? Or perhaps I‚Äôm not as depressed as I was before? 

I don‚Äôt think I would ever attempt to die by suicide, but when something tragic happens those thoughts come fast and strong. I even woke in the middle of the night a few weeks ago and immediately wondered if taking an entire bottle of blood pressure meds would work. It literally scared the shit out of me that I had a semi plan. 

I am able to hide the depression from coworkers and family, but inside I‚Äôm dying. 

Anyone else here? ",09Jan2019,1
4,"I'm an outcast. Or maybe a better way to describe it is people just ignore me or shit on me. 

I joined a leadership club at college to try to be better at that, but at the end everyone made such great friends and I still had nobody. They all ignored what I said or talked over me or rolled their eyes when I spoke or tried to make friends. They treated me like a weirdo or an idiot.

This happens to me all the time. I always get treated like crap. I break my back for people and I just get shit on and maybe I just am not one who is meant to be happy. 

Even my own family leaves me out of everything and talks behind my back. Im nothing but nice to people and I'm just looked at as weird or annoying even though I know I'm not weirder or more annoying than anyone else. 

My boyfriend is the only one who consistently cares but even then it feels like I can't trust him; he says his friends are annoying and treat him badly yet he still hangs out with them over seeing or talking to me. He wouldn't listen when I said I was depressed until I told him my therapist diagnosed me. Apparently even my feelings are invalid. 

I know he loves me though and is otherwise a great person that I also love very much and can't live without. 

Nobody takes me seriously and just shits on me all the time and it's annoying. I'm the one nobody really cares about or makes time for, or the one people talk about behind my back. It's really getting to me. I've felt like this for years and today has been one of the worst. 

I would never commit or even attempt suicide but thoughts keep crossing my mind, like who would even care? Or care longer than an hour? 

I see my therapist every week but I guess I haven't been completely open with her. I probably should be next week though I'm just scared. ",09Jan2019,1
5,"My dad got really mad at me today because I gave him attitude, and as in mad, I mean MAD. This wasn't the first time this has happened, though. Sometimes I give my parents attitude without realizing it, and they get mad when I say I din't know. Anyway, my dad sent me to my room and told me to stay there for the rest of the evening. Then he decided to come into my room and started yelling at me about how I was a bitch, I was a heartless person, and that I didn't deserve anything and the reason he only loved me was because I was his daughter. When he left, I started to have a panic attack, as I was already depressed and I stress too easily. Later that evening, my dad started to talk to me, not about what happened, but just random things like I was okay! I haven't talked to anybody all day, and my parents are pretty annoyed with me, which I don't understand, because it was their fault. I don't know what to do anymore, I tried self harm, and I honestly just need a hug.

8,"I have been a victim of depression for as long as I can recall. My family doesn‚Äôt trust me as a result of my cynicism which isn‚Äôt directed towards them. My father and brother are self-righteous, my mother has constantly yelled at me since I was two, threatening to have me deported (i‚Äôm a Guatemalan adoptee). I retain almost all anger and sadness I experience, and I can‚Äôt go a day without recalling the mal acts I have witnessed and been a victim of. I don‚Äôt give a shit about anyone‚Äôs opinions, but the discrimination directed towards me doesn‚Äôt help. There‚Äôs one specific memory that has been bothering me, lately. In the third grade, I developed intimate feelings for a girl (let‚Äôs call her Emma). During the time, she was incredibly present, and her devotion to religion gave me the idea that she was innocent (i‚Äôm atheist, and I have been for years. In the sixth grade, I informed her of my opinion of her. That was before I realize dhow much of a bigoted narcissistic cunt she was. I overheard her claiming that she wanted her grandfather to die a horrible death because she ‚Äúgot her phone taken away by him.‚Äù Emma constantly judged people who didn‚Äôt agree with her, or didn‚Äôt conform to her standards (she was perceived as popular as a result of an abundance of attention from male students). The one time I requested her contact information, she gave me written instructions on how to use it. At that moment, I realized how blind I was to her mal acts, and how illogical I had been acting because of neurological development. She later participated in mass verbal assault against me, started an argument with me because she believed I was homosexual. There was one instance in which I was conversing with a peer of mine, and informing him of my disdain for those who faked mental illness for attention. Emma decided to enter the conversation, claiming that ‚Äúif you were a good person, you wouldn‚Äôt think like that.‚Äù Her and her affiliates have called me various racial slurs (especially border n*gger). I cannot express my hatred for them, and the rest of conformist human society. I‚Äôve seen it happening everywhere. It‚Äôs inescapable, and I consider suicide every day, thinking that she and her friends might feel guilty for taking a life. I just want to speak with someone. Thank you. ",09Jan2019,1

13,"First time on here...please exscuse me
I've had problems with depression, low self esteem and isolation/loneliness for most of my short life ( 20 yrs). I'll admit I have a problem with being alone; whether i crave the company of a friend or romantic partner, I just have a really hard time being alone. Some backstory to what's caused my current depression episode: back when I was in highschool I had met a boy online who I quickly gained a liking to; we started a long distance relationship soon after and that lasted around two years, I ended the relationship because both of us were just too busy with our lives. I felt like i wasn't getting a lot of attention from him, of course I didn't expect 24/7 attention or anything that's ridiculous, that I was already used to. We went from chatting nearly everyday to maybe getting two messages from him every 2 or 3 days. I didn't necessarily want to break up and neither did he but I just wasn't happy and he told me that if I wasn't happy then I should just break off the relationship. Over the next 3 years we would casually get back in contact to see how each other was doing. He would repeatedly tell me how he was still romantically tied to me, how he was upset that he ""just let me go"" and that he's been wanting to fix things ever since so he would ask me if I was willing to try again multiple times. For the first two years I was just way too scared that the same thing would just happen again and I didn't know how I would handle it because my feelings are made out of damn glass. I still loved him of course as well; both of us moved on to dating other people. During November 2018 we got back in touch and I was ready to try again so I asked him out and he said yes of course. He was super happy about it and so was I. Everything seemed fine for the next few weeks but then during the last week of November he told me he had some work to go do and I just haven't heard from him sense... I've tried calling him, on my phone and snapchat, and I've only ever gotten his voicemail. I've sent a bunch of texts and messages through the different social media's I knew of that he had (some of them he's deleted) I'm quite heart broken from the whole situation and don't know what to do now. I'm jealous that some of my friends have had great, long lasting relationships. A close friend of mine is going to have a baby soon with her highschool sweetheart, I'm super happy for them but at the same time I'm upset because why can't I have something like that too? Not necessarily a baby, just a long lasting, reliable relationship. It always feels like the small good things that happen to me never last and are immediately replaced with sad or stressful situations. It's made me so tired of life and question whether it's even worth it anymore. I've been to therapy, have prescribed medications and  some people around me who understand because they have depression themselves but it still feels like nothings working. I feel alone and I just want to curl up into a ball as small as i can make and just never move or do anything again.",09Jan2019,1

17,"I'm currently at work and I'm struggling to function. I am an intern with a shitton of insecurities. I haven't really told anyone here that I am struggling with mental health problems. Mostly because I am scared of their reactions.  


My parents haven't really been the greatest help either. Last weekend we had a massive falling out when we talked about school. I told my parents that it may take me one year longer to graduate because I needed to focus on my own mental health first. They just looked at me weirdly and basically told me to get over it. I managed to stand up for myself, but I couldn't help but let my emotions get the better of me. I've yelled and cried, and yet they still see my depression as being ' a bit blue ' even though my mom has been depressed and has been taking anti-depressants for years! Isn't that hypocritical??

18,"This is my first time posting anywhere like this so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right but I just really need to tell someone what's going on with me and hear that I'm not alone

Before 2018 I was an optimistic teenager eager to start my own life. I was always the funny one in my group of friends and I loved hanging out with them.

I went from that to a depressed, anxious mess of a person in under a year with the help of two major surgeries. I have no interest in hanging out with my friends and when I do, I don't know how to act like myself. Health problems are still bothering me daily, and I'm only 18.
How the hell is this going to get any better. I'm so goddamn hopeless and tired, I didn't go to school at all last year and now I'm trying to start studying again but it all feels so pointless. What the hell am I even studying for?
I'm 18 and I don't have a job, don't know how to drive and have no savings.
I feel like I'm going go explode at any moment and start throwing things and screaming at the top of my lungs. I have never ever felt as hopeless as the past year has made me feel. The only thing that brings me comfort is the fact that I can off myself at any moment.

I could honestly write a novel of all the things that are causing me anxiety and things that went wrong lost year. 2018 was the absolute worst year of my life.

I was slightly constipated as well, but again I managed with a little tums and ginger. I was doing well, had a great job, friends, social life, family was okay, I was going to the gym regularly hitting PRs. Then my nausea started getting worse to the point it was almost all day everyday, finally got in to see PCP, she gave me Omeprazole. Took it for about a week early November, started to get intense heartburn so I quit. After this omeprazole is when it started to go downhill. I was so nauseous it felt like I was gagging as I was eating. I missed 3 weeks of work. I layed in bed all day because it seemed to be the only thing that helped. I even stopped eating because I couldn't keep the nausea at bay, I went to the ER 4 times, Urgent Care 3 times, seen a GI Specialist, and switched PCPs and I'm still at square one as to whats going on. I took so much zofran I'm lucky I didnt OD, still no change in nausea, Combined Zofran with Promethazine, still insane nausea.

27,"Hello everyone, and apologies for the throwaway account and for the length of this post. 

I'm in my mid-30s and I‚Äôve been dealing with undiagnosed depression and anxiety (and I wouldn't rule out a pinch of something else) ever since I was a teen; unfortunately the stigma is strong here, and ironically my situation at this time prevents me from seeking help, so everything sort of coalesced into low self-esteem and a constant sense of feeling like I'm bothering everyone (being ghosted multiple times by people I trusted, and occasionally gaslighted, surely didn't help).

In any event, I‚Äôm trying to stay afloat without burdening myself too much with pointless ‚Äúnew year‚Äôs resolutions‚Äù; of course I‚Äôd like to feel better, but I find that ""resolutions"" just add pointless pressure. I‚Äôm finding it hard anyway, in part because feeling low is pretty much a habit at this point, and in part because I just can't seem to break the wall.

For most of the things that involve ‚Äúthe world out there‚Äù I have to rely on others, simply because I don‚Äôt drive (I did get a license at 18, but that was it and never drove afterwards: I had a crazy first driving school teacher who literally called everyone names, and the second one was better but I got stuck once and panicked, and that subconsciously put me off driving, even though now I'd love to be able to do so). This leads to an even stronger sense of self-hatred ‚Äî being 30-something and having close ties to your parents isn‚Äôt at all unusual in my country, but having to rely on your father to go to places is definitely odd ‚Äî yet also leads to a strong desire for finally breaking out. Or trying to.

This is not just about driving, however, even though I do think that if I got back behind the wheel and got a car of my own I would probably unlock the world; having a car would also prevent me from making excuses with myself, which is another annoying habit of mine.

I often feel like I‚Äôd like to do things that are effectively pretty normal to normal people, but they wind up being a big deal for me. I'm talk about things as simple as going to meet a friend, for instance. Every time I force myself to do things that I want to do that I'm stopping myself from doing, and manage not to chicken out, it generally goes well. I think that, whatever it is I‚Äôm planning to do, I just rehearse so much in my head that I focus only on the potential negatives and ultimately give up before even trying, probably because subconsciously I feel that if I don't do a certain thing, that thing cannot go wrong. Makes sense, yet it's so stupid. That's how you wind up with white hair and yet have fewer life experience than a teenager. Bring on more self-hatred.

Now, while meeting a friend is a relatively harmless thing even if it goes badly (just how bad can it go anyway?), there are bigger things out there I‚Äôd like to do. For instance: taking driving lessons again, as I said (partially behind my family‚Äôs back, simply because they don‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù anxiety; and by not driving, living on the edge of town and not really going out much, that ‚Äî ironically ‚Äî becomes more complicated than it should be), or... going to London.

See, I love London and had the time of my life when I was finally able to go back three years ago with an acquaintance/friend. It was truly the best week of my life, I even slept better than I normally do, I took nice photos that everyone loved (photography is a hobby of mine), and just enjoyed everything more than I can say in words. I‚Äôve been meaning to go again ever since I came back from that trip, but never found anyone to go with me (London is quite expensive, unfortunately, plus I‚Äôd rather go with someone who has similar interests to mine), and with the upcoming Brexit mess, I finally decided to book a hotel for March. Alone. That's huge, but the catch is that I didn't commit to anything: I can cancel for free and I still haven't booked the flight.

The people I shared this with were enthusiastic and cheerful and encouraging and happy for me, but I‚Äôm obviously having cold feet. I should really book the plane asap before the prices increase, but that would mean committing (or at least losing the money of the flight if I change my mind). And I just can't get myself to do it, I have even stopped planning my trip (I like being on top of what I'm going to see, what times places open, how far they are, etc.)

What am I afraid of? I honestly can‚Äôt even tell. My English has been described by native speakers as ""flawless"", so communication is not a problem. Indeed, and when I was there three years ago, I was a completely different person: I felt outgoing, I spoke with everyone just for the heck for it, I took the lead about where to go, I loved every single moment of it. I even told two pretty shop assistants that they had lovely smiles (not in a creepy way, in fact I think I made their day because it was both sincere and out of the blue), whereas here I can barely make eye contact with myself in the mirror and would rather be tortured than have to be social.

Maybe I‚Äôm afraid that on my own it won‚Äôt be as nice. Maybe it‚Äôs a reminder that, even though I do have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (admittedly mostly live far from me because it‚Äôs easier to open up online), nobody from around here wants to spend a week with me; I rationally know that's just me making excuses because the problem is that London is expensive, but it does make me wonder. Maybe I just want to share the best place in the world with someone, and I'm reminded that I have nobody.

So I focus on the potential negatives, coming up with idiotic doubts: if I have to go to the bathroom on the train, who‚Äôll watch my luggage? What if someone steals my camera? What if I get sleepy in the middle of the day and just have to have a nap somewhere? (I sleep poorly here, so that actually happens occasionally.) On the other hand, I know it would all be fine; it‚Äôs pre-Brexit London, not Gulf War Baghdad, and I‚Äôm not planning to go to any shady places; I can plan ahead to be back at the hotel, which incidentally is in one of the safest parts of central London, by mid-afternoon and go out again at night if I want to, for instance. There‚Äôs always Uber for quicker-than-public-transport needs, not everyone‚Äôs a horrible unreliable person (and there‚Äôs enough police to talk to someone trusted at any time if need be) and being alone for real for the first time ever would grant me a level of freedom I can only imagine: no compromises at all. Maybe that scares me. Yeah, it definitely does. But it also sounds good.

I work all day, all week. I don't make the big money, because hitting jackpot in my field (I work with languages) isn't easy, and there have been some major setbacks last year, so who knows what's coming up. But I pay everything on time, and also help my family; some would say I shouldn't do it as it often pisses me off, but I guess it's cultural, plus I only have them. I've actually helped a few friends financially and got burned, but hey, I put good intentions into it so I refuse to call myself stupid, at least for that. Still, I literally have no set work hours. I may get work at 2 am on Sunday, or at 10 am on Wednesday. I'll just do it, and won't complain about it because I see a lot of people struggling to find anything at all, while I managed to carve myself a little work niche there. And working makes feel better, actually; it makes me feel like I'm not completely useless anyway. But it's tiresome, and I could use a break. And that trip to London, well, those people I shared the hotel news with, they all said I really deserve it. I'd say they're right, if that didn't make me feel like uneasy because I generally feel genuinely worthless and worthless people are entitled to nothing, right? Maybe that's another reason for my not having the guts to commit.

Ugh, I‚Äôve written way too much. But my question is not just about London; it‚Äôs about all of these things that I want to do and that I know would help me. Going for an extra walk, taking driving lessons, meeting a friend, booking this damned flight. Sometimes I get the impulse of doing them: if I could do them right on the spot, I would; but that‚Äôs always when I just can‚Äôt do them. For instance sometimes I think ‚ÄúI should ask my father to have me drive, just how bad can it go?‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not possible right then for some reason. And then, sometimes even just a few minutes later, that ""pro-active high"" disappears and I go back to my usual self, with some extra self-hatred because of it for good measure. And then I go back to thinking about all the potential negatives (for instance, in the case of driving with my father: I‚Äôll mess up, he‚Äôll be disappointed, I‚Äôll feel like a failure, he‚Äôll pester me to do it over and over again like when I first got my license and I‚Äôll be put off, etc.)

So my question is: should I actually sort of force myself to do those thing when that ‚Äúpro-active high‚Äù strikes? Or maybe I should force me to do them anyway, regardless of whether I feel like doing it? It‚Äôs hard to go against myself, obviously, but I‚Äôm also quite a rational person, sometimes even too much, so I guess I could see that as a project. I‚Äôm just not sure if I would ultimately be setting myself up for further self-hatred. Ever since I got a smartwatch, however, I've been finding myself more active: reaching a hundred percent each day is addicting; I'm still chubby but I don't care, I'm moving more and that's a good first step. But miles and calories can be calculated, whereas doing those things (meeting a friend, booking a flight) just can't, so it's hard to set up a regimen.

Oh, and remember that feeling of worthlessness? I'm actually regretting writing all of this: I've been reproached multiple times of being verbose, and to think that someone read all of this and found it a waste of time makes me feel even worse. So if anyone is feeling that way, I'm really sorry. (A friend of mine said I should just stop apologizing for being myself, but it's not easy when you constantly feel guilty for, well, existing.)

Thank you in advance to anyone who has read so far, and who may leave a comment. I really appreciate it.

28,"I cant figure out how to make myself care. 
I own my own business with my wife. I have struggled with depression my whole life and am trying to manage it.
Nothing ever scares me enough to change.... in the past my partners would threaten to break up with me unless I fixed myself and it terrified me, but I could never figure out how to motivate myself to be better with the problems they had with me.

Now, I choose sleep over finishing something costing us hundreds in overnighting shipping fees. I slack on cleaning and have gotten respiratory infections and wheeze when I wake up. It got so bad once that I was constantly having sickness symptoms and it went away when I left the house. I cleaned but keep letting it get back to that point in this cycle I am in. 

I could loose my business, my home... my health... and more that I am afraid to share here. I have sacrificed so much to be where I am, and have worked so hard. I dont want to just throw it all away, but I cant motivate myself to change my behavior.

*I am on meds and have been refining what prescription I am on with my doctor over the past 8 years. 
*I am in therapy with a counseler/therapist.
*I am getting on a 9 month waiting list for a psychiatrist. 
*I am aware that I have depression as well as anxiety, PTSD, and obsessive tenancies such as picking skin till I bleed. I also struggle with hitting myself when I am frustrated, paranoia, self harm, suicidal thoughts and a bunch more little things that I can identify as mental health issues. 



TLDNR: I could totally die and loose everything but I dont care enough to be motivated to change. Advice? ",09Jan2019,1
29,"I haven‚Äôt been on Reddit before this profile and I‚Äôve never made a post, but I want to vent on here now, maybe get advice too.. 

I have always struggled with depression since I was a child (around 11 years old) but for the last 4 years before this I had been fine. I recovered, made something of myself and I haven‚Äôt felt that impending doom feeling for so long, up until about January 2018.

The weird thing is, nothing really ‚Äúhappened‚Äù. Like, no negative changes, only positive ones, however I just don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. I lost all my self confidence and even my closest friends tell me they‚Äôve never heard me talk so negatively about myself or be so anxious about doing regular everyday things.

I‚Äôm a model, it‚Äôs my job, but I‚Äôve completely stopped doing that and taken on another profession because I can‚Äôt stand looking at myself long enough to get ready for a shoot. And even if I manage to get ready, I can‚Äôt freely pose and make the pics look stunning because I‚Äôm just thinking about my insecurities. I no longer feel like the confident and vibrant person I‚Äôve always been. I just wanna hide in a cave and never come out.

I hardly ever eat or sleep and I have no motivation to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to workout, I don‚Äôt wanna see my friends. I never wanna go out and drink (sounds like a good thing but for me it‚Äôs really not. I can only drink if I‚Äôm in a really good mood and I just never am anymore) and I don‚Äôt wanna see any of my favorite artists or do anything that involves being in public. I don‚Äôt know where this funk came from but I‚Äôve been holding it in so long that I feel like I‚Äôm going completely insane.

I feel like medications are the worst option available, so it will be the last thing I ever subject myself to again. I‚Äôve never been suicidal except when they had me on all those stupid pills and weeks after I stopped I felt halfway normal again. Still really bad, just no more suicidal thoughts. Impending doom never went away until I found myself but now I‚Äôm back to the drawing board. 

Advice? Criticisms? Anything will help at this point. I‚Äôm starting to think me being against the medication might be my problem but I just don‚Äôt know.",09Jan2019,1
31,"I'm not even sure if this is a good idea to post here, but it gives a story about where my depression and anxiety started. 

Hmmm‚Ä¶where to start.  I guess I‚Äôll go back as far as I can remember.  I was born in Trail, BC.  I remember living with my mom and dad in a house on the corner.  I remember walking up a very large set of stairs every day to go to school.  I remember sharing a room with my brother.  There was one meal I remember in particular, we were having Kraft Dinner, and I ended up puking all over my plate of food.  There was a family in Trail that my brother and I would go to stay with.  From my understanding, that family was my first foster family.  I remember enjoying the time I spent there as they had a gaming system that I liked playing on, as well as lego.  I don‚Äôt remember much other than this.  
When I was about 7, we moved to Calgary, Alberta.  When I was 8, my brother and I were placed into foster care with our uncle and aunt.  They showed us love as if we were there own children.  They have since told me that they would have like to adopt us, but due to circumstances, they couldn‚Äôt.  The court papers showed that we were put into foster care because of my mothers mental illness and my father was transient.  Even when visiting with my mother, I don‚Äôt remember him being around much.  I remember a few visits with my mother, going to her apartment, spending weekends with her.  I remember often going to visit my grandparents in the apartment building that they lived in.  
My uncle was in the military, so we ended up moving around a bit.  After several years in Calgary, we got posted to Petawawa, Ontario.  We went to a Lutheran church in the next town over.  I fell in love with a girl there.  At least, at the time, I thought it was love.  Looking back on my first relationship, I feel I pushed her away because of my clinginess.  This is the first time I can remember of having an attachment issue.  I remember the house we lived in had a pool in the backyard.  It was a mess when we first moved in, but Uncle was able to clean it up.  It was awesome having our own pool.  I only had made a few friends.  I never was very outgoing, and making friends wasn‚Äôt my specialty.  My first year of highschool was here.  That was a hard year for me, having been bullied by older kids.  When we got posted out of Petawawa, I cried.  I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave behind the few friends that I had made.
In 1999, we got posted to Cold Lake.  New schools, new people.  I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this.  The family started attending a church.  I went to the youth group there and made some friends.  It was in Cold Lake that I looked in the mirror and figured I would spend all of my life alone.  At youth group, I met a girl.  We started dating in high school.  I felt like I was complete with her.  I felt like I was in love.  On September 28, 2002, we got married.  Everything was great for a while.  In 2005, Amber was pregnant.  She ended up having a miscarriage.  I am still devastated to this day about the loss of my first son.  What would be different now?  What would have changed if he survived?  I think about him often.  April 26 2007, Jacob was born.  He is my pride and joy.  I think after he was born, my relationship with Amber started going downhill.  I remember playing World of Warcraft one day, with Jacob on my lap, and she told me that I had to choose between her, and that game.  I admit, I was playing the game lots.  I chose her.  Many times I think I should have taken my exit pass then when it was presented to me.  Further down the road we had another child, Jeremiah.  Shortly after Jeremiah was born, we became foster parents and bought our first house together.  Our third foster child was a 1month old girl.  As soon as we saw her we decided that we were going to keep her if she wasn‚Äôt going home.  A few months later she gave birth to our daughter.  And after that we adopted another little girl.  What a big family we have now.
Our marriage has been slowly sliding downward for many years.  I felt like she never wanted to hear how I was feeling, and in turn I started to lose interest.  She had even suggested going to see a marriage counsellor, but I was pretty much checked out at that point.  Most days I locked myself in my computer room, so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the wife or kids.  Every day, whenever I was at home, I would be found in my computer room, watching Netflix.  This room was my quiet space, my home.  I didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged out with the rest of my family.  
In 2016 I was diagnosed with depression.  The doctor started me on 20mg of citalopram.  In a follow up appointment, my meds were upped to 40mg daily.  I have been on that dosage since.  At this point I am feeling that the meds arent really helping.  I have felt this way for a while, but nobody seems interested in changing it and trying something different.  I have now ordered CBD oil to see if that will help.  I have heard that it does, and am willing to try just about anything at this point to help get out of this rut.  
September 2019 is when my mid-life crisis began.  I don‚Äôt know how everything got to where it got too, but I ended up texting with another woman.  We ended up sending each other sexual memes,  and one thing led to another, and I was sneaking over to her house to have sex.  I would sneak out whenever I could, because being with her made me feel happier then I had felt in a very long time. Even my coworkers noticed a change for the better in me when this started.  Eventually I ended up telling my wife what happened.  She was devastated.  She said many things in her anger, which I am still trying to work through to this day, even though she says she has forgiven me.  After I told her, I packed up my stuff and left.  After bouncing around a couple places, I was able to get a place of my own.
While I was in between places, I fell into a very dark place.  I had a breakdown at work one day and had to leave in the middle of the afternoon.  The next morning, I called in to work sick.  When my girlfriend was taking one of her kids to school, I took a box cutter and started slashing at my wrists.  Luckily, I didn‚Äôt go deep enough to cause any major damage.  I went to the hospital in town, where they told me that there was nothing they could do for me.  Later that night. My girlfriend drove me to another city that has a psychiatric department, and I was admitted to the psych ward for 2 weeks.  One week after being discharged, I tried to strangle myself.  I had missed my meds for a few days, so feel this is what attributed to my feeling suicidal again.  Things never really improved.  A couple weeks later, I ended up going back to the psych ward for a week.  The psychiatrist told me that what I am going through is part of life and I had to learn how to deal with it. 
It hasn‚Äôt been an easy road.  There are so many days where I wish that I would go to sleep and not wake up.  So many days where all I want to do is stay in bed and not get out.  Even going to work has been difficult.  I am trying to fight the depression, but everytime I seem to be doing better, something comes up and sends me back to ground zero.  I‚Äôm writing this story down in Hope‚Äôs that I can reflect and add on it in the future.

32,"Hey guys,  


so for some years know I have been dealing with recessive depressive episodes.

  
That basically means that I have episodes in my life, usually not longer than a day, in which I am really depressed and afterwards everything goes back to normal. These episodes usually happen twice a week and sometimes it is so bad that I can be happy when I was at least able to eat a little bit. Usually I don't even get out of bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I have acknowledged this problem and am seeking professional help but the wait time in my country is at least three months and in the past time it has been increasingly bad. Now I notice in the evening before that the next day is going to be shitty, the symptoms usually are:  


1. Mental fatigue
2. Thinking that I am a burden on anyone and everyone, that everyone hates me and is just pretending to like me and spend time with me
3. Very dark thoughts that cloud my whole mind and reasonable judgement
4. In social situations I want to escape although I am usually a very social person

The problem is, that I can feel it coming and I feel so helpless that it just runs me over like a wave so I need to learn some coping strategies in order to survive the next day.  


I hope you guys have had some experience and give me a little bit of guidance.  


Thank you!
