I could be doing relaxing, happy-type stuff, be around cool people and still be depressed. I really don't know how else to explain this.",22Oct2019,10

I'm convinced that God hates me, there is no way I can have this much bad luck without God being upstairs using me as his little experiment to see how far you can push one person without them breaking. Well guess what, I'm broken. 

I'm in too deep of a hole, and everyday, no matter what I do, I'm sinking deeper and deeper.

I just do not see what the point is anymore if there is nothing I can do to turn my life around. The only reason I'm holding on is because I can't do it to my family (not my friends, I have none).",22Oct2019,4
2,"Hello, 

I'm new to reddit, but I feel like I need some serious help. I've been dating this guy I met in college for over a year. He's 25. He suffers from depression and anxiety but has refused to get help since he was first diagnosed. It comes in waves every two or three months or so and this wave is definitely the worst one. It's tied to being unemployed for several months after graduating college. 

He's becoming more and more withdrawn as he doesn't have money to get out of the house. I pay for him to go out sometimes (I get payed well) but it embarrasses him. He still refuses help, especially now that he would have to ask his mom (whom he lives with) to pay for it. I really want to help him, but he's always insisted that he can help himself and I being there when he needs me is enough. But I've 'been there' for over a year now and I really want to know what I can do beyond that to make him feel better. I've been thinking about telling his mom, but he doesn't want his mom to worry. I probably would if he admitting to feeling suicidal, but it hasn't gotten there, yet. (thank goodness)

Is there anything I can do? I really love this guy and I just want him to feel better, please help.",22Oct2019,4
3,"Depression and anxiety are caused by low levels of 3 key neurotransmitters in the brain. Those neurotrasmitters are serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. To get the depression to remission you need a medication that works by increasing the levels of those 3 neurotransmitters or increasing only dopamine a lot. I know a few.

-Selegiline is a MAOI-B that is a potent antidepressant that works by inhibing the monoamine oxidase which is responsible of removing those neurotrasmitters from the synapses. It will increase the level of of those 3 neurotransmitters and it takes a few weeks to fully work. It will work good on the anhedonia part of depression because is very dopaminergic and is also neuroprotective to dopaminergic neurons.

-Tramadol is a weak mu opiod agonist and a SNRI. This increases the levels of the 3 but by different ways. All opioids or opiates releases large amounts of dopamine in the brain. Is commonly used as pain medication but is one of the most potent antidepressant in the world and it could make someone suicidal feel happy in matter of hours specially via IV. It works very fast (1:30 hours) and the effect last 8 to 12 hours. Many people use it today as an antidepressant for years and only low doses are needed. It feels euphoric and is very anxiolitic. You will feel confident and optimistic about the future. The side effect are mild too but the downside is it could cause addiction and dependence. Specially at higher doses and it could cause a strong withdrawal.

-Low dose of amisulpride is an excellent medication for depression and anxiety and is used a lot for that purpose mainly in Italy. This is an antipsychotic that at the very low dose of 12.5 mg it only blocks the dopamine presynaptic autoreceptors which are in charge of clearing the dopamine from the synapse thus blocking it will increase a lot the amounts of dopamine in the brain. I guess to be like 3 times to 5 times the amounts. So the difference will be massive and you will feel in another world very fast. It start working very fast in just 2 hours and the effect last all day. I felt no side effects. But it could get tolerance at first like in a week but the effect will usually return stronger at 4 to 6 weeks. People have reported to work up to a year. Is very effective for social anxiety like Tramadol too.

-Parnate is a MAOI-A that's is very effective for resistant depression and anxiety. This are the first type of antidepressant developed and it needs a dietary restriction because of it's dangerous interaction with tyramine. It works by increasing the levels of the 3 key neurotransmitters too. Selegiline by been a type B at low doses don't need a dietary restriction.

-Nardil is another MAOI-A that works similar to Parnate but both have some different effects and advantages over the other. Is effective for social anxiety.

-Mirapex is a dopamine agonist that is used mainly for Parkinson's but is also very effective for treatment resistant depression. It works by mimicking dopamine in the brain thus increasing the levels a lot. This will increase a lot your enjoyment and pleasure levels. Is one of the most potent antidepressants but it have some downsides. It could cause a condition called DAWS when stopping the med and this is potentially permanent in some. At first produce harsh side effects like nausea and dysphoria but they will go away with the days and it will start working like in 2 to 4 weeks. It could cause addictive behavior. This is kind of a last resource medication.

-Ketamine is one of the most potent and faster antidepressant if not the most. Is both an anhastesic and recreational drug that act as a dissociative and hallucinogenic. It acts on many systems but mainly in glutamate and dopamine. It also promote neurogenesis and the grow of new neural connections. Is used today to save people who are suicidal in the ER and as a treatment for treatment resistant depression. It works very fast and is very effective. The effect of a single session last about a week or so. It will be approved soon by the FDA for depression. Unfortunately is quite expensive.

Psychological therapy is also recommended along side medication to address physiological issues like low self esteem for example. Exercise helps with depression and anxiety because it releases endorphins which are endogenous opiods of the brain and they promotes relaxation and feelings of well being. Socialization is also helpful.

In the other hand some illegals drugs like MDMA or LSD are know to have cured depression with only one dose in some people. Magic mushrooms act potently on serotonin and have been proven to be an effective antidepressant by brain scans. Ayahuasca could be helpful too because is basically a DMT + MAOI-A. Each of those medications above could work for many years. Hope it helps",22Oct2019,1
4,"So. I was a bit sick last week, enough to leave school on Thursday, and come a few hours late on Friday. It doesn’t sound like a big deal. But apparently my brain decided to go all “Doing anything at all is bad!” And “I’m gonna shut off now okay? Good luck with that.” 

What I mean by that is, not only was I physically sick, I also got hit with a pretty annoying depression wave. This is normal for me, it happens on a weekly basis, but since I was sick, apparently I couldn’t handle it. I also happen to be taking a college course right now, along with the the rest of my full 10th grade schedule. 

I didn’t even realize I was letting my self get so far behind, but now I’m behind on literally everything. I have a discussion for my college class that was apparently due last week, A current event for my history class that was due Friday, a biology assignment because my google form didn’t save when I did most of it on Friday, a project in history due tomorrow, a project in Environmental science due tomorrow (that I don’t even know the purpose of), and a Language Arts assignment due tomorrow.

I added all this up, and if I do everything at the fastest possible rate, it will still take 5 hours. I’m still sick too. We had an in service today, but I have school tomorrow. I don’t know what I am going to do. My mom has always pushed for straight A’s, and no late work ever, etc. There is dire consequences for a grade dropping to a B, let alone having two late assignments that are both worth a bunch of points, as well as other assignments that won’t be anywhere near to my usual level of work. 

I literally have to be at school in less than 12 hours. What am I going to do???!!!",22Oct2019,5

7,"So, this is my first reddit post. Sorry in advance for any typos or mistakes.

A little background. I'm 21 (f) and my parents divorced when I was about 5 years old. My dad couldn't deal with the fact that my older brother and younger sister both have severe cerebral palsy, and are non-verbal and require 24 hour support, so he left to start a new family and it was just my mom and I taking care of my siblings for most of my life. 4 years ago my dad tried to re-enter my life, but after about a month of us trying to repair our relationship he died of cancer. 

Two years ago my mom met my step-dad, and they got married last summer. He's the first man who's ever loved my mom so fully and has had no issue with the fact that my siblings are a handful, have constant tantrums, scream, cry, need diapers changed, etc. He's accepted it all. But tomorrow, he's being deported from our country because of issues with his immigration paperwork. 

I feel crushed and devastated. It's like losing a father again. Having him around to support my mom has taken a huge weight off my shoulders, I'm in my third year of university and I just got a great but demanding new job. Without him I'll have to become a second parent again, which I don't mind, but I feel so depressed because it seems like life is determined to be difficult for my family and me. It feels like my whole life things have been so unnecessarily difficult, and I really feel for my mom. The past 2 years are the happiest I've ever seen her, and I feel so angry that she's going through something so devastating AGAIN. I know life is unfair, but this is just too much. I've been very suicidal lately because I'm tired of life being so difficult and disappointing. But I know I can't actually end it all because I need to be there to support my mom and siblings. I'd never do that to them.

I'm currently on the waitlist to see a psychiatrist because this is the first time I've felt truly depressed and suicidal. My whole life I've been pretty good at just holding it all in and being optimistic, but now I can never picture myself being happy again. Which is sad. I used to be so happy. 

Are some people destined to be suicidal forever? Why do some of us have such unnecessarily difficult lives, when we've done nothing to deserve it? How can I go on to live a happy life, knowing my mom has been heartbroken so many times? Can anyone relate? I'm tired of being alive. I feel broken and shattered beyond repair.",22Oct2019,5
8,"*disclaimer this thread entails dark stuff

I have been noticing my brain will randomly go dark quickly out of no where.

I started to notice when I was playing Sims and my mind would tell me very unpleasant things like I should kill myself, I’m worthless, I’m going to be homeless. Then it would make me fearful and tell me I’m going to be homeless if I lose my mother, that I’m going to lose my mother and I’m going to die etc. 

I tell myself why am I thinking this? It feels like another person is telling me these awful things in my head. I try to replace it with good thoughts and I looked up online to see if I was crazy, it said Anxiety has a lot to do with morbid thoughts. I do have anxiety, I get anxious easily and I bite my nails constantly. 

I’m pretty messed up, I get side tracked when I’m talking because so many thoughts race through my head but for the most part I was wondering if anyone had some advice on how to get the negative thoughts to stop. I know it’s a stretch asking on a depression forum but it’s like I tell myself things I would never want or do due to the fact of the “what if”. 


I just want to stop being sad and anxious",22Oct2019,1
9,"Hey guys, new to this sub after scoping reddit for a community that seems more centered towards support for those suffering from depression from like minded people. Just to preface this and avoid any unnecessary worry or alarm, I’m stable, have been in contact with close family and friend as well as my therapist, and am currently in a good mental state and absolutely not in danger of harming myself.

That being said, after four years of being clean from self harm and being able to fight urges to cut again, I relapsed a few nights ago while in an episode. I can’t even begin to express the devastation. I’m trying to cope with this, tell myself it was a brief setback and it happens. But four years has been such a long time after continual self harm during my adolescence, and despite my depression becoming more severe and stabilizing in waves, I’ve been so strong and so persistent with fighting those urges for the past four years. But I just broke down that night, and it’s lingered with me so heavily. I feel so guilty for allowing myself to let it come to self harming again, and I’m making sure I take every single step necessary so it doesn’t happen again. Has anyone had an experience similar to this, regarding a lengthy period of time being stable and being able to fight off those urges and eventually relapsing? How did you cope, come to terms, and ease the immense feelings of guilt and shame?

I’m confident in my ability to continue my path towards the best mental state of mind possible, and I’m confident that even with this setback I can truly manage to abstain from self harm again. It’s just so disheartening to know that I regressed in an instant. But as we all know, mental illness can be a bit of a sneaky fucker. So I’m genuinely trying so hard to forgive myself. It’s just been hard, and I’m looking for any advice or similar experiences for a bit of peace of mind.",22Oct2019,1
10,"Im new here. Ive been dealing with depression for several years and have tried a lot of medications. They seem to work at first but then wear off. When i get in a down mood it usually lasts around a week, but this time it has been at least a month. Im not sad, i just have no desire to do anything. I feel so empty and blah all the time. Im trying to do hobbies i used to enjoy and i cant even muster any kind of excitement. I dont know what to do about it. Its so hard to describe to the doctor and i just feel like im always complaining.  Is there anything that has helped you guys who experience this? Ive been on my current med regimen for about 6 mo now. Im so tired of them not working. Or is this just how im always going to feel on any meds?",22Oct2019,3
11,"My existence used to be so heavily oriented around the fact that I connected super well with people. I was known around my entire school as a healer. I had people who were complete and genuine strangers that would come to me for consolation and advice. 

When things got bad, not only did my life change, I changed, too. 

Now I’m not saying that I dislike who I am, because I think I have sailed passed the roughest of the waters in the prior years. In fact, I’m a M(18), I workout 5 days a week, and i have more direction than I’ve had in a long time, and not only that, I consider myself genuinely happy and healthy. 

But it’s almost like because of how much I’ve changed I can no longer obtain the connection with people that I used to have. It seems all I have now are the means of connecting to myself, but I just genuinely feel like I no longer have what it takes to connect with others, or at least anyone I know. I just want to feel understood. 

TL;DR: I’ve grown up and changed and now I feel like I can’t connect with people anymore.",22Oct2019,3
12,"Not sure if this is where I am supposed to be posting, but here goes. 

ANYONE WITH ADVICE ON DEPRESSION IN RELATIONSHIPS PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!! 

Met my partner 10 months ago. Literally love at first sight. We had so much fun for months, I stayed with them all the time and we made endless plans for the future. I knew they had a history of mental illness, being suicidal, etc. At the time it was not an issue but all of a sudden it hit us like a tidal wave. 

It started as them being a tad insecure about themselves and therefore thinking they “weren’t good enough for me”. This insecurity turned into me canceling plans with friends so I didn’t hurt their feelings. I did not want to start any arguments because I was scared they might do something to themselves. They were happy at the moment because  all of my attention was on them. I JUST WANTED PEACE IN THE RELATIONSHIP!!! Little by little, they opened up to me more and started to vent about feelings of depression, being suicidal,and more. After a while, I got so burnt out that I had to vent to my friend. Now, the discussion is ONLY about them. I have to fight to get in anything about me. I am constantly bending over backwards to make sure they are happy, feeling safe, and feeling loved at all times. It is exhausting. They wont get help, see a therapist, talk to anyone. NOTHING. 

The depression has also caused them to start making me feel less than (Probably unknowingly ). They make me feel like I dont know as much as them, dont have as many responsibilities as them, and sometimes put me down for being myself. It hurts but i know it is not them. 

I AM HERE TO GET HELP. Do I have room to be mad that they barely let me see my friends, all my time is put towards them, and they put me down? I am scared to speak up, but am now feeling stuck and helpless. I love them and want to make it work. NEEDING ADVICE!!!! 
Thanks guys 🖤",22Oct2019,1
13,"Some background info real quick, this person was a real close friend of mine. Her and I would talk almost everyday about everything. At first when we met we tried getting together but things didn’t pan out. I still held feelings though. Only recently I found out she had stopped because she said “I was hard to love like that...” my biggest insecurity. Not only that but (not to go r/niceguys on here) she said she was not looking for a relationship because the guys at her school kept objectifying her. Then she proceeded to tel a story how she started talking with this guy who just called her “hot” one day. At that point I lost hope in myself again. I’ve been in and out of therapy for over 5 years for suicidal thoughts and near attempts over similar trust and rejection issues. Since I’ve turned away from my own faith, turned to painkillers, and even cut off some friend groups. I sent her a message not 3 hours ago telling her while our friendship was great I can’t keep hurting myself by being around her and that I don’t hunk we could continue because of how I felt. Truth be told I’m not sure how I currently feel about this. This person regardless of how I felt was such a close friend. I’d love to continue being friends but it’s hard. To conclude, I’m not so much upset she didn’t have mutual feelings, she’s entitled to however she feels and I respect that. What bothers me is her attacking my biggest insecurities as her reasoning for not giving us a chance, opposed to this new guy. I understand this is a very petty issue compared to other people on here who are less fortunate than I am. But I still need your guy’s help.

I’m just looking for some support in this time or any advice you all are willing to give.",22Oct2019,1

Lines, literally just lines. I sometimes would remember this particular episode but would always be able to ignore it. Today, it simply popped into my head and that was that.

15,"I dont know why today was so hard for me. I cant stop crying over nothing and my living just hurts. To be on this planet hurts. That sounds so dramatic but im not even…saying this in a way that means I want to die. Does that make sense? Living today was really hard for me. Knowing that im on this earth right now hurts me to my core for no reason. My existence is suffocating me and I dont know why that upsets me so much. I feel like im being just a really big baby today, crying over everything for absolutely no reason. But im hurt. Im really hurt over something that I cant even pinpoint. Maybe im hurt about the fact that I have to wake up tomorrow morning. I hurt that I have to wake up the morning after that. I think I feel like a really big disappointment right now. To my friends, my family, to myself. I think im feeling it more now than ever. im feeling that im not enough harder than I ever felt it before. I wanted to pick up a razor again and show myself that I dont deserve to be healed but I know thats just the easy way out of this. I need to feel things. I need to really let myself feel things because I need to learn how to move past these feelings without hurting myself. Even now I feel like im dissociating and drifting off. I partially feel as if im not even in the right state of mind right now. I dont know what’s happening to me but it almost sort of scares me that im like this right now because I cant accurately explain how I feel at this current moment, I dont know what im going through but its so scary. Im typing and typing and I feel like im not even the one typing. Or maybe I do feel like the one that’s typing? Its almost as if im floating in space while im watching myself type all of this. I was looking out at the window and crying which is so dramatic… but anyway thats what I was doing and it was so scary in a way. I felt it. I felt the loneliness and I felt the universe weighing down on me. i asked if there was a god, and that if he could watch over me and love me. I guess I cant really start the favor out by questioning his existence but, I dont even know if im real at this point. Maybe im not even real. Maybe none of this is real and we’re all living based on nothing at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Today was so weird. Ive never had a day like today before. It was so weird. I woke up, got ready for school and for some reason I started to feel myself slip into a really bad mood. I was annoyed at everything around me for no reason. I left for the bus and on the bus, I cried for no reason. just…cried for no reason. I couldn’t stop even while I arrived at school. I think I cried for almost an hour. I felt okay for a second but I came home and its late and im sitting here and suddenly im crying again. And everything around me feels so scary. Nothing feels real and I feel like I’ve never been more scared of existing than I am right now. Im fucking terrified. I dont know whats happening. I hope someone will help me.

I don't care much for my family, I don't have any friends, and there is never anything happening in my hometown. So I figure I might as well leave, but I know I'll never get up to do it. 

So maybe there is some other solution that I'm too blinded to see. I feel like I know that nothing else will work out, but it doesn't matter. It's going to be a long, painful life, so I might as well try and get some things right. I don't know how I would get through my depression and anxiety.",22Oct2019,2

She’s my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, it’s becoming a toxic situation because I’ve been feeling pretty down myself, and it’s been taking a toll on my emotion well-being. I honestly don’t mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like it’s too much for me to handle.

It’s a tough situation because I feel like I’m not fit to be her emotional support as I’m going through things myself and I haven’t been feeling great for a while but I don’t think I can tell her that, I know she’s going through a lot.
Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, I don’t know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it’s so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It’s been a few years since this has been happening. She’s always coming to me, and I’m pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness.

22,"My partner has been fighting their depression for a few months now. 
They are currently;
1.talking to a therapist whom is providing medication to treat his depression 
2. Going to the gym regularly since he noticed symptoms. 

My theory although unconfirmed: the start of this was untreated/repressed ptsd symptoms flared up and causing them to relearn how to walk. Then recently a friends sudden suicide.

23,"I don’t even know where to begin, but all I can really say is that it’s like some sick joke has been pulled on me where if I want love, company and belonging, even if very temporary, I must trade in my freedom.

I used to do everything, go everywhere, work, study, talk to people, see music being played, play music, write....

I feel like I never really escaped the domestic violence, and that I’m still stuck inside, unable to work, go for a run, see band play music or even go for a hike, all really innocent things. 

No one comes to see me and I’m expected on a limited income to go see people who really could care less about me, and chase kid around non baby safe house, coming home more exhausted and out of pocket. I’m not really set up for guests, and I’m not gonna waste my time or money. If they wanted to see us that bad, they would have already. 

I feel like I am dead and I’m certainly being injured by the amount of cigarettes I smoke. What else do I do? A hobby? Like what? Kiddo is a fckn handful. 

I never wanted to win - I just wanna go and do stuff like normal people I see outside. 

If it wasn’t for my boy having no safe or sane relatives to go to, I’d have probably killed myself. I stay alive just to make sure we are both ok. 

I feel like because everything has mainly been psychological, social abuse, it’s invisible and they are wounds I can’t stitch up now I don’t have any freedom. 

I love my boy, but I really wish I didn’t get pressured in by people who never intended to support me anyway into not having an abortion. I didn’t really want to because I couldn’t see how I’d survive, and felt shame and didn’t wanna be ousted, but I am shamed, outcasted and can’t wait to die.",22Oct2019,5

I'm ugly, I have average intelligence, I'm not special in any way.
 And I'm realising that more clearly each day. 
I really need to know how to feel at ease with who I am. 
I need to know how to be secure, and happy with myself. 
I really really need help. Can someone please help me? Please. I am on the verge of a breakdown.",22Oct2019,3
27,"Hi! I hope this post finds you well. I would like to know your experiences after psychosis. I am finding it hard to be motivated an get off my couch where I spend most of my day. I am also bored - it’s like the things that used to bring be pleasure don’t do anymore (like music)! Socializing has also been different: I don’t speech as much and I am more quiet and introverted and I don’t know how to enjoy the moment. Lastly, I have a permanent thinking process: “when will be back to myself?” “will I ever recover?” “how long will the stage last?”. Thanks for reading can’t wait to read your experiences!

28,"I wanna kill myself. But I don't wanna die. 
I don't want to feel anything. The constant thoughts thats on my mind is killing me. The anger building up. Uncontainable. Feels like I'm slowly drifting apart from my friends as well. No one to talk to, really.

Everyday, I just live in my own fantasy. A world where I live freely. A world of freedom. Yet a lonely world.

I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. Am I really alive.?",22Oct2019,11
29,"Hi everyone, I’m new to this sub but this is something I’ve been struggling with a lot lately and I feel like I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

So I’ve (F19) recently started dating someone new who also struggles with depression (M22). 
It’s hard because we often get into depressive episodes at the same time, but mine are a lot more drawn out and, from my perspective, are having a greater impact on my daily activities. 
I’m diagnosed with severe depression which I’ve had since childhood. His on the other hand only developed a few years ago- post trauma. 

I know dealing with what he’s got going on is hard for him especially because he like remembers a time when things weren’t like this. But it’s really hard for me to sympathize because this is my reality always and forever. Sometimes he’ll say stuff about his depression not expecting me to relate but I guess he doesn’t realize that those are just things that happen with depression. 

I think this is maybe something I need to work out with him, but I have no idea how to go about that without being incredibly selfish..

That’s basically it, please give advice if you have any",22Oct2019,5
30,"Hi guys. My name is Sara and I have depression. I was formally diagnosed with major depression in 2011. My sister died when I was ten years old to brain cancer but I have been doing better in terms of getting my life together. I am graduating in winter of 2020 and I have a job. I am very happy with my job as an after school teacher. But here’s the thing. I have some minor health issues such as diarrhea randomly, pelvic pain, migraines, and frequent self doubt and anxiety. I’m pretty proud of how many obstacles I have overcome. I’m just having a hard time thinking about bills and having to get my drivers license. It’s a big goal of mine to learn how to drive. I’m just still sad. I’m usually sad everyday at one point. I think of suicide sometimes. But I would miss my loved ones, I would hurt my parents and my boyfriend of two years, plus I’ve made it this far..... I think about not being good enough, or making enough money. Worrying about not being able to make monthly payments for a car. Oh and my school isn’t offering morning classes next semester for me, so I may have to work 4 days a week instead of 5 and take 14 units. I have taken 13 units before. So I hope I can achieve my goals of working and getting a car, and plus keep my job. Children make me feel better when I’m sad. I enjoy helping and sometimes they give you hugs. I’m going to see a school counselor. Thankfully I’m part of the school disability program.",22Oct2019,2

32,"Recently had my SO move out across the country. We had a rough relationship and I was looking forward to him going so I could have a clear head. I had been feeling depressed for some time before he left, it's always hard to tell when it actually starts. A month has gone by and I've re-lived the same horrible cycle of life every week. Working late on the weekend, not being able to sleep intill 4-5 in the morning, not waking up for the gym, then showing up just on time if not late to work to do it all over again. I spend my days off on the couch, tv, sleep, tv, sleep. My cats make me feel even worse, because I know I'm not giving them the time and attention they need. My house is filthy, there is laundry everywhere, and I can't bring myself to do any of it. I've lost my inner voice that tells you that you're being absurd. I have no one to speak to, I have no therapist. I have hardly any money, my bank account dips into the negatives every 2 weeks. 

I just need to know what steps do you take when you can't motivate yourself. Everyone says you have to just get up, but every day I try and fail. Everyone says to go outside, but when I do, I don't even get that little spark of joy. 

How do I fix this",22Oct2019,9

36,"Lately it's been hard. I sleep all day, my apartment is a mess and I almost never go outside. Earlier I got this sudden urge to talk to someone, to call someone and as I scrolled through my phone it hit me. I don't have a single friend. I used to have friends when I was in high school, maybe not real and meaningful friendships but at least people that I could hang out with. Over the years depression has taken every last one of them. I have no friends and it just makes me so angry that this illness has taken so much. How do you cope with this?",22Oct2019,12
37,"Felt angry, like really angry.
Thats something i havent felt in some time now.
To be honest its nice to be angry because at least when im angry i dont feel as sad or tired and drained.
But i know its not good to stay this way.",22Oct2019,1
38,Title. I don’t even know what to say here. I feel so worthless and alone like nothing will get better. My plan right now is to end it right before my birthday. I’ll be 29. My life is so pathetic and going no where anyways. I can never do anything right. I suck at everything. I barely have friends despite my efforts at trying to connect or reach out for help. So i guess everyone else realizes I suck too.,22Oct2019,3
