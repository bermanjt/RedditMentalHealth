0,"As the title says, I’m on an antidepressant (2 actually) and my depression still comes and goes. If you are looking for a super sad story, this is not it and you should probably find a different one. I have a bad case of OCD and it showed it’s ugly head a year ago. After four brutal months of fighting with it, I made a very serious suicidal gesture and got sent to a mental hospital. You’re probably thinking something like, “Gee, a gesture? That’s not serious kid, GTFO. This if for real problems.” I wish it was that simple, but my psychiatrist said I was compulsively suicidal, and if I could compulsively make a serious gesture (I had made no other gestures in the past 4 months) then there was a very good chance I could compulsively kill myself. I’m out of the hospital and it’s been almost a year since then, but I still have serious bouts of depression. They usually leave within a day or two, but they are still present in my life. Usually it’s due to my loneliness and the feeling of a lack of love for me. I’m lonely because I’m in college and all I do is work. I feel a lack of love because I don’t have a girl who says she loves me, I have few personal friends and they are usually busy, and I don’t feel connected to my family. I guess it would be better if I wasn’t a shy kid growing up and my mother wasn’t such a mean person to my father while I was growing up. The hate and aggression my father received when  I was growing up rubbed off on me, and it felt like my mother was screaming at my father and me. It didn’t help that she disciplined me hard and expected results. Doesn’t help that hard disciplining parents are revered for making their kids strong and all the older generation of people say that their childhood was shittier than the current generation so all young people need to STFU. Makes me wonder if I’m broken, just adding to the depression.",15Apr2019,1
1,"I'm 19 years old from the UK with diagnosed clinical depression, anxiety, and an addiction to smoking heroin to which I have relapsed several times since I start-stop-started in early 2018. This opiate problem began as a form of self-medication which grew out of control.  
I've had genomic testing done, showing that due to my SLC6A4 gene anomaly, I have a high risk of severe side effects with all SSRIs, which explains my bad reaction to fluoxetine when I was first trialed on it in 2016. **This means I cannot take any SSRI antidepressants.**  
Since then, I've cycled through trying the following:  
Antidepressants: (Fluoxetine), Venlafaxine, Vortioxetine, Imipramine, Trazodone (caused serotonin syndrome)  
Anxiolytics: Propanolol, Flupentixol, Baclofen, Pregabalin, Diazepam (illicit)  
Other: Quetiapine, Ritalin, Modafinil

&amp;#x200B;

All of these have been continued due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects with the exception of Modafinil which worked but has since been replaced by Elvanse which works better to keep me awake and reduce the extreme fatigue, yawning, and lack of motivation that I had.

  
**My current regime of daily meds is: 150mg Clomipramine, 150mg Bupropion, 70mg Elvanse(Lisdexamfetamine) , Buspirone 10mg, Naltrexone 25mg.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trialling 5mg Buspirone twice daily for anxiety, which has yet had no effect. The naltrexone is to help with the continuing opioid problem, which I am also battling, acting as a barrier to try and stop myself from relapsing. **The clomipramine/bupropion has had some effect on depression yet my general anxiety levels are quite high requiring use of the Clonazepam but this is not sustainable long term or I will develop a dependency - and I really don't need another addiction.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I am keen to hear of any possible medication/ treatment options available in the UK, particularly suggestions to deal with the problematic and continuous anxiety as this is something I cannot continue to address with benzodiazepines.** In addition, my heart rate generally rests around 95-110 during the day which is partly due to anxiety, the clomipramine/bupropion. For someone who had a healthy resting HR between 60-80 this is of worry. There are many ongoing battles here, but from this subreddit I'd really just appreciate some guidance as I'm concerned I'm running out of options particularly on the extreme anxiety front.

Many thanks.",15Apr2019,1
2,"So recently, I've been picking up drums again, and I'm a lot worse than I was before I hit a depressive wall. Also, I have to prepare for hockey tryouts nex spring. I've been having troubles sleeping at night before, which kind of sucks, because I can't play drums past 7:00pm in my town, so if I stick to the sleep schedule I did, I wouldn't get any time to drum because of work. So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working. If it wasn't for my want to be as good as I used to be at drums and get into hockey again, I wouldn't have made the decision to get healthy and also have a healthy sleep schedule.

Long story short, try to find something that can really make you want to be healthy, mentally or physically.",15Apr2019,5
3," I am a bright student preparing for exams to join top universities. The most important exam out of all was attempted last week and I felt that it was easy. But today I checked the scores and it was very much lesser than expected. I have been spending a lot of money for preparation and the result turned out like this. While attempting the practice tests for joining the not so top universities too, I am scoring less marks these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very very very much depressed right now. My friends who used to score lesser than me in all other exams may have more marks this time (that's not my problem, just the background effect). I don't now how to face everyone especially my parents and teachers. I can't have a next try in the exam too nor can I change the plan of joining a university. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Help me cope up with the stress of having performed bad in the exam.** My mind is very much disturbed now. I want to breakdown and cry but I can't even do that as today is a superstitious day in my place where no one should cry. See the coincidence. My heart is aching. Please help!",15Apr2019,5

6,"One week ago my little brother committed suicide. I am not going to tell you how, because I don't want anyone getting ideas and I also don't want to get too personal.

He was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. At least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. What no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years… The news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. Our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. 

Looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter… not a day has gone by since he left us that I haven't cried until I was completely exhausted; that I haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.

We were extremely close and I often let him know how much he means to me and that I will always be there for him, but still… he felt alone. It was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. And now it's too late. He can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. We now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. If you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.

You may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. It's your illness that makes you blind.

So please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. There are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. There is a way out of this suffering. I wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. I know this world sucks, I really do. We have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now I'm furious at the whole world. Please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. You don't have to be 'sexy’, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. All you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. Reach out so someone. There is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.

I wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. I know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me’ - I can assure you, that is a lie. It's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. It wants to win and to do that you have to die. Don't let it win. Please stand up and fight. You don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.",15Apr2019,98

I’m currently attending my first year of college. I’m double majoring in two fine arts degrees (Film directing and Theatrical Lighting). I went out of state because I wanted to be more independent of my parents (long story but basically I’m gay and they’re mormon and separated).

I’m starting to realize I have no real support system at college. Like I have friends but they’re really just surface friends. Whenever I have a problem I’m texting my friends at home. I crew a lot of shows for my major and I have yet to have any of my friends come to a show I’m crewing. The one I’m doing now (literally backstage right now) I’m actually ensemble and I asked a few friends and one came but left at intermission because he found it boring (he’s also a theatre major). Maybe I’m overreacting because I’m just a small role in a complex, 3-hour long 18th century French play but it still hurts. I’ve been trying to go to the shows he crews and support him in his art but it doesn’t feel reciprocated at all.

For my 18th birthday I invited about 15 of my friends a couple of them were super close and only 4 showed up. For my 19th birthday I didn't even invite anyone to come over because I knew they wouldn't, and I only had about five friends just tell me happy birthday. I always go out of my way to tell people happy birthday even if I barley talk to them because I know how much it sucks to barley hear it. My dad told me that I should've gotten some people together for my 19th (he dosent know that nobody wants to come) and I'll more than likely have to tell him that I have no friends this year because I barley have any friends.

13,"i dunno where else to talk about this but i need to get it out. warning: i dont know how to correlate my thoughts so this wont make sense
warning 2: this is long i dont blame u if you dont bother reading it lol i wouldnt 

ok so. i honestly don’t even think i have real clinical depression, i was kind of diagnosed as a kid but never really went through with any counselling or treatment and just ignored it. and by this i mean i had a few sessions and she kind of mentioned it and told my GP i had it but idk

anyway, i know i get depressive episodes from time to time. they’re usually caused by whatever im semi obsessed about. for example most recently, i had a group assignment due yesterday that i had been working on over the weekend. i couldn’t completely understand my part. i have trouble focussing on uni work and remembering details of stuff in general (despite genuinely loving uni) but like a switch i went from feeling ok to wanting to kill myself, all because i couldn’t complete my part of the assignment properly. i still havent recovered from that feeling

two weeks ago i was catching up on another subject and i couldnt understand the lectures or whenever i googled the worksheet questions, i just couldnt retain any information i read. alas, breakdown and few day depressive episode.

two years ago i was in highschool and i was feeling pretty shit about a test i did that i thought i bombed. after it i literally had an anxiety attack and cried i thought it was that bad. anyway fast forward a week and i end up getting an A for it; i was so shocked and i shit you not i was extremely happy for a month. i could start to feel like shit and id say “hey but remember that English grade?” i honestly felt like the depression i had been ‘diagnosed’ with the year or so prior was suddenly cured.  lol

other examples include, i played soccer last year and had a particularly bad game. they were a much better team but i felt i disappointed everyone especially myself. i felt so shit it impacted my uni work. over something as small as that :/

or when i get ‘obsessed’ with a friendship (not even in a creepy or romantic way, i just suddenly like hanging out with them a lot) so i would overthink and get depressed if i thought they started to not like me etc etc you get the idea
oh and also with that, i cant maintain many longterm friendships, especially if they start off this way because i WILL get bored and again the switch will flip and ill start hating them. but thats a whole other issue. (i know im a shit person lol)

so yeah. idk i dont think i particularly have depression but sometimes i do. idk why i have such an intense emotional response to things. and it does work both ways, if im depressed about uni work and the next day i suddenly understand that concept, or realise my assignment wasnt as shit as i thought, im suddenly fine and im motivated to do even better. 

usually i feel pretty apathetic about everything when im not having these weird moodswings

16,"I'm not sure what I'm expecting to get from this post, I think I just need to put some stuff into words and if anyone has had similar situations, maybe they can help.

In mid 2016 I had a severe depression/anxiety flareup. It had been building for a long time and finally broke me. I went on Lexapro and it didn't help at all so after a while, the doctor increased the dosage, which just made things worse.

Eventually, in early 2017, I was moved to 100mg Sertraline and that started to work. By July/August, I was having some issues with side effects, so the dosage was dropped to 50mg which helped with the side effects. By early 2018, I wanted to try going med free and got to August before realising that I needed to go back on them and have been on 50mg ever since. This was going great until the last few weeks/months. Firstly, things were better than ever for a while, followed by a period of mood swings. I would be on top of the world one minute and then a bad thought would come into my head or something and I would be down again.

Now in the last week or so I have just felt really low. I have had worse depression in the past and this is more like a complete lack of interest in doing anything at all, even little things that would have brought me pleasure before.

I'm not going to make any immediate decisions as I know that these things can ebb and flow, but I was wondering if anyone else has found themselves in the same situation? Did a change of meds or dosage help at all?",15Apr2019,1
17,"Hello I'm new to reddit and I wanted to talk about my mental health and how it affects me, Im 17 right now but I'll start my story from when I was 12 ,ever since I was young my parents would fight alot and start breaking things and wouldn't care who would their problems aloud. One day after they were arguing my mom came to my room to check up on my dad to make sure what he was doing, who was in the garage at the time.i went to check up on him and when I opened the door to the garage I was him about to hang himself, he had some kind of band around his neck and he would have attached it to a metal chain we had hanging from the ceiling. I was 12 at the time but I still knew what he was doing. When he saw me all he could tell me was what are you doing in here. As I could only tell him with tears in my eyes what are you doing? Ever since then I always dream about it time to time, it shocked me deep inside as to why he would do this. Ever since then my parents havent fought alot but when they do I still get worried he would do the same thing again. It also didnt help that my 2 sisters dont like to talk with me about anything, they dont like to be around me that much and when they do they only want me to buy them something, 

Ever since I was in elementary I would get bullied about my looks, how I didnt have any friends and I would just be a loner most of the time. I'm still kinda like this in high school but the only people I talk to are very few. I talk to girls but their all a waste of time to me know , I dont think I can love anyone anymore. When I was a freshman I had my first girlfriend, atleast I think she was , except she was a big hoe and I had big feelings for her. After a month of talking with her she told me she didnt love me and that we should only be friends. It struck me pretty hard and to later find out she got another boyfriend the day after she left me. I felt as though I wasn't good enough for anyone, I still talked to other girls but I didnt feel any connections with them, even though they liked me alot and wanted a relationship with me. I didnt feel anything towards them. Until I met this girl last summer one month before school was about to end. I would see her alot in the hallways and one day I talked to her and asked for her number. I did get it and we talked all through the summer. I thought she was an amazing girl and I had a connection with her and she had one with me. The only problem was she missed her ex boyfriend who was way past her age, but she loved him. One day her and I were at her house and we were watching TV. He started to get closer and we started to kiss and take out clothes off, we had unprotected sex on her couch which I still regret to this day, following that day I started to develop what looked like pimples on my foreskin and and stared to burn and tingle, I asked her if she ever had sex and she told her she has herpes. She never told me this before and I was completely shocked. I still dont know what I have to this day because I know never bothered taking me to the clinic or parenthood or wherever your suppose to go to talk about STDs. Following the week of having sex with here it was tingling and burning and after that week it stopped, it never came back expect every few weeks. There would be those little pimple look alikes but they would only last a day. And I would sometimes it would feel like something m is throbbing inside my penis. But most of the time its feel fine. Since last December I lost contact with her as she was to busy with college and I'm guessing she went went back to her abusive boyfriend. I'm still very worried I have herpes or some kind of STD, I feel as though I can never have a kid, and if I do my partner will get herpes and my son or daughter will have it aswell. It still haunts me to think about it as she was the first person I had sex with and I ruined it for myself. 


I'm still depressed and lonely, sometimes I think about ending my life or killing those I hate, who bully me and turned me into who I am, but I'm not like that. I dont want to end someones life. I dont know who to talk to about this. I dont want to tell my parents about my depression as they'll just brush it off as symptoms of my ADHD. Since about a few weeks ago, I've been going onto bestgore alot at night and watch all this violence and gore happen in other parts of the world. my family is religious and I want to believe in it but I have a hard to of believeing, if God was real, why would he let us go through pain and agony? I been thinking alot at night before I sleep I'm afraid to die and decompose 6 feet below the ground, I really hope their is an after life I try to be though and think I'll be fine but that's what I worry about

20,"Hi, my name is Danielk, I will give you a quick summary of what's been going on.

A couple of years ago I was married and with a child, long story short, my wife was cheating with one of my best friends at the time, I found out that my daughter was his, and I went through depression as best as I possibly could, never had therapy of any sort though.

Back then I thought of killing myself, but never got the courage to do so.

Fast forward to january this year, I broke up with my girlfriend after three years of relationship, it wasn't anything messy, it was mostly that both of us are busy ( we are both working and in college) and decided it was best for us to split at the moment, we broke up in good terms.

Yet for the past few weeks I've been feeling really down, I don't eat much, I can barely sleep, and the thought of just dying has been in my mind constantly. 

I'm having a hard time understanding myself, this isn't even close to what happened before, but somehow, I feel the same or even worse. I don't want to kill myself, just die, like getting mugged or ran over by a bus or something. I've been engaging in dangerous practices, I walk out at night on shitty neighborhoods looking for something to happen, I just don't think I have energy to do anything anymore.

any advice? I feel this might be some strange case of ptsd, I dunno, I'm open to suggestions, and I am already looking for a therapist.

21,"A little backstory: I’ve been diagnosed with depression and had been prescribed lexapro. I took 10 mg for about a month and with no results, upped it to 20 mg and my body just crashed. Side effects became too much and it’s been about a month and a half since I’ve been off any meds. Since then I’ve been prescribed Zoloft, but my dad hasn’t let me started it, worried that I’ll have a repeat of side effects.

With lexapro, it helped my depression enough so that i didn’t cry everyday, but my anxiety was worse than ever during withdrawal and at times I felt completely numb emotionally. 
After being off of it for a while, I’m back to my usual crying, usual episodes, struggling to get out of bed and now going days without sleep and struggling to nap.

MY MAIN POINT Ig is just whether I should try and start new meds or if there’re any other solutions to help with falling asleep. Ditching any screens before bed time isn’t much of an option since it helps me distract myself and prevents my mind from going too far. Ty in advance",15Apr2019,1

But I don't actually have that many people who truely care about me and I've had so many people who claim they do then they hurt me. It's like the world around me is giving my depression fuel.

25,"I have always had a rocky relationship with food.

I have always thought I should be allowed to have more control over what I put into my body.

I want to live a life where I have time to make meals I enjoy from scratch but I never seem to have the time money or lack of other people in my business about my food choices.

I eat a pescatarian diet but rarely cook seafood at home. 

Lately I have sort of stopped eating entirely.  So now I am in a really unhealthy cycle of eating.  Because I am always starving I ignore basic nutritional facts and just grab whatever is available.

Also I am currently experiencing some hot cold sensitivity to food and I do not have the money it takes to go to the dentist.  I can barely afford my bills and any type of food at all.

I am tired of this toxic food cycle.

Did anyone else conquer their food demons and reclaim some sort of food routine that got them back on the path of enjoying meals and being proactive about food choices?

I feel so lost and I do not want to lose all the positive work I have done on myself in the past year.  

I know that I cannot accomplish what I need to accomplish on a daily basis if I do not have the fuel that is required to function.

I am tired of waking up hungry and going to bed hungry because I do not have the desire to eat anything.

I think my plan feel apart when I realized I really like smoothies and I needed a new blender.

I wanted to get one that would do the trick but it was more expensive than I could afford.

Months later I realize I could have bought that blender a few times over.

I have so many toxic things in my life right now and I am fighting with all my might to stay proactive and follow joy so I can get closer to a more less toxic life each and everyday.

This food problem is immense and a life long struggle for me.  I want to face this demon once and for all.

26,"I've put a lot of my self worth and value into the hands of a person who is no longer in my life, I feel like it was partly my fault for projecting my insecurities onto them, pushing them away with some of my behaviour (Sending a lot of messages or being too pushy when they didn't get back to me, not letting go when they wanted to leave.) but at the same time felt they lacked consistency, didn't really make time for me or care about me all that much. I want to move on but I still think about this person and put hope in something that perhaps never was really reciprocated. They have somebody they love, at least I think they still do, I'm still searching, I'm not even as much as a friend to them, I'm just a stranger and a body and feeling like I have to accept that makes me feel almost worthless and even angry at times.

I was also recently casually dating a guy who invested quite a bit in me but was talking to another girl while with me, I wasn't happy with him texting too much while in my company or out with me but I wanted to be open minded towards it so I agreed to a situation between this girl, him and a friend he pretty much hooked me up with, with the promise of a bit of extra cash on the side - we were at a spa resort and two rooms were booked, one for him and the girl and one with me and his friend, I didn't like the situation but felt pressured and didn't know how to communicate at the time to get out of it - I felt passed down and like I was a commodity to him so cut things off.

This sort of thing seems to keep happening and I feel unsure of whether more people will see my value and things will change even if I act differently. I just want to get past feeling like I'm not worthy due to connections and encounters where the feelings weren't reciprocated or mutual.",15Apr2019,1
27,"These past few weeks I have been spiraling out of control and feel as though I can’t control my thoughts or emotions anymore. I’ve been arguing with my mother and been unable to articulate any meaningful thing and she has basically been making my choices for the past month but she says this one is up to me.

I’ve been sitting in my car for hours crying and debating if I should call an ambulance and spend the night in the hospital. I’m just very scared of what that process will look like and I have an exam in the morning.

My main reasons for going would be I think I’m going to commit suicide. I’ve already started to self harm again, by hitting myself in the head and face with whatever I can find (glass bottles, remotes, my fist) and I’ve been using cocaine again (around 0.1mg/day) to fog my brain out but even that doesn’t work anymore and I think I’m either going to drive away and do something stupid or I’m going to try and overdose on cocaine or hit my head until my skull breaks.

I am just exhausted and terrified right now and am emotionally and physically out of the energy to continue on.

Has anyone gone to the hospital for depression? What is the process and should I go now or should I wait until my therapy appointment next week to see if I feel better? I’m just so close to the end of rope and need a reason or help to not completely let go of it.",15Apr2019,1
28,"I just don't know what I am.

I don't know how to put into words how much desperate I am to be a better version of my self and yet I can find the willingness to actually do something to make me better. Am I making any sense??

I joined reddit in the hope of finding someone who can relate and maybe share how they cope.

I feel hopeless, worthless and just not good enough to be with anybody. I feel like I am more of a burden than a reliable partner.

I want to keep trying but whenever I am alone, I find myself brushing off everything that has been bothering me and just sit, day dream and eat and pretend that all of this will get better without me trying to actually do anything to make my self better.

Just reading all of this makes me feel so dumb and disgusted. I can't believe this is what I have become.

I feel like living is a mistake. Everything I do, i think about is a mistake.

I am a mistake.",15Apr2019,10
29,"I feel like my husband and daughter would be better off without me. I barely do anything around the house. I feel I can easily be replaced by daycare and a maid, who would do a better job than I'm doing.

When I talk to my husband about my depression, he gets stressed and usually blames it on my being on the phone (or other screens) too much. Which I definitely, definitely am. Hours too much.

If I tell a professional, I don't want to be put away in a hospital for a week or something like that. My husband would need to stay home from work to watch our daughter.

I'm not good enough, I know that. How can I change it. (I know I'm addicted to my phone pretty much. And advice on that would be appreciated as well, as long as it's not ""just don't use it"".)",15Apr2019,1
30,"I’ve been unemployed for 6 months now after breaking up with my gf of 4 years, moving back to my hometown and struggling to find work. I had my first day of a completely new sales job and role today. It went okay, I have lots of sales training this week and everyone seems nice. They have doggos in the office and lots of cake. 

But as I was walking home, I thought about crying, totally randomly, and I just wanted to let myself do it. I didn’t. But I wanted to, I really wanted to and I have no idea why. I walked home and thought about crying in the shower, I did shower but I didn’t cry. Things are finally changing for the better but I don’t feel good. I feel trapped and I don’t feel like I’m equipped well enough. 

And since I’ve been back home tonight I’ve just felt, strange. I don’t know what I want and I don’t know what I can do right. I don’t know, I really really don’t know what I’m feeling right now. Because I just feel lost. And I don’t feel equipped. And I don’t know how it stops or how I just be like everyone else. Everyone else can cope.",15Apr2019,5
31,"I started Wellbutrin XL 300mg Jan 2019. I have serious SAD and this medication helped so much. I'm usually a high energy person and love mornings. This med gave me back my energy. Things were going well and I took care of myself. 

But it suddenly stopped working? I'm talking mid March, I felt a sudden fatigue and it hasn't gone away since. A month and a half has gone by and I'm barely holding on to my health. 

Wellbutrin makes me nauseous (no biggie) but the sleep. I've had broken sleep for 4 months now and I rarely feel rested. I tried taking an over the counter sleeping aid. It helps a little but I feel groggy in the morning. 

I honestly don't know what to do? I have an appointment date set but it's in a month. I think it's the sleep that has me tired but I was told the side effects should stop after a few weeks. I really don't want to give up on this med since it's the best I've had!",15Apr2019,1

33,"Hello people, 
I desperately need help, idk where to find one. So here is the background story of myself . 
I am an immigrant who moved to states at age of 21 to live with my family who came here much earlier . After moving here I realized my credits from my home country didn't transferred to states so I have to start college all over again. I even have to take basic classes which I know for sure I am good at, but not knowing my way around having no other option I took few classes and completed my classes with good GPA from a community college  and transferred to one of the best state school . So during my last semester in community college I started to experience that it's been hard for me to wake up and go to classes nevertheless I did attend the class and finished them . Once I started my classes at the university I got lost and GPA is so bad they suspended me so I went back to community college hoping that my grades will get better but they didn't.  Now that I am in senior year I dont want to screw up my life I am 24 yrs old i can go back to the university for one last semester and if i maintain my GPA i will be able to graduate.  I am so thankful for my parents that they pay my tuition fee and provide me with all the needs but me not graduating from college even with all the resources will break their heart . 
  What's happening with me: so I wake up hoping to go to classes I drive 10 miles and park my car in the school parking lot and start to feel anxious and scared just to go to class and I divert my self by watching Netflix comedy shows and eat all the junk food so that i wont be able to face the anxious pain. I know i can do better . I did better as a kid , teen and until 2 yrs ago i did good with my GPA . But now everything changed I dont feel like studying, dont feel like doing gardening, dont feel like painting, dont feel like buy something nice for me, dont feel like working out,  all o fo is sit watch TV shows, drive to the school and get anxious and start watching TV shows and eat junk.  I have to pull myself so hard to just do the home work which is so easy . Previous me would've done all the homework within few hours and would've enjoyed my time with other activities . 
    So I decided to tell it to someone hoping to find solution , so I told my mom.  My mom said that as a person even as a kid I needed the push to even to go out and play with others do any other things . I mean I understand what she saying because back then she used to push me for things which I didnt think I liked them. But I can sense that things changed within me I know for a fact that I used to do things that I think that important for me and the things that I like to do . I always used to sit in the front row listen to lecture and do homework and be a decent student 80% of the time 20% being lazy and having other fun . 
Waking up in the morning is being difficult,  doing homework assignments is difficult  my dr said that my cholesterol levels are high and he insisted me working out more often to reduce my weight and cholesterol levels  none of these things are bothering me . I am feeling anxious for the things that are easy to do and I am getting upset about it.  I need help idk where or whom to ask for . Please help me",15Apr2019,3

36,"Hi, I've posted on this page before, so I'll keep this brief. It has come to my attention that I am trying to focus too much on one factor in my life for happiness, love. The problem is that I am in college and every single girl around me isn't available or has someone. It also doesn't help that I'm not on the dating scene. Regardless, I find it hard to be happy many days. Doesn't help that I didn't have the greatest of childhoods and I am a whirlwind of emotions. Does anyone have suggestions for being happy, please no cheesy stuff.",15Apr2019,1
