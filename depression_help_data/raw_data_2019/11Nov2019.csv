0,"I’m noticing that most of the posts on this forum are from teenagers. I am not here to invalidate you, I want you to know that what you are feeling is very real and teenage years suck hard. Whoever says high school are the best years of your life is just wrong. So I can start off by saying, you are obviously not alone. That kid sitting next to you probably also has suicidal thoughts. Most teenagers are fucking bananas and losing it inside and just trying to keep it together. I tried to commit suicide at 18 and wanted to die before I was 30. I’m now 32 and feel like my life hasn’t even reached its peak yet. 

I don’t know why teenage years are so hard, but I think it’s because you are suddenly gaining a lucidity that you didn’t have as a child and feeling intense emotions you’ve never felt. You have very little experiences or points of reference to help you navigate through the world, so it’s completely overwhelming. You are still in a microcosm of your school where you are trying to learn how you fit in. If you were or are being bullied then that makes you even more anxious about how you’re going to navigate this world, because you probably feel like you better say the right thing, wear the right thing etc OR ELSE.

But the truth is once you graduate and get let loose in the world you will discover how truly free you really are. You will gain perspective and experiences that will thrill you and validate you. There are thousands of people out there like you, probably just as weird and awkward and depressed, etc. We are all a lot more alike than we think and if you talk to others and share your insecurities and listen to them, really listen, you will find your reflection in them. More important than that though is - fuck what people think! So much of my happiness is robbed by worrying about what other people think. You know what people really hate? A poser. A fake. So just be your wierd-ass self and be honest and open about it. Life is supposed to be fun, your happiness is important, and there is so much joy out there for you to discover and people for you to meet. 

You are at a great advantage when you’re young because you can still be whoever you want to be and move freely about this world. You probably don’t have kids or a family yet so you don’t have those sorts of obligations and you have a lot more free time than adults. I hate that I wasted so much of my free time as a teenager doing jack shit when I could have been feeding my soul being creative or writing - things that make me happy. There’s no rules, the world is your oyster and you can do literally fucking anything you want. Life doesn’t get easier as you get older but you will meet your tribe, you will attract people like you and you will find more purpose and perspective. Act with love in whatever you do and love will return to you, I promise. “People will forget what you said your did but they will never forget how you made them feel” - maya angelou

As a former depressed and suicidal teenager, I’m here to tell you that yes I am still batshit crazy lol but i am loved, and I am not alone. The more love I give and leading by example I do the more rewards I reap.   And I will never run out of things to learn and people to meet and beautiful things to see. So don’t give up just yet, you have a lot of time to figure it out. So in the meantime find ways to have fun and feel good and take it one day at a time. I wish I could hug all of you and tell you it’s going to be ok, because it is. Everything is working out for you if you just let it. 

TL;DR - We are all depressed little balls of crazy as teenagers and you’re not alone. Do what makes you happy and don’t give up, because there is a big world out there full of joy and full of people who want to know you and love you.",11Nov2019,1
1,Its been over a year and I still miss him. Am I insane? How do I get over this? I feel so confused and frustrated. I doubt he feels the same about me. I just keep holding onto non existant hope. We haven't spoke since the morning we broke up.,11Nov2019,1

4,I've struggled a lot with my mental health for as far back as I can remember. I have my ups and downs but the loss are always longer and harder hitting than the highs. I've just gotten so tired in these last few years of struggling and dragging myself through everyday hoping that the next will be better but it never seems to at least not for long. Someone that I regard as my closest friend told me a couple of days ago that he needs breaks from me because of my mental state and that I should take hints better. That felt like a slap to the face especially because I hate feeling like I'm a burden to those around me. It just feels like everyone's lives would be easier without me. I want to get better but I'm just so tired.,11Nov2019,1
5,"I’ve been through a lot and it’s insanely diffcult to open up about them, so it seems to family I act the way I do just because I chose to. 

I’m constantly being made fun of for not doing certain things and I get really offended and uncomfortable. I prefer not to share what, but I usually tell them to quit it, yet they’re always like “it’s a joke” or “you’re so over dramatic/buzz kill”. Now I don’t ever say anything because now I have the reputation of being the “negative Nancy” of every social event. 

I even have a certain family member who pry into my business cause they want to know my secrets. Why isn’t boundaries a thing anymore? Sometimes I think to myself I should just blurt out what I’ve been through just to have a greater chance of letting them leave me alone, but it’s scary and personal. I can’t even write them in a journal, to my past therapist (who I saw for six months), or friends I trust. I hate myself everyday for always keeping things in. I’m a coward. 

I feel trapped in my mind. Always telling myself to forget, but think about it everyday anyways. What do I do to change? How can I escape this constant degradation from people? 

Thanks for reading.",11Nov2019,1
6,"Surely, you may think that I am just faking this and that obviously I have friends, but I don’t talk to them. I actually kinda do, but I never have a chance to talk to them because I’m always focused on something else. I’m immature as hell too, and that’s one of the reasons. Another is that I was raised where I behaved right and that to be respectful to people. When I go to schools, everyone else except certain (but barely any people) act like crackheads. I feel like I’m stuck in this void of nothing. I signed up to talk to my guidance counselor at school but I have not been called down to her office yet. I mainly just need advice, but also support on how I can not be lonely anymore or how I can get people to talk to me. What do I have to do next, bash my damn head against a wall and bleed out until I die? Online friends are long distance and sometimes I don’t even know them either. Help, please.",11Nov2019,1

19m here,
So I started taking Prozac 10mg 5 months ago. I developed depression around a year and a half ago. when I started taking Prozac I was dealing with really bad depression and bad suicidal thoughts and ideation. I had been hospitalized twice before I started taking it. After 5 weeks I started feeling a bit better consistently, but it only lasted around 2 months. I eventually started developing bad anxiety and had an anxiety attack driving to work and had to go the hospital and quit. I’ve now had 2 more since and I’ve been prescribed Ativan. Sometimes I feel less depressed and then there’s spans of times(usually a few days) where it hits 10x harder, and in that time I’ll blow my money or take a stupid drug or just something really dumb that I regret later. The suicidal thoughts haven’t gotten better even when I’m not feeling depressed and my psychologist doesn’t understand. I kept missing my appointment with my psychiatrist and now he won’t see me. 

In the last month the loneliness has been crippling as me and my gf just broke up and I really have no friends. I don’t feel like I can even connect with people anymore, I’m just really dead around people. I constantly hate myself, and my doctor refuses to up my Prozac until “we fix the anxiety” and she put me on Zopiclone 3.75 for sleeping. I have no motivation to do anything like ever, and even when I do I can’t bring myself to do anything. I feel my life crumbling apart and no one is helping me just giving me more drugs. I need advice or tips from anyone. I know I’m going to end up killing myself if this gets worse.

Ask questions If you want more details about my life I guess or anything",11Nov2019,1

9,"My depression is alone in the darkness. I’m under two blankets because I’m cold and the weight and softness is comforting. My depression is touch-starvation. I crave skin contact, but I’ll never receive it. I use soft and warm things to try to simulate a hug. But it’s not enough. My depression claims I will never be enough. In any aspect. Alone. Forever. My depression is anger and irritability. My depression is spending too much money and eating too much bad food trying to feel good if only for a second. My depression is the chaos produced when mixed with my anxiety. My depression is worry and restlessness, emptiness and sloth. My depression is a dementor, slowly sucking the life out of me. No one can see it, but it’s there, slowly killing me. My depression is wishing for death but being unable to consider finding it for myself. My depression is caring so much for everyone else and their feelings that I have nothing left for myself. 

If there are any powers out there listening, please, let this stop. I’m tired. It hurts so much, and simultaneously I can’t feel anything at all. I just want this torture to end. Please, just let me be. I just want to not hurt anymore, not live my life longing for things I can’t have. 

I guess I’m just desperately looking for some way to hope for a future that’s better, or the courage to end it all despite the suffering I’d leave behind. Please tell me it gets better someday. I’m desperate.",11Nov2019,1
10,"I saw a picture of the boy that I love on Instagram by accident today. It was of him and another girl, and she was kissing his cheek. Looks like he moved on. 

Now, I love this boy, and all I want is for him to be happy. In fact, the two of them were smiling and I really hope those smiles were genuine and that they are happy together. I want the best for him and that girl. But that still doesn’t make it hurt any less. 

We had such strong feelings for each other, but as soon as a problem came up, he pushed me away. It took a lot of strength for me to end something so beautiful. 

We were supposed to be friends. After I stood up to him and ended things, he apologized and told me that I deserved better. He gave me a whole speech about how I don’t deserve to be treated the way he treated me, and I’m grateful that he tried to empower me like that, but it doesn’t change what he did. We tried the friend thing for a few weeks and then he pushed me out altogether. I feel like using the term “ghosting” really cheapens the feelings I had for him, but I guess you could say that’s kinda what happens. 

And it only ended a few months ago. It was the first time I’ve ever held anyone’s hand without the reason for it being that I was too afraid to say no. I was molested when I was a child, and I didn’t think I’d ever be able to let anyone in, and then I found him. And then he fucked it up and broke my heart before I could even fully show him my world. And now he’s with another girl. 

I never kissed him. I’ve never kissed anybody. I love him  and I don’t think I’ll ever see him again. And he’ll never know how much I’ve changed for the better after knowing him. I’ll always be different now, but it feels like I might have never mattered to him. But then I feel like I’m crazy because when I go back in my memories, I clearly did. Just maybe not as much anymore? I don’t know. 

I could really use some kind words.",11Nov2019,1

16,"Happiness
Remember what happiness brings to your life, how it feels, the way it warms your chest and keeps you smiling, that is what you live for. Happiness is available to everyone, but happiness isn’t the easiest feeling to achieve. What we all want is to be happy, but sometimes you have to work for it. You could be a student trying to make it to graduation or just someone filling out job applications until one finally sticks, but it’s always important to keep your goal in mind, it’s human nature to think about the future and what it might hold. Sadness and happiness are two sides to the same coin, sometimes we have to be sad for a while before we can really be happy. There’s an emptiness we all feel when we haven’t been happy in a while, happiness is important, if your sad for too long then you may forget the warmth happiness brings. Happiness can be the single most important aspect in any persons life, what good is life without happiness. Above all else never give up the search, never forget what your looking for, never let anyone bring you so far down you feel like you can’t get back up, and never forget to stop and give time for yourself along the way. Never stop searching, because one day you are going to find your happiness.",11Nov2019,1

19,"**O**n the 7th of October 2018, my grandmother died, while I was away, in Berlin on holiday. My family lay around the bed while I sat away enjoying myself on the flight home. Then when we got back, we had the rosary service on my birthday a few days later, with me losing it and crying right in front of her, feeling hopeless. Then came the real nightmares in the form of the next year of my life leading up to this tragedy.

I attended a school-based exchange to Italy, during which many debaucherous things occurred, mostly stemming from one of the students from our country who I'll call H. He is meticulously horrible in every way, a veritable misogynist, and an evil person at heart, who had intercourse with one of our students and had many drinks while the teachers slept in their own rooms, and I met with his partner that had completed this activity with him, she shall be called F. She told me about the whole story.

Come January, school break had occurred, and I still had all of my friends around me, until they all banded together and had a party, completely without my attendance, but still being stupid enough to broadcast certain events on a social media platform. As of the 21st of October, I still haven't heard an apology for it.

Come March, and the school holds a prom, and I end up singing at it. I thought it was amazing, I received many compliments until Easter time when I told my cousins aged 30 and 35 about it, who relentlessly made fun of me until I sliced at my wrists with a soda can. That was the last time they made fun of me.

During May, my parents had been arguing relentlessly about my mother's work and my father's lack of completing house chores, so from all the background noise, I took 20,000mg of paracetamol medication in the span of 20 minutes. It did not have an effect on me, but I did tell my father, who only said 'ok' in response

Let us fast forward ahead to June, where an anti-bullying survey allowed me to explain how certain other students had made me feel, and the school got involved as I told them about what occurred on the exchange trip in December. Then the death threats came upon my life, from H and his friend who was also involved. I am still uncertain of how they knew when the school told me they told no-one and the survey was entirely anonymous.

To take my mind of these occurrences, I decided to write a philosophical thesis based on questions from my cohort, which was relatively well-received, until I decided to write another about individually talking about the other students in my cohort, which excited many. People who had never talked to me before had been badgering me about what their passage contained. That's when I knew that they didn't deserve to hear the truth about themselves

I instead decided this was going to be my final writing which I sent off as I proceeded to jump off of the school building, but then H.'s friend stopped me, again cornering me to understand if I ratted him out about the trip. I confessed and shouted at him, and that night, another student sent me a death threat because I had hyped up the thesis and didn't deliver all the dirt on everyone as I promised.

After telling the teachers about all of these occurrences, they took in all the evidence and tried to assist me, took me to the counsellor. But I have still not heard any word about punishment being placed upon all of these people who have wronged me, like H., his friend, or the new death threat guy. These are just the most important parts though.

I have failed to mention other events such as my homegroup teacher calling me fat, me cutting myself in front of the counsellor and him not knowing/caring. The class captain telling me to ""grow some skin"" after revealing some of these facts to her. After all of these occurrences, I am beginning to feel like I deserve these events to happen to me, as no-one has been punished for them, to my knowledge, no police forces have been contacted. And the second death threat guy only got lunch-time detention.

I believe this to be my last Reddit post for eternity. Cause I don't feel like I can go on much longer feeling like this, despite psychologist and psychiatrist visits. And many may say that you're just doing this for attention, but having depression is like having that dark black hole in your body and swallows everything and the life you lived before becomes faint wishes of happiness. Best of luck trying to help me, cause God knows I've tried my best",11Nov2019,1

22,"I don't know how to phrase my question without getting into too much details..... 
I just have been living myself without joy and motivation most of the time, and there are times I feel too empty. Just doing things has been hard. 
I was thinking of taking anti depressants and my therapist supported that idea.. But I am a bit afraid of it due to someone taking a kind that lead to a very negative behavior from her.. but I'm currently self aware enough to realize that I might not be able to go on like this and that is an option. 

Do you think I should start taking them despite the fear I have?Are there any types I could do research on? I kind of do but I don't at the same time.. Sorry if it sounds very vague.",11Nov2019,1
23,"this is difficult for me.  I can't help but feel like I shouldn't complain. Honestly my life is so good.  I'm relatively stable as far as money goes.  I have a husband who truly loves me and is patient with me. I'm not in a 'bad situation'. My life is.. well, okay. Just fine. Typical. But there are things I can't stop thinking about. Two things really, maybe three. First ( as far as chronologically at least), my father threatened to kill himself. He found out my mother was cheating on him and threatened to kill himself to get her to tell the 'whole truth' as far as what had happened and why.  He said that he wouldn't have done it, but based on what I know of him, I don't believe it. At the time, I was in a relatively stressful military training. My mother called me saying my father was in the local psych ward because of the suicide threat. I knew of the situation at the time, and I wanted to go home. I did what I was trained to do and called the military chaplain on duty. He suggested that maybe it would not be a good idea to go home, as my dad 'may not want his daughter to see him that way'. I fully understand that idea, and I don't feel the chaplain was \_trying\_ to 'accomplish' anything, but at the same time I can't help but feel that he was 'just trying to get me through' what I was going through at the time, for the sake of my stressful and somewhat important military training. My father is doing better for the most part, but I can't stop feeling the guilt. I didn't go home. I didn't immediately take leave and see my father in the hospital for myself and show him that I was there for him no matter what. I told him this once, and he said that he forgave me, it was a non-issue, but I really can't let it go. I feel that he would have dropped everything to see me in that situation, and yet I hesitated. I was almost afraid to go. My second ... problem.. is that my grandmother passed away. My Mammaw. I wish I could convey to you how amazing she was. She spent so much of her life trying to provide for her children and her children's families that she never really lived for herself (after having her kids). God I wish I could really take the time to tell you how amazing she was. My mammaw was a live-in nurse for most if not all of my life. I remember thinking as a young child that she was an old person taking care of older people. For a decent chunk of her life she made very decent money. She spent most of that on her sons, who for whatever reason (its really just typical conjecture/psychology ideas that aren't necessarily wrong) were only able to live at the bare minimum standard on their own. In other words, they could survive, yes, and even care for their families in the most basic sense, but she would always give them money to make sure that they have enough, and that they needed as little as possible. She worked. She worked nearly her whole life. During my childhood, I would tell her that I wanted to get a job and make lots of money so she could come live with me and not have to work anymore. Once I was an adult, I joined the military, and to be honest, I didn't think much of anyone else for the first couple of years. I realized at some point that my mammaw was essentially living in squalor. She was living with her eldest son in his trailer. While he was 'doing his best', his 'best' just really wasn't much. I didn't fault him for it, but at the time, my mammaw was living in his living room, whilst his three children and three stepchildren and his wife where living with him in a trailer. As much as he may have wanted to do more, he just didn't, or was unable to. I got stationed roughly eight or so hours away in a 'retirement' type of area. I wasn't making a ton of money, but I decided (and convcinved mammaw) to move in with me. She lived with me for roughly a year and a half. During that time, I got married, I worked with her debt collectors (she had a crappy situation and a genuine lack of knowledge regarding taxes and medical bills). I was able to get her into her own 'home', which was essentially 'section 8' housing, or income based housing for poor people for those who don't know. I was able to get her credit score up a decent bit by negotiating with her debtors. She wanted to be independent. I did everything I could to make sure she was. She was 72 years old, living in her own apartment with her little dog (pug) and cat. She was only a few minutes away from me, maybe 10 or 15 minutes drive. At some point, her health took a turn for the worse. She had smoked most of her life, perhaps 40 years or more. I had convinced her to start vaping. To drink water instead of diet soda. To take walks more often. There was a situation where she was hospitalized for breathing/heart trouble. Luckily she had a friend staying with her at the time, and he was able to take her to the emergency room to get checked out. She was so incredibly stubborn. She wouldn't have called me. She stayed in the hospital a few days due to a heart arrhythmia essentially. They were able to stabilize it at some point and sent her home on oxygen. I took her to my home and kept her there so we would be close. At this point she was on oxygen constantly, which isn't terribly abnormal. I remember I took her to the beach one weekend. We took it slow, as slow as was necessary. I really didn't want to strain her, but damn she loved the beach. She loved to sit out in the sun. She had loved it for as long as I could remember, and being in the sunniest part of the country, neither of us could resist taking advantage of the weather. It was tiring for her, but she made it. She seemed to genuinely enjoy it. A few days later, she had to go back to the hospital via ambulance. My husband and I had been out shopping, and when we got home she mentioned that she was terribly cold, and no matter what we did we couldn't stop her from shivering. We called 911 and followed the ambulance to the hospital. she was there for maybe three or four weeks. She was cognizant the entire time, though sometimes she seemed 'loopy'. I visited her every day. The hospital told us that she needed to be moved from the hospital into a kind of 'halfway house' for the unwell. Essentially it was a live-in therapy facility. She was moved there and my daily visits continued. I think she was there maybe four or five weeks. I remember thinking how frustrating it must be, bedridden, stuck in a room 24/7 with almost nothing to do. I did my best to visit her every day. I missed maybe four days. For the most part, she was not happy there. It's almost difficult to explain... Do you have an elderly family member? Perhaps one that seems almost constantly grumpy? That's the way my mammaw was. I tried so hard to convince her that everything was going to be okay. The nurses don't hate you. The doctor's are listening when you tell them how you feel I promise. Are you sure you are remembering that right? Now it feels so cruel. At the time, I just wanted her to be okay. I wanted her to see the other side of things, the happier possibility. I swear to god I paid attention. I watched the nurses and doctors like a hawk. I begged my work to let me leave or come in to work at all hours of the day so that I could 'randomly' visit my mammaw and make sure she was being treated well. I never saw anything out of place. I don't know that there was anything amiss. They seemed to be perfectly normal and professional, but jesus christ I looked. Because she told me how she felt and I refused to just ignore that. I told her what I saw, that everything was fine. They were doing their best. At some point, a good friend of mine went on vacation with his family. He asked me to look after his cats. I would get off work between 330 and 345pm. I would stop by his house and feed his cats and clean their litter. Then I would head to see Mammaw, and I'd arrive at perhaps 430pm or so.  This was a regular thing for about two weeks. At this point, Mammaw had been in the hospital for almost a month, and I had been visiting almost daily, so it was relatively routine. July 25th, I got out of work at 345pm. I went to my friend's house and checked on his cats, fed them, cleaned the litter. I took pictures of his cats and sent them to his family with amusing captions as if they were secret agents because they were so shy when I was there. I left at about 415 to see Mammaw. I was very stressed emotionally at this point, and I messaged my husband 'I almost dread visiting Mammaw because of how stressful and emotionally taxing it was becoming. I was on my way there when I received a phone call at 420pm. It was her doctor. He asked me if I was driving, and I said I was. He said he had some news for me when I stopped driving, and to let him know when that was. For whatever reason, obliviousness, childish naivete, it didn't occur to me. I thought that something had happened that required her to lose a limb. It just didn't process in my mind. I arrived at about 430pm. The doctor pulled me into a room and told me that her heart had stopped at around 415. They had tried to restart it with no luck. She was gone. I died. I cried. I had never lost someone I was close to before this. It was surreal. I cried and cried. I asked to see her. They took me to her room, where I had been less than 24 hours before. She was laying in the same bed she had been in, but she had tubes going down her throat from where they had tried to resuscitate her. She wasn't married. Her two sons weren't there. Of her five grandchildren, it was just me. I was alone with her. But she was alone. She had died, alone. No family with her. No children or grandchildren to hold her hand. To be clear, her sons, my father and my uncle, are not at all 'well to do'. They have little to no money. They were unable to be there because of financial constraints. That being said, she was alone. I wasn't there. Nobody in her family was there. She died alone. And that kills me every day. Logically, I know I helped her a lot. I know that she was able to enjoy the warm local weather and feel good in general because I brought her down here. She got to be independent for a while. She hadn't had that in ages. My mind, my brain, my emotions, they just don't add up. I KNOW that she lived longer because she stopped living with my uncle who was a constant smoker. I KNOW that she wanted to go to florida. I KNOW she loved the beach and warm weather. I KNOW she enjoyed being independent for the short time she was. But for fucks sake, she died alone. I wasn't there when I should have been. jesus christ I even said that I dreaded visiting her because of the stress. At the time all I wanted to do was point out the positive to her, tell her that everything would be okay, and there was nothing to worry about, but all she wanted was for me to believe her when she said something was wrong. Even if nothing was wrong WHY COULDN'T I JUST UNDERSTAND?! WHY COULDN'T I BE ON HER SIDE?! The one thing she needed and I just.. couldn't see it.",11Nov2019,1

I have deadlines and things for college and life right now but feel no stress towards it and that’s not out of laziness but it’s like my mind and brain won’t connect with me anymore and part of me says I’m fine but I know that part is lying to some degree.

26,"So I’m not really sure how to start this, or what I want to say exactly but I know I want to help her  and she really wants help as well, so here goes ... 

I live in New Zealand, I work as a Mental Health Assistant in a Mental Heath Inpatient Unit. My partner has severe depression and anxiety, she’s 25 and we’ve been dating for almost 2.5 Years, she’s wonderful and I seriously couldn’t ask for anything more. She has the kindest heart and warmest personality you could ever meet, and the looks to match. Her personality and heart make her a natural in her career as an Early childhood Teacher. 

Since puberty she has been plagued with really bad depression and anxiety, I seriously don’t know how she has sort of just dealt with it on her own, for so long, She’s definitely much stronger minded and willed than me. From the outside you probably wouldn’t know anything is wrong. 

A few months ago things were really bad, she was having thoughts of harming/killing herself and I didn’t know what to do. I work night shift sometimes too and since we live on our own, I really didn’t want to leave her all alone when I went to work, to be honest it scared the heck out of me. “What if the thoughts get to much while I’m at work, what if she does something while I’m at work” these thoughts were racing through my head, I was worried sick something would happen while I was at work or out. 

One night, not long before I had to leave for work, she grabbed me and said she couldn’t guarantee her safety when I left. Worried I knew I had to do something so asked her if she would mind if I rang the mental health crisis line, she seemed to be in support of that. She agreed to an appointment with a DAO at the hospital and I let my work know I’d be late that night, long story short, they assessed her that night and said she could spend the night at her mums. In the morning we saw a Doctor and he prescribed her escitalopram and said as they were the crisis team they wouldn’t be able to do much of a follow up, we were hopeful the new meds would help and on our way we went. I felt there was more we could do but was sort of stuck for for what this might be. 

Now, a few months later, things seemed ok but slowly I started noticing certain things that weren’t quite right. I had a feeling she was possibly getting bad again, she would often come home and be very reluctant to have a shower, I would do my best to encourage her, but it wouldn’t always work. 

She asked me if I could talk to someone at my work, I’m not really sure, I want to but where would I start. I know she still has bad thoughts sometimes, I know she doesn’t want to act on them, but I also know that they scare her and that I’ve got two months of night shift coming up so I don’t want her to be on her own at night. We don’t have the money at the moment to pay 120$+ a session to see a therapist/counsellor, I don’t want her to have to go through this anymore, she the strongest girl I know but I know that depression is something else and sometimes it doesn’t matter how strong you are, I’ll admit it does scare me. I will be there to support her but I know I’m not enough on my own. 

If anyone has any advice, I’m all ears. Anything would be greatly appreciated at this point. 

P.S. Sorry for the long read, I’ve never written any of this down before, they’re just my thoughts and some of the goings on of the last year or so for us.",11Nov2019,1
27,"Today’s been pretty awful my mother says that I’m a disappointment.ive decided I’m gonna do these quite often as it helps me. I’m struggling to leave my house and even talk to anyone in person I’m going to get kicked out of college and although it’s something that I really want to do I can’t bring myself to do it.
I’m honestly considering suicide again maybe instead of pills I might throw myself infront of a car.my mother says that she will only cook me food and nothing else and then said that when her,her boyfriend and my brother move out I’m not coming and then she’s going to tell my dad who owns the house that we are living in that they are moving out so then I’ll end having nowhere to stay she said this after smacking my arm several times. I told her to fuck off mainly because I can’t deal with her shouting at me. She says that I’m causing drama etc but she’s the one who shouts at me and starts the drama. She then asked my brother who doesn’t speak to my dad to message him and say that I’m fuckin my life up. I’m used to being the black sheep of the family I’m a failure and I can’t help it I dont want to be here or even be alive I just want someone to come and eat a pizza from dominos with me and talk to me and just make me feel like less of a loser. 

To top it off this weekend my girlfriend and I went to a house party. (Backstory) she came over after I went out with my dad on Saturday which was pretty awkward and stuff as when your parents have a divorce you kinda have to get used to eating McDonald’s or other fast foods and going out places like the cinema we went to see the joker which I guess was ok I’ve seen it before but it’s still a good movie.
Every now and then I’d have flashes of what seemed to be a loving father figure that wasn’t very present in my life to this point but then I realised he can never be that for me it made me feel useless and helpless.
My mum always says that my dad doesn’t want me like his father didn’t want him when he was younger and that I need to accept that he doesn’t want me and move on and stop trying to convince myself that he can be what I want him to be. He then drove me home and parked just about a street away I played him some of my music on the drive home I wanted to hear him say ‘sam who’s this it’s cool’ or even try and show some approval of my music instead he said it was awful and he didn’t understand how anyone could listen to that kind of music. It was Pantera for anyone who was wondering. When we got out of the car he hugged me and said he’d see me soon. He doesn’t know about my suicide attempt I don’t intend to tell him either he usually just sorta says oh well exercise try to turn your life around which when you struggle to leave your house is kinda difficult. Or when he sees me down he tells me to cheer the fuck up. And then tells me to stand up straight and smile. And wear some lighter colours.’he wonders why he’s depressed...if I wore black as much as he does I’d be depressed too’ he said this to my brother one time infront of me.anyway so my girlfriend met me after my dad dropped me off and we went into my house and had some dinner there was slot of laughing and talking and stuff it made me think that maybe things are getting better. We went out after to meet me girlfriends friend.she was in someone’s house cutting a long story short she smoked a lot of weed and so did i we came home and she threw up she had work the next day so she had to miss it which sucks but I guess it’s better she missed it. I blamed myself for this.at the house that her friend was in loads of guys were staring at her this made me feel unworthy of her company. It really made me realise that I’m not good enough  for her

Anyway if yall want me to keep doing these let me know

29," 

I am 29 yo, where I feel like i have a bunch of problems, but I don't know where to start to get help. even writing this is raising my heart beat and making my body shiver. I dont know where to start and how to get help. here are some more information about my situation, not in order as I don't know where to start.

\- I am carrier focused, I have a decent job (make over 140k around maryland); i have a masters and work as a manager in a construction firm

\- i live by myself, all my family are overseas, and I have been living away from them off and on for over 15 years. Being from a middle eastern country family is very important to me but yet I do not share more than routine casual conversation with my siblings and parents, I help them (financially and routine advise often) yet I don't let them get involved in my life in the same way (this may be due to fear of being judged, or not trusting to get the advice i need, i don't know).

\- i easily get mad and cut ties with friends, family, or relationships. (i.e, i have not been speaking with my dad for over a year over something he said that may or may not have been geniunly his fault). I broke off with a girl i liked as soon as i saw signs that she may possibly hurt my feeling .this has been the case on multiple occasions; as soon as I see signs that someone may hurt me, I cut off all ties or will be the first person to end the relationship; I often think about scenario and justify the situation but this has happened so many times that I have started to dought myself on whether the fault is fully mine and not the other person; here are some examples:

1- I broke off with a girl I really liked, because I got sick/mono after dating her and she refused to say it was her that I contracted the virus from (even though she was showing the signs)

2- I broke off with another girl because she would stand me up multiple times and then come back the next day with a text making an excuse

3- I have not been talking properly with my younger brother (over 8 years younger) because he cursed me out over a year ago.

4- e and my very old friend stopped speaking with each other; after I felt he disrespected me.

5- I try to help my friends both financially, with college/school/carrier advice, or going out of my way to find them employment. But even then I feel like it is not appreciated by them or even recognized.

this list can go on and on,

All this may make me sound like a horrible person; but I genuinely try to be as much of a nice person as I can; I never try to do anyone wrong. I have been called self absorbed, I am lonely and sad and even through I am 29 I haven't had a steady relationship (besides one night stands that last time happened over 7 months ago). After trying hard to find a relationship, I have been at a hopelessness point where I have given up looking, and going to gym, and instead just focused on work. I don;t know what I am expecting to find here and if any of what I am writing makes sense but I just want to get it off my chest.. and there is alllllot more of this

at the end I don't know where to start, don't know if therapy will be helpful and how should I go about seeking help through therapy",11Nov2019,1
30,"So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didn't really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is -until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and I'm trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him I'd try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I self-harmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didn't feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt *alive*. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, I've slipped into a different type of numbness. It's like I don't care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really don't have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldn't care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like i'm gonna go out of my way to make it happen.

34,"Bit of a life story with this sorry if this is long. First time posting though going with no expectations.

Im a stay at home mother to a 1 year old and hub works 60-70 hours a week. Im unable to work due to medical issues and going through process of acquiring disability. I wont hear an answer(denial 80% likely) until march. Im also unable to drive and do not carry a license. 

So basically im a shut in. 

In 2016 I graduated college (Culinary) with high honors and after a year in the field my doctor told me to change careers or risk permanent damage to my body. I was diagnosed with a few autoimmune disorder, and my flares(periods that arent considered remission/inactive disorder) were being caused by my work life. 

Now I can barely sustain a home life and doing mundane tasks leaves me hurting often and I get injured very easily, so easily it’s laughable. 

I also had a falling out with family after figuring out they were the source of my severe ptsd and are abusive. So I moved to the opposite side of the country and ghosted them. 

I lost 3 things that year, my career, my family, and my home(the place most dear to my heart).

However Ive gained a son and husband now, so thats nice at least. 

Anyway, I have been getting worse lately as Ive been a shut in for nearly 2 years(I had to stop working when pregnant on high risk bedrest). I shower once a week and sleep as much as I can because im so tired. I dont eat much anymore, food doesnt appeal to me. Im not motivated to do anything except basic care towards my toddler who I do love and makes me happy for the most part. I dont really have friends here, the two acquaintances I have also work nonstop and I cant expect people to cater to me. 
I go out if the house once or twice a month and its usually for grocery shopping. The other times its dr appointments. Id take a bus if I didnt live in an extremely unsafe area, especially as a young woman with a kid. Even taking an uber is shady, many of my male drivers are predatory and comment how young I look. 

What my ultimate question is, am I just sad and lonely? Or am I depressed? More times than not I feel numb and unemotional, like a big blah. Other days I feel lonely and cry and pity myself. Is it situational depression? Should I seek help or am I being overdramatic? 

My insurance covers therapy but the last 2 I went to were god awful and just a joke. I thought of doing online therapy thats paid professionals(vs what youd call interns practicing) but its 120$ a month we cant afford. We just moved to a house to live by my mother in law so I could have a babysitter(havent had a day to myself since he was born) but their house got foreclosed illegally so they have to move until they fight and sue the bank. So that went down the drain again.

I did start new medication that can cause worse depression but there is no alternative meds to this and I have to take it as it is life saving. 

Should I just stick it out and pay for the therapy? I get a free trial for a week if I dont like it I wont commit.",11Nov2019,1

36,"Alone again. Inside my head. Angry voices yelling my name. Telling me how I can’t. How I haven’t and never will. How I’m better off dead. And it’d be better off for those I love too. So off myself is what I should do. 

Tears are streaming, body shaking, dry heaves in the making. My heart. My mind. My life is breaking. Is this a chemical imbalance or imbalance in the way we’re living? Can’t shake the feeling of being helpless. The pinches, cuts, and punches punishment for lack of efficacy. 

The self hate and isolation of a child who’s deemed themself a cancer. Incurable. Best to cut that shit out of the body of society. Online alone in a sea of angry voices. The world is disordered and what if I don’t want to contribute my part to that? A public service by refusing to add my litter to the gutters of the world. 

But I will try screaming first. Roaring into the abyss. Maybe, just maybe I am not alone. That this feeling could pass. That I could mean something to those I love. That I’m worth being carried sometimes. But I resent myself for being carried. How do I let go of that? How do I stop hating myself? How can I carry myself if not with love?",11Nov2019,1
37," 

I am feeling bad. Yesterday I was really bad.

Yesterday I had a break down over something completely tiny, though it is linked to other things. The night before yesterday I had asked my bf 3-4 times to stop to get me a dr.pepper on the way home. Two of the times was when he was on the way home.

The next morning I (home alone) not even 15minutes out of my bed about to take laundry down, I had to stop to let the dog out so I checked the fridge to see where he put them. Only to find he never got them. He somehow completely forgot and just picked up our roommate and went out to eat. I was at work the whole time on one of my almost 13hr shifts the night that I told him to pick them up.I got so ridiculously mad. I just had a complete meltdown. It was not due to the fact that he didn't get the soda, it is the fact that he never makes what I say priority in his mind. This kind of thing happens ***all*** the time.

I texted him and just went off. He went through the same old, ""Im sorry I just forgot"". I just wouldn't take it. He said he was worried with the way I was reacting and I told him I had already done everything he was worried about, which is self harm. I had been having things build up for a while, and once again my period was involved. It also came yesterday so that probably did not help anything.

This breakdown was something else. I did not cut too much, but I had sat there in a daze of dark thoughts and blankness for so long that my blood had dried and stuck to the towel that my arm was laying on.

Skip to half a day later, the roommate came home. Things were fine til we waltzed over and just berated me with all this is the span of about 2-3 minutes.

""Shouldn't you be reading, playing a game or ***colorinngg?""*** I was actually organizing some pages I had not finished coloring at that moment. He walked up to me and said, ""Are you even going to finish any of those? What do you not like coloring living things? And what is this (points to my computer background) a still shot? ""

I told him yeah its a still shot from a Ghibli film and his response, ""Well DUH!""

All in the span of 2-3 minutes. I just felt attacked. He left the room after saying all that and I just said fuck it and went to the bathroom and completely torn up my arm. The worst I have in months.

I just do not understand why people treat me like I am just something they fuck with. Something that is not worth the memory space in their brain to remember things I ask or say. I am never priority to any one.

I am getting more scared of myself because I realized last night that cutting is helping more than I actually even knew. I normally use it as a mood stabilizer to keep me from actually being violent with someone, and just because no one wants to have break downs and feel that way. Well I realized yesterday that I am much more suicidal when I try not to cut myself. All the times I have tried to refrain from self harm I have had really bad affects. One time I actually thought that I might have needed medical attention but just decided to sleep on it.

I am mainly feeling bad because I sound ridiculous. Having a break down stemmed from my bf not bringing me soda? That is stupid. But I feel bad because I cannot help the way I respond to things. As much as I hate myself for responding the way I do to somethings sometimes, I can not help it. I cannot. And it makes me feel worse that people think that I am just being dramatic or looking for attention. I am not. I am just frustrated and suicidal (only during break downs and such).I do not know why he is even still with me and dealing with me. I am such a shitty person.

I do not know what to do about this since it will be a while before I can save to even attempt seeing a professional..

I have started a gratitude journal and have been writing in my journal every day as well to try to help. But so far it has had vert minimal affects.

I just need to know if these are signs of depression.


I could be having a wonderful day with my SO, then something along the lines of we can't do something I'd like to do ( could be anything from seeking a sexual encounter to wanting to go to some particular place to eat, or watching a movie I wanted to see ), some times it almost makes a switch in my brain click, and  one of two things happen emotionally. 



1. I get irrationally angry about it. Not yelling or being bitchy about it but just being angry and not being able to let go of it in my head. After some time I can generally tell myself I'm just being dumb and if I just forget about it I'll feel fine and it often works.



2. I get irrationally sad. Not like crying sad, but like feeling worthless, or unwanted/needed. And I get so fixated on the thing that set me off that's in my head atleast it has to be part of some bigger issue, and my brain makes something that isn't an issue into an issue. Tonight in particular after some little things again 




Tonight in Particular I'm feeling worthless, unwanted, but also lifelss, I could sit here and just kinda stare at somthing for 20 minutes at a time and not really feel anything about it, or what I'm doing. I feel dispair where none is warranted. It took me off gaurd when I noticed how little everything seemed to matter and how I wasn't even moving I had to check myself to see if I was having a stroke or something.



Idk this was a lot of words, if you need any mor info or anything was unclear feel free to ask me to clarify. Hopefully there's some nice people with some advice out there.

I took an hour long bath. Now, I feel like a gross, soggy prune. I look like one too.

Or I give in because I just need to move on from the bad feeling and the temporary release is too appealing.

She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. 
Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 5/7 days now.",11Nov2019,1
