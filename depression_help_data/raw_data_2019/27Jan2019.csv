1,I can't seem to help sabotaging relationships. I get to the point where I'm not happy all the time. So I seek attention from other girls. I know it's wrong but I can't help myself. My girlfriend just left me and now I don't know what to do. ,27Jan2019,1
2,"I’m 17 and I’m already so tired of living. I hate myself but I don’t necessarily hate my life. I have an amazing boyfriend, I’m doing good in school. My parents are very hard to deal with but I’ve gotten used to it. I have felt depressed for a few years. Therapy is not an option for me right now. I take citalopram but I don’t know if it’s helping and my mom won’t let me go to the doctor to try something new. Almost every day feels like I’m just trying to make it through until I can go back to sleep. I love sleeping because I don’t have to feel anything. Sometimes I cry nonstop and other times I feel absolutely nothing. Nothing interests me anymore. My boyfriend is in the navy so I don’t get to spend time with him. Only phone calls and texting. I know that has made it a lot harder but he helps me so much. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I think about dying every day. I read about suicide. I know I’m most likely not going to do it but I can’t help thinking about it. I just want to not exist but not die I guess. This post is long so thank you for reading it. I don’t know how to keep going. I have to live with my parents until I graduate college so 4 more years. ",27Jan2019,1
3,"For the last few years I have been dealing with depression, I got it under control for the most part without medication. Just worked up a good support system and figured out a way of tracking when the bad days would come. But lately it just seems like the bad days dont go away. My support system kinda diminished since I've been doing "" so much better,"" over the last few months. Next week I'm starting a new job. But for some reason I dont see  future formyself. The only reason I haven't done anything is because I take care of my parents and I dont want to leave them. But i feel like if something happens to them I dont really have a reason for living. Which quite honestly I dont. I'm not married I have no kids I dont work in the field I graduated college from. All my friends are getting married and having kids and I'm starting to feel like something is wrong with me even though I know I am a great woman. I cook I clean I'm funny wicked hard working loyal and a great friend. I'm just tired of being a burden. Of resurfacing every few weeks talking about my depression Is bad again. I feel like people are getting sick of hearing it. Quite frankly like I'm tried of dealing with it. I'm not afraid to die. I've come to terms with that. I think I just want to find some type of purpose. Or at least some single friends that want to hang out so I dont have to lay in bed all weekend instead of actually being productive. ",27Jan2019,1
4,"Long story short, I've tried all kinds of meds, talk therapy, even the TMS treatments.  I stopped taking meds after the 6 to 8 weeks because nothing makes me feel better.  I tried opening up those closest to me, and I instead get told that my emotions are out of control, or I get chastised for how I am ""being"". Mind you, this is from people that know I suffer from severe anxiety and MDD.  I feel like I can't talk to anyone.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I know I need help but nothing seems to make it better.  I've been told to ""get more sleep, change my diet, exercise more"" and the super awesome ""just cheer up"".  I've suffered from MDD for over 20 years now.",27Jan2019,1
5,"I have to find it within myself to stop this cycle I'm in! First off I have MDD, OCD Pure ""O"" and mild Tourette's syndrome. I was spiraling down, and have already hit bottom. I have no motivation to do anything! I became disabled in late Aug. 2009. I started waking up in abdominal pain. Long story short, my intestines were 270° counter--rotated, I had surgery at The Cleveland Clinic. It didn't stop the chronic pain. My Duodenum was engulfed in wide band like adhesions called Ladd's bands. They removed the adhesions, and turned my small intestines back clockwise. The surgery did save my life! I am now disabled with chronic abdominal pain. I have lost alot at this point in time! I had an awesome career and moving up! I was an Industrial Electronics and Automation Controls an Robotics Technician. I was the leader of a team of 25 tradesmen that kept the machinery and factory running. I really miss my job! Now I'm nothing important! I can no longer do that job. It just so happened, I had signed up for Long Term disability insurance the previous 2 years.  I'm a believer in insurance! I'm ok financially for now Thank God! I'm a physical and emotional wreck though! Soon after my surgery, my wife left me, I was hard to live with, believe me! At around the same time, my oldest brother died. My downward spiral began! I began getting depressed. Over the years, I just do less and less, to the point I am doing nothin, like vacuuming and dusting and house cleaning! I can still do work around the house. The problem is, I am so depressed, I can't do shit! There are a few things I have to do, keep the bathrooms clean and laundry, the basic necessities... I'm an alcoholic, 58 days SOBER today. I have no drive, I have alot of shit I need to be working on in my house. I just can't seem to make myself do it, or anything else for that matter. I'm the epitome of lazy! I don't want to do anything and I know I'm perfectly capable. It's like I'm froze in neutral! WTF is wrong with me? Anyone, how do I break this cycle? I have suicidal thoughts, because I feel like a slug! I'm just wasting away! I need exercise, but have always sucked at that too! I'm dying a slow miserable death at 49 years old! I live like a hermit! I need help and motivation! Sorry for the ramble. If you made it this far, thanks for reading! PLEASE HELP!!!",27Jan2019,1
6,"So I am extremely talkative and have no issues communicating with total strangers but over the past 3 months I haven’t had any real time with anyone. A lot of people I used to talk to for hours over discord have either moved on to something or no longer use it (I don’t hold any grudges or bad feelings for these people) but I haven’t had any chats or friendships for awhile and I can feel how it is affecting me. I’ve become depressed and down. Feeling less motivated and tired. I get my energy from others, meaning good conversation and laughter means good energy or happiness for me. I love seeing others smile and happy and that in return makes me feel the same way. Any suggestions on what I could do to maybe meet some new people again? I’m new here so please tell me if I have said anything I should not have and I can remove this post. ",27Jan2019,1
7,"Lately I’ve been fretting over things that need to be done in the future and my mind won’t rest. It’s a never ending yap of what’s coming up in school, or reminding me I probably failed my exams. Of course, throughout all of this I just feel empty with a tinge of sorrow. 

I want to be in the moment, appreciate the quiet and the fact I have no obligations right now, but I can’t. what should I do? 

I’ve gone on the internet, but its all ‘find a distraction’ and every time I try, I unconsciously remind myself of bad times ahead. Or find myself wishing to be in another universe, where it’s all fun and fantasy. Which makes me even more depressed.  Tips? What do you guys do?? I don’t have anyone in particular I can talk to who can take how intense I am, emotionally. ",27Jan2019,1
8,"I’m 12, nearly a month away from being thirteen, and I’m struggling, severely. I’ve been getting more and more depressed since I was in first grade. There I was immediately ignored and bullied. It has begun getting worse and worse over the years. Now I’m just a depressed wreck. I’m constantly suicidal and it’s my will to stay alive has nearly disappeared. While I haven’t gotten any help, I’ve been doing everything I could to stay alive, but they’re failing. I made myself a jokester who no matter what would crack a joke and keep myself entertained. Now my ability to joke around is failing. I made myself an optimist who was always looking at the bright side of things. Now I’m a pessimist that thinks I’m a failure and everything will go wrong, but still acting like an optimist. I made playing video games a hobby, something I enjoyed since I was around 4. But my will to play is gone and I don’t find entertainment in doing so. I became a YouTuber who was trying there absolute hardest to entertain. I never gained subscribers, got almost no views, and made horrible, unedited videos that are all deleted. I became a star student who was able to solve almost any problem and loved reading. Now my grades are failing and I barely even read. Everything I have done to succeed in not dying has failed. At school I’m treated like crap, at home my siblings don’t even care about me, and no soda listens to me and ignores everything I want to do. Instead, I must be a rocket scientist or lawyer or something like that. It’s extremely hard to not kill or harm myself. Worse, I have to bottle up my emotions. Because I’m a male. And makes can’t cry or show emotions. At least, that’s what society says. That’s why I haven’t gotten help. I also am the oldest. So I have to not only make sure I can survive, but take care and set an example for my younger siblings. My life has become other garbage and now I’m an anti social idiot who only cares about video games and his phone. That is how people describe me.",27Jan2019,1
9,"I don’t know what to do. Every time when I talk to someone I can’t keep an interesting conversation. I usually don’t talk or say something that’s weird or doesn’t even make sense. I feel like people look down on me because of that and think I’m dumb. But I’m smart, I just need time to think through most things. 

I’ve been trying to talk to more people as much as I can to learn how to be social, but i can’t do it. I’m terrible at talking to people but I like doing it. 

Literally all of my conversations are just me asking questions and me being short. I’m honestly scared that I won’t be able to have a normal relationship with people. I’m nice and people like me; I’m just terrible with talking. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified. I dont know how to help the way I talk. ",27Jan2019,1
10,"Hey guys, so my girlfriends little sister is having some problems we believe and we are not really certain who we should turn to. Right now we are looking for a psychiatrist to help her but we are not really sure what could be the problem. 

So the thing is that she has stopped going to school and the only thing she does on the days are staying in her room and watch YouTube on her cellphone. She’s told her mother that she feels lonely even when her family is there. She doesn’t want to talk about how she feels and always feels like she is the only one that knows the answers to everything. 

She has always been “special” but this last year she’s been totally disconnected from everyone, and she can go around and talk to her self and laugh. When her mother ask what she is doing she says she is “training”. Any one here that could know what’s up?",27Jan2019,1
11,"I have been in a deep emotional slump lately.

A little background of me: Type 1 diabetic since 2007, victim of child abuse between the years 2005-2007. Clinically diagnosed with bipolar depression, 2 attempted suicides, have personality and behavioural disorders, fairly high IQ (elligible for Mensa), underdeveloped EQ, very asocial, had 4 friends until now.

So. The reason I brought up these are so you could understand a little bit better why this certain chain of events that happened troubles me so much.

As you can see (and guess) from my background, I have very few people whom I trust, and therefore, care. My first assumption when I meet anybody is to assume they are lying, and attempting to take advantage of me in some way.

When I met this girl 5 years ago, I crushed hard on her. I was too uncomfortable to actually approach her until 2 years after I met her initially. I befriended her, and she helped me get through some dark periods, amd I helped her through some situations. I presented her gifts (which I rarely do) every ""natural"" occasions, such as her birthday, Valentines Day, Christmas, etc.

It pained me to realize that not only my very presense made her feel annoyed, but even messaging her once in a while (3-4 conversations through chatting services per week). I tried to get over the fact. I deleted her contacts, social media, and avoided her in anyway possible.

But I can't get over it, because I feel too emotionally infatuated over her (as I never had liked a woman before, and thought I lacked the ability to love), and when I finally opened myself to someone, letting her know what I am truly thinking, I was pushed away.

Although this was not my main reason of my current ""Wave of depression"", this even has worsened it, beyond imagination.

My other 3 friends, all overseas, are starting to distance themselves from me (or so I feel).

What can I do? What should I do?",27Jan2019,1

13,"A friend recently asked if I could help someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety for 9 years (I’ll refer to her as “person A”).

Person A has few close friends, is isolated from her family, lives alone, and was subjected to some bullying in the high school. She says she has “tried everything” from therapists to antidepressants with little success (she went to a doctor as recently as last week), and that the cost of treatment and counseling is becoming too much for her. Most of her time is directed towards rigorous classwork or playing video games, and her social media is filled with posts that mention depression, anxiety, and death. She tells me she is exhausted, miserable and hasn’t had a good day in years.

At the request of my friend, I agreed to make myself available to Person A whenever she needed to talk online, and check in on her once in a while (I'm trying not to act like a therapist, but more like a friend who is always ready to listen). But besides gathering her thoughts on a daily basis, what are some ways I can actually help her cope? What are some questions I can ask, or things we can discuss? What are some things to avoid (tone, specific questions or topics, etc)?",27Jan2019,1
14,"For the past few weeks I've been feeling more and more depressed. I've had it controlled well for years but things happening all at once has just brought me to tears at this point. I have a bf, he's amazing but one thing that I would say is wrong with him is he doesn't know how to support me when I'm like this. He'll ask what's wrong, If there's something specific I'll tell him, but it's been so many things it's just everything. And he doesn't know how to respond to that. It just makes me feel incredibly lonely. I haven't been able to get out of bed yet (1.30pm here) and he just happily stayed on his computer and now he's gone out. 

I just want to feel better, go about my day but I can't. There's nothing I want to do. Nobody I know I want to talk to. I'm just laying here. How do I get out of this?",27Jan2019,1

19,"I know some of the things I will mention don’t work for everyone but it helps me personally and it could help someone. One of the big things I like to do to get my mind off my suicide tendencies and depression is to clean. I like to clean while listening to my favorite music, it brings me inner peace and calms me down. Also I like to take long walks during the night while talking to myself about my thoughts and emotions. Another thing that personally helps is to hang out with friends, while a lot of us feel alone it’s not true, we have friends and family that go through their own hell, it’s great to know that you have that love and support.

I finally finished a winter class and graduate college. But I’m lost. Idk whether to find a job or try to travel. I’ve been doing drugs and drinking again and today ended a 4 day bender. And it all came crashing down.

I haven’t self harmed in 6 months. Today, I ended that. I haven’t felt suicidal in a month but today I can’t imagine being here anymore. It just always comes back to this. These feelings I’ve had my whole life will never go away. All the medicines and doctors I’ve tried, nothing helps. The only thing keeping me here is my family. But I am suffering.

I do not see a point to this world. It’s like I’m just floating through it until my next life. Like I’m not even supposed to be here. Nothing matters. I just don’t know anymore.",27Jan2019,1
