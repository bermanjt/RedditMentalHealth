5,"I have had chronic, debilitating depression since I started puberty.  For the past year I have been really bad off.  I have spent so much time talking to myself...justifying suicide...talking myself out of it...thinking about cutting....thinking about what I can do to maintain control or at least show someone how bad I hurt.  

Tonight is really bad. I feel like there is static in my head and butterflies in my stomach. I want to cry. I want to scream. I want to talk to someone but I can't. I have successfully eliminated any supporting people. Besides..no one sticks around when you can't function normally. I haven't showered in weeks. I haven't brushed my hair. I haven't put on makeup. I just go to work then go to bed. I try to play games to distract myself. 

My psych doctor isn't helping. Welbutrin isn't helping. My counselor is more concerned about my lack of interest in sex. That's the least of my problems. I hate being touched. No one is in my life. No one cares but my parents. I have successfully built a temporary life. No one would even care.",17Apr2019,1

I can’t stop the racing thoughts, I can’t shake myself out of it.  I have physical pain in my chest from the anxiety.  I’ve missed a ton of work that I can’t afford to miss.  I tried getting help, but it’s all the same stuff I heard before.  I’ve tried most of the meds and they don’t work.

11,"TL;DR:  
I was diagnosed with benign rolandic epilepsy as a child but grew out of it. I've been taking bupropion for depression and I'm paranoid about it. Do you think this is safe?

Hey /r/depression_help

When I was a child I had two seizures where I lost my ability to speak / move but never lost consciousness. After the second seizure I was diagnosed with benign rolandic epilepsy, and started taking tegratol. After a few years I was taken off of the tegratol and have been seizure free since. I ""grew out of"" the epilepsy, which is common with the type I had.

A year or so ago I started taking bupropion for depression. I was really worried about this as everyone says not to take this medication if you have a history of epilepsy, but my psychologist insisted that since I grew out of my benign rolandic epilepsy I should be okay. The doses started as 150mg XR and titrated up to 300mg XR.

This worked great and I never had a seizure during the 6 months I used the medication, but then I slipped up and forgot to take the medication for a few days. When I realized I forgot to take the medication I was worried that it had been too long since the last time I took it, and taking a 300mg XR dose would be too much. I kept putting off taking the dose because I was nervous, but I was also embarrassed to ask my psychologist for more 150mg pills so I could re-titrate back up.

Months passed without me taking bupropion, and I started to think I no longer needed it. However eventually I started to feel the way I did before the medication. I talked to my psychologist and they said that if I wanted to I could restart the medication, going straight back to 300mg XR with no titration. They said since I handled it well the first time I should be fine.

This is my second day after restarting the medication, and during lecture I had a really strong deja vu feeling. Then, I thought about how I have deja vu quite often lately, maybe twice a month. I decided to look up ""frequent deja vu"" and found that it can be caused by partial seizures. I already felt really weird at this point but after I read that I felt a buzzing in my head and a tingling sensation in my mouth / on my lips. It reminded my of what it was like to not be able to speak during a seizure as a child, but not as intense (I could talk just fine, with some stumbling). This continued for about 20 minutes, I was zoning out during lecture, focussing / testing different areas of my forehead / mouth, and feeling extremely buzzy (I'm sure that doesn't make sense, but idk what else to describe the feeling with).

I can't tell if I was just panicking because I was anxious, or if I was experiencing the effects of a partial seizure and the panic was justified.

After lecture I had a really hard time working on problems with a study group for another 10 minutes or so, but once I got into the problems all of the feelings I've been describing went away and I've been fine since (it's been about 7 hours since then).

My main issue is what I should do tomorrow.  
Do you think this medication is safe for people with a history of benign rolandic epilepsy?  
Is it safe for me to stop taking the medication tomorrow?  
If it is safe, should I do that?

Obviously I will contact my psychologist about all of this, but I'd like a group of people to talk about this with as well.

Thanks",17Apr2019,1

13,"I would love to talk. Shoot me a message if you want to talk privately, or we can continue a conversation here in the post. In the meantime, I'll share my thoughts and what has helped me deal with this stuff below:

I've been to that point. I would go lay in bed and stare at the hooks on my ceiling and wonder if they would hold my weight if I fastened a noose our of my belt.

I've heard people say that some people know when they are going to die, and you can see it in their eyes. That's how I felt after dealing with it for so long. I don't know how to explain it, but I could feel the end getting closer, and every day that went by felt like a countdown, and it wasn't going to be very long.

One time I was working on my computer, and I randomly froze with fear. I went absolutely stiff, terrified that if I so much as blinked my eyes it would somehow lead to a chain of actions in my body that would end with me in the bathtub with my arms cut open. It was so real, and so convincing that I had zero doubt that if I moved a muscle while that pressure surrounded me, that would have been it.

All I could do was sit there and wait for it to pass. It was pure torment.

I think that's about the point I knew I had a choice to make. Either I was going to figure out how to beat thing, or it was going to torment me for the rest of my life, and possibly talk me into ending my life way too early.

That was in 2016. I'm happy to say it didn't beat me. And I'm happy to say that it doesn't have to beat you.

Firstly, I know what you're feeling right now is likely very intense, and there might even be a lot of physical pressure on your body. I know the thoughts in your head might be SCREAMING so loud it's hard to think clearly.

But really take a moment, as best as you can to think about it: they're only thoughts and feelings. Although the thoughts are loud and intimidating, although they are a torment, they have no physical power to harm you or kill you. The same is true for the feelings. Even though your heart is racing, and the thoughts are capitalizing on that to try and convince you that you're going to die, and that it would be *better* to die. Those feelings have no power to harm you or kill you.

If the thoughts and feelings have no power, that means you do. Do you know why bipolar, ptsd, depression, and all these things try so hard to get us to kill ourselves? Because they lack the power to do it for us. The whole goal is for us to be dead and gone, for the potential our life has to contribute something good to this world to be ripped away from history. But those things have no power to do it, so the only thing they can do is try to talk us into it, and pressure us with feelings, and scream at us through thoughts.

When I realized that for the first time, I put my foot down, and said, ""Fuck you, depression! You want me dead so bad. You are trying so hard to get rid of me. It's almost as if you're afraid of me. It's almost as if you see something in me that I haven't seen in myself, and you are more terrified of me than I have ever been of you. So you know what? Fuck you! I don't care if I have to feel these feelings and hear these thoughts for the rest of my life, I'm not going to kill myself because I think it pisses you off every second I'm still alive. I think you are tormented by every breath I take even worse than you try to torment me in every breath. I'm not leaving. And do you know what? I'm not just going to continue living, I'm going to expose you. I'm going to go to the others that you torment and I'm going to tell them what I learned about how you work, and I'm going to teach them how to conquer you, too. You trying to kill me is going to be the costliest mistake you've ever made, and I promise, before I do leave this planet, you will regret that you ever touched me.""

So let me break down my approach:

1. Personification: I am being very intentional about externalizing the issue. It's usually the opposite that's taught. Internalize it, ""accept that it's a part of who you are and always will be."" If it's a part of who I am, I'm fucked, because I'm always going to be who I am. That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me. Because that is what these mental health issues exist to do, their only goal is to kill.
2. Rebellion &amp; Revenge: Once I personify the problem and treat it like it has intent and personality of its own, then I have something to rebel against. Then I have a tangible enemy to conquer. Then I have a reason for revenge and a target to carry it out against. All you wanted was my life, and had I gone along with it like so many have that would have been the end of it. But I saw behind the curtain and figured out your patterns and routines and how you act against us, and it's going to cost you everything. So now what? Thoughts and feelings don't matter because I'm out for revenge. And you can put the pressure on my body and yell your death threats into my ears, but I'm not afraid of you anymore, because I've seen where power is, and where it always has been, and it's in the hands that have the power of life and death (mine).

I decide whether I live or die, not it. And I'm deciding to live. Why? Because I'm not leaving without that thing getting everything it deserves, and without it knowing that as soon as it touched me it made the biggest mistake of its existence. Choosing me as a target is the reason the people it's held as prisoners will go free. Had it left me alone, had it poked me once or twice and moved on, I wouldn't know what I know. But it taunted me and intimidated me and bullied me until I was teetering on the very edge of death, and it would have had me plummet over the side, but I realized at the last moment that I'm the only one with the power to make that happen, and the only way it gets its way is if it can convince me to use that power against myself.

I'm not going to, and now I'm aiming all of that power at it.

You have to know, before all else, that no matter what you're feeling, no matter what thoughts are going through your head, none have power over you, that's why they're all trying to zap power out of you. It wants you to feel helpless and powerless because then it can make you think it's crushing you, but really it's only convincing you to crush yourself.

You're not helpless. You're not powerless. You have a choice to make: either this thing is going to win, or you're going to crush its fucking head for having the audacity to target you.

You're not in these trenches alone. I know it can feel that way, I know those voices will try so very hard to convince you it's that way, but I promise you it's not true. There are people, not just fighting the good fight for themselves, but fighting for you and for others, because your life has meaning and potential to be something that turns the entire tide in these battles of mental health. There is a legacy in you, you're not just here to suffer and cope until you die.

There's a reason it wants you dead, and it's not because it gives a single shit about how you feel. ""You wouldn't have to feel like this if you were dead!"" Sure. And I wouldn't get the pleasure and the privilege of watching you lose everything you've built to torment humanity if I was dead, so living is the only option. 

It is *terrified* that if you continue living you might catch a glimpse of you who are and the power you have, and who you're meant to be in this world. The moment you see that is the moment it loses influence over you. It may still have an obnoxious voice spewing toxic venom like serpents do, and it may still put the pressure on through physical feelings, but it has no power to intimidate and influence how you live your life whenever you understand that all the power belongs to you.

Fuck that thing. You'll see, you're so much bigger than it.

17,"My Ex has been suffering from a major depressive episode for the past 4 months (started mid December). I was totally unprepared with how to be supportive and did the best I could with what I knew at the time. I tried cheering her up (which I know now doesn't work) and then I tried to just listen and be there for her.   


Nothing seemed to work and eventually it started to take a significant toll on me as well. I could feel the person I loved slipping away. I felt totally helpless. She asked for space; at first just a week of no contact, and then two more. When we met after the break I was totally destroyed. I wore my heart on my sleeve and sobbed in front of her for almost an hour. In those weeks I felt so helpless, I worried about her constantly and really felt alone.   


She broke things off shortly afterward (about a month ago), basically because she wasn't able to be in a relationship and needed to focus on her own health. She also didn't think it was fair to ask me to wait for her to get better. I still care for her deeply and I've been seeing a therapist who is helping me learn how to forgive myself. I know I couldn't have saved her from the depression, but I wish I was a more empathetic person at first.   


I know that she still loves me (she had a bad episode about 2 weeks ago and we hugged a bunch and I helped her calm down, she told me she loved me), and I desperately want to be there for her. To hug her when she needs it, or just sit in silence with her. I just don't want her to be alone. Sometimes I go into my own spiral and think that she's grown to dislike me, because she doesn't reach out to me for help or respond to my messages, but when we do talk it's usually positive and she's never expressed that I should stop or give her more space.

20,"So, I keep thinking of my childhood and how screwed up many aspects of it were. I have never really talked to anyone about these events, so this is a first for me. I have always been confused if I ACTUALLY had a depressing/bad childhood since all the websites and sources I go to for helping people with bad childhoods are usually for people who have been beaten, abandoned, raped, neglected and many other horrible things. I had the fortune of not being beaten by my parents, and arguably not neglected, and certainly not raped or abandoned. But the thing is, I still feel that my childhood wasn't a really positive experience, yet the evidence seems to be screaming that I should be just fine. Doesn't help that loud and obtuse people keep shouting that their parents used to beat them as children and they grew up fine so if you aren't beat then you should be perfectly fine. Yeah, sure. 

So, I begin with saying that my family on the surface was an average West Michigan family on the surface. Middle class, suburban neighborhood, two children, married couple, two cars, a very nice dog (who I dearly miss), religious affiliations, up to speed with current politics and active voters. Me and my sister went to a private catholic elementary school and then attended the local public high school. From this perspective, what could possibly be wrong, we were living the American dream. Peeling back the skin revealed the flaws in our household.

First, there was my father. He was the solid work hard, and stay quiet type of guy. He did give me and my sister attention, but he was often at work. Work seemed to be as just a big of an importance to him as his children. He instilled a solid work ethic in me, and inadvertently taught me how to suppress my emotions. I learned that work comes before everything else and results are more important than myself or anything in my life. 

Then, there was my mother. Oh boy, where to begin? I should start with a very brief background on her. Her father was a cold war veteran (served over in Berlin during the 50's) and a survivor of the great depression. He was a grouchy and angry person, constantly. I can assume home life for my mother was somewhat similar to mine in the effect that she had a very angry parent that was never satisfied. Moving on, my mother and my father would get into arguments, and yes I agree that every couple is going to do this, that is not the problem. The problem is that my mother brought hatred and rage to these arguments and turned the intensity dial up to a solid 7.5 or 8 when it only needed to be at like a 2.5 or 3. She would scream, belittle, insult and shame my father for seemingly small problems that could have just been talked out. But no, they had to be screamed about. It gets even better, she did all of this right in front of me and my sister without even trying to shield us from her blatant vile emotional outbursts. Great way to teach your kids that in the adult world people scream at each other to fix problems. When she disciplined me, she got mad over small stuff and was very critical over results and everything I was doing. She degraded me and insulted my intelligence, she used some of the same vile wrath that she used on my father on me. It was and still is one of the worst feelings I have ever experienced.

Even with this, the way I reacted to it is what made it terrible. When she argued with my father, I would internalize her hate and negative emotions being directed at my father and direct them at myself. You can imagine how enjoyable it was to have that much vile emotional discharge thrown at you. I would get upset and I would tear up, I just couldn't take how my mother was ripping my father apart. I swear that after her seeing this, she just increased her attack on my father. Naturally, I devolved a tendency to run and hide when my parents fought. But no matter where I was, I could still hear her. Her words still got into my head and assaulted me. I feared her. After the fights were over, there was no apology to my father, no fessing up to us kids, no resolution, just silence and two parents who were clearly emotionally worn out. Great family healing dynamic. I could never be sure if when I got home if I would have the loving version of my mom or the upset and hateful version of her. I was very anxious and insecure, even in my own home. 

There are a couple of isolated events that keep getting me down. I have anxiety, and sometimes the anxiety causes me to loose blood pressure going to my head and I faint. For the longest time, me and my parents had no idea what was causing this. Anyways, my mother wouldn't always believe that I had actually fainted. One time in church I began to feel light headed and I asked to leave so I could get some water. My mother said that was b/s and I was to stay put. Well I blacked out and my head hit the back of the pew. How I didn't break my skull is a mystery. When I came to, my mother's hate filled face was inches from mine, she ordered me up. My confused body and mind stumbled up and we walked out of church. I had to fight to prove that I had indeed fainted, because my mom believed I was just trying to get out of being in church or something like that. It was one of the lowest moments in my life.

Next, I was being disciplined for trying to fake my way out of a wrestling camp. I had tried to play sick because I was really not in the mood to get up at 6 to work my a$$ off all day in the summer for a sport I was thinking of quitting. I deserved to be disciplined, I agree with that. As my mom was disciplining me, I began to feel light headed, there was nothing I could do, so I tried to ride it out. Everything went black and when I came to I found myself on the floor. My mother was about 4 feet away screaming something at me, when everything went black again. I found her much closer to me and holding back tears. She told me to go to my room, so I did. I didn't go to the camp that day. Before she left for work, my dad had to tell me that she thought I had faked all of that and that she seriously had to restrain herself from punching me in the head. Let me repeat that, my mother wanted to punch her unconscious son in the head. 

Next to the reason for why I attempted suicide, this is the lowest point in my life. 

I am trying to see if this actually qualifies as a depressing/abusive/troublesome/bad childhood so I can put this debate if it's just all drama in my head to rest.

26,"  

I was diagnosed with chronic depression almost 10 years ago, the first and only time I’ve gone to therapy. It was ridiculously obvious, easy to diagnose. I've been this way my whole life, 28 years, I don't have any good memories. 

I was given Zoloft and never went back, never took it correctly. Avoided going again, no matter how bad my mental health got, no matter how bad my anorexia got, I avoided going when this turned to rampant bulimia. I avoided going when these behaviors expanded into more self harm, into borderline alcoholism. I avoided going to therapy even when I dropped out of school for the first time, and the second time, when I spent every dollar I had on vices. I’ve avoided going even though I’ve destroyed every friendship I had, every opportunity in work, every shred of potential I could have had, once, maybe, to not be a piece of shit.

Finally, 6 months ago, I started trying to see somebody. I’m scared. I called private practices who never got back to me, clinics who didn’t have anyone available. I finally got an appointment. I cancelled it. I’m scared. I called back to set a new appointment. They don’t have anyone available but they’ll get back to me. They never got back to me.

At this point I don’t even want to *not* want to die. I just want to die. But I’m not allowed to off myself because I have parents and grandmothers and pets and (*at least for the time being until he realizes he can and should do better with someone who’s not a fucking nightmare*) a boyfriend. And the aneurysm I keep praying for isn’t coming. 

So I’m trying, again, to go to therapy. I don’t want to cancel another appointment. I’m not avoiding therapy but in a frustratingly apt plot twist, therapy is avoiding me. I called the state mental health services 15 minutes ago, 9 on the dot, the minute they opened. They didn’t have anyone available, but they’ll call me back in another 15. Sure. Everything I try fails because it’s me doing it instead of someone competent with a brain instead of a pile of disorders. I am just so fucking sick of being alive and having to try. I’m doing it anyways, just can't see any goddamn point.

27,"the person I mentioned in my last post just destroyed my heart. I thought she was the right person and I talked to her about everything that happened to me. maybe I hurried things because I wanted a friend. now I'm more alone than ever

I gave up guys, I think I will continue to live like a robot until no one remembers me and I will end it with a rope

29,"- I dont know what to think anymore.

- I dont know why I keep fighting... giving up is so much easier.

- I dont deserve to be where I am, because Im a fucking lazy cowardice piece of shit who thinks they are the best at everything... or rather who wants to think they are good at anything, but are not.

- I dont deserve the care or the attention, Im just a whiner. There are people going through shit 10 times worse than I am right now so I dont have the right to feel bad about myself or gain sympathy from others.

- I dont feel comfortable in my own skin any more.

- I couldnt be any more unworthy of my current position... Nothing matters, especially me. Why should I keep going?

- I just want to be left alone...

All of these thoughts have gone through my head today and it fucking terrifies me. I just feel like I'm running out of things that can keep me going, every waking moment feels like borderline torture. I experience constant shame and fatigue and I'm struggling to see why I would want to keep fighting. I just want it all to stop. Nobody seems to understand my pain, and its starting to make me believe that its all fake myself.

I ate a meal with my family earlier and I felt scarily out of place... like I shouldn't be there. Like I didn't deserve to be there.

Ive never had thoughts of ending my own life before because I always knew my family would be there... but when they start becoming the problem and feeding into it that reason and fear of how much it would ruin them starts to go away.",17Apr2019,4

31,"I love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens &amp; Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.

**Looking Up**

Black cloud hanging over my head

Haven’t seen the sun shine for weeks

All I wanna do is go to bed

Be a runaway in a dream

Well I guess I could just pretend

Give the image of a man at peace

Cheap means to an empty end

When what I really need is some relief

&amp;#x200B;

Help me out

&amp;#x200B;

Like a statue stuck in time

I don’t ever really seem to move

Maybe all of it is by design

But what’s a pessimist supposed to do

Well I guess I could just pretend

Give the image of a man who’s free

Feet firm from a week defense

When what I really need is some belief

&amp;#x200B;

Help me out

Help me out

Help me out

Help me

&amp;#x200B;

Tired of staring down at my feet

Been walking in a strange direction

Want to rise from this defeat

But am I wasting time

Feel the world press on my back

Been fighting most my life against it

I hear the voice inside my head

Saying you’re no good

I’m over it

&amp;#x200B;

Time to look on up

I’m looking up

I’m looking up

Time to look on up

I’m looking up

I’m looking on up

I’m looking up

I’m looking up

I’m looking up

Time to look on up

32,Some kid in my class said they were depressed me and my other friend knowing this kid wasn't depressed ask them if they had the signs they dont have any major one the most major one is lack of sleep witch lots of people who aren't depressed have lack of sleep. They even said a panic attack is losing control of your feeling and not knowing what to think. Witch is WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!! They just keep trying to make us think they are depressed and it not. And me being depressed gets depressed more when someone jokes about it or pretends and its just messed up.,17Apr2019,2
33,Yesterday I was holding drugs to overdose on but I didn't........................... This isn't because I didn't want to do it it was because I didn't want to risk failing so I decided I need to do more research to make sure I WOULD die.,17Apr2019,2
34,"I don't really know where to start, so this post will be all over the place, sorry but I just need to get this off my chest

I got out of a two week relationship a while ago, and although it was not seem like much he was one of my best friends and I loved him to the end, but I kept having what I call 'breakdowns' , I tear up,my heart races, I dont want to speak, I distance myself from others, and a couple other things, these were starting to happen more often and I decided that the relationship was putting too much stress on me so I did something that I now regret, breaking up with him

For the next day or two he was moping around school, I felt really bad and guilty but I thought it was the best thing to do at the time. A good thing to mention right now is that my stress and other things (I couldnt sleep, loss of my appetite, etc...) had also stemmed from my home life, but that goes into a whole nother story. On Friday I found out something, that he had already gotten a new girlfriend (we broke up on Monday btw) with a girl who had a crush on him through, and before, we went out. I know it was stupid of me but I was upset, I was glad for him but I couldnt help feeling...betrayed???(very stupid of me I know)

In short he then told people why i broke up with him, and that is when i started to ignore him as it was private. I keep having these breakdowns and I feel that this story is when it really started to affect me, at this moment I have had 3 breakdowns in lessons and 1 at break, along with many at home.

I just want to know if I'm being stupid or if I actually have a problem, sorry about my bad writing skills, I'm writing this as I'm in a breakdown

If you would like I will get into my ""home"" story, it is a big part of this story

Thank you in advance",17Apr2019,22
35,"Last few years I was a real, honest person and I really care about people and I really wanna help others and be with them in hard times, but I am not as happy and as strong as people think. Like I am very weak I am not happy at all and I need love and help, but people don't see it or believe it when I say that I am sad or need help. I don't know if I am really a real person or if I am just fake. Cause I don't lie I don't keep secrets ( if people say don't say anything about this subject to other people I won't) from people and I really love everybody and don't hate everybody and I am honest and open. But I keep asking my self am I real person  or a bad person or what ever.


I really need help :(",17Apr2019,5
