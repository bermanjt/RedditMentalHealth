0,"Buckle up because this a one long ass story. Taking the time to read and give me advice would really help me as I am really struggling. I’ve been stuck on this for weeks and can’t get over it.
Note: I have changed names of all those involved


So this starts back in late July 2018. I was having the time of my life, I found my passion wakesurfing and became talented practicing every morning at the crack of dawn with my father. I was hanging out with buddies and going out on my surfing boat nearly every day. (Note: my parents are very fortunate to be where they are and it is a core value of ours to be humble and never flaunt). The days were perfect and the weather was always nice. Things all changed when my beloved grandfather passed away. I felt just absolutely raw emotionally. Words cannot describe how much that man meant to me. (I made a post recently about him if you are interested). I turned to the bottle and became miserable. It was like this for a few days until my long time best friend, Graham, intervened. We both shared a passion for the lake life. We planned to surf on the weekend after my grandfathers funeral. 

That day came and it was a perfect summer day, low 80’s, slightly humid, not a cloud in the sky, no boat traffic, and just a slight breeze, Ideal surfing conditions. Graham brought his girlfriend Opal and their 3rd wheel, May. I invited over my buddy Chris as well. We went and had a blast, I showed the girls how to surf and showed off a bit. We went and got shore lunch and it was perfect. My spirits were lifted. Graham and the girls came over 4-5 times over the rest of the summer. Chris was too much of a flirt and scared the ladies so we just went the four of us. We would surf and surf and surf and surf until finally the sun dipped below the horizon, bouncing pink and orange off the water into our eyes. We always ended up eating pizzas at a local restaurant then we would joyride in my Jeep around town. Sometimes the four of us would watch a movie before the night was over. I fondly remember watching Borat, Graham and I nearly died from laughter, the ladies weren’t as impressed. 

It was around the 3rd time we went out that I realized how much I liked May. She had an infectious smile, beautiful and long blonde hair, big blue eyes, cute voice, a tall, skinny, athletic body, and a cute little butt. We almost looked almost like twins, I have blonde hair, blue eyes, fit athletic build, just a few inches taller than her as well. Our personalities were nearly identical too, we both have a good sense of humor, always joking around, and maybe both just a bit out of control. We really made each other laugh, making humor that only the two of us understood. I was too nervous to make any moves on her as I didn’t want to ruin the perfect quartet we made. I should mention she broke up with her abusive boyfriend a few days before we first met. She was tricked into the relationship and he was using her for sex. Opal told me she was going through hard times just like I was, but that May enjoyed hanging out with us.

It was late August now and Graham went off to college in a week. We planned one last rodeo for the summer. On a beautiful Thursday morning I sat on the boat cleaning it with a rag and a bottle of Windex. The lake was glass and the only other boat on the water was a lonely fisherman casting for Musky. Graham came as I was wiping down the boat and we listened to 70’s tunes waiting for the girls. They showed up about 15 minutes later and we threw the rope. We surfed until our legs gave out from under us, blasting music and laughing until the sun set. The girls took photos for their instagram. Exhausted, we docked and layed on the pool-cover staring up into the stars. Opal and Graham held hands while May and I lay there awkwardly. We took the doors and roof off my Jeep and rode into town with the warm summer air blowing our hair. We got pizzas in our classic spot, and drove to downtown Minneapolis where we were pulled over. Apparently the officer said the music was too loud. I got off the hook on drove off blasting “All Summer Long”. We parked and walked to the Stone Arch Bridge, an old relic of the once proud industry here. The four of us sat on the banks of the Mississippi under the golden lights of the bridge. Crickets, toads, traffic, and sirens all could be faintly heard in the background. Moths kamikazed into the light above as we dipped our feet in the cold water. Ducks ate the bread that the Korean tourists above were throwing down to them. At one point an orange Croc floated by and we tossed rocks at it. It was getting late as we sat there all holding hands. Opal and Graham kissed, I looked over at May, she was looking directly into my eyes. I wrapped my arm around her and kissed her on the forehead. She leaned over on me and placed a kiss on my cheek.

I drove them back to my place where their cars were parked. We gave hugs and they drove off. Graham and I talked a bit, I patted him on the back and he was off to college.

Only a week later and it was J.J. Hill’s Day in the town I lived in. (It's basically an excuse to shoot off a ton of fireworks and have a July 4th 2.0). The girls were in town and called me to pick them up on the docks. I pulled up playing “The Ecstasy of Gold” and they were embarrassed, all as planned. May sat on my lap and we watched the fireworks dance in the sky. I dropped them back off later and they drove home. This was the official end of summer.

School started and life went back to normal for the most part. I shared my first class of the day with Opal. The two of us would walk everyday to meet May in the locker banks. Life was looking up for the most part. Suddenly things changed, everything seemed perfect but I became depressed. I missed my grandpa and again turned on the bottle. Graham wasn’t there to help me and it slowly spiraled out of control. I came to school hungover most days of the week. Opal wasn’t stupid and picked up on this. Our relationship faded, I didn’t walk with her in the halls anymore and stop to talk with May. I eventually opened up to Opal about how down I was. She was supportive but it made things uneasy between us. Opal and I have maybe talked 2-3 times in person since then. Opal must’ve told May when I innitally opened up to her as I got a message from May asking to have a serious conversation with me. I sent May a message but I think she fell asleep and never got back to me. May though did offer advice and helped me get off the booze but it didn’t last long.

Time for homecoming came around and neither May or I had dates. She pestered me about what party I was going to. Looking back on it now it was pretty clear she was trying to get me to ask her to the dance but I was none the wiser. I ended up getting grounded anyway so I wasn’t able to see her at any parties.

Time again passed and I saw May less and less. At football games from my spot in the senior section I would spot May up in the junior section. I’d wave and she’d blow kisses back. Other than that I started to lose my connection with her. I didn’t wave to her in the halls and we seldom texted anymore. She hooked up with another guy who went around telling everyone that he got her pregnant. She was pretty upset and so was I, for different reasons. Weeks went by without conversations, I really was fond of this girl and wanted to bring her back into my scope.

I thought I had a had a great idea that would let me win her back. I asked May if she wanted to go to the Travis Scott concert with me and a friend of her choice. She took up the offer after some contemplation. Opal and May had somewhat of a falling out and I’m still not sure why, so I asked her friend, Laura, to accompany us. The tickets cost me $400 of my own hard earned money I made working as a groundskeeper at a country club over the summer. I was fine paying for it as we were gonna have a blast I thought.

On the night of the concert they carpooled over to my place. We played pool for a bit and then went to go get pizzas, same place from earlier, of course. As we left they took videos of the house and car for their story. This ticked me off as I was brought up to be adamantly opposed to that behavior. I kept my mouth shut and just let it be. We made it to the concert and found our seats. The place absolutely reeked with the smell of pot but we got used to it after a while. May sat on the opposite side of Laura from me and I was a bit confused. The concert was running late as they always do. 45 minutes after the scheduled start Shek Wes came out and performed his only mentionable song Mo Bamba, a song which makes me want to vomit now. He sounded god awful as well but the managed to get the crowd riled up. He got off after performing 2-3 more of his songs that nobody knew the lyrics to. The girls got up telling me they would be right back. 20 minutes later and no sign of them. I sat there alone and scrolled through Instagram. Somebody spilt beer all over somebody just a few couple rows down and they got in a fight. Security arrived and so did the girls, along with a guy. I didn’t know the kid but he was from the high school apparently, Alec was his name. They got hopped back in our seats and we waited for Lil Baby the next performer to take stage. This is when shit suddenly hits the fan for me. May sits down in Alec’s lap and he gropes her. Laura looks at me sort of shocked watching for my reaction. She looked just as surprised as I did. I thought to myself, “Did I really just buy May tickets so she could fuck around with this douche?” Lil Baby preformed and he was better than I had anticipated. We waited again for Travis Scott to perform. It was about an hour long intermission this time. May made us move from the seats that I paid $400 for because “they sucked ass”. I’m really not sure why I didn’t just excuse myself to the bathroom at this point and drove off without them. We weren’t able to find any seats and by that time three 6’4” dudes who hadclearly been drinking took our seats and I was not about to fight them for it. Travis Scott was an amazing even from our spot on the stairs. People in the mosh pit were passing out and the air was hazy with smoke from all the weed. I’ll admit this part was a blast. Alec just stood there while May and I danced. Concert was over and we were all deaf and contact high. Alec had been drinking and needed a ride but I refused to give him one. On the way down the escalator I noticed May was picking up guys numbers. This was the last straw for me but I would resolve it later. May and Laura profusely thanked me once we got back to my place. I stayed up on my phone waiting to make sure they got home safely. Once they were home I flopped on the couch and fell asleep, too tired to walk upstairs to my bed. I woke up to a text from May, she had sent me kissing emojis and told me how much fun she had and that she was so thankful. My dumbass fell for the bait and answered her back with some dumb puppy love. 

She didn’t reply for about a solid week. And when she did she asked if I would take her to the upcoming A$AP Rocky concert. As dumb as I am I saw right through that. I called her out for it and she denied everything. I rang up Opal and explained what had happened. She told me that May was manipulative and I it would be best if I stopped talking to her. That made two of us who had been fucked over by May. I texted May back, tears rolling down my face, explaining the pain she caused me and how much I loved her. She texted some daggers back and I just replied, “fuck you”. And that was that. Sometimes I see her in the hallways talking with her friends, Opal now not one of them. She’ll look over at me but I just don’t have the strength to look back. 

*I don’t want to look into her blue eyes and wonder what could’ve been.*



TL;DR I thought I was mad in love with a girl I really bonded with. We had good times and a real connection with each other. After not seeing her for a long time I brought out all the stops to revive what we once had. Unfortunately I found out who she really was and got used big time.",21Jan2019,1
1,"At this moment i sit at my own home and i cant place my feelings and dont know what to do. 

4 months ago i ended a relationship of 7 years and there is not a day going by that i dont think of her. She didnt make me happy anymore and i had enough of it so i decided to end it for real this time. I’ve ended the relation a couple times before but that was only for 1 day or so. 

While i was in that breakup period i met a woman that makes me feel so good. We now have a relation of 5 weeks.This weekend we talked alot that it doenst work for her if we keep going this way. She is a very independed woman of 28. Never had a serious relation until now. We were litterly every day with eachother and slept together until last week. It was to much for her and told me she need more time for herself. When we sleep together we both dont get a good night rest. We both wake up like 8 times each night what is to much for her. 

We both work in shifts, this week i will work from 00:00 until 08:30 and she is working from 06:00 until 14:30. We decided to take skip seeing eachother this week so she can get some rest but i feel so shit about not seeing her. I came in an empety home and my first thought was. Fuck im alone, what now..

Now i have a relation with her but it brings back bad habbits. 

She smokes now and then some weed and i started smoking weed again after couple years of being clean. My drinking habbit is not a problem i think at this moment. but is way to much, i drink like 50-70 bottles of 0,3cl beer a week. I use the excuse that im just moved out of my parents home and now living in my own new rental appartment. 

I would love to stop drinking and smoking but my friends and everyone around me smokes and drinks heavy. (Except my new gf)

Everything is going well by my own idea but i still feel like shit, im very emotional. And asking myself is this life? Is this now what makes me happy?

2,"Literally writing this from my half hour break in the lunch room. 
I am so sick and tired of working for a company that only seem to care about the staff who are of the same ethnicity. We are working for a company that mainly employs immigrants and the turn over for European employees is very high because they are often alienated by management who are of various other ethnicities. (The manager is Filipino, the other is Indian). It appears that they prefer to have on the floor working, the immigrant staff because they can exploit them and treat them badly, which majority of us Kiwis will not stand to tolerate. I am only qualified to work in this sector though, which is healthcare, and so I am extremely stuck as to what I should actually do. I feel like I am going insane by being not listened to and I strongly feel my race is the reason why.",21Jan2019,1
3,I’m starting to get real tired of always initiating plans in my friend group. It feels as though I put so much time and effort into trying to include them on things while they hardly ever reciprocate. I’ve mentioned to them before I’d appreciate if they invited me to things every now and then but they always give me the same excuse of “ we don’t owe you”.  What should I do? ,21Jan2019,1
4,"Hi guys,

Basics - 
20 y/o female, 5'3 &amp; 97 lbs, graduated high school almost 3 years ago, never went to uni, no goals or dreams in live, no drive to achieve or be successful (other than to stop being a disappointment to my parents), long history of depression/anxiety/existential suicidal ideation, long history of having little-no friends because of having trouble keeping in contact with people or getting myself to go out, off work due to basically having a mental breakdown (but not on EI), no extra money, no car/method of transportation, no internal clock (I tend to be awake for up to 3 days at a time and then sleep for like 14 hours), battling eating disorder, completely aware of coping mechanisms but unable to find the mental strength to keep using them. 

My mind is kind of messy right now, tangled thoughts etc, so I'll do my best to explain this clearly 

I was highly advanced and pretty talented as a kid. Always told I was going places. Problem was I never learned to work hard for things, practice, learn perseverance to improve etc because everything came very easily. So as things got more difficult and other kids started to catch up, I found it more and more difficult to stay ahead, and eventually I fell behind, and then off the map entirely. Overwhelming feeling of being a disappointment and a failure as a result, because I was always the one who was supposed to succeed, shine 
Acting, writing, composing, and singing were my greatest skills. Always thought I would pursue that. But I haven't been able to get myself to sing or write or get on stage in years. Developed stage fright and intense social anxiety after high school. Creative block as well, so strong that my brain basically hurts and 'itches'when I try to write and I end up agitated, distressed, uncomfortable and in tears. 
I used to be sort of a leader in school. no real close friends but friends with everyone type. Now I can't even look people in the eyes when I go out I can barely speak loud enough to be heard. Beyond that, any sort of social engagement with family is so energy-draining that I find myself either snapping at them or avoiding them completely. 
I spend all my time alone in my room. 
I used to watch Netflix or browse the internet with all my time but now I can't even bring myself to do that 
Everything feels annoying. Any show. Any music. Any activity makes me feel agitated, exhausted, exasperated.. my brain ""itches"" until I stop. Like the feeling of restless legs, but in your brain and behind your eyes. Now all I can manage to do is sit on the floor against the wall and stare into space for entire days at a time, OR eating disorder behaviours like Binge/Purging (I'm anorexic subtype B/P)
I was happy for a few years but only as the result of being in a very healthy and happy relationship. I have only ever been able to see a future for myself when I build it around my partners. We broke up in October and it was a blow but I was able to keep myself functional and healthy for a few months. Got a new job... Used my coping skills... thrived. Until suddenly I start having breakdowns at work because I can't push away the desire for nonexistence any more. 
I just don't want to exist 
How do I want to exist 
It is so hard to work through mental illness every day. It is so hard to make yourself use your coping skills so you can keep functioning like people are supposed to function, let alone set normal life goals and work towards them. 
I want to get out of my room and try to do things but my energy is so low and my willpower so little I have no idea how 
Today I woke up and showered for the first time in 5 days, and then I sat down on the floor against the door to my room and haven't moved in 6 hours since 
I wanted to go out today. But I have no money to spend, no method of transportation to get anywhere, some potential for things I could do if I was able to but I live in Canada and it's freezing cold and already dark and public transit will take so long and I might have to eat or drink if I go and god there's so many challenges and I'm the only one who can make myself face them and I know I have the skills but I don't have the willpower or the want enough to actually do it 
I want to die but I could never do that to my family 
But I also don't want to live enough to actually live
Right now I'm just existing 
and I don't want to exist anymore 

there's so much more 
but this is jsut becoming a pity party 
so I'll stop 
but basically 
how to I find the internal drive to get better 
How do I replenish the sheer willpower that kept me going until now 
how do I make myself right when I don't want to s
how do I make myself want to 

done therapy 
done medication 
done hospitalization
done the whole ""drop everything and move to another country in a desperate attempt to change everything and start a new life"" thing 

don't know what to do anymore ",21Jan2019,1
5,"Okay, so I trying to befriend this random guy online but it seemed like he got frustrated and ”attacked me” like, he would steer the topic to how his life sucks/failures then ask me what i think of stalking an ex girlfriend.

I felt kinda nauseous and breaking my pc at that moment... from what just happened, is that a thing? The thing is he didn’t use any malicious words...  ",21Jan2019,1
6,"I'll try to make this as short as possible while giving the required information. I (21F) and my at the time boyfriend (24M) moved from our home state to another so that we could both finish school, undergrad for me, graduate level for him. Before moving, we'd been together 4 years. During the process of moving states his 95 y.o. grandfather passed in July, he took it very hard. We moved in September, things went down hill. He says I wasnt there for him in the way he needed me. He'd leave me alone in our new apartment so that he could go home to be with family for holidays, I couldn't go due to work/school and couldnt understand how that made me sad. We had a HUGE blow out in December, a lot of things were said from both sides and we broke up, we both went back home for the winter break. Now that we're back living in the same apartment and I've had time to rethink my actions, I think that learning from the mistakes and moving onward with a relationship would only make us stronger. Things are going good again, we have fun and are able to do things together again, my feelings are just as they were for him before. When I talk to him about it, he says he cant get back into a relationship with me, but would like to continue doing what were doing to see what happens. Makes sense. The problem is:  he needs me to prove that I've changed, so over this time as I'm maintaining/ builiding feelings and feel as I'm still committed to him, hes just observing. He's free to talk with other women if that arises and investigate that if he wants. I feel that if I stay in the apartment I'm just going to be falsely building something in my head that doesnt exist. Just to wait and see if he wants to be with me or not. He has the best of both worlds, he cant act as if he's single, but has the woman he's living with doing everything she can to be back together with him. What would you do? ",21Jan2019,1
7,"Alright, so I’ve been working out for a while now. Glutes, abs, waist, legs. I’ve managed to reach the equivalent of a hot body (I also thank my genetics).

I’m slim thicc now.

And I really really want to show off my progress!! But, I fear everyone will call me a hoe since it’s so unlike me to show off my body.

To give you a bit of background I’m a stereotypical “good girl.” I don’t engage in bad things, try to look pure, blah blah blah.

So it will be a shock to everyone if I do post these pics but I really want to take hot pics yet I fear the backlash I’ll get from the people I know.

Should I just say F it and post hot pics or just wait for a special guy to share the pics with lol.

8,"I've been seeing her ever 4-6 weeks for the last 4 months. It's glaringly obvious, to me at least, she's at least somewhat interested in me. But being the shy/awkward mess I am, I'm not sure what to do

Here's signs that I'm pretty sure she's into me

* Whenever I enter the barber shop, her eyes light up and she gives me a big smile
* she playfully calls me things like ""big boy"" and ""papi""
* when I compliment her, she gets flustered and turns red
* she asks a bunch of questions about me. All barbers I've had do this so idk

Downside is, she has two kids and I don't know if she's taken.

10,"I was driving home from work, and thought I would take a shortcut, since I work in town B, but live in Town A. 

I was following this winding road that went through farm country, and the ride was good, but I went up a hill, and right on the other side was a cow in the road. I slammed on the brakes, but still hit him enough to put the poor thing in pain. 

I walked to a house that was nearest to me. I knocked on the door, and a farmer answered, I asked if the cows were his, and he said they were. I told him that I ran into a cow on the road, and I just wanted to mention that it might need a vet. The farmer asked for my number, and I gave it to him. 

He asked where this happened, and I pointed to the hill, where my light beams were visible in the low lighting. He got in his vehicle, and I walked back to my car. I finally got to my car, and the farmer was already there, and assessed the situation. He told me there wasn’t anything he could do for the cow, so he went to his truck and pulled out a gun and shot the poor cow, execution style to the head. 

He tells me he’s going to get a “price adjustment” on the cow, and he’s going to call me for money. This feels like highway robbery, I can’t believe someone would be so cruel as to shooting a poor animal and asking for money. Should I call the police?? ",21Jan2019,1

13,"So im 16 and my parents dont like that i smoke which i respect, its not their fault that they werent raised where it was looked positively upon but rather seen as a drug which makes you lazy and crazy etc. They’re rlly stupid and think its like heroin or some shit and said they dont want it in their house. So obviously ive been hiding it but i spent £50 on weed which i ordered and came in the mail and they intercepted it because that day i was busy hitting gym before coming home and flushed it down the toilet. I told my dad he just threw £50 down the toilet and that i was only shipping it to the house so i could give it to someone else to look after (they dont really care if i keep it somewhere else and smoke somewhere else because theyre so stupid and think that they will lose their jobs if i get caught smoking smh so dumb) and so now hes swearing at me telling me hes going to go to the police and stuff, i just want my money back like it was my property which he got rid of therefore he should pay for it. In the past my parents have found my weed when i was bad at hiding it and pretended they never saw it and let me keep it (it was a much larger amount) and my mum is pretty convinced im some dealer ffs. So now im just stuck and dont know what to do, also it was my own mail which they opened up without my permission but whatever. Should i steal their money considering they basically stole mine and also my mum owes me money and so does my dad currently already before this (only like £20 for buying something they told me theyd pay me back for). Now the worst thing is my dad told me he’d rather have me smoke cigs and get drunk often than smoke weed cause its illegal *Lol*",21Jan2019,1
14,"Hey guys! I'm a high school junior from the state of Illinois. 
I am currently looking at colleges and figuring out where I want to apply, and would like some advice. Right now I am looking at colleges in Illinois and AZ. I really like arizona State University. 
A bit of a back story though,
In eighth grade I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I was hospitalized several times and put into a social/emotional special education program.
 Since then, I've been put into a full gen Ed class schedule, and have been getting straight A's, I even run my own business outside of school. I am really worried that my emotional struggles from 8th grade-sophomore year will make colleges not accept me, because of the fact that I couldn't take AP/Honors classes with my emotional instability.

16,"First off, I want to clarify that no one in my family is a racist. We never even mention race and we make sure to treat everyone equal and pass that example on. 

Right now me, her, and the rest of my family were watching music videos with dancing (she likes to dance so she enjoyed watching others do it). We began to watch the music video of “In the Closet” by Michael Jackson featuring Naomi Campbell. We all start saying wow she is so pretty and the like, when my daughter goes “no she’s not”. And starts asking us to change it. When we asked why she goes because she’s dark. 

Obviously we were all shocked and asked “what do you mean? What’s wrong with that?” Keep in mind we live in NJ, which is already very diverse so it’s not like she only sees white People. To her it must of seemed like we all attacked her so she said “fine watch it but I’m gonna sit on the stairs Becuase I don’t want to watch”.

I’m still very baffled about this. I have no clue how this thought came into her head and why she was so strong about it. She’s begun to notice that there is a difference in color between people but she’s never been offensive about it. 

I have no clue how to react. We didn’t make it much of a big deal and we switched the video after (even though she insist we watch it while she was in the other room) and told her it wasn’t nice to say that about anyone (we didn’t bring race into it or even mention it, just say that it was a rude thing to say. She has a tendency to want to rebel and I think if we make it clear what we’re upset about she may continue to act like that just in spite of us, whcih will carry on with her as she ages).

Does anyone have any advice for something like this? ",21Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So, I feel like I am outgrowing my main group of male friends.  There's four of them and I've known them since school for about a good decade now, some even longer, but over the past couple of years or so I've been noticing that they are becoming different people than I am becoming.  I feel like they are becoming bitter about life, as they've fallen into the trap of a 9-5 job, which is something I don't imagine they wanted to do when we were back in school.  Because of this they are becoming cynical and ignorant, unwilling to try out new things and judging other kinds of people they don't interact with.  Some of the dudes are becoming a little racist and sexist, and when I challenge them on some of the dumbass shit they say, they write me off as being a ""bitch"" and say that they're just joking (I'm no SJW btw).  I'm particularly sad about one of them from the group who I used to be super close with, and like me had his eyes set on a particular career, but I think he's given up.  Which is ironic as he helped me when I almost gave up.

I'm on my last year of uni and have my eyes set on doing a placement abroad after graduating, and finally making a career out of what I love.  But as for my mates, they make me feel angry and sad.  They speak as old, cynical men but don't realise they are young and can and should experience new things and people.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am asking for advice on what to do and how to deal with this friendship.  I've got love for all of them, but I've begun to distance myself from them.  I don't want to cut them off, but I feel like a little distance will be good for me.  Anyone been in a similar situation?  What did you guys do?

19,So I'm really into a girl that works with me and she's making it very obvious she's into me too.  My problem is I'm not sure how to get something going with her since we work at Chipotle which has very very little down time and I've never had a real conversation with her since shes a manager and is usually in the back.  I can really tell she's super into me and has given me opportunities to start a conversation but I pretty much bitch out every time (I'm a pussy).  I have no idea whether to try a friendly conversation to get to know her or go right for her snap/number.  Really don't know what to do.,21Jan2019,1

23,"It's a retail gig for during semester. I sometimes work on the weekends but it depends and is spotty. There is a girl that I am really into who I've run into a number of times near my department and we've small talked a couple of times and (bias?) catch stares from each other. It's difficult to talk because of our differing jobs that we usually do day to day and with me going back to school, there wont be many occasions where we may even work the same day. 

Would it be a bad idea to friend her on facebook? (stalker-ish?)

I wan't to get to know her but its somewhat impractical :\\",21Jan2019,1
24,"so I have a friend who’s a compulsive cheater, him and his girlfriend have been together for a few years (we’re in high school), and he’s done stuff with multiple girls while they were together, including losing his virginity to another girl and then having sex with her multiple times, and a couple incidents where he’s kissed me at parties (I feel insanely guilty about it, but more on that later). A few of my friends and I found out that he’d been having sex with this girl (one of our other friends, she eventually left for college as she’s older than us) and we were going to give him the option to tell his girlfriend about it or we were going to tell her. 

Eventually he got word of this plan before it took place and broke up with her without telling her what he had done. Directly after they broke up I had some sort of relationship with him, we were pretty much dating but we never really talked about what it was and kept it a secret from our friends, as I’m kind of known as an innocent little sister to most of them because I’m 1-2 years younger (we’re all in high school, and the boy in question is only a grade above me).

I told myself that it was just for fun, and that I could never actually have a serious relationship with him because he’s not that great of a person and I’d just get hurt in the end, but I ended up developing feelings for him and I didn’t realize this until it was too late.

after a few months of our little thing, he texted me to tell me that he had to end it because he realized that he was still in love with his girlfriend and had to go back to her. He apologized and said that I mean a lot to him, but this is something he had to do. It hurt to read but I knew there was nothing I could say that would stop them from getting back together without ruining our friendship, so I told him it was ok, no hard feelings, and wished him well.

It’s been a few months since they’ve been back together and seeing it hurts a lot. Not only do I feel guilty and anxious around her for doing stuff with her boyfriend, guilt that I admit I deserve, but I just feel genuinely bad because she’s so in love with him and has no idea what he’s done. What if he’s changed? But at the same time that could just be my stupid feelings being jealous.

I don’t know what to do, but thanks for listening. I know that this all sounds like stupid high school drama and that I come across as a terrible person and a flaming whore, I’m just really stuck and I know I can’t keep doing this anymore.",21Jan2019,1

28,"My family is pretty conservative, and i am sure that they would not approve me being in a relationship with someone from a different country that I met through social media. And yet, in about a month, I have planned to visit my s/o, which means, that my parents have to find out about it somehow. How do I break it down to them with as conflict as possible?",21Jan2019,1
29,"To keep things short, I’ve been dealing with severe trust issues for as long as I can remember and I don’t know why. I come from a happy and reasonably stable/supportive family, but since age 10 (if not younger, idk, I don’t remember a lot from my childhood) I haven’t trusted by parents. At that age I was bullied by my best friend for two years (10-12) but I have zero concrete memories of anything majorly upsetting happening and in general struggle to remember most of that time period. Around age 12 I started experiencing dissociative episodes where I felt disconnected from my body/identity. As the years have gone these episodes have seemed to happen less frequently, but I dissociate entirely from my identity every few years. For example: I struggle immensely to connect with/remember my perspective from any events in my life that were more than a year ago. I often can’t understand how I used to behave or what my personality was like more than a year ago, even though I try to remain present in the moment and I have been told for years that I have very good insight into my mindset/motivations. I feel like I’m a different person every couple of years, even though I can point out many consistent personality traits/behaviors that have been present since age 10.

Lately I’ve been feeling even more unsteady and ungrounded in my identity. I don’t trust anyone, even though I have deep relationships with people in my lives. I feel like there’s a physical barrier keeping me from ever being actually vulnerable with the people I love. I’ll tell them about intimate/personal details of my life, but only in ways that require no trust in them. Like, I won’t reach out when I’m feeling extremely depressed, but a few days/weeks/months later I’ll fill them in on what I was feeling and the way I was thinking in that moment. Even when I try to tell people what I’m really feeling or thinking, I twist it at the last second without even trying to so that I’m not truly vulnerable.

I have been trying to overcome this with my current best friend, and this is definitely the most trusting relationship I’ve ever had. But anytime I reveal even the tiniest detail of a vulnerabilty to her, I experience extreme emotional backlash. I isolate myself, become consumed with self-loathing, and obsess over/overanalyse her every interaction with me for weeks. I have only ever managed to share these minute scraps of vulnerability when intoxicated, and I cannot imagine ever doing so sober. I also never actually express my emotions with her (ex. she’s never seen me cry, the few times we’ve fought I’ve avoided any in person confrontration and used text instead, she’s never seen me anxious/depressed). Any time I share something with her I feel dissociated and identity-less for days afterwards.

She’s the only person I’ve managed to get this far with. Despite having a loving relationship with both my parents, and them being very supportive of both my siblings (who go to them for advice), I can’t share anything with them. Despite both my siblings actively reaching out to me with specific questions about my emotional stare, I lie to them when I’m struggling. Despite my other friends sharing all their problems with me and trusting me to help them, I never reciprocate.

I have never dated, because I have no trust in potential partners. Never had sex, because I don’t trust anyone who is interested in me. I struggle to make new friends, because I have no idea how to form a mutual connection with people. I have major control issues regarding my eating habits and self-harm, because I don’t even trust my own body.

I’m just at a loss for what to do or why I’m like this. It’s so hard to believe that two years of forgotten childhood bullying could rattle me this bad, and it doesn’t explain why during that time I never trusted my family enough to tell them what was going on. I constantly yo-yo between obsessing over my childhood, and trying not to think about it at all, because I don’t trust my own mind not to give myself false memories. I don’t even trust that I didn’t purposely make myself mentally ill as a kid for attention, even though I don’t remember trying to do that. I’m driving myself crazier and crazier.

I want to see a psychologist (I’ve been in psychotherapy before for depression and it was very helpful), but I can’t afford one unless I went like once a month, which would be basically useless seeing as it takes me 6-12 sessions just to begin trusting them enough to start talking about these issues, let alone actually be fully open about them. I can’t use a cheaper option like a therapist or counsellor, because I’ve tried that before and they ultimately couldn’t provide much help regarding my dissociation and potential trauma issues as it was beyond the scope of their expertise.

I just feel so stuck. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m so tired of being alone, but trusting doesn’t just feel like something I don’t want to do, it feels like something I fundamentally don’t understand HOW to do. Any advice?

**TL;DR: Can’t afford the therapy I need, can’t get help using the therapy I can afford, can’t trust people but can’t keep living without trusting people. Please give me advice. I’m so lost.**",21Jan2019,1

I dropped out of college in 2013 and got married to an amazing woman. I started working at a company and have been there for the past 5 years and I cannot stand it. I worked my way up and make pretty good money, especially for not having a degree and I feel like if I leave I won’t have the same opportunity. I love my coworkers but my job is draining. I hate sitting in my office everyday, crunching numbers, and sending reports. I HATE IT. But the worst part is I have ZERO idea what I want to “Do with my life”.

33,"She works in a new place.  I told her she needs to not let things like this happen but she's very submissive and I've tried but I can't change that about her.  He's just being classic coworker style creepy.  The kind of creepy guy that doesn't have a lot of access/experience to women so when a charismatic attractive woman is polite to him he can't handle it.  He just does borderline creepy stuff like listen in on her conversations from other rooms then come in and comment on them, say things that kind of hint at some sort of attraction but pretends he was mishearing things, and tries to walk her to her car.  She's gotten pretty good at trying to be too busy to talk or minimize contact but once he gets latched in he tries all sorts of mind games to latch on more to unnecessary conversations and interactions.  He's also like mid-50s.

I want advice on whether or not you guys think I'm wrong for wanting to meet him at his car and tell him not to treat married women the way he does.  That's all I am going to tell him I'm not going to get in any fights with anybody I'm too old for that.  He's a fuckin creep and we don't have time for giving pieces of shit like this the benefit of the doubt in our lives.  I don't care if he's just a lonely guy or whatever.  He needs to learn how to treat members of the opposite sex regardless of his intentions because he makes my wife and a lot of other women at the office uncomfortable as shit but he doesn't ever take things far enough to report him to HR.",21Jan2019,1

I briefly met his boss at a work event before he was laid off where I was introduced as his girlfriend.

Except the last couple times his friend has come over, Alex gets drunk, and starts talking about how much his ex boss loves him and misses him.

My boyfriend is the one who told me about this, so I feel like I shouldn't be concerned, but what should I do about the fact that in addition to her apparently loving my boyfriend, crying at his absence and now wanting to hang out randomly with him, it makes me uncomfortable?

Even my boyfriend feels as though it's weird, but he does want to hear her out in case it's about a job possibility.

45,"Went to Happy Hour with co-workers. Group of 5 women decide to settle which of them is the best dancer, the winner decided by who gets the most applause from the guys.

Of the 5 women, 4 are hot and 1 looks like she plays nose tackle for the Green Bay Packers.

I have a brilliant idea: “I know how to impress the hot chicks! I’ll clap for the ugly chick. The hot chicks will think I’m sweet and sensitive, and they’re all in to that body positivity stuff”

The dance contest starts and I’m giving it up for the ugly one: “You go girl!” “Slay queen!” And every other idiotic platitude I can think of.

After, the hottest chick comes up to me. Yes! It worked!

She tells me next weekend she’s having a little get together at her place, did I want to go. I eagerly accept, already thinking up an excuse to get out of there after I’ve done the Dew.

She looks even happier and says, “Great because (ugly chick’s name) will be there!” I was confused why I would care about that, but continued the conversation. She starts giving me romance tips, things I should do for a chick I like.

At first I was ecstatic, figuring she was just telling me what to do to get her in the sack. But it turned to horror as I realized she was talking about ugly chick!

Stunned, I blurted out, “You think I’m interested in (ugly chick’s name)?!” She said yes, citing my enthusiastic applause. She then quickly turned accusatory, asking if my applause was just to mess with (ugly chick’s name)

Now, normally I would just cut my losses here and walk away. But this chick’s boobs...

So in an effort to appease her, I let her get the idea that I’d be open to the idea of being with (ugly chick’s name). She got more excited, gave me more romantic tips and then reminded me that Valentine’s Day is coming up... Dear God...

So what should I do? I obviously don’t want to be with the ugly chick, but I also don’t want to alienate the hot chick. Help!

55,"Hi Reddit! I'm a 16-year-old female, and today I realized that I hate the way I live, and I want to make it better. I know I've got big problems, and I wanted to know if you have any advice on how to deal with them and move on from there.

1) I have 3 siblings. I share a room with my younger sister, and that's my main point of dislike. There's no way for me to change around rooms, and I've come to terms with that. With that said, my younger sister and I are like fire and ice. We can't agree on anything, and the constant fights are causing me to stress like crazy. Our room is a weird shape too, so the configuration is either a) cramped or b) missing a few key pieces of furniture. I need privacy sometimes, but I don't get it. If anybody has any advice on how to make this part better (I don't even know what to ask to improve), then please comment. :) 

Also (I'm trying to break this up but it's going to be a block of text, I'm sorry.) I know ignoring her is a valid option, but when you share a room with someone 24/7 and you're trying to do homework or go to sleep at a normal time for once and she refuses to, it's kind of a granted that you get angry. (At least for me.)

2) I have a major problem with taking care of myself. I was never taught proper eating habits when I was younger and my parents don't really set any restrictions on eating things. Every time my grandma stays with us (for a few weeks) when I walk into the kitchen, she comments saying something like ""you're eating again?!"" or ""you're going to get fat, you know."" and it just absolutely ruins my self-confidence. I know I'm overweight. (I'm a 180lb 16yo 5'6"") But I don't know how to go about fixing this. I don't have a car, and I don't have my own room to have the privacy to exercise in. My parents make dinner (so I don't have control over eating healthier) and I have no time in the morning to eat breakfast. I'm also reliant on what the school serves for lunch.

This was insanely long, so I'm going to end it here. If you want any clarifications or want me to give you more information, comment and I'll answer you. Thanks, if you answer, and I appreciate you. :)

TLDR: How do I deal with having no privacy and sharing a room with someone younger than me? and What advice do you have on being overweight and getting healthier?",21Jan2019,1

60,"I’m 23 and got a job at a public accounting firm doing auditing work last year right after I graduated. The job itself is good and the money is good, but the further I’ve gotten into it, the more nervous I’ve been getting about the rest of my life.

As time has gone on, I’ve noticed that what I think I really want to do with my life is to entertain people, whether that’s through comedy, video games or just interaction through a different medium. The feeling I get from giving people a good time, laugh or experience is better than anything else that I’ve felt before.

I’m nervous about progressing in my career, because I know the further I go, the quicker time will go by. You also hear stories of people who are successful in the segment of the entertainment industry I’m interested in and about how they started relatively young, most younger than me it seems.

It’s just setting in more for me that the opportunity to do what I feel like I really want to do is slipping by me and that makes me feel really anxious because I’m not sure what to do.

When I think about what I would like, gaining a following on either Twitch or YouTube comes to mind. A big trick in the situation is that I’m also married on top of having this full time job. I haven’t spoken with my wife about this, but I’m also fairly certain that she would be supportive of anything I’d want to try. She’s definitely not the type to drag me down, as long as I was on top of everything, of course.

I’m just really feeling the pressure to do something now, if I want to get into something I could really see myself loving every day.

Any thoughts or pieces of advice for me? Whether it’s about how to get through this feeling or advice on how to start out?

Anything would be appreciated.

62,"First of all i just want to state that  i understand that this is not an urgent issue and other's problems deserve much more attention than my issue and secondly, despite this post being about a single insecurity i have i am certain that everyone (including myself) would describe myself as a confident person so i am certain there are no underlying self-esteem issues. I appreciate any and all comments made just looking for suggestions.

For context, i have always struggled with liking my smile due to my front 4 incisors having gaps and not being straight, also braces weren't medically required because my teeth have never caused issues with eating.

about a year ago i brought up my insecurity to my dentist during a check up, they have always taken care of my teeth with great care and they were super supportive and suggested i try porcelain bonding (temporary sediment) because they could give me the ideal shape i wanted. i had the procedure and fell in love with my smile and my confidence had reached a new peak. Over the course of a year my teeth did eventually get small cracks and unintentional grinding in my sleep was the cause to this (i was aware this would happen eventually and my dentist did warn me). i wasn't upset because i was working so i saved up to do the procedure again, treating it as a 'touch up' or reenforcement so i could keep my 'perfect' smile. 

For the record the procedure although not as costly as veneers, is still quite expensive (£95-£100 per tooth) so i really wanted to get my teeth the way i desired them.

After the procedure my dentist showed me the final results and at first i was very happy as she had me check them with a handheld mirror, when i got home i narcissistically smiled in front of the mirror to check my smile but to my disappointment i could see gaps on the outer edges of my two widest incisors, a gap in between an outer and central incisor and that the front two were not even in length (only by a fraction though nothing deep here). in other words my teeth looked different to how they were and i don't like it. out of the four incisors, the outer two are significantly shorter than the two in the centre, i know aesthetically they should be shorter but they were shorter than what i would consider a suitable length, especially in ratio to the central 2. 

In all honesty i am a little upset that they're not the way i want them, i have a check up with them this week on Thursday and i don't know what to say, i don't want them to charge me more to fix it but at the same time i don't want to a)to insult them and b) have my teeth as they currently are.

Again i just wanna state i am grateful for any and all suggestions as this is not a serious issue in comparison to other people's problems but its something i consider an issue so anything is something.",21Jan2019,1

70,"She has battled cancer since 15 years ago (she's in her 40's now), had multiple surgeries. Lost speech but was able to walk and autonomous.
Everything seemed ok apart obvious scars and being no longer able to talk.
Was monitored twice year with CT scans.

About 1 year ago she started having temporary blood losses events (from inside her mouth/throat, like 1 every 3-4 months, not predictable) that urged us to take her to the hospital, but after a few tests she has always been dismissed since they could find nothing and everything went back as normal.

A few days ago she had another blood loss event which was however larger in duration and blood loss.
Rushed to hospital, was transferred to a larger hospital in the capital, given transfusions and they tried an angiographic procedure to stop her bleeding.
However upon trying to reach her carotids, they found that one artery has been closed from a precious surgery she had and the other one has a narrowing that makes going further in risky and possibly causing an ictus.

Tried to play it safe and choose not to risk an ictus. While in the hospital she had a further bleeding that rushed her in angio and they tried everything they could, I think they closed a few veins but couldn't do much more.
They told me that bleeding area is probably a tumor which has created more blood vessels for itself and that she might have to keep a gauze in her mouth to stop bleeding but that she won't live for long.
Her face is now swollen and can barely open her eyes but she can answer questions with a very faint voice (she had her vocal chords removed years ago so has never been able to speak properly since then).

I am not expert, I know that due to her past and current status she is a difficult patient to perform surgery on, but if there are no metastases wouldn't it be possible, as risky as it may be, to remove the tumor?

Am I too optimistic in expecting this to solve with some world renowned team trying something and saving her?

85,"Prepare, this will be a long post. 

Hello fellow Redditors. Made a throw away for this post because I felt insecure about using my main account. Insecurity will probably be a recurring theme though.

So first off a little background. 
1.5 years ago, started doing my Masters degree, and decided to do an internship abroad. I just came out of a long relationship of 4 years (bad break up) and wanted to get away from it all, but also knew this was good for my resume (abroad experience works allot in my field). So I set in a procedure to do a 6 months internship at a prestigious university in the US (I am from the Netherlands, to clarify). I got an offer from my former professor to do an internship with a college there, working on a cool project. This took a while but after some months I finally got everything in order to leave January 2019 till July. 

Here comes the problem, because when I was setting things in motion, around November 2017, I came across a girl. I knew her from my study, and we found out we had a lot in common. We were first just talking, then things clicked and so started dating. A few weeks later we had our first kiss. Everything went on and on, and we started our relationship. I was insanely happy that it happened but we both knew that I had my internship for 6 months in the future. We decided to carry on (best decision). She is my soulmate, and we have been super happy together ever since. We were together allot, basically everyday, but we both didn’t mind at all. We still did our things separately with friends and what not but just at the end of most days we would be happy sleeping together. 

Fast forward about 10 months, and January was getting closer. We talked about it a lot now but since I already set everything in motion I couldn’t really turn back, as it was still one of the best opportunities in my life. Last few days in December and start of January we were inseparable and very happy together. But then came my flight day off (8 of January) to the US. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing ever but we both knew we would see each other in 2 months (she’ll visit me for a week). 

At first I was fine! Yes it was hard, I missed her and my own place and family, but it was okay. But than after a day or two I became really insecure and sad. I always was (unreasonably) insecure, even when I was still home with her. I trust her 110% and I knew she would be forever faithful to me, but a voice in my head kept saying that she could just leave me whenever she wants. This made me even more insecure and drove me crazy. I talked about it to her and of course she told me she would never do something and be with me forever. Problem is, I really need to talk about my feelings. I need someone to help and listen to me when I’m feeling down. She on the other hand would rather not talk about it because it would remind her how much she missed me. This was and still is very hard because I have to give her space but I can’t really because I want to talk to her. So to sort of replace talking to her I now talk to my friends and family a lot, but this is sometimes really hard because I miss her and talking to her the most.

So we do talk once or twice a day, but it is hard talk. I am sort of pretending that I am fine to help her, but inside I just want to go home and cuddle her. I have enough to do here (made friends, have enough to do for my internship, can walk around and discover etc), so it’s not that I can’t distract myself, but my head just won’t stop thinking. The evenings are fine because then she is asleep and I can’t talk to her and my head can rest because it thinks nothing can happen now, but the mornings are though because I then want to talk to her but she is doing whatever stuff so we can’t really.

Going home is not an option really because I invested so much money in this internship, and would bring my former professor to shame, let alone the place I am now. I know she will come in 7 weeks and I also know I have to give it more time since I am here for only 12 days now, but there are times that I just break down and feel so intense dark/sad that I can’t really think about something else than going back home and be with her. Due to me being insecure, I am sort of a ‘doom thinker’ meaning that I am imagining all sorts of crap which I know is not true (She doesn’t love you, she found someone else, she is happy without you) but I can’ help thinking those thoughts. We talked about it, and she said to just don’t think that and that she’ll love me forever and that I am hers forever, and that helps every time she said that, but a few hours later  after we talked the sadness an insecurity slowly creeps back.

So, I can go into way more details but I think you get the point now. I am out of ideas to set these thoughts out of my mind. Read all sorts of guides online to stop homesickness and the feeling of missing someone. But I still feel so empty and lonely especially when I think about the fact that I have 7 more weeks to go till I see her, and after that week, 4 months till I am finally home and I am just here for 12 days now. I don’t want to count down the days but my head keeps doing just that. I am supposed to enjoy this super cool and adventurous period I am here but my head just keeps thinking bullshit.

Any advice?

89,"So, I have a friend who makes considerably more money than me. They are basically rich. Without provocation, it's not uncommon for them to offer to treat me to lunch or dinner. Great! who wouldn't want to be treated to a meal? 

But whenever  we go out and it's time to pay for the meal she's treating me to, she has always 'forgot her wallet' and will vemno me. She does, later in the day. But, it really really annoys me. Yes, I'm grateful for the meal...I guess...but I didn't expect anything to come out of my account. Let alone the price of going out to eat (even if it's just momentarily). 

This also happens when we go to the store and we are individually buying things. I think what bothers me the most is that she doesn't take her wallet bc she knows someone (me) will use theirs? I don't know, she buys things when I'm not with her so I assume her wallet must exist.

There's also an issue with Postmates. She offered to get food just recently but didn't want to order it - even though it's on her phone - bc she 'always does it""? Again, she offered to make/order dinner. I come over. And she doesn't 'feel like pulling up the app""? 

So I download the app, order the food, and she vemno's me the money to cover the food. But, she didn't give me the money for delivery or tax (which is a bitch on postmates). Not wanting to seem ungrateful, I covered the tax and am basically out 15 dollars for a 'meal' that was to be provided.

This is too much for my anxiety. What should I do? I usually like my friend and don't want to stop hanging out. But, I also know addressing this head on will, with our personalities, lead to a fight. Should I just stop accepting food offers or going to the store with her? ",21Jan2019,1

I am in a normal university (a private one) and not the best one in my third world country, when i was 18 i didn't had the control of my life (i was dealing with suicide thoughts and a really high chronic anxiety) and by that time, my family told me i had to choose something, so i went for biochem and the privates one don't have a exam to get in.

would i even be able to achieve something? i don't even want to talk to people who are my friends and that are in better universities, it just makes me sad. (i just feel like they probably think i am not smart, simply dumb)

My fellow friends in my class don't feel this way, yes...they are aware that there is a better university but they ignore that fact and they still going, they want a job and i do too but sometimes i wish i just had the chance at the time to control my life.

93,"I have someone in my life that I really am quite fond of and I'm not sure if he feels the same - or if he's not in a state to feel the same.

He seems to be pretty depressed. Deleting social media off/on for long period of times, cancelling plans, smoking/drinking alone in his room more often, inserting sad things here and there. I've asked dozens of times if he wants to talk, and he doesn't.

I'm to the point where I'm emotionally frustrated myself, I care, but I'm tired of caring to the extent that I do. I care too much.

I wanted to move on so I started distancing myself, which he has caught onto and has been messaging me more often then he used to about stupid things. I'm now reconsidering my distancing efforts because I don't want him to have one less person to reach out to if/when he wants to. But I also want to move on from this if it isn't going to flourish to anything. 

Am I an asshole for trying to distance myself from a depressed person for my own sanity?",21Jan2019,1
94,"These last couple months my depression has really flared up, to the point where it’s a hassle to even shower, or get out of bed. Work is extremely difficult for me (mentally) and I’m always exhausted after only a 4 hour day, two days a week (Monday and Thursday, we don’t work on Fridays.) I also do online school, and I’ve fallen behind schedule due to my depression and being tired all the time. I take medication, and I go to a therapist, but it’s never enough for me. Whenever I go to talk, it’s just mundane conversation that isn’t even about what I’m feeling. Typing it out is different, and easier, but explaining how I feel is hard. I’m fifteen and I feel like my teenage years are being wasted away by work and school. I know it’s normal to get a job at sixteen, but I basically have no social life apart from my adult colleagues at work and my online friends. I’ve tried to tell a family member about how I’m feeling, but she always acts mad and blows me off when I try to talk, so I don’t attempt anymore. My worst fear is coming off as lazy, especially since my aunt is the one who hooked me up with the job in the first place. I know it’s important to talk care of yourself first, but I don’t want to quit my job because I know teens would kill for my job, and my boss pays me $40 voluntarily every two weeks. (That’s my only form of payment, besides my aunt giving me $50 per month as allowance for doing chores.) I know I have to work to pay for my dog’s needs, but I mentally feel like I can’t do it anymore. I’m at a breaking point and my insomnia is very bad, and I don’t get much sleep anymore. I’m very unstable, and I’ll cry at the most spontaneous times, and depression hits me out of nowhere. My acne is horrible due to me being stressed, I’ve gained weight from stress eating, and I’m very unhappy with my life and myself as a person. I always feel bad bringing up how I feel, especially since I know people have it worse off then me. I’m very sorry for the wall of text, but I’m hoping somebody will read this and give me some advice. Thank you for your time. ",21Jan2019,1
95,So I've been with this girl since I was 19. 3 months in our relationship she got pregnant.  We were together until last year when she started her tricks. I tried my best to make her happy and out child. The mother went to school . I would driver to school while also taking care of our child. 2 months before she graduated she tells me about this new male friend she has. Says nothing happend but would send me pics of him and talk about him. The day before her graduation she tells me she did sleep with him and 2 other guys while I was watching out daughter. Then the next day says she was just kidding and that nothing happened . So I take her word then right before July 4th she tells me she did suck that guys dick . Then ignores me for months and says if I want to know what happened ask him. I did he confirmed and when I told her she said she lied and told him to lie to me too. Then ignore me again even though we have a child. She recently tried talking to me about out daughter and acts like she did nothing wrong or didn't hurt me at all. Says I have to move on yet this was the women I wanted to marry . Couldn't even talk to me in person. Says she did all that so she could get rid of me like I'm some kind of disease when I'll ever did was help her and try to make her happy the best I could with all my heart. Now months later I still don't know if the story or true and she has now for sure boned other people while I'm alone missing her. ,21Jan2019,1
96,"When asked on my stance on things, I have this constant conflict of saying what I think vs. looking like a jerk to another person. This makes me either retreat and cry, well up on the spot, or just burst out. I can't seem to control it.

Even when taking advice from people or arguing for my side, I feel like I want to cry. It's not a little feeling; it overwhelms me. I feel like a stray dog—any advancement toward me that I deem provocative puts me in a state of emotional high

We have tried helping him but he just keeps going back to being incredibly annoying and it is taking a huge toll on all of us.

98,"I'm a busy freelance musician and have an ensemble that's been together for ten years now.  It is our main creative project.  We perform up to six times a year.  One core member had a brain injury and a child in a short period of time and in the last year has slowly been able to start playing again.  We had been very accommodating and often gave rides or brought rehearsals to her place.  We consider her a friend, though not a very close one.    


However, I feel that she has been asking too much.  She lives quite far from everyone.  For every service, whether rehearsal, recording session, or performance, she asks if she can bring her son (who is four) or she often can't make it because she can't find childcare or isn't willing to pay for transportation (she doesn't drive).     I feel that she is playing the victim a little bit and that there is a tinge of passive aggression.  I empathize with parents, but her inability to work has hindered our efficiency and pushed back our demo release for months at a time because she can't record her parts or come to rehearsals.  I also don't like her making a point of needing to find rides and childcare or asking us to come to her place.  I feel that her child and her not knowing how to drive should not be on us.    


She is as invested as the next member in our group and comes up with great ideas.  However, the logistics are tricky and I am getting impatient.

100,"Quite the long story, but don’t even know what to do at this point. 

August of last year, an online friend of mine helped move me across the country to get away from my abusive family. I have no car, no license, no job, and was ready to give up. I packed all my things (and pet hedgehog) and moved to Nashville, away from everyone I’ve ever known. 

A few months went by from living at his mother’s house (he has promised to get an apartment as I have poor credit from hospital bills) but it is now been 6 months and we are still at his mothers. 

He has become extremely manipulative and abusive. 

He refused to let me leave the house, so no friends/work. He constantly commands that I be his sex slave, and I’ve told him no now over 15 times. He has threatened to rape me, to kill himself, to kick me onto the street. He has told me that my exsistence is a burden, that he has done so much (he has, and I’ve always been thankful up to this point) but I never do anything in return (I do his dishes, his laundry, I cook for him and clean his house once a week). 

I have been trapped in my room with the doors locked constantly for the last 2 weeks. He only talks to me to try and ask me to “be his slave” or to threaten to hurt me or kill himself. 

I have 500$ in emergency money, but not much else. I’m probably going to rehome my Hedgehog, but I don’t know what to do. He refuses to help me leave and instead berates me. He is delusionally abusive, and I no longer feel safe. 

The only options I can think of are contacting his family for help, but they are very banging of him and I think that contacting the police would also end up in me being homeless. 

What do I do? I’m staying to give up hope. ",21Jan2019,1

I didn’t say anything to him at the moment but now it got me thinking, why he singled only me out? Is it discrimination?",21Jan2019,1
102,"I feel like I’m a sponge and everyone’s emotions soak into me; Anyone I come into contact with at work, my personal relationships, and family. I’ve always been like this. I get sad, worried and anxious when other people are feeling anger, distress, or any negative emotion really. I had a lot of emotional issues as a teen. In and out if counseling for the past six years. Yada yada. Made it out okay though I think. Life is a process, but I think I’m doing okay.  Counseling helped me manage my emotions and taught me positive coping skills. My dad helped me a lot too during this time, sort of mentored me. Without him I don’t know where I’d be, but I have now had to learn to live without him. 

My family dynamic is a little screwed up, but that’s a long story. We all love each other, but we’ve all hurt each other and dad died a little over a year ago now. It was sudden and hard on everyone in the family. It strained relationships and really showed how horrible family love can be when bad things happen. One sister is an over achiever, very goals and money oriented. One sister is extremely level headed and generous. And our brother is a good brother, except when he has a meltdown and goes back to old habits. They’re all older than me, married, and they have a different mom than me. We grew up in the sand house, things were mostly normal. 

Throughout this past year my brother hurt me deeply, but we hVe made amends. My sister also hurt me but all I can do is move on. My mother hurt me, and though we didn’t have a good relationship to begin with, I do love her and made amends with her. I was very lost for a while, went to counseling again and also started meds. Things got soooo much better, but I’m still finding I can be over emotional and really affected by certain things. 

I’m 21, I’m going back to college soon. Only part time though because I also have a good job. My life is going okay. I rent a small house on some land with my boyfriend. I have fun hobbies that I enjoy. I have lots of pets. I like my job, my coworkers and where my career is headed. My relationships are going okay right now. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I love him.  I have plans for my future and work to achieve them. 

I had a few bad romantic ventures in the past, but who hasn’t? Now I’m very happy in my relationship. 

Life as a young adult is complicated, but I am happy. 

Then sometimes I’m not and it tends to be the more I’m around people when they’re upset, the more off my emotions become. 

Like if my boyfriend comes home grumpy from work frequently throughout the week, I tend to focus more on negative things as well. I take  his emotions and I somehow assume some responsibility or connection to them. He can be a positive person, but he can also fixate in bad things, expect the worst in situations. And then I step up and reassure, comfort, or create balance for him. I like being that person for him. And he has been that person for me, but I am much more emotional than him, while less vocal about it. When I am depressed I tend to let things go. I lay around. I sleep. I listen to music. I mope, but I’m not vocal about it. When I am vocal it goes one of two ways: I cry hysterically but no words come out, or I have a completely lucid conversation and solve all my problems and feel so much better. Usually it’s a fifty fifty shot. 
During my dark times after dad died, my bf was really good about being there for me. He still is, but also since I’ve been on antidepressants I need his support a little less. 
When he is down he mopes sometimes, gets angry at everything sometimes, neeeds space sometimes, needs comfort sometimes, sleeps for days sometimes, can’t sleep at all sometimes. It’s a lot different than how i react to things. I’m not saying that’s it bad, but it does effect me negatively when it can be so hard to help him. 


If my mom decides to bring up something from the past, with anger or regret; not even directed at me, I will still consume my thoughts for hours, maybe even days. I have similar feels about her emotions. Every time I go to see her I’m anxious about the mood she’s going to be in. She’s not afraid to cause a scene even in public. I met her at a bar a couple months ago and she started an argument with me about her cheating on my dad when I was 16. It was ridiculous. She’s very unpredictable. Always has been. 

Sometimes I find it hard to be around my siblings because of the hurtful memories I associate with them. I love them. But I spent so much time with them over the past year, a lot if that time was going through dads things, not good times. I enjoy their company now, but then afterwards I think a lot about the past. This happens less and less now, but still sometimes. 

Even if I have a particularly trying day at work I can feel overwhelmed when I get home and try to wind down. I love my job, I love helping people, but I do deal with a lot of people on the daily.

I feel like I’m a social introvert when it comes to my personal relationships. I love people and I get along well with positive humans. Not everyone can be positive all the time, but some people just have a knack for it. 

It’s not like I don’t ever want anyone to be vulnerable, sad, or upset around me. Comforting people brings me comfort, but sometime I can’t be that person. Sometimes the strain just throws me off. 

My life is good. I love the people in it. I am doing very well really, but I just can’t seem to master the art of being emotionally strong. 

Any advice? I know I could go to counseling again and I’m sure it would help but I don’t want to go back at the moment. I’ve heard and learned in therapy, enough so that I should be able to handle this. 

Thanks!

104,"So here goes, and I’ll try to shorten it the best I can. Currently my sister has a foreign exchange student (I’ll call her E) from Thailand that is having a rough go of it. When she first came over she was placed with a family that treated her rotten as a whole. My sister had met her thru her daughter I believe and liked her so much she took her into her home. That’s been for several months now and everyone in my immediate family really enjoys E. She is a huge sweetheart and is very kind and caring to everyone she meets. My sister has 2 daughters herself that are 17 and 14. I know there is a ton of bickering at my sisters and the 14 year old has some issues that she is being tested for. I believe she is somewhere on the autism spectrum from some of her behavior and has been taken off of an antidepressant for them testing her. This of course has made her mood worse and my sister said that since E has moved in it has made the 14 yr olds behavior worse. Without going into too much detail I could see how that is because she doesn’t get enough attention at home. In the process E has had her boyfriend break up with her and is missing home a lot. 

My sister spoke to me about taking E in if things get approved and I said yes. My sister already spoke with one of the people in charge and they just need to clear it with their superior, but my sister said to plan on it being a go. My only worries are that honestly idk what I’m doing in that regard. I have no children of my own (though I spend a lot of time with my nieces and nephew). I also don’t want E to think any of this is her fault. I worry about that since she started in one home and moved and would be doing it again. If I have her move here I just want her to be able to have a great experience and be as happy as possible. I know my sister will try to help, but her and I don’t exactly see eye to eye on different things. 

E is 16 yrs old and her birthday is coming up soon. I thought about trying to have a birthday party for her but idk what to do. I know she has had a hard time making friends at school as well and has mostly just hung out with foreign exchange students. 

If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

124,"I had met a girl in my C++ class that eventually I fell in love with. I knew going into it that she talked to this man that was 8 years older than her, her being 16 now and him 24, that would regularly get into arguments and she'd be down and, at the beginning, would always go to me (keep in mind he is online and im irl, even though they plan to meet this year).   


Me being who I am was very lonely when I was younger. I didn't make friends and I was the kid that was made fun of. I tend to be very clingy when it comes to people such as this person. Our relationship built from barely talking to talking and calling everyday. I should add that these two are on a call 24/7. In the past I believe this girl even made sure she could track the guy's phone so that she would know where he is (she's yandere). The only times she seemed to call me were when he was away or asleep, which he was for most of the day because the guy does nothing and hasnt even gone to college, and when he'd come back she would instantly hang up.  


Some background info on the 24 year old: He's a 24 year old who still lives in his parents house. He bought a junkyard car that his dad was going to fix up so he'd have a car. No college degree and no intention to go to college. He is bipolar, and depressed, which this girl has as well.  


As a side note: She likes him for his interests in Japan, anime, persona, and collecting figures. She likes me for my personality since I dont say, ""what are you, dumb?"" when she misses a step for setting DS4 windows up.  


They met when this girl was being abused by her mother. Randomly hit and mentally tortured. I even remember a story that she told me that for every minute she'd cry her mother would make her sit 1 hour in front of a blank gray dot tv. At the time, im sure anything would've been better than no one, but she seemed to attach to him like nothing else. Twice he has made her suicidal and she tells me she's constantly fearful that he will leave her.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have is I can't let go. Our relationship, although we weren't dating I say relationship in general, went downhill when I began to have negative thoughts when she left me alone. I'd tell her I feel like im being ignored and that she was with the other guy doing stuff, and ill admit maybe that was radical. I had hoped I would've stolen her from him and treated her better. Ever since she didnt like me as much ive told her 4 times I was going to leave and I stayed away, for about 24 hours, then I went back. Life is dull without her. I dont have any problems, but it all seems pointless without her. Nowadays I keep telling myself to shut up and just be positive for her so that she will eventually come back to me, but it's not working. In the current state of things im just simply waiting dully for her to come back while she's busy doing god knows what. Her friend got her into weed, which, when presented with acid she does that now. She has depression and her therapist isn't helping. She tells me she always feels empty, but won't ever expand and talk to me about her feelings. I have no clue what to do. I'm stuck on her and sometimes I have suicidal thoughts because I can't feel good without her. Hell, now im doing weed, only have done 3 times, just to get her attention. Weed honestly only makes me laugh a bit really, but she usually wants to see me if im high, but she's been too busy with him to anymore. Any thoughts on what I should do?",21Jan2019,1

126,"In my experience not enough people understand the importance of talking about your own achievements - even if you don't consider them to be achievements worth ""bragging"" about. It's not ""bragging"" nor is it arrogant; it's simply advertising your worth, and your supervisor will be more than happy to sing your praises to the powers that be, because they're able to claim credit as being partially responsible for it as your lead/supervisor/manager.

I see too many self-congratulating asshats get promoted/increased salaries because they do this frequently, while quiet little achievers who are more effective than aforementioned asshats get no recognition because they're humble.

Take off the humble hat every now and then, it'll do wonders for your wallet.",21Jan2019,1
127,"I have depression, maybe bipolar, anxiety and deeply low self esteem. I was abused/neglected growing up and my family is poor. I'm working little by little to improve my life, I'm in therapy and take pills and I'm still in college. On one hand I feel like a strong and independent person yet too weak-willed to make anything of myself and my big dreams. I feel afraid and like I have no real power to make my life happy. I really don't know why.

I've been fired before from jobs I've had. I take responsibility for behavior that was irresponsible. After I graduate I'm terrified to work a 'real' job if I can even get one, and instead living destitute or being homeless and miserable in a city I can't afford or living at home working minimum wage forever. This is a really deep fear of mine. I keep thinking I'm actually just entitled, that's my problem, and don't want to work. Maybe that's partly true but also kind of an absurd idea considering I work normal jobs and I do work hard. I think im just terrified and confused because I'm afraid of assuming so much more responsibility than a retail or food job. I constantly feel like I should be doing 'more' and utilizing my time better but I'm still frozen.

Can someone help me make sense of these nagging thoughts and feelings? I really don't know what to do or how to get myself going. I feel like this has a lot to do with trauma, could it be self sabotage as well? How can I change my perspective on work to see it as a good thing that I WANT to work toward and take action for? My self esteem is deeply flawed so that's a constant battle.

129,"First time on this sub so if this a cliched question I'm sorry.

My best friend, lets call him Ryan, is in love with me, and to top it off he's my boyfriend's best friend as well. Ryan reassures me that he doesn't let his feelings affect our friendship, and I will never have anything to worry about. Of course, I still do or else I wouldn't be here.

The thing is, I've been with my boyfriend upwards of five years now, and met Ryan through him about two years in. I feel like I lead him on in the beginning, and maybe I did it on purpose. I liked the feeling of being liked, but then it got to be too much and I cut him off for a year. We've been talking, but I know he still has very strong feelings and I feel guilty for talking to him. Like I'm microcheating, or that I'm still giving him hope. I really love him as a friend, and he doesn't cross any lines anymore. I don't know what to do. 

I get that is ultimately up to me of course, but I was just looking for any hot takes or similar experiences. I've only ever dated/slept with my current boyfriend so I'm sort of new to a lot of things like this.

134,"This is going to be kinda a long story and I honestly was not sure what kind of questions I should be asking as I feel I have so many. I am a lady in my early 20s that is not sure what to do with my life. Now I am aware that most young people do not know what to do with their life. The thing is I can not help but feel stuck or trapped in my own life. 

I have been in a depression since I was about ten years old. The depression has been lifted once in a while but only for a short period of time at a time. I may get at most two to three months out of the year of mental peace before those negative thoughts and feelings swallow me up again.
I suffer from vivid nightmares. I cry a lot in my sleep silently. I used to have a lot of trouble taking care of myself especially during my freshman and sophomore year of high school. I used to not brush my hair for a couple of months at a time, shower maybe once or twice a week, and forgot to brush my teeth a lot. I can force myself to do all these normal everyday things now but I still feel the same.

I came to the realization of what I wanted to do with my life today. Things have just started to make sense all simultaneously. I was hanging out with my friends for the weekend and everything was same as usual. We sat around playing video games and D&amp;D. I felt like I was in a bubble. It was like everything was muffled and lacking color. Monotone and monochrome. 
When it came time for me to be brought back home I was sitting in the backseat and my friend asked me if I wanted to listen to some music.
The internet has not been so great at the current place i lived at and I had to cancel my spotify subscription for not having any money. I have not really sat and listened to music for about three months so I was really happy to just sit and listen and actually have a choice of what I wanted to listen to. The weirdest thing happened.
I started to feel peace.
My mind was not screaming at me anymore. I can hear clearly and I started to see color again.

During that thirty minute car ride I started having flashbacks. Repressed bittersweet memories. How my curiosity hurt me so much but introduced me to the thing I loved the most.

*TRIGGER WARNING* ( This first memory mentions sexual abuse)
When I was no more than ten years old I met a man way older than I was. He lived very close by so I walked over to say hi once in a while. He had a pink electric guitar that I picked up, played, and practiced. I was so naive at the time. After some time he started to expect weird things from me in exchange for this musical knowledge. One day things went to far and I wanted out and..... well you get the point. 
After it was over life got significantly harder for me. I started getting picked on in church by all the other kids for it.  I was getting bullied at school. Life just kinda sucked.

When I was about eleven or twelve years I did a lot of research on music and played it out loud over the computer speakers. I listened to a lot of Megadeth, King Diamond, and Black Sabbath, etc.
A lot of the classics.
One day I leave to walk around the motel to find something to do and one of my neighbors hands me a mix CD with Morbid Angel scribbled on it with sharpie. He tells me I got good taste and leaves me on my way. I guess he was able to hear me in my room.
I thanked him and shuffled back into my cave. That CD was one of the best things I listened to in a while. (I remember I kept it for years until it stopped working). From that day foward I started expanding my genres. Started from heavy metal and now I was starting to get into death metal.

When I was twelve years old I got my first guitar. I remembered asking Santa for a guitar for Christmas three years in a row. I was so happy when I recieved one. When I was holding it I felt peace.

After a bit my parents wanted me to play it less. They did not like how noisey I was. So I practiced outside. I started bringing it to school with me to practice more. Got picked on a lot for not being good but I did not care as I was learning my chords and scales at the time. There is no getting good overnight after all.
I remembered playing at the school talent show at the end of that year and getting compliments from teachers saying how much better I got quickly. I played a little Black Sabbath medley as I did not know full songs yet.

After that I played to myself for a while. I did not want to play in public or for anyone to hear me. I bought headphones to plug into my amp. I wanted to get good at it first before playing for people again. 

Senior year of high school came around and I decided to play for a school project. Each person or group did their project. There was applause and talking in the audience for each person or group. Normal reactions.
I came on to the stage solo and started to play. The entire audience went silent as soon as I started to sing. There was whispers. People started taking their phones out and started recording me. I had a panic attack before I could finish the song. I got a completely different reaction than everyone else. 
I did not have any friends at the time so I did not speak to anyone for the rest of the year.

I still played quietly to myself as to not draw attention. I remember studying music theory and dreamed of going to college for music. ( even though I can never afford it)

I played until my home burned down and I lost my guitars. That was over two years ago.


These memories started flowing into my head all at once. I felt more emotion in that moment than I have in my entire life.



Now I am trying to figure out where to go from here. If it was up to me I would move tomorrow to where there is a music scene, buy a guitar, and start writing. It is not that easy though. My parents never taught me how to drive, I have no money (currently working on getting a job.), and also my boyfriend of half a decade. How do I tell him? What do I even tell him? He saw the guitars in my room but has never heard me play. I pretended I was not even interested around him. It is going to sound crazy considering how well I hid it. Ever since I have been in a relationship with him I followed him blindly. I really care about this person but he has only seen me in my depression. What if he meets the real me and winds up not liking me. Real me and depressed me have completely different personalities. 

Where do I even begin?
What should I do?

If you need more details I will answer questions and such. Thank you guys for listening.

135,"Long story short for context, I ran away from home as a teen and went to live with two childhood friends of mine. They're both older than me and I've always seen them as my big brothers. I still live with them today and we're all really close.

The thing is, they have problems of their own. They argue a lot about their own parents and family drama and I always feel so helpless about what to do. I love them both so much and I want to help, but I don't want to butt in where I don't belong. I'm years younger, only met their family a few times as a kid, and I feel like trying to get involved would make them mad. But at the same time I feel awful for not doing anything because it just makes me focus on how they're not REALLY my brothers and that I'm just some kid they took pity on years ago.

I know if I told them this they'd try to assure me that I really am their sister where it matters, that they love me and all that. But deep down it really hurts and I feel left out sometimes, like I'm living a lie and they'd be better off without me. I wonder if I'm wasting my time looking up to them when I'm kinda irrelevant in the long run.

It's not like I could go home to my parents at this point and I don't think my heart could take it if I left my brothers now. But I can't stop worrying and feeling like an outsider, and every time they talk about their family it's just a big reminder that I don't really belong. I don't know how to stop these insecurities. 

Sorry this was long. I've never opened up about this before.",21Jan2019,1

Im interested in anything that would apply so any suggestions are welcome. I was initially thinking of becoming a police officer and working my way up the ranks but i understand my degree isnt exactly tailored to that profession, but could be useful.",21Jan2019,1
137,"I am a pretty simple person. I don't feel complex emotions and most of the time I am usually just a neutral guy. I am never happy nor am I ever sad. I am not lonely or depressed, actually I don't remember the last time I've yearned for social interaction. I don't really have a desire for physical possessions and find it hard to be sentimental with objects such as gifts from family, etc. I am very self aware of my narcissistic personality, I will openly admit I do feel as if I am operating at a higher level of existence than most people in my life. I feel smarter, faster and stronger than the average Joe I meet on the street.

I have very few desires in my life but there are some things that I crave for. I am obsessed with control. I need every thing in my life to go exactly as I planned it or I start to slip. I need to the people in my life to follow my plans as well. I need every object in a room in the exact place it belongs, and I need everything from general appearance to the rotation of the remote control on my night stand to be perfect. The title states that I feel a few more things than what I have listed and I will now explain. 

Generally, I am tame and elaborate in the way I think. But other times, increasingly more over the years, I get this strange and powerful anger inside me. I become angry at everything and everyone for simply existing on the same planet as me. I often refer to people in my head as bugs that need to be squashed when I am angered. Stains that should be erased if you will. I remember when these feelings arose as well, it was my second year of middle school (7th grade), that my rage for everyone around me began. For the beginning of that period I chalked it up to hormones developing my body to make me feel the angst and edge that is so common in teens. I told myself that then and I continued to till I reached the end of my middle school career. The anger I strongly felt had partnered feelings that began to accompany it. I have always believed that the people who angered me should die, that they have no right to exist, but I found that I started to feel like I should take matters into my own hands. I figured that no one else would clear the floor of these cretins that surrounded me so I might as well. I remember openly discussing my desire to murder someone with some of my peers in class, attempting to relate to someone (not the brightest move I am aware) but I was always met with disgust and became that, ""weird kid."" 

I realized that no one in this world would accept me for who I am so began to hide. Once I got to high school, I started to copy what the popular kids did to an extent. I got the shoes that all the kids were wearing I got the popular branded clothing and I even made disruptions in class to crack stupid and immature remarks that my peers loved. By the end of my freshmen year in high school I was quite popular and no one was the wiser. I have been keeping up this facade since.

Currently, I am a sophomore in my local community college and pursuing an associates in Biological Sciences. My life seems average from the outside. I have a day job, great grades, working and getting my first apartment, and I even managed to persuade a girl to become my girlfriend. Now while I don't have any real feelings for her (in fact she is quite annoying and I've come to loathe her), I continue to date her because I figured she will tell her friends how nice I am to her and how our relationship is great, posting pictures of us on her many social media platforms. I picked her out because she was quite popular at my high school and I figured if she could convey the image that I am a loving boyfriend to many people, that could do nothing but benefit me. 

I am getting closer and closer everyday to slipping and taking matters in my own hands. Cleaning the world of stains. I have killed multiple animals and at one point even stole my neighbors cat for my vices. I will admit I enjoy the feeling. But I understand that with modern forensic technology the odds of committing a murder and getting away with it are extremely slim. I need to know how to get rid of my desire for death. Every day I feel these violent shakes through my body and the overwhelming need to find someone and do what I want to them gets stronger and stronger since those simpler days in middle school. I cannot go to prison. I have worked too hard to build a believable life for myself to be outed to everyone. I need to get this under wraps. I hate to ask for help but, please help.",21Jan2019,1

143,"Basically, me and this girl became somewhat romantically involved over the last semester. She's the hottest girl I've ever seen and mega-rich (I'm not). Girls approach me a lot so I think I'm pretty good looking, but she's so gorgeous it's unbelievable. Way out of my league. Long story short, she told me one day that she liked me. We became close and you know the rest. We'd always say ""I love you"" to each other, she'd randomly text me at like 1am saying that she misses me, all that other shit. At one point, she basically asked me to date her through text, but never brought it up again. 

It was always hard to see each other with our schedules and the fact that she lives pretty far and I don't have my own car. One day, she told me that if I lived closer to her, we'd be dating. That crushed me, but I sorta knew that this is how it was gonna be already so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. 

We somehow became even closer over the next month, and I fell in love with her more and more. We'd talk about everything and anything, including our futures with other people (dating, marriage, etc.). At this point, it's pretty clear that we aren't dating or exclusive or anything, which sucked for me, but whatever. I'd come to terms with the fact that I'd lose her eventually.  

However, I got a drunk call last week with her asking if I loved her, telling me that I cheated on her because I hooked up with some girl on a New Year's trip (followed by a ""well it's not technically cheating""), and that I was embarrassed by her. She had to hang up because she crying too hard. The next day, she said that she ""didn't remember"" what she said, but she obviously did. What the fuck? She was the one who made it clear that we weren't dating. I told her that and told her that judging from all she told me and all her talk about finding a dude to marry or whatever, it was obvious that I didn't fit into that mold so I did what I did knowing that she didn't want a relationship. She said ""well you unfit yourself"" and went back to crying. Judging from this and other past behaviour that was just really irrational and strange, my friends told me to cut her off because she's too unstable. 

Anyways, she told me recently that she hooked up with some other dude and I'm a wreck right now. I'm not mad at her and have no right to be 'cause we aren't dating, but I don't know what to do. We talk every single day still and I know that I'll never get over her if I keep it up. She may or may not date this guy, but she'll find someone eventually and it's gonna be so much worse for me when that happens. In the meantime, I won't find anyone because I'd still be hung up on her. On the other hand, I don't want to let her go because I love talking to her and it's the highlight of my day.

I definitely do not and both girls are big into gossip, and I don’t want to be known as the new girl that drama just follows. The girls joked (yes, this sounds extremely middle school-esque) “oooh, Katie has a crush on Johhhnnn, we’re gonna tellll him” with pretty much no basis.

Been depressed since I was 15, last years of school were really bad, everyone was cruel to me because I wasn’t as witty as the other kids and they all targeted me because I wasn’t able to defend myself

I was skinny as hell because of my eating habits, I dont really like food that much 

To solve my weight and my stress problems I tried lifting for a year but then it just wouldn’t take the stress out so I left it

Then I started smoking cigarettes for some reason,  but my body started reacting badly, I wouldn’t eat as much then smoking made me skinny again, now I’m just trying to quit

I’m in my least years of college and I still cant get my shit together, I don’t have plans for my future 

I ignore girls who try to give me signs to talk to them, I just don’t feel like I wanna date someone when I really hate myself

I try to come up with any excuse to convince myself not to talk with people in general, guys and girls, I would tell myself that I don’t have that much communication skills and I would fuck up my relationship with that person somehow or I would make them lose respect for me

my main excuse for not enjoying is money, I don’t have enough money for expenses, my Father gives me just enough to live cause he wants me to go find a job and rely on myself 

Which leads me back to the beginning, I don’t want to try and find work, as much as I badly need a job to have fun with my life, I just don’t have it in me right now, I am a very miserable person I don’t think I would be able to find a job, the interviewers would overwhelm me and reject me in the end


Nobody in my life knows about these thoughts I have, not even my closest friends, when I told my friends I was still a virgin they were shocked because they thought a good looking guy like me would’ve had some action here and there

I don’t see myself the way people see me, I don’t think I’m attractive, I don’t like people and I don’t like this world



Since I said so much negative shit above I want to end this with something positive, I like reading about history a lot, I get really excited when somebody mentions something that happened 1500 years back and I can talk to them about it in detail 

I’m also well informed about whats going on in the world, my friends say that I’m smart a lot, I don’t think thats true, otherwise I wouldn’t have started smoking

My parents separated last year and my dad lived in a car for several months before moving into a one-bedroom apartment. This meant I had to switch between households to keep both of my parents company. I preferred my mom's house but she's terribly strict in terms of me leaving the house and we fight constantly and can't even hold a conversation without boring her so most of the time I stayed at my dad's, who is the polar opposite: he allows me to borrow the car and I can only stand him for a certain amount of time. Sitting in his apartment drives me crazy - aside from work, he watches football, occasionally runs errands, and plays with my dog. His social life revolves around the friends of my mother's, and his work friends whose invitations he always rejects (""I don't feel like hanging out.""). He embarrasses me. It just depresses me and I worry that if I end up like either of them, which I inevitably will, I will live an unhappy life. They are both paying off my brother's car loan, and I keep thinking to myself that maybe my depression will decrease if I have a car of my own so that I could switch between houses whenever I'd get sick of either of them or drive to work, once I get a job.

I feel as if I should force myself to be spontaneous and bubbly but most of the time we hang out we always just lay in bed and watch movies. I have a feeling he is becoming bored of me, and oftentimes I wish things were back to the way it was when we started dating. I had a pregnancy scare last summer when I was a minor, and on a whim, got the IUD implant (birth control) for free at Planned Parenthood, which took a massive toll on our sex life and I'm saving up money to get it removed. My other option is to use insurance, which is a pain in the ass because I don't want my mother to find out I've been using it for birth control. I don't want her to find out I've been having premarital sex because she is strictly against it and I will be punished if she ever finds out. This has been one of my major stressors. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also sought out help from a therapist last year but I always would lie about self-improvement, and eventually I'd just stop going. I was basically diagnosed with extreme social anxiety, and have had it ever since I was a child. I don't have a major social network because of it, and it is one of my biggest insecurities. I fear as if I'm going to live my life this way, and I'm terrified to seek help because of it. It has also taken a toll on my relationships, especially with my boyfriend's friends and family, who probably thinks I'm either stuck up or too dumb to even form an opinion. I went to a family reunion once (my biggest fear lol) and met my cousins for the first time. I didn't even talk to them.

&amp;#x200B;

It just scares me that life is going to be like this forever. I feel like I don't have a personality, and I'm tired of being lonely. I've told my mom about my depression and social anxiety and she doesn't understand. She just tells me to ""not be sad,"" and to ""be yourself"" as if that will fix everything. I'm afraid that the people around me will say the same. I just want to teach someone how to understand me. ",21Jan2019,1
148,"Ok lol so here it goes

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my teenage years I did have a few chances to get laid but it never really happened. This was partly because I felt I was not good enough, so anytime anyone showed any interest in me I'd be surprised as heck and run away or cut contact with the person. I can recall two situations right now. One was when I was 15 or so, a girl texted me telling me I was rude to her and should apologize, and set up a meeting in a public street. When I got there I sat down on stairs and she sat on the stairs. She sat up a few stairs above me, legs wide open, strong eye contact. Told her I had to go, walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

Last time this happened must have been when I was 18 or so. Went with a friend to a bar, girl we knew was sitting alone at the counter. Kissed her in the forehead even though we had barely talked until that night, physically blocked my friend out of the conversation with my back because I'm a dick, and spent 2 hours talking with her. Midway through my friend left to meet out peers in another bar.. After those 2 hours, said my goodbye and left. She followed me outside with ""You know, I just texted \[one of my friends in the other bar\] and she told me they are going to stay for a while so we can be together a bit more"". She was almost on my lap by that point. Told her ""Nahh I really want a beer"" and walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea there's that. I wanted to give a few tangible examples of people I knew were attracted to me in a way. The other partial reason I never acted on anything was the feeling that I would find someone more attractive than that person. So it's ""I'm not good enough for them"" mixed with ""They are not good enough for me"" that got me to this point of my life where I'm 22 and yet to get laid, or even to be kissed if we don't count middle school.

&amp;#x200B;

Dang it, I'm dumb. Got my standards for myself and others too high during those years. You aren't supposed to have standards at all until you reach your 18s-20s, yea I got that now. That's when you start finding people you feel attracted to and settle instead of experimenting. Too late to learn that one tho. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to current day and age and the problem now is that due to this huge lack of experience I become incredibly creepy and needy every time I get close to a girl. So if a girl clearly likes me to the point of asking me out for lunch and coffee (I'm remembering a particular example), and then she agrees on going on a 1-day trip to another city with me, you can bet whatever you want by the end of the day I'm going to be creepy as hell because that trip is only a success if we kiss or stay the night, and I'm not going to enjoy it otherwise. She eventually reacts to the creepiness and backs down, I realize that and back down as well, and the relationship dies.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes it that much harder to deal with people from the opposite sex because it's like you actually \*need\* them. Even if you aren't particularly attracted to a person, part of you still sees her as someone who could provide you with the experience you seek. And yea I'm creeping myself out right now as well. It kinda ruins every kind of relationship you have and takes a toll on you.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I'm wondering if it's a good idea to pay and get this out of the way. By this point I don't feel like I should have any type of standard, what's the point anyway, I'm most likely just going to creep everyone away the moment they start to show interest or to spend a big portion of time with me.

152,"We were all supposed to do it cause frankly everyone other than my oldest sister who wants to get fit for the military needs to loose weight, but I(17f) feel horrible because of it. I feel so awful because I’m not perfect, and I have trouble with losing weight. I get so paranoid over diets that I just end up hating myself even more. It makes me fucking depressed and self conscious as fuck whenever other people know I’m attempting to loose weight and I feel so scared to let other people down. It doesn’t help that whoever looses the most weight wins $200, so that’s even more pressure.

Now that the whole household is dieting all I hear is “what did you eat today? What do you weigh? When’s the last time you weighed yourself?” My sister even went as far as to ask me in front of my friends about my current weight. I know I’m out of shape, and I know they want the best for me, but it just constantly reminds me of how much I hate myself.

I’m not in a good place mentally right now. I really am not, and this just makes it worse. I haven’t lost any weight so far, and I hate myself so much for it. The first week I did everything like I was supposed to, and I didn’t loose shit. My sister (not the thin one) and dad almost lost ten lbs each, and I had nothing to show for it. My dad made fun of me and said “YOU aren’t eating the right stuff, hahaha, that’s why you’re loosing weight, you’re not doing it right” and it made me feel horrible.

I really don’t know what to do at this point. I feel so alone and  sad all the time now, even when I’m with friends it’s like I’m just numb. I have no motivation to do anything and I just want to stop existing. I don’t know how to talk to my family about it cause they think I’m just trying to be depressed cause it’s cool and edgy. When my dad talks about loosing weight he gets this big smile but it doesn’t make me feel good. I don’t have any hope for the future and that scares me. There’s no motivation, there’s no drive. I don’t see a future where I can be happy, even if I lost weight.",21Jan2019,1

It looked like he was going to seize, so as soon as I noticed this I disengaged eye contact, and I noticed his face relax immediately as soon as I did.

We have lived together for around 3 years[Both mid 20s Europe]. When we met she was the average girl. Using tumblr to look at art. 
Then when she started browsing 4Chan more and more she seems to have lost any differentiation between the real world and  just garbage online commentary.

Gamergate, /pol/ and the YouTube Radicalisation Machine. That would all be fine we don’t need to agree all the time... but things are leaking trough.

She is starting to behave like all those pundits and edges lords. Condescending and self assured that she’s right. For the most of mundane things completely unrelated to politics or any shit like that. She believes she’s part of the “knowledgeable” few, so to speak.

I tried twice to open such a conversation but it’s really hard to tell someone that they live in a reality completely disconnected from the real world. How to change someone’s perspective on the difference between internet shit posting and every day life?

164,"Hello, this may be long, thank you all who offer advice/have read:

  My mother in other words is what I thought was Narcissistic. For years, with the upbringing I had and also the trauma that went along with it I know for a fact something with her was not right. When I was younger, my mother would state various times that she never wanted kids (had 3 total - 1 out of wedlock, then myself and a younger sister with my father). My older sister who has a different father, my mom had her at 32 and gave her up for adoption. She claims that was against her will. I soon found out that was false as she was found unfit to parent. She never had a stable job, dropped out of college, and has alienated herself from her family and my father’s. She has a history of very unstable outbursts and very rude, almost baffling comments. She is an exceptional liar. When I say that I mean she will lie about anything and everything - and will keep going. She also is in incredibly poor health at age 62. She has done this on purpose. When I was young I would get sick all the time because she did not clean the house, she also would serve us moldy or old food. Sometimes none at all. The times I would get sick, either from the state of the home or the food, if I had to stay home my mom would actually encourage me to not only take days but sometimes weeks off from school or work. Even receiving a letter in the mail stating that a social worker would come to the home to inspect why I wasn’t in school, my mom actually laughed at that. She was extremely mentally and emotionally abusive. Very controlling with my father and younger sister and myself. There is much, much more abuse I could go into, and I apologize as of right now sometimes it is hard for me to even express what I went through without getting incredibly angry, so I am giving a summary. 

With all of this information, when I moved out of my parents home and I am now living my own life, as well as planning for my wedding, her behavior has in my opinion really gone off the deep end and I feel I am noticing more. Because this has bothered me so much with recent events (the last one was on Thanksgiving Day, she called to scream at me then hung up), I have done a lot of researching on my own. My father is way too passive, I love him to death but he really has not helped me figure out what is with my mother’s behavior, and my younger sister unfortunately has some mental disabilities so she does not fully understand the complexity of my mom, but she does voice however is she is being mistreated. So that leaves me to everyone else.

I recently on my last leg called my uncle, who is my mom’s youngest brother as well as one of the closest few friends she had. He has refused to speak to her as he wrote her a letter about 3 years ago expressing how exhausting it was to be in her life, and god I totally agree. He is also a social worker, as well as he is my family and I am close to him. When I called him to ask him exactly what was up, the first words out of his mouth were “I have been waiting for you to ask me this since the day you were born.”

I knew then I actually had relief - I’m not crazy. There is more to my mother’s behavior then just being a crazy bitter woman. She may possibly have a severe undiagnosed mental illness. My uncle said he personally believes it is either bi-polar disorder, or border-line personality disorder. I have definitely suspected this in the past and I can absolutely believe it. She has never been to a psychiatrist and refuses to go. I feel like all these years of trying to figure out my mom it all makes sense.

I need advice on how I can possibly get help for my mom? It’s so bittersweet because... she gave birth to me she’s my mom. I know deep down under her issues, she does love me. But her behavior, how she treats people and the erratic things she does and says - even at 62 I want her to get help. She needs it right now before I cut her off because I can’t take it anymore. Has anyone been through this and what can you offer? Thank you.

I’m a girl, and I’m young. Like, extremely young. I’m in 6th grade and  12. This might just come in handy to the way I’m viewed in the story. 

Sooo for context-

  In fifth grade me and this girl, we’ll call her melody, were placed into the same class for the first time. We clicked right away. At this time I was 10 and just stating PuBeRtY, this is be sorta relevant. We would spend so much time together just talking and sharing opinions, and I loved every second of it. Now, puberty is a bitch. It gives you things you’d never think you’d have to experience... pimples, voice cracks, excruciating pain only healthy when relating to growth spurts... and it can also make you catch feelings. And sometimes those feelings can be... oh my god I feel guilty thinking it. I haven’t admitted it to myself in so long. Long story short, puberty makes people gay. And I was gay for Melody. And, even though it was unspoken, I knew she was gay for me. How could I come to that realization? We held hands. We cuddled. It was all supposed to be platonic, but there was clear, uncut sexual tension. It was a lot clearer than it sounds, okay? Just take my word for it. Sounds great, though, right? Your first love feels the same way... no. I had a problem with it. I was scared. I was terrified. I started to have trust issues, I hated myself. It was such a dark time. One day I decided that without Melody, I’d have no gay thoughts. I’d be free. That turned into my biggest regret. I shut her out, I closed her off, I wouldn’t speak to her, I wouldn’t look at her. It hurt so fucking much. I was so afraid of my own fucking sexuality. Melody must have thought it hurt, too, because she did everything she could to salvage anything. I wouldn’t budge. I ignored her for the better part of a school year, until I had a ‘crush’ on a boy. It made me feel comfortable talking to Melody again, since I OBVIOUSLY was straight there couldn’t be anything between us! Though, I made sure to keep my distance. The school year ends and we part ways, we also go to different schools the following year for junior high.

Fast forward to the present-

I recently reconnected with her at a mutual good friend’s sleepover. We found out we were obsessed with the same tv show, and bonded over that for a little bit. We spent the rest of the night flirting with each other, followed by an awkward laugh and a joking ‘no homo!’.  We also slept on the same blow up air mattress, not that it really mattered. Anyways, a big season finale for the show is coming up tomorrow, and I invited her over to watch it. She agreed. It’ll be an hour of us, alone, in a dark room, sitting together on a couch watching it. I’m terrified of something happening. I have a gut feeling I’ll try something or she will, and honestly, I’m not completely against that. I just want to avoid doing something I’ll regret. Can I please have some advice on how to handle the situation without anything intimate?

179,"So I'm a conservative  but I'm aware that tv and books are fantasy so even if you're a conservative it's not real so you shouldn't really make a big deal out of the things you read or watch. There was this girl on Fictionpress ( a website where authors write stories) who wrote some immoral stories that even I wouldn't read. She became a born again Christian  and  deleted her stories which I believed was the right thing to do but then she wrote this whole note about how the lgbt movement is leading to the end times. I don't really get involved in the lgbt community like I have friends who are part of the community but because I'm a conservative I just keep my opinions to my self. However this girl writes that the world is rejecting Christianity and promoting all other religions. Jews, Muslims, and Christians all follow God and Jesus so the fact that she believes other religions are hurting Christians is really crazy. Like God loves us all and we should love each other (love thy neighbor) but this girl is spewing writing that is not even hateful but insane. She goes on to write that there's not enough time because Hell is near and Jesus is coming. Who is she to judge when Jesus is coming? She ain't Jesus. She also writes that even though she needed love desperately the love from her friends and boyfriend never reached her but Jesus alone. Friends and all those we care for are in a way God and Jesus reaching us. She thinks the ""devil and his minions are the Gods of the world"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys actually believe like her, that ""hell is near"" and ""Devil and his minions are the Gods of the world"" or does she need to visit a therapist??",21Jan2019,1
180,"It was a great relationship built on a lot of intimacies that werent romantic. Lots of deep friendships and vulnerable moments.   
I wasnt there for long, but he wanted to see where it went. We were in constant contact. He sent me video messages on my birthday. Lots of flirting. Then he faded off a bit because of his work load. He told me a few weeks ago he couldn't do romance because he had to focus on his career but he still cared about me ""so very much"". But, a friend in the same city said she's seen him with other girls and he seems like he's just casually hooking up.   
That would be fine, but he said he'd tell me if he was having sex with other people.

181,"English is my second language. This is the first time I write about this, so; rant warning.  I will give the nessesary backstory and the effects i have noticed by it to provide a fair basis to give advice.   


I and my friends are 22 year old males. I have one friend (Oliver) that I have consistently hung out with since I was 6 years old to this day. The other one(Harry) had family issues that required him to move around the country for a bit, making hanging out difficult in periods, but the last year we have hung out quite a bit(drinking, gaming, eating). The names Oliver and Harry are aliases. There is another guy involved in the bullying part, but I never considered him my friend, so he is not part of the question I need advice for.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to a small school, and since first grade we hung out and had fun together every break at school. In wich these two characters became my best friends. Which is what i belive makes this hurt so much. We also hung out in our spare time if our parents allowed it. 

&amp;#x200B;

From the age of about 11 to 14 they verbally abused me at every break at school, my three closest friends ganged up on me.  Pointed out every flaw they could imagine, ridiculed me and my family, made fun of the way I looked, made song dedicated to make me feel bad. They rideculed everything that I said to the point that I litterally did not speak during the breakes, for years. I am a likable person, always have been. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know when you are rideculed, you usually think about it later and think about some clever way to respond? Or you thing about some thing you could have done or said to come out on top of that situation? They had gotten me so low I didnt think those thoughts, I had no hope to ever come out on top, I didn't even dream about it. Every morning for 2 or 3 years I involentarely violently retched because I didn't want to go to school. Tl;Dr: I was in no position to stand up for myself in any way shape or form. I was young, unexperienced and probably depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was the good kid with no problems, stable home, good grades, so I did what i could to maintain that image. And to do that I supressed the living shit out of my emotions. I did not tell anyone, and I escaped reality at every possible opportunity by playing videogames and piano (still do)(good thing is that I learned piano well). I faked a smile at every comment my ""friends"" made, while all i wanted to do was cry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I developed major trust issues and deep going doubts about my inherent value. I could by example not imagine by my wildes imagination that another being could actually enjoy my company, up uintill about 2 months ago (thanks to another set of friends). Next step is to try to imagine someone loving me. I have anxiety that makes studying almost impossible, but I honestly do not know if it is related to bullying or a life of escaping reality through medias on screen. Thankfully I was capable of getting through 1-13th grade without studying, but I'm failing hard at university.  


I did not cry during this period or the following 7 years or so. I let one tear come out of my eyes when I first got the message that my sister got cancer and we didnt know if it was treatable or not (she is cancer free now, god bless). But the last 4 months i have cried more than I have done in my entire life because I finally am facing some of my demons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have naturally spent most of the following years supressing the memory of this period of my life, uintill the last 14 months or so.

&amp;#x200B;

So the bullying stopped once Harry moved to a home in another town. Oliver was left behind with me on school, and he acteually got teased for about a month by the third guy in our group, but he managed to stand up for himself after that month.  


Since that time Oliver, Harry and I have had many merry times in our spare time. We do things and talk about things, to anyone but me (it seems) it is a normal friendship. But we have never talked about what happened. I never did tell them how I felt about the bullying and I honestly think that my acting somehow convinced them that I don't have a problem with the period. They share their most intimate secrets with me, but i don't share anything intimate with anyone.   


I love Oliver, I have spent my whole life with him and he is a part of 80% of my stories. Harry is a charismatic person who loves to talk about how tough his life has been and every mental problem he has. In my mind he is delutional, always talking about goals everyone but him knows that he will never reach. Or he is a clever devil using other peoples wonder of his hardships and goals to gain social status. I thought I loved Harry too, but the more I think about the trouble he has caused me the more I get biased against him. Somehow I can't feel so betrayed by Oliver, even though I know I should.  


If they knew how hard I took this bullying, they would probably think I am pathetic for still having a relationship with them. Am I pathetic for allowing people that cause me so much pain and missery to be a part of my life? Maybe breaking these life long relationship is a path for me to regain the faith in my inherent value. The fact that these relationships live on might convey to my subconcious that they were right, or that I can't rise above the bullying.   


I briefly mentioned to Harry last month that I don't trust that he wishes me well, and he mentioned the option of not being friends any more. Something I had already thought of, but I didn't want to do a rash decision. Breaking with Harry would be much much easier than breaking with Oliver. But we are close friends (atleast they think we are) so Oliver would know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so scared to talk to Oliver about this. Maybe I'm scared he doesn't understand, maybe I'm more scared that he might agree.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that even if we talked it out, I will never trust them. But maybe, in the long run, I learn to trust other people if I leave them. Advice wanted!

182,"I’ll start from the beginning. This girl I met like a year and a half ago we’re really good friends. It’d be almost every day we’d sit down and just have a conversation about something stupid I don’t even remember what we talked about. But it was good, for me friends don’t come along too often so having someone like her in my life was something I really needed. For the past couple months however things have been changing, we hardly talk anymore, she seemed distant as if she never wants to talk to me anymore. She’s important to me and I really want her to be a part of my life, but I don’t if she’s distancing herself for a reason or if it’s just she’s lost interest in me.

187,"To give a quick background story, I befriended a girl online who lives in Canada and I live in the US. We've known each other for about a year or so, and we got *really* close. For one reason or another in September she decided to stop talking to me, and blocked me on everything. I still care for this girl and always will. She was diagnosed with Depression and Severe Anxiety, she also has paranoia and trust issues. She is a twitch streamer. She recently showed her evidence of self harm (cuts) to her stream, and was talking like she is suicidal. ""Sometimes I have a hard time seeing what's the point of going on""is something she said while in tears.

I don't know what I can do, these breakdowns on stream are occurring more and more frequently. I am going through my own episode of depression that is fueled by grief and guilt over the loss of a friend from years ago. (he drove his motorcycle drunk, and ended up killing someone and himself). I will literally do anything I can to help this girl. I have her address, and I have told myself if I think she will do serious self harm to herself, shes only a 3 hour flight away. I will not hesitate to show up to her house.

So far, I've sent her a message on instagram. Just letting her know that I still care about her, and she can message me anytime. (which she then blocked me). I have also reached out to a few friends to make them aware.

What else can I do? What else should I do?

188,"Hey! This is going to get really long so bear with me. I’m going to give full disclosure about everything going on in my life and probably get judged hard for it, and that’s ok. I need some tough love right now because I’m getting tired of having so many issues that I feel powerless to tackle without some major changes.

So, the title pretty much sums up most of what I have going on. I’ll break it down into sections though to make it more digestible or if anyone would just like to help me work out how to tackle 1-2 topics (though a lot of them circle back into each other). If I had to sum it up, I’d say I feel really far behind my peers socially, financially, independence-wise, etc and want to catch up so I can be happier and not feel so self-conscious and awful about myself.

**Minimal work experience:** I have barely worked in my life. This is due to no drivers’ license and living in a rural town in my teens, as well as my poor mental health and fear that I cannot handle a work environment that most people can live with... I don’t want to be perceived as too fragile to handle criticism or rude customers, and I have a hard time managing social politics that come with peers/coworkers. I know that’s stupid and entitled, but I’m honestly embarrassed to start developing the thick skin you need to work retail 4-5 years after most people start doing the grind. I have applied to several retail or similar jobs before and only got two interviews, neither of which ended in being hired. I kinda gave up for a while and am admittedly putting off picking it back up because I am self conscious about my age and lack of experience. All I have to put on a resume is pet sitting I did as a teen, volunteer work at an animal rescue organization, and online freelance work I have done/am currently doing. I want to continue with the freelance work because I enjoy it and it uses skills I am good at/want to develop more, but it just isn’t frequent enough and lucrative enough at this point to justify doing it as a full time or barely even a part time job. It does not pay enough to manage my living expenses without help. This work would pay enough if I had 3-4 more recurring clients but I am still trying to learn how to network more. I try to use this to justify my lack of working to family/peers but am afraid that to keep doing it blindly and making only 1/5 of the money I want to be making at this stage is to be living a lie.

**No drivers’ license** I took drivers ed twice in high school and had paid driving lessons almost two years ago and still can’t drive. My parents were terrible at teaching me back when I lived at home and our relationships have only worsened since that time. My mom was too anxious and panicked over every little thing and my dad and I had falling outs for other reasons in my late teens. I have poor spatial awareness and terrible anxiety related to driving. I was also in an accident a few years ago that while not particularly severe (vehicle was very totaled but the driver and I walked away with just minor injuries), mentally fucked with me for a while to where even being a passenger I would flinch if another car on the road got too close or did something slightly unpredictable. Even my friends who were kind enough to give me rides at that time began to notice and ask about it. I don’t want to call this PTSD because that feels too extreme but that’s pretty much how my reactions were like. This all took place around the time I should have been learning to drive and needless to say was a huge setback. It has gotten better over time and I wouldn’t say it’s a major issue anymore at least, but still not helpful in the grand scheme of things. My boyfriend has offered to take me to an empty parking lot to practice but truthfully my issue is working with other cars on the road, ie spatial awareness, changing lanes, and unpredictable drivers. I just can’t wrap my head around driving a 2,000 lb hunk of metal and it being normal and expected even to eventually at some point hit someone or get hit. The hundreds/thousands of dollars in potential damages and daily risk of injury/death is just a normal part of life! Yep, just a daily part of life that I am afraid to step up and take responsibility for. I need a car to get a job and feel like that is one if the issues holding me back from working. I have no idea how I will make enough working minimum wage to cover insurance, maintenance, etc on top of other living expenses though. I would open to taking public transportation but even though it exists where I live now, it has very limited coverage and is notoriously unsafe at night.

**Mental health** I suffer from depression and anxiety (doesn’t everyone these days?), and may have Aspergers/be lightly on the autism spectrum. The depression is semi-manageable but as of recently it is becoming much worse. I feel like I’m living just to survive and get the tasks I have to get done in a week, and I’m lacking motivation and not enjoying a lot of the things I used to do for fun anymore. I am studying a creative field and feel like my well of inspiration is running dry because of the feeling of either constant burnout or constantly trying to avoid feeling burnt out, which doesn’t even make sense because clearly my life isn’t *that* difficult/exhausting by comparison to most of the people I know. This leads to anxiety that I’ll fall behind in my classes because of not having projects on time. The anxiety in general comes in a lot of forms. Social anxiety (mostly fear of being perceived negatively), health anxiety (hypochondriac over a severe condition that runs in my family), and anxiety about getting myself in a better place/being okay in the future are probably the biggest ones holding me back. As for the Aspergers, mine is mild enough that I can “mask” pretty well to acquaintances but I do worry that it shows through to anyone who spends extended time around me. I feel this factors into the spatial awareness issues I have, as well as my social awkwardness. Small talk is hard and it is very easy for me to miss subtle cues that come naturally to a lot of people. I’m self conscious about this issue so I keep myself distant socially to avoid judgement. This hurts me though by making it hard to network in college. Which brings me to...

**Social life**

I have not had a tight social group with a number of people who I know for sure genuinely like my company can’t be counted on one hand since high school, and if I’m being honest that’s probably because the bar to be an acceptable member of society was a lot lower then. I could be a good and reliable friend without having to have a steady job or a car. Most of the friends I had as a teen have drifted away due to distance, as I now live three states away from them. I feel kind of like an outcast in college, and that if I wasn’t adequately good at what I do in class then no one would keep me around. My one friend who I was particularly close with there graduated ahead of me and may be moving soon. We keep in touch regularly and text/call multiple times each week but I do wish I had more people who I could hang out with face-to-face. Of course with no car, I won’t be the one making plans to hang because I don’t expect friends to be my chauffeur. There are acquaintances I talk to but don’t consider myself close with as we don’t hang out outside of class and they are closer with each other than they are with me. I do worry about some of them perceiving me negatively if they did know my full situation, so I keep them distant on purpose. It would be nice to have a support system, but I feel like I can’t offer much in return. I know how to be satisfied in my own company but do feel like I’m missing out on having tight college bonds and stories, and also do still need to be amicable to rely on help with group projects, etc. The only other people in my social circle currently are my SO’s friends. They are nice enough to hang around but I do wish I had more friends independently. 

**Relationship** I am in a committed long term relationship with my SO of 5 years. He is the best thing to ever happen to me and we’ve been with each other through a lot of things, but I fear that I’ve become co-dependent on him. We live together and he is my main source of transportation, and also one of the only people I feel comfortable talking about personal issues with. We’ve been making things work and love each other a lot but he is starting to face understandably strong pressure from his family over me not doing my share and him having to provide so much for me. His family and I have had other unrelated issues in the past (many instances of them being rude/petty to me long before we lived together or were tied up in anything together... I can elaborate if needed so it doesn’t seem like I’m being super entitled over this one specific issue). I just want to be more useful to him in some way to prove I’m not a sunken cost fallacy. He doesn’t believe I am but I fear he will wake up one day and see it that way and he has family and possibly friends strongly implying that I am (rightfully so if I can’t make a change). I think our relationship is otherwise very healthy. We do things around the house equally, no instances of distrust/cheating/etc ever, our sex life is good, compatible views on where we want to be in the future, etc. This issue is becoming very stressful though and I don’t wish to be a burden.

**Family** Here’s another big elephant in the room, my own family. My parents are good people and I don’t fault them for the majority of things that are going on currently but our relationship as it stands now is not healthy at all. They split when I was in high school which made my home a really toxic environment for a long time in the process. My dad quit his longtime secure job and tried pretty much throwing things at a wall to see what stuck including a small business failure that he put a significant amount of money into. My mom grew frustrated at this and started avoiding him, so being the oldest child I had to step up and grow up very fast to try to reason with him. Trying to appeal to his logic and his emotions failed and turned into constant fighting between us. I also had to be the one to impose a “curfew” for arguments so everyone had enough time to cool off and sleep for school/work the next day. I felt like I couldn’t leave the house to hang with friends for more than half an hour (neighborhood friends’ homes were very much my safe spaces at the time) without going to check in and make sure they weren’t at each others’ throats especially after my mom started threatening to move out. I began having panic attacks to the degree of feeling numbness in my body that I haven’t experienced anything like before or since that period of time. There is much more but I’ll cut that part there because this paragraph is already super long. I graduated, and my dad moved out around the same time. My first year of college passed, during which I lived on the campus and out of state with financial aid. I was still close with my mom but kept my dad at a distance. That summer, I went home and one day my mom sat me down to have a serious conversation about news which changed my life for the worse forever. My dad has a degenerative disease that likely led to the choices he made over the past couple of years and other strange behaviors he had/has, and this condition may have also been passed down to me and my brother. While I was still deeply upset about certain events that happened, I could no longer completely fault him for it. This condition causes the health anxiety I mentioned in the “mental health” section but I am not comfortable going into detail much farther on that topic because it legitimately triggers me. Towards the end of my first year of college, my dad came to visit to help me find a new place to live, as I was unhappy on campus at that school and thinking of transferring schools to one two hours away in a major I felt suited me better, that would also allow me to live in the same town as my SO. He was surprisingly supportive and the decision we ultimately came to was that he would take out a loan to get my SO and I a place to live together where we would pay bills and lower rent to him that most of what was in the area. I am very grateful to have a roof over my head, and he has been very lenient about repayment while I get my shit together. However, this arrangement makes me feel like a spoiled trust fund kid and I feel guilty that I have not done more to repay the favor, am very behind on rent, etc. I also kind of feel it was a move to “buy back” our parent/child relationship which also makes me vaguely uncomfortable. My grandmother (his mom) also contributed financially to this arrangement but we also have a strained relationship because how I turned out and the things I am interested in/passionate about as an adult are different than what she wanted me to be like. I’m not hurt by this but do feel a need to “appease” her whenever we see each other. In recent times my mom has tried to have a more amicable relationship with my dad because she feels responsible for not being more proactive about his health and general well-being, but weirdly enough our relationship has become worse as a result. She feels stressed and has a low self worth because of the whole situation and because my dad has a new girlfriend (whole new can of worms... tldr I’m glad he has someone to take care of him but I’m also worried she could be taking advantage of his health). I also feel that I inherited some of my mental health issues from her. Our relationship has turned from relatively healthy parent/child into therapist/client since I’m a good listener and giver of objective advice even if I don’t have much else going for me. A lot of the issues causing her stress affect me directly or indirectly though to the point I dread talking to her on the phone and start shaking with anxiety when she calls because it’s bad news or more venting than I can handle maybe 50% of the time. I was still sort of ok with things up until an incident with extended family over the holidays happened where I got really upset with her actions. I do hope it was a wake up call and she claims that getting herself to a better place is her New Years Resolution, because she realizes the situation has become toxic. For both of our sakes I really hope she sticks to it...

**College life** The final dilemma in my life currently is where I’m at in my degree/future career. I am on my last semester of my associates degree and am unsure whether to continue to my bachelors, take a break to try my hardest at working, or stop there indefinitely. I am paying very expensive out of state tuition, and am not eligible for in-state until I am 24 (three years away) or married (obviously a terrible idea until I get my shit straight). I enjoy the program itself and most of the professors who I have had, but the program is split into a two-year and four-year degree and some cynical students and profs claim that the two year program has been “dumbed down” to encourage more people to continue on to the four-year program. I am a fairly good student as long as I can manage my mental health, but the environment here has grown tiring as it’s a small program and gossip spreads like wildfire. Financially, I would only be able to continue with help from my dad and grandmother and while they have offered to help with the tuition, I am uncomfortable asking for that much money from them because I don’t think they understand how much it actually costs and because of reasons regarding our current arrangement as explained above with no immediate way to be able to repay them in sight. They are also very hard to communicate with at times and have old fashioned views on young adult life. My field itself is one that some people would argue that you don’t need a degree to be successful in, being a creative field with a lot of skills one can teach themself with online tutorials. However, I’m also here also to network, build a creative portfolio, receive professional guidance, and rent equipment at a far lower cost than what would be available otherwise. I don’t really feel prepared to look for a job in my field and to give up using the facilities, but at the same time I don’t want to throw money down a hole/put myself in more debt with financial aid and/or my family. I also worry that I would stagnate by staying in the program and get too busy with complex assignments to be open to working a serious job for possibly the first time ever. I’m also afraid of stagnating even more from where I am now if I were to stop at my associates. Another major benefit to staying in school longer though is that I’ll be able to keep my student health insurance under my dad’s plan though, which is a huge benefit since I have no other way to cover that cost. Overall I’m just really torn on what to do here and am afraid of making the wrong choice.

**Conclusion** If you have taken the time to read all of this or even just part of it, as long and convoluted as it is, I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart because I know this is a lot. Ultimately this is a cry for help and I just want to get out of this hole I’m in and into a better place in my finances, career, health, and personal relationships.

**TLDR: I’m struggling to gain confidence and independence in my life due to a lot of issues, including but not limited to lack of work history, no license, poorly maintained mental health, an unfulfilling social life, fear of codependency with my partner, strained familial relationships, and indecision on whether to continue my degree after getting my associates. I just want some tough love and hopefully some steps I can take to make things better.**",21Jan2019,1

What can I do to heal my thumb?? 

*back story* 
About 2 months ago I burned the inward side of my thumb pad. I was microwaving a (ceramic) bowl of El Polo Loco Mac and Cheese for like 6 min. The bowl was ceramic, but anyway I completely blanked out and tried grabbing it. Only my thumb made contact but it was too late. It didn’t seem like too bad of a burn but oh boy. The burned/healed area is like half a quarter leading up to my nail. It’s hyper sensitive, but like feels hard on some areas like callus. Also some areas look like my thumb print didn’t grow back so that probably isn’t good. But yeah. Also it’s my right hand, dominant. ",21Jan2019,1

I (20/M) am trying to get someone (20/F) to stop texting me all the time (and period).

192,"I’m a tall, pale, redhead so (maybe...idk) needless to say I get looked at. Maybe I’m just really in my head but I don’t wanna draw so much attention to myself especially since I hope to start college soon. I’m not really shy. I just hate people looking at me all at once. It’s makes me uneasy and not really what I want when I’m trying to meet some new friends, ya know? So any tips or tricky would be really helpful! I’m sorry if I come off narcissistic or stuck up.

194,"I've had a best friend for close to 10 years now. We've always been incredibly close, and practically inseparable. However, a couple years ago we graduate high school, and it's been a bit difficult since. The distance (3 hours) was never an issue as we both drive, or the money as we have great support systems. We both ended up being a two very different points in life, after being the same for so long. 

First issue arose when first year of college I found out I was 4 months pregnant. Of course, this means my whole life would be completely flipped upside down. At the time we had tickets to an amusement park, obviously rollercoasters weren't a great idea at that time. She became very angry around this time, and severely judgemental. I was aware that I wasn't ready, but that didn't change the circumstance. Shortly after, I had a miscarriage for the first time. I was in complete emotional distress but she seemed quite happy, stating I have time to do more now. 

It's been 2 years now, I went from going out a lot to focusing on just school. Social life is on the down low but my grades are luckily very high. I graduate soon. She's dropped out 3 times. I haven't once judged her, and have only tried to be there if she decides she needs it. However, with each drop out she seems to constantly insult my program and explain I'M wasting my time.

I have a long-term and VERY supportive boyfriend whom I live with. We never argue, surprisingly. We get along amazingly and are extremely close. Couldn't be happier. Yet she always has to explain how the fact we don't argue is unhealthy, always trying to find something negative. We really just don't argue, even living together. I'm sure one day we will, but we're not actively searching to start a fight which seems to irritate her.

She loves to go out and party now, drink, take enables and I really don't anymore. I'm bipolar who quit all of that a while back to focus on my education and mental health which was my personal decision.

She's not stating I'm ""lame"" and we're twenties now. I know it's a prime time to have fun and party sure, but it's just not my thing anymore. I'm much happier this way. We don't speak much this past month now. Unsure what to do :/",21Jan2019,1
195,"I’ve known her for about 7 years now. Met in 9th grade i believe and were 20. While in high school i’ve always liked her but we were also really good friends so i never wanted to say anything cause i felt that would ruin things but our senior year came and it was bothering me too much so i had finally had to say something and just take the chance, it failed lol. At the time she was gonna be going away for college after we graduated so she said she wouldn’t be able to do the distance thing. I understood and just kind of let it go because i still wanted to be friends with her cause she’s a great person. 

The next year rolls around and i get accepted into the college i was wanting to go to back in high school which inevitably is the college she attends. This year is where i fall in love with her. We spent everyday together for about 5 months, doing everything with one another. Then she gets a boyfriend so we don’t hangout as much as we used to after that, come to find out she’s dating a guy from back home. This is probably what affected me the most. I remembered what she had told me back in high school about not being able to do long distance so this made me question myself and go crazy thinking about it. This is when i realized how much i fell in love with this girl. As a college student we would get super drunk and i remember i even broke in tears heartbroken over it and was so upset i punched my windshield in anger, i was so lost i had no idea what to do with the situation. 

But as of right now we aren’t in the same town or college. Been this way for about 6 months now? I needed a break. The depression started to affect all my school work and i just did not want to do anything. Wouldn’t even get out of bed most days. Gained so much weight also. 

It’s gotten to the point where i feel like i need to say something about it or else i’m going to be stuck wondering what could have been .

197,"So recently I was involved in a conflict that started with me making decision to leave a program due to professional reasons. And my closest friends and family who I consulted with, really understood my decision and thought my reasons for wanting to switch to another program were very well justified. And so after I notified my peers within the program and I guess my ""mentor"", it seemed my peers were all very understanding too and actually praised me for the decision to switch programs because they thought my reasons were justified as well. My mentor on the other reacted very harshly and first dismissed all my reasons/concerns for wanting to switch to another program. I tried to be extremely understanding of his reaction because we were quite close and so I'm sure some of his reaction was a result of his emotions (anger, surprise...). I really tried to emphasize that it is purely professional and there are many factors that I don't feel are good for me anymore in his program. So after I notified my mentor, before my official departure, he used his remaining power over me to be the most petty possible, he almost forced me into paying a couple thousand $ unnecessarily, he also kind of affected my status at the new program. But basically this guy preached for a couple years that all he wanted was whats best for me, and then as soon as I wasn't beneficial to him anymore, he did as much as he could to screw with me. In this whole matter I was incredible mature, I am honestly extremely proud of how I behaved. I could've done a lot of things like go and tell all my peers from the program about his actions, or go above his head and cause a big mess there, or go on social media and bad mouth his program (which someone else did in a different program recently). But I did the most to try and part on good terms even tho he did the most to mess everything up. And at first I felt really good about how I handled the situation. But now its been a few weeks and I've settled in a new routine at this new program, but I'll just be chilling sometimes and get extremely mad about everything that my old mentor did and I just feel like even though I took the high road, it feels like he came out winning in this battle.

201,"My brother is really fat for a 15 year old because he's always in front of the computer or tv, and eats way too much. It's not like he ever goes out or does sports which doesn't justify his appetite. 

Even my mom tells him that he's fat and that he needs to stop overeating. 

He doesn't really have friends or talents so I scream at him to stop because having people like you is harder when you're overweight and that no one will want him.

She's already locked the snack cabinets but that won't stop him from randomly eating slices of bread or yogurt in the fridge or making ramen. 

Today was the last straw.

I woke up late, around 12pm and went downstairs to see my breakfast my parents left me.

Half of my breakfast seems to be eaten and all there was left was 5 chips. 

I was livid and started screaming at my brother and asked him if he ate more than his share of breakfast. 

He almost lied at first then admitted it. He sometimes lies about the amount of food he eats to my mom and I when we confront him.

Later at lunch, my dad came back to make fried chicken. 

There were 12 pieces and he put them in the oven.

My dad left to go take a nap and when I go downstairs in a few hours to eat the wings my brother tells me to save at least 3 chicken pieces for my dad and to only eat 3-4 like he did. I called bull.

I was generous and left the last 4 pieces for my dad.

A little later I hear my brother go downstairs and I ask him if he's eating the chicken.

He finally admits it.

There's 3 pieces left but I'm furious and start screaming at him because it's like the lecture I gave him about eating less didn't mean anything to him.

I then ate the remaining chicken and threw the tray at his face and the bones on the floor.

Especially my mom. My boyfriend is very sweet, caring, has a good head on his shoulders, respects our culture, and he gets along with them really well when they're together.

My mom is very emotional and dramatic to the point where I feel like she's unstable at times. She says hurtful things when she doesn't hear what she wants to hear. I know she's a good person and she cares about me more than anything but she can be just plain mean. She'll say hurtful things about my boyfriend like just now when she said, ""I should've taken advice from \_\_\_ and never have met your boyfriend until you graduate college"".

I tell my boyfriend about our arguments and he knows that she hurts me and he's heard her say some mean things about him in the past. I tell him everything about my life and the arguments with my parents, but I don't know if I should continue sharing the parts that my mom says hurtful things about him.

We have need really close friends our entire life and it’s been amazing. I just recently met Dwight a few years ago and we hit it off immediately. 

So I’ve made a huge friend group through Dwight and we are really tight. Now I decided “Hey. Jim and Dwight have never met. They are both my best friends. Might as well introduce them to each other” Oh boy was that a mistake. 

Now mind you Jim was an innocent boi. Good Religious guy that didn’t fuck w anything. On the other hand Dwight was a pothead and activity drank (we are in Highschool). When I introduced the two all was fine. It was all good for like a few months and then I find out that Dwight has started drinking and smoking with Jim and actively dealing to him. 

This is where it all started to fall apart. I kept telling Jim to stop but he insists it’s ok and that “Colleges will accept C’s. You’re just judging me.” Then I found out that Dwight graduated from Pot to abusing his Xanax prescription. I’m afraid that he will try to get Jim to do that and just fuck up his life

Now I’m not too sure what to do. They both still insist we are all best friends but I’m not tryna get caught up in that whole thing. I could just keep talking to them and pretend or I could just cut it off. Idk what to do. Mind you if I did cut it off I would still have that friend group I made through Dwight to fall back on (they are also kinda fed up w his bs so they feel the same way). I’m just at a loss.

Picking up the slack for my deadbeat dad and mom trying to provide for my 3 sisters as much as possible. Don’t have a car and don’t know how to drive. Hit my lowest point back in October of last year and was very close to suicide. But somewhere my stubbornness kicked in and I found a bit of hope again. A light at the end of the tunnel.

I have no one to really teach me how to drive so I’m not really sure how I can go about that and I’m barely able to really scrape up money because my dad will just spend his money and I have to pick up for his slack.

I (21F) and my at the time boyfriend (24M) moved from our home state to another so that we could both finish school, undergrad for me, graduate level for him. Before moving, we'd been together 4 years. During the process of moving states his 95 y.o. grandfather passed in July, he took it very hard. We moved in September, things went down hill. He says I wasnt there for him in the way he needed me. He'd leave me alone in our new apartment so that he could go home to be with family for holidays, I couldn't go due to work/school and couldnt understand how that made me sad. We had a HUGE blow out in December, a lot of things were said from both sides and we broke up, we both went back home for the winter break. Now that we're back living in the same apartment and I've had time to rethink my actions, I think that learning from the mistakes and moving onward with a relationship would only make us stronger. Things are going good again, we have fun and are able to do things together again, my feelings are just as they were for him before. When I talk to him about it, he says he cant get back into a relationship with me, but would like to continue doing what were doing to see what happens. Makes sense. The problem is:  he needs me to prove that I've changed, so over this time as I'm maintaining/ builiding feelings and feel as I'm still committed to him, hes just observing. He's free to talk with other women if that arises and investigate that if he wants. I feel that if I stay in the apartment I'm just going to be falsely building something in my head that doesnt exist. Just to wait and see if he wants to be with me or not.

About a month ago, my partner of two years decided that we should “take a break”; they felt that they had not established a true sense of individual identity, and wanted to work more on themselves (for the record, I completely understand this and have tried to be nothing but supportive.) 

Now, this was coupled with them saying that they planned on us ending up together, which is exactly what I want. 

My concern is this: we talk almost every day. I got a really bad speeding ticket and was kind of a dick that whole night while we were texting. I am having a really hard time letting go because my feelings have not gone anywhere, and I don’t want to be with anyone else.

224,"So there is this girl I have always liked. One day she decided to ask me out on a hike and we flirted a bit and I may have insulted her a few times jokingly of course. She did the same to me. However, what I didnt realize was that she took things a but personally and ignored a few texts I sent her. 

Being super clingy amd awkward at the time and i continually asked for her forgiveness and she ranted and told me to basically screw off. So I did for a bit and she told me she wasnt angry. 

So I didnt really interact with her for a while till one day she decided to bake me cookies and we sorta started our friendship again.

I baked her cookies back and she would frequently text me which was nice. We had decent conversations and I decided to give her a christmas gift which she liked.

So we talked some more and eventually our conversations became bland. She also seemed disinterested and started only asking me for help. Sometimes i would say goodnight or something nice and she wouldn't reply, sometimes even leaving me on open. To be fair we text late at night and she sometimes falls asleep before opening my messages.

When she does open them, she rarely replies. I try not to initiate the conversation but she hasn't really talked to me at all these past few days. 

Should I talk to her again? Should I initiate the conversation? How do I know when to stop? At what point are we just friends? She doesnt really talk to me much anymore? I'm not sure if I should move on either. 

I have a bunch of opportunities to sit by her and talk but I dont and I think she notices. The reason I dont is because I'm not sure if she wants me to or if she would actually like to talk to me. 

Should I talk to her again and maybe ask her out? I don't have a car so that might make things awkward. Any advice is appreciated, thanks. 

TL;DR: Accidently got on a girls bad side but she forgave me and we became really good friends. She would get me gifts and I would do the same for her. Recently shes seemingly lost interest and we dont talk like we used to. Should I start talking to her more and maybe ask her on a date? ",21Jan2019,1
225,"Hi everyone, new Redditor here.

I'm a 27yo F who is currently living abroad in Hong Kong, and I feel stuck in a rut. When I lived in the UK, I worked in a secondary school as a full-time teacher of RS/Philosophy and Citizenship. Now, I work as an English (EAL) teacher in a tuition centre.

When I lived in the UK, I spent time looking for jobs in HK, and was interviewed for two positions. One of the posts ended up being filled internally, and the other position was not right for me. So when I moved to HK, I took a TESOL course so that I would be qualified to teach English whilst I looked for a teaching job in an international school. As a PGCE-holder and someone with 3 years of experience teaching in a British, international-esque school, I felt that I might be a good candidate. Unfortunately, many schools in Hong Kong no longer offer RS as a subject, or if they do then those schools are faith-schools (I'm an atheist). So I got a job in a tuition centre and continued to look for jobs. I've applied for RS/Philosophy jobs in schools and have had no luck - not even an interview. I then decided to try applying for English Lit/Lang teaching jobs in schools, as I have experience of that in the centre - but again, I have been unsuccessful. Understandably this has put me on a downer. On top of this I find it difficult to enjoy teaching EAL (English as a second language) as much as I did RS/Philosophy. I have considered applying for EAL teaching jobs in schools, but I don't know if I'd be any happier. However, I do not want to stay in the English centre forever as there are no opportunities for career progression - but I do sometimes find EAL teaching unenjoyable compared to my previous subjects.

I suffer with anxiety and depression and for the past 9 months I have been back on anti-anxiety and anti-depressants. I have felt extremely low and am questioning my abilities. During my time at the school in the UK, terrible things happened. My school was extremely demanding and punishing, refusing to issue pay-increases and changing the dates for submitting pay-related documents at extremely short-notice. My gained time during the summer was taken away so that I could teach classes who had, in some cases, had 7 teachers in the same year (!) and I was never rewarded for the hard work that I did. I was just expected to get on with it with no support and no say in what happened... I felt extremely un-valued and unappreciated and spiraled into depression. This was the first time I went on anti-depressants. In some ways, I am now scared to go back into a school in case this happens again, and am wondering if this and my lack of success in getting a job in a school is telling me it's time to get into another job. However, if I left teaching I would miss it and my students.

I have been considering becoming a counsellor or someone else who could help people with mental health issues. I would probably have to go back to university to do so, which will cost money, and would be difficult, but I could do it, and there would probably be opportunities to develop and grow and eventually gain a senior position. 

I suppose I don't know what I want to do in life anymore. I could continue trying to get into schools for various posts and see how I get on. I could possibly go back and study (but I'd want to be sure my salary would be at least equal to what I'm on now). I am ambitious and the lack of career progression opportunities are making me feel really bad about myself, but due to my MH issues I am also terrified to take a step in a totally different direction.

227,"Yes - I understand that there is their kid and that I have no right to involve myself in their business. 

Okay - Ive(33M) lived with a couple (F34 - M22), who have a child(2M) for a little over a year and a half. We have pretty good communication and are friendly towards each other. I am definitely closer with the father - who had spoken to me about feeling trapped in the relationship and sense of shame he has around leaving. 

NOTE: he’s 22 and the wife is 34, that not a typo. 

So they have this kid who is pretty cool - but I can’t help but feel that their relationship and the difficulties they are facing are fucking this kid up. The kid has ZERO socializing with other kids, ZERO. Goes ZERO places for fun. The father does not work and spends 6 days a week alone with the kid while the mom is working. 

The kid is definitely behind in terms of what I see for other kids his age (my brother have kids) - he is limited with his words and communication. 

Right now - it’s 10:15pm and he is still awake running around - this is NORMAL. It seems to be getting worse with time. 

What I think is happening - they have ZERO friends - and ZERO social life. They kid basically props with their relationship and they use him to keep it falling apart. They don’t put him to bed at a reasonable hour (from what I’ve read on the internet) as they don’t want to actually have to face the reality of how shit their life together is! 

Can I do anything? Can I say anything? Can I show any compassion for the kid? Or do I just shut it and look to leave? 

I care about the kid - and I’m scared that he is getting messed up by the parents inability to provide him with what he needs. 

I care about the father - he’s a good YOUNG man who is always looking for guidance - wishes he would be social and looks at me like I’m the most blessed man alive because I have a “normal” life. 

I don’t necessarily care about the mom - I don’t know who gets knocked up by a 20 year old, keeps the kid and marries him... I’m sorry, I don’t get it. We live in LA. It’s crazy weird out here for that shit to happen. 

And no - I don’t believe they love each other. If that matters. The husband has cried when talking to me about how sad he is and how trapped he feels. 

NOTE - sorry if the edit is terrible.  ",21Jan2019,1
228,"On January 3rd, 2018 I went to the hospital because I was in excruciating pain in the right side of my pelvic. Upon arriving, I found that to be the aftermath of a large ovarian cyst rupture— AND appendicitis. I was rushed into emergency surgery to have my appendix removed. They also looked at my ovaries and saw the fluid from the cyst ruptures, along with “many other cysts” as well. Don’t know how much. Wasn’t even in my discharge papers. After 3 days I was released. Ever since then, I’ve always been a little bloated in my pelvic area. Shortly afterwards I thought it was just fluid still in there but it never really went away. This sucked and was weird because my entire life I’ve had a perfectly flat stomach. 

Up until a few weeks ago, the bloating became worse. It’s very very hard and tight in that entire area. My whole pelvic is in pain every day and when I get my period, it’s 100x worse. Same with my back, I’ve always had back issues from sports but recently this is the worst it’s ever been and I’m not even as active as I used to be. My whole life I’ve had the best bladder ever (I get it from my mom) I could survive 4 hour road trips on 2 bottles of water. Now I drink half a bottle and I cant hold it in. I used to eat 2 entire entrees at restaurants and now I can’t even finish a small plate. My stomach hurts all the time and I thought it was just dairy but I cut that out and I’m still in pain. Even going #2 has decreased a lot. I’m tired all the time and was even put on antidepressants for it. I’m on birth control and vyvanse for ADHD (which I don’t take every day.) so the addition to the medications also confuse me on if they’re just weird side effects. But all of these symptoms are consistent. The only symptom I don’t have is pain during sex, only because I haven’t had sex in a long time. 

Even before I did my research on ovarian cancer, I’ve just had a bad feeling. And having the ovarian cyst rupture just a year ago freaks me out even more because it’s all related. 

I guess the reason why I’m not rushing to the doctor is because I’m young and the risk typically tends to run higher in older women, but I’m just very nervous at the fact that I have all of the symptoms. I also don’t want to be one of those people who go into the doctors office saying “I looked it up on the internet!!!!” Or for them to think I’m dramatic. 
I’m not sure if it runs in my family. It’s a very random question to ask and I don’t even want to bring up the idea to anyone. 

Could all these symptoms be something else? Does having a cyst rupture increase chances of getting a ovarian cancer?

If I do go to the doctor, do I bring up ovarian cancer or tell them my symptoms and let them handle it?


TLDR; I’m having almost all the symptoms of ovarian cancer but at my age it’s very rare. I’m scared to go to the doctor because I feel like I’ve already had so many issues recently and I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic.

231,"

Growing up, my parents were around but weren’t really there for me save providing necessities or partaking in parent teacher meetings. 

My mom was crazy when I was young, withholding food from me until I did the extra homework she assigned me(yeah she’s a tiger mom). I honestly don’t have many opinions of my own anymore because she exerted herself over me so heavily. But I’m trying to become a whole person again. My dad was nice but just so involved in his work he never really had time for the rest of us. My younger brother joined the family when I was 5, and things kind of went downhill from there.

Physical affection was never a thing. Encouragement from my dad was rare, never my mom. Today, my mom works and worries too much about everything. She’s still crazy but in a different way. She’s paranoid the neighbors are staring into our house and closes the blinds. She thinks I’ll never amount to anything after high school. My dad just exists, he’s nice. My brother has removed himself to the Xbox with his friends.

I’ve never really had a whole, healthy relationship with anyone. My best friend has depression, and can be kind of toxic sometimes but I guess like attracts like. I have friends, but I don’t talk to them about much besides school. It’s obvious when I talk that I’m don’t know how to hold a conversation. The things I say come out wrong and in a way that I don’t mean. But the damage is already done. And then I overthink these situations, which helps. 

I crave closeness for these reasons; I’ve never had that in my life and want it, but have no idea how to get a friendship or just relationship in general without scaring somebody else. It’s funny though, I’m scared of opening up to others. I guess it’s because I’ve never really had the chance to in the past. 


Sort of off topic, but something that made me reflect:

A topic came up in my English class about people being chameleons. They change, can adapt, and can hide. You can’t pin them down, but at the same time, why would you want to? They can be anything, but stare hard enough, and are nothing. My teacher stared at me while talking about this. I think she can see right through me, but I don’t know how to feel about this. 


Sorry if this came off not as asking for advice but trying to get stuff off my chest. It’s kind of both.

233,"Hi, I'm an aspiring DIYer and in need of advice on how to transport long 2x4s and sheets of plywood. If it helps, I live in the midwest of the United States.

Background: I want to build myself simple furniture for my home as a hobby and past-time. It's something I've always wanted to do and as a new and first-time homeowner, I have that opportunity to make that happen!

However, I own a small compact hatchback that can fit, at most, a couple of 2x4x6. A full plywood sheet is out of the question. In general, transporting anything a bit larger challenging or impossible... I've been offered a couple of free couches and had to pass them up because there was just no easy way of transporting them. 

I'm not in the market for a new vehicle just for transporting things every other weekend. I also don't have that much space to just buy a ton of material at once with a rental truck and store it all. 

Ideally, I could somehow move 5 or so long 2x4's and sheets of plywood easily every other weekend or so where I can work on them to my desire in my garage.

One option I've considered is that my car does have a class I hitch attached that I've been using for a bike rack. Would it be possible to buy a small trailer?

239,"I'm 26 years old, currently living with my parents, and excited to move out and gain a new level of independence soon. However, I feel very ambivalent about where exactly to go.

On the one hand, I'm a strong introvert, and I treasure my time in solitude. I also prefer a rural setting to an urban setting. For these reasons, I often find myself fantasizing about living alone in a quaint little cottage off the beaten road somewhere. I'm not tied to any particular location by my job; I've worked in the past as a private math tutor, so I can live anywhere I can find clients.

However, a major goal of mine (or what *should* be a major goal, at least...) is to work on improving my social life, which is seriously lacking. I don't know anyone locally outside of my immediate family that I could even call a ""friend"". I've never experienced a romance. So, I'm wondering if I should find a home in the city for better access to social opportunities like clubs. Then I'd probably be forced to split rent with strangers, which sounds kind of terrible, but may itself be a way to make friends if I'm lucky.

So, my question is, should I forget about social life, and take the attitude that the right people will come into my life at the right time if I simply go wherever the heck I want to go?

241,"I'm 22, living with my grandfather while working a part time job. I was attending university but I took a year off after sophomore year due to various mental health issues. I went back junior year and ended up leaving mid-spring semester due to the same reasons. I couldn't function in that environment.

I feel much more stable now, emotionally and mentally speaking and I was very seriously considering never going back to school. But there's a part of me that thinks it's important to finish what I started. I never really nailed down exactly what I wanted to study but I've had a lot of time to think during my time off and I know what I'd like to focus on now. It's not really what I initially entered school for so I'd basically be like a freshman again, course-wise.

Let me start from the beginning.

I left high school a nervous wreck and went into college thinking things would be different. They kinda were. I worked as a tutor for the school and my coworker was super cute. We started talking and quickly became friends. Turns out that even though we're not into the same stuff, we get along super well. There's a lot of nights where I stay in her dorm watching movies and talking with her until 4 in the morning. I sit shoulder to shoulder with her every night that we do this. Back then I had zero self confidence, and while I understand it was stupid now, I had the misconception that she didn't want to spend time with me. That I was kinda just socially obligating her to. This prevented me from ever divulging my feelings to her. I even went so far as to assume she really didn't like me.

By the end of our first year of college together, I met this other girl and got with her. It was my first relationship, so after I lost my virginity I was sorta trapped in that relationship. ""First love"" and all that. It was a horrible relationship, and she tried to turn me against girl #1 the entire time. After six months of that bullshit, I left her and honestly I still felt a lot of feelings for girl #1 the entire time. During my depression that followed the end of that relationship, girl #1 helped me through it. And I made the questionable decision of telling her how I felt about her, to which she replied that she was flattered, but that she was asexual. Things were a little awkward, but we talked about how we could be even better friends now that everything is out in the open. I literally bawled my eyes out after she left, worse than I did after breaking off that relationship.

We hung out a couple more times, but not nearly as much as we used to, and I found another girl. She wasn't horrible but not great either, and after nine months, that relationship ended pretty mutually. Through that entire relationship I was still thinking about girl #1. And me and her haven't talked since May. I'm still thinking about her and trying to make since of my feelings and I just don't know what to do, I think I love her.

There's a lot to be said, but I'll try to keep it to the point. I've never had a problem with him having this friendship... I trust him completely and it never felt like a threat until this person bombarded me with her neurotic behavior as it related to continuing to be friends with him and her entitlement to his time b/c she needs him and he makes her ""happy."" Not to mention she has her own family thing going on with a fiance and future step-child. 

Basically, it seems like he tried to warn me about her behavior very early on, but also kinda made it seem like there was some stock there... Not that her opinion of me mattered but that us getting along was important. 

Therefore I was cordial, despite the things I knew of her from another mutual friend and things he'd shared. She begin by friending me on fb and initiated conversations with me a few times through messenger and I engaged. However when I initiated a conversation with her, she was very short with me. She went on to ask my bf why was I messaging her, and later admitted that she questioned my motive b/c it felt ""strange"" for me to message her 🤷🏽‍♀️.

Some time later she invites him and I over to her home for a BBQ in which she's has the best of the best of her friends there to size me up. All the while acting like she's Sooooo nervous to be around me. Her petite little friend shakes my hand super aggressively as if she had the ability to intimidate me.

Something came up during the BBQ and she learned that I'd be back in the area visiting family a few weeks later. I receive an invite from her to socialize and I accepted, still trying to be the good GF and give my best effort. Well.... It turns into a shit storm. Somewhere into the night she brings up that she doesn't get enough of bf's time, I fall into the trap and began to probe to try and understand her position and from there go on to tell her in short priorities change and that you can't expect for things to always stay exactly the same. From there she gets SUPER upset and lays out that he should have set the ""precedent"" of what to expect from their relationship!... And lots of other ugly unrealistic negativity. Me still being of rational mind asks (if this is your stance) ""what was all of this for, what did you expect to gain from us spending time together"" at which she scoffs with an heir of superiority (like, I have nothing to gain from you). I then moved to end the night and walked away, while she's still walking with me and still talking while I'm through with the whole thing and was probably very short at this point. What's her very next move???... She calls my bf crying about how's she's ( herself) has ruined everything 🤦🏽‍♀️. ( So, why behave like a crazy person???)

From there, I pretty much dismiss the idea that this person and I are going to be acquaintances but I agree to my bf that I can be cordial. However I also expressed to him that there are certain things that are just unacceptable, and that he can't allow her to disregard our relationship boundaries and that he shouldn't be going out of his way/downplaying aspects if our relationship to make her happy. 

Weeks later, she texts with some""Sorry if I did something..."" the rest is irrelevant b/c it was a bs apology, she started off not acknowledging her wrongdoing. Anyway, I gave a short response knowing that I'd take the time to think about things before really expressing how I felt and I did. I basically said to her that I didn't think the apology was insincere and that she and I were not compatible as friends but that I hoped we could be peaceful and not cause my bf any additional stress from being caught in the middle so to speak....I let him know that I sent said text and hadn't heard back from her.  Weeks go by and I realize that he's talked to her, she shared with him that she didn't read the text (dismissing me once again), and he ""avoided"" telling me about it. At this point, I felt it was very important to have serious talk with him about the situation ( I thought we'd had one after the first incident but I guess my expectations weren't clear). From there I told him that it was something that needed to be addressed head-on.

Months have passed which brings us to this weekend...I know he's been talking to her and then Saturday morning he springs it on me that she's coming to town, she's gonna come by his place and then they're gonna go grab lunch together. I immediately feel hurt and threat. Here's my bf happily carrying on with this person who disrespects me and disregards our relationship. I talk to him after they hang out and I say to him...I haven't forgotten about the text situation or the fact that it hasn't been addressed (by him) as promised... And suddenly I get the news that's he has addressed it with her a mere two weeks ago, however I've heard nothing of it!

And now I'm here... Asking for advice. He's admitted that he hasn't handled things appropriately and has avoided conversations/kept things from me in order to not have arguments. However, I know that I can't continue to deal with this, I've tried to establish an amicable understanding... I've tried handing it over to him... The only two paths under my control are calling it quits or accepting that this is how things are going to be if they remain friends (which actually is not an option for me). He's agreed that change is necessary on his part and how he handles things. Honestly, other than this, our relationship is pretty great... However this is pretty significant to me (him protecting our relationship and his acceptance/excuse making for her behavior) and seems to be recurring.

257,"This all started in September. Had a stroke at 29 years old. Doctors can't figure it out. Caused me to lose my job on December, right before Christmas.

Been using a cane to get around and I have some very bad days. State denied me medical insurance and denied my unemployment.

I had to start a go fund me to get some help with bills/food/etc.

I've been trying so hard to get back into the workforce because they see my cane and instantly discriminate. My career had always been in IT. The things I needed to do would have been done at the same quality, rather just a little slower.

I've been carpet bombing resumes and have only had one call back for a phone interview.

At this point I'm at Rock bottom. Never thought I'd need a GoFundMe ever.

I just don't want to lose everything I've worked for. And I have to make sure my fiancee and our animals are taken care of as well.

258,"This post got a lot longer than I intended, but the most important part is the second half, the 'juicy' part. Also, not sure if this post fits well here, so if not, tell me and I can move it :)

&amp;#x200B;

So back in my second year of college, I didn't have many friends and I met a girl in a class, and we didn't click at first, because shes super religious and that basically instantly makes me less likely to become friends with someone, but we ended up becoming really good friends. At first we studied together a lot because she is really smart and hardworking, and I was working fairly hard for the class, so we were well matched. We eventually spent most of our time together, and became thick as thieves, doing silly shit together all the time. It was a really wholesome friendship for a few months. Despite her being a diehard Trump supporter and a strict Christian, we were able to have civil disagreements and come out the other end unscathed most times. At the end of our 2nd year we decided to live together. We went to the odd frat party, even though I wasn't really into it, and I enveloped myself in her culture because it is a huge part of her identity, and I wanted to be closer to her I guess? I went to **CHURCH** with her and her family. Which is strange for me, I absolutely hate religion, it all seems like a cult to me... But she asked me to go with her, and I agreed and promised I would be respectful, and it went as well as it could have. Idk, I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think I was a pretty loyal friend and I loved her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

We had basically nothing in common except our work-ethic and our majors... but we were like sisters or something, it was crazy. It was like life had chosen for us to be friends, but neither of us had had much choice. Anyway of course that's not true, but it really felt like that sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

*Now for the shitty friend part:*

There were some instances where she would get really stressed out over school and lash out in insane ways, but I'm pretty used to abusive behavior from the people around me, so I didn't really notice, or I wrote it off. For example, one time I suggested the wrong answer to a physics problem and she spent like 5 minutes saying how dumb I was. She didn't really apologize afterwards, but I ignored it anyway. So, the friendship was never perfect, but it was good for the most part until the end of us living together.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I get my financial aid in three different chunks at once over the course of the school year, and that's how I pay my portion of the rent. At the beginning of the three month span, I have massive amounts of money in the bank because its the rent (etc) for the subsequent three months. So, one such month I paid the whole of the rent out of my bank account, and mentioned to her to write me a check for her half of the rent when she got a chance. A few weeks go by and I don't think much of it, and I have more pressing things to deal with, and it's never been a problem before, so I just make a mental note and move on. Finally, a whole month goes by and I ask her for the rent money because I'm starting to run the risk of not being able to pay the rent the next month. She says she doesn't have it all, but she will give me half of it (\~400) and give the rest later. So, I agree and again don't think much of it. We pay the last month's rent and then I have exactly no money left, so I'm starting to get pretty worried about it. I send her a friendly text to remind her and she says she doesn't have the 400 and will have to give me 50 dollars a week until I have it all. Only one problem, (we decided to move into separate houses because we had different living interests) that would take 8 fucking weeks to get it all back to me, and I had to pay rent in like 3 weeks, not to mention feed myself. She continues to be nonchalant about the situation, meanwhile I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to stay in school for the next school year...... I started mentioning it to her more frequently, and I even went as far as to ask her if she could ask her mom for the money (because the woman is a professor at Yale and is a millionaire....). She refused to ask her mom about it, so I tried Ye Olde Appeal to Sympathy trick, saying that I had no idea how I was going to eat for the rest of the month, and I would be kicked out of my new house if I couldn't pay my rent (which were both true).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the actually juicy part:

She then proceeds to tell me that I could just get *free samples* from Trader Joes to feed myself. Or maybe I could open a credit card. Or maybe I could ask my abusive ex boyfriend for the money. Or ask my family (who are all dirt fucking poor and incompetent, and couldn't give me the money if they wanted to). \[does this qualify this post for r/ choosingbeggars?\] She had some other really comically terrible suggestions that I meekly declined. After about 10 minutes worth of those suggestions, she gets exasperated and exclaims that I'm being so combative and shes just trying to help me solve my problem..... (at that point I realized I was in deep shit, and I had been dealing with a possible narcissist for many months)

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, I remained civil and calm, and tried to solve the problem without her help. I complained to another friend about the situation and they offered to lend me the money, so I had a backup plan, but the shitty friend didn't know about it. We ended up moving into our respective new houses and she still hadn't given me my money back. So, I texted her about it a few times and she always put it off a few more days or weeks. Finally I was getting actually **mad** and stopped being as patient. I think I sent a few texts in the same day and she sent one in response saying how BUSY she was and how I shouldn't BOTHER her about it so often! and how if I needed her HELP so badly, I should have been more ON TOP of the situation from the beginning. I reply with the first actually mean message I ever sent her, saying ""I should be more on top of it??? YOU owe ME money, not the other way around!"", and to that she said basically 'Never Speak To Me Or My Son Again'.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my money back finally, and my situation turned out to be ok, but I didn't have a lot to eat for a few weeks and it was really stressful while I was working and going to school at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

So now its been about 4 months since we talked. I was pretty pissed off about it at first, but after a few weeks anger faded to sadness and then I more or less forgot about the incident because I have a lot of other good friends now. But, nevertheless, I kept dreaming about her. Usually the plot of the dream went as follows: we would be forced into a situation together where we had to talk, so I would say something like ' hope you're doing well, I know we didn't end on a good note, but I forgive you and I wish you happiness and good things in this life, and I have love for you in my heart' and then we would move on from the encounter and continue not speaking thereafter.

&amp;#x200B;

My phone sends an emergency message to a few of my contacts if I press the power button three times... Unfortunately she was on this emergency list and I accidentally activated the SOS text a few days ago. She texted back, saying ""Are you ok?"", and I respond apologetically, saying I forgot to take her off the list and it had been a false alarm. She said it was no problem, and she was glad I was ok.  I guess that really made my urge to clear the air intensify, because now I cant stop thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this whole situation signifies a deep-set character flaw in me, but anyway, that's why I need advice. Is it dumb of me to aim for mutual forgiveness? I probably won't get an apology out of her, but I'll settle for acknowledgement of my apology to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice on what to do, as well as psychoanalysis welcome!

To summarize the entire post I've linked there, I've had a rough few months since I started University in the fall. I've been trying my absolute best every goddamm day but my motivation is gone and trying isn't getting me far enough anymore. I know some of the advice some people will give and do I just want to state what I know, what I've tried, and what I am unable to do:

1. I have and am seeking professional mental and academic help constantly.
2. Lots of people will recommend taking a semester off, I can't do that since residence is paid in full in fall and I don't have the money to pay for 4 months rent and food somewhere I am not living. I am only taking 4 classes and planning on dropping out after this semester but I want to at least try in the 4 classes I have for the next 4 months.
3. I have talked to residence and student services about all of this.
4. I do not have family I can get help from and I have pushed away all my friends, my attempt to reach out to my closest friend ended poorly and I now have no one at all.
5. If anyone reads the post I've linked and gets the impression that these issues are strictly because I'm a recovering addict, I don't think that's the case myself.

280,"Hello, r/Advice.  


My name is Michael and I'm confused about myself and my future. 

I will really appreciate all your tips and any help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you a little story.  I'm 23 y.o. white male and I have some issues in life. As I can tell the biggest one is my fear of action and moving forward in life. At July 2017 I got my Bachelor degree at Management (profiled Marketing), stashed my diploma on a shelf and.. kept doing nothing. I remember being saddest version of myself ever, walking around the block like a ghost and sitting on my bum behind PC playing video games and listening to music. I didn't want to change anything as I was concerned about my life being shitty and hopeless, me being useless and worthless aswell.

Most of that came from my dad who is addicted to drinking. He used to put me and my mom down, mocking us, calling us names, threating with punches, questioning our abilities, our self-worth. Basically, he was a dick. He treat me like a useless scum, never really taught me about life, men code, how to do anything in life. 

I could live without his tips since there are lots of kind people around ready to help you BUT he always put me down, treat my failures as ultimate fails and biggest dramas. A bullied boy inside me believes that dad stood between me and better life. I always looked up for the image of masculine, confident and calm men (parental issues, you know) and end up being polite, calm, &gt;&gt;&gt; and weak, soft, non-confident and not-ready to do big things. All that led me to start hating him, I understand that his approach is completely sick and I'll never act like this with children. \[At that point I understand that I blame HIM, but should've blamed MYSELF firstly for such reaction on his actions\].

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I'm an average (give or take) looking guy, wearing speks (those worn by hipsters), muscular for my build and bone structure, with normal sense of style (nothing fancy), 171 cm. Been into gym since I've become freshman in my uni.

Btw, in December 2017 I was taken by Russiаn Armed Forces to serve that country for 12 months (yes, I'm Russian :| ). Somehow I felt good and in an exclusively-manly company. I was out-going, confident, just like old times before an uni. Then at February 2017 I was recruited to work at office for officers and this is where I shined. My PC software skills, fast typing, knowledge of modern technologies and computers came in handy. Not to mention my personal qualities like an accountability, an ability to multi-tasking, an ability to work till the end, fast learning. However despite that great year spent in RAF my old problems strike back as I retired at December 2018...

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue is about unpredictable changes in my perception of reality and perception of myself. One day I can feel great and motivated (yet I won't do sh\*t, just walking around being driven), and later this evening I'll be upset as hell because of this and because of that. Usually my anxiety and fears are striking like this: ""What if I can't do something I'll be asked to do at job?""  ""What job should I apply? I can't do shit"" ""I'll be definitely laughed at as a 23 y.o. guy with so little job experience"" ""My life sucks I want to go outta this country, maybe that will help"" ""I'm just scared to go anywhere to work"".

I used to dream to move somewhere and live at beautiful cities, at warm climate, driving something from my favourite car garage, doing something cool for a living. Then it all disappeared. I have some grounded dreams like getting a ride, getting a new laptop, acquiring my first case of investments, being able to help my mother financially so she doesn't need to work as hard as she used to and other. But I always end up like: ""Ok, but the other day. I feel good and powerful enough to do at least something but.. not this time"". And I'm back to video games and old routine. I'm really tired of this, it feels like there are two souls inside of me. The one is ready to do things, he wants to be somebody, he wants to help people, to earn money and build his life and life of those around. The other one is like a boy forbidden by his elders. He doesn't know where to go and what to do, he can only follow old path of routine made years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, as I am writing this, I am unemployed, can't make moves to find a job, sitting behind a screen, monitoring job sites and pretending to do something. Still zero action. I'm also trying to get some money by freelancing at UpWork but it didn't work out for me yet. I write my approvals for any job including translations from RU to EN and vice versa but ppl do not review me as a potential worker. 

My real job experience includes 3 months of summer full-time job at car service, that makes me sick too; I'm ashamed by this. However as I found out I am capable to do big things (Like my service in RAF; but only when there is a constant pressure? God, I can't understand that).

Guys, any tips? Have you ever been in a situation like this? Maybe your relatives or friends have been there? Feel like I need some serious help otherwise I'll be stuck in that hole forever.

I've been in a relationship since I've been 18. It's been 4 years since then. I met him on a popular hookup app. It was supposed to be a one night stand. We went on a date the next day, and it's been four years since then. At year 3, he proposed and I accepted. There's an age difference, a bit over 10 years. He is professional and established. I'm only getting my life together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting bored. Recently, I haven't been totally involved. I've been sleeping with other people. Attention from people at work has prompted me to believe that I should not have settled so quickly. I know that I am good looking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm missing out. Especially since I'm in my early 20's. I want to have fun and experience life. With him, I don't think I can. He wants kids soon, I can't make that commitment. It would be a huge inconvenience if we were to split. We live together, he pays for rent and all that. I pay for food, groceries and some other things. It's a really perfect relationship I'm just not happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been talking to someone from work and we've been hitting it off nicely. He's around my age and we have similar interests but all we've done is hookup, some chatting but not enough. I'm attached already and wouldn't be able to go on 'dates' and stuff with him, since, well, I'm already in a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know what I should do. I want to experience life without being held down by someone. I want to make love to other people without having the guilt that I feel when cheating. If I leave him, I will have to find a new place to live and our pets will have to be split up. It's all so much to think about but this has really been weighing me down for months now. I just want some guidance. ",21Jan2019,1

294,"Hi all. So I have a bit of s personal problem I could use some advice on. 

To start off, I’m 23 years old and female. I have dated a little in the past, in college and otherwise, but it never got around to the sex stage. The reason for this is during college I was mainly focused on my studies so didn’t taking dating very seriously. After that, I was involved with a man who didn’t seem to be able to commit to me so we never got to being serious it exclusive. 

Anyway. There’s one guy I got really close to in college, we knew each other for more than a year. We took 2 classes in 2 different semesters together, and we had a group project together the last one. We obviously liked each other, got along well, even went for drinks once. He’d drive me around in his car and pick me up and drop me off for our project stuff. He was very nice and the first guy to really give me any real attention. I trusted him. I wanted to ask him out but because we were working on the project together, it wasn’t really feasible. 

I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. I vented to him a little on the surface and he listened to me. He vented a little to me about his life problems too. At the end of the semester, when the project was over, I texted him something to do with one of my personal problems. I told him how I was leaving my sister’s place who I was staying at because her and I were fighting. I also tried calling him. He replied back saying sorry he can’t talk now, he’s out with his girlfriend. 

I had no idea about any girlfriend, he never mentioned her before at all. So I do feel he brought her up as an excuse to not have to deal with my problems. I just said no worries we can talk some other time or something similar, and I stopped messaging him. I was really quite gutted and devastated. 

That was a years and half ago. I’m about to return to my conservative country, where open dating and sex isn’t really allowed. Well, it’s not too bad, there are open-minded people as well as expats there; however who knows if I’d find someone like-minded. It’s still a Muslim country. The reason why I’m going is for a break and to visit my family and best friends. I don’t know if I’ll be there forever. However, I’m still a virgin and want to lose my virginity beforehand just in case. I don’t want to sleep with anyone I don’t know and trust, and this is where this guy comes in. He’s the only guy I’ve ever really known for and gotten close to over a long period of time. 

I want to text him to see if he’s still around/single and to ask this favour of him, to take my virginity from me. But I’m worried he’d view it as very weird or something (I know it’s a bit of a weird request). Worse yet, what if he’s taken?

What should I do in this situation? How do I text this guy about this, and should I even do so? I’d appreciate any advice, thanks so much. ",21Jan2019,1

297,"Long post... sorry

Been seeing this girl for almost 2 months. Going well until.... a week a go we get drunk. She tells me she thinks things aren't going to work out. She says everything is feeling ""too serious"" and that going out on dates is pretty stressful for her and she doesn't want something serious so quickly. 

I tell her I only took her out on fancy dates because that's what I thought she wanted and that I also want to take it slow. She still says she doesn't think it'll work out. She's black out drunk and falls asleep. I lay next to her till she wakes up an hour later and says she doesn't remember what happened. After again repeating she's not sure whether it's going to work out, we have sex. Afterwards she says she's sorry and that we will keep hanging out. She drives me back home.

Next morning she sends an apology text asking me to forget what happened. I figure that she was really drunk and that I'll give it another shot. We hang out again a couple days later and talk more. She asks me whether or not my feelings for her are solely physical. I tell her they are not and that I do care about her and want to get to know her more. She claims this is ""a relief"" for her and she spends the night at my place.

Everything seems fine. I figured she was just afraid about entering a relationship. She texts me over the weekend with random pictures and videos and stuff and I cordially reply. 

Earlier today I ask her if she wants to hang out tomorrow. She says yes before later sending me a text saying she can't hang out. I say no worries and tell her to let me know whenever she wants to hang out again. She replies, ""no, can't."" I ask her if everything is okay and she says everything is fine. I try to pry and tell her that I'd like to talk with her if she's feeling uneasy about things.

She reads my text and then replies 6 hours later saying that ""we are chillin"" and that she was just high. I didn't reply.

I've never been so confused. What in the hell is she trying to get across here? What does she want? Is she just fucking with me? Is it worth my time to meet up with her again and try to figure it out? I'm tired of playing games. I like her, but this is all too much for me and it's a really big red flag for me. Is it worth giving another chance or should I move on?",21Jan2019,1

300,"Hello, this maybe trivial and the answer may seem very straight forward but due to bias and clouded thoughts.  


I am a M26 who attended college about 100-200miles away from my hometown. I met my wonderful girlfriend (F25) at school and we are almost 5th year into our relationship.   


My dad has a business within logistics and did pretty well for himself. After college, I was accepted to a graduate program nearby my hometown. Due to my mother's infidelity and eventual divorce my dad became extremely anxious and depressed which made me quit the program a semester into it.   


During this time my relationship with my girlfriend was damaged due to the distance and my constant anxiety from sham-wowing my dad's anxiety. My attempt to fix the relationship was moot as she wanted something much more closer and not long distance. In order to both extract myself from my family issues and being closer to my girlfriend, I decided to move to her city (which is where we both attended our undergraduate in).   


First year and half was fine as I was working for a reputable insurance company and was able to live comfortably. However due to issues with immediate management, I had to leave the position and secured another one position this time with a law firm. I was unfortunately unsuccessful and is now out of work as of two weeks ago.  


My predicament is this, my dad who is now older and thankfully much stable, wants me to work for his business partners to eventually take over the business and live with him. Due to the cost of living in the neighborhood I live in, my savings were dry and due to student loans my debt is still not yet fully paid.   


My girlfriend who is much more mature and understanding, wants me to try to find a job nearby our house, but understands if I want to move back home to continue my dad's business, that it is okay to do so. She has no interest in moving to my hometown due to her family obligations.  


My fear is the long distance portion as what has happened before. I know my girlfriend is much more mature and she now understands much more, I still fear what happened in the past to happen again.  


**Should I start to take over my family business and risk my relationship or should I give up what I could possibly have and pursue the relationship?**

&amp;#x200B;

Couple things to note:  


I don't mind taking over my dad's business. I can see the profitability and I have an interest in doing it.  
I had ambitions working in the legal profession, however after dipping my toe in it, I had cold feet and now thinking otherwise.

For me, marriage with my girlfriend is definitely an option and I could see myself with her.  
I also know realistically, working in my current city, I don't feel that I would be successful financially as if I was working or taking over the family business.   


If anythings unclear, I would be happy to clarify. Thank you for reading my rant/cryforhelp. ",21Jan2019,1
301,"I'm a 23 year old female. I have a happy life with good family and a few good friends. Today, at a medical check up the doctor told me they found cancer cells in my womb. To be honest, I wasn't shocked nor scared. It was just, another matter of fact kind of information. 

So the doctor said that if I stopped smoking and drinking, I can love a long life. But if I don't stop, I could die at the age of 35 (12 years from now). 

I'm not planning to kill myself or anything because of some negative shit that happened in my life. But I don't want to grow old either (like be in a wheelchair and depend on people to take care of me) I live everyday doing helping as many people as I can, being happy, enjoying life and growing as a person. I want to continue living as I like (continue drinking or smoking or doing the occasional recreational drug) for as long as I can, and if I die young; so be it. 

People keep telling me it's wrong to want to die young because life has so much more to offer. But in my opinion, I have no intentions of starting a family, growing old with friends, having grandchildren or anything of the sort. 

I agree that my choices are selfish (?) But if I live life to the fullest and don't want to stop my habits because I enjoy them, what's wrong with letting the cancer kill me? Is it wrong to choose to not take care of your body? Is it wrong to want to die happy and young than older? I'm not considering suicide or anything..

306,"Alright so this might end up long winded and verbose in an attempt to accurately describe the situation and how I feel... So I've known this girl for a while (about 4ish, 5ish, 6ish?, years). We recently started geting closer as friends these past few years and even closer these past few months... Like pretty close... I've always had some sort of 'more than friends' feeling for her. Didn't act on it because I was pretty young. Then got older and had already started seeing this other girl (earlier 2018)... That ended pretty bad for me (story for another time I guess). Fast foward... she starts appearing more frequently in my life... coincidence?


It wasn't really until October 2018 (almost four months ago) that I really felt it... and it only grew from there... I found out around October that they (as in her and her family) were moving away mid December (3-4 hours away)... November hit, I realized I need to act fast... We connected a bunch, played some music together (pretty darn cute if I do say so myself), started texting a bunch (lots of feels, ""😉"", ""😊"", ""😁"", ""😆"", ""😂"", ""😅""). Then late November early December things complicate and they end up leaving early, leaving some unfinished things here.


I came up with a really great, sensitive, emotional, thoughtful gift to show her how I felt. It was a book she wanted 'Five Feet Apart'.... fitting right? I had printed some pictures of us, wrote a bunch of notes on the back of each one, and hid them between the pages. I also came up with something pretty darn cute to write inside the cover ""Distance is not measured in miles, but affection. No distance is too far, and no time too long. Distance gives us all the more reason right? There are some bonds no distance can break, I hope ours never will :)"" (and something on the back). Pretty dang slick no? On some of the notes I had brought up the idea of us going out and kinda conveyed how I felt, but at the same time not (not straight up, flat out)... if that makes any sense... Point is if anything was gonna ""make her fall for me"" this would.


She came back (after they had worked out the hiccups) a few times to finish up somethings here... I should mention that most of the time we hang out is with her and her older sister, me and my older sister and a few other people... But this last time only she came back. She texted only me, around 8ish, that she was in town. I had eagerly asked if she wanted to do something. We talked about going out (what seemed to me, just us two, a ""date"")... I was so nervous I was texting a friend for help and suggestions... everything was closed so she eagerly suggested a movie at her house... And I couldn't tell if she was meaning just me or my sister as well. It kinda seemed that way, but I didn't want to ruin anything had she wanted a specific way... So I invite my sister (to the enragement of my other friend) and we watch a movie at her house. It was then I gave her that gift.


Fast forward a little while, she opens it, says it was the most thoughtful thing... Not exactly what I hoped she would say... Fast forward a day or two, she tells me how much she enjoys me and compared me to chocolate. Cute right?... Fast forward a day or two, she tells me about how, in the book, the girl finds a really cute creative way to ask the guy out. And how she wished she was able to do something like that. To which I replied with how I wished I was able to do that. She then tells me that ""Idk I thought you had did a pretty great job with the book 😉""...


The next day she talks about the end of the book and tells me shes excited for the movie. I said that I didnt know if I would enjoy the movie based off how the book ended. And said that there was really one way for me to find out... She then suggested either reading the book or watching the movie both of which she wanted me to do with her ""😉""...




TL;DR: So here I am now 3:14 A.M. Seeking the help of random strangers... after a bunch of somewhat hinting texts and encounters, and mixed emotions and signs... I mentioned in my story above some big things that I thought might be signs, but I am terrible at picking up hints... especially after what my last experience was :/. I know we're young, but I could wait (but for that I need to know how she feels)... We're almost out of high school and this is something I want in life... I think it's somthing I should pursue... But I don't want to ruin anything. Should I tell her? Should I wait a little while? How should I tell her? I dont know what to do...




P.S. I'm hoping maybe I could tell her face to face IF I'm able to see her again soon (alone)... maybe at the movie she wanted to watch with me?...",21Jan2019,1

310,"to me the prospect of becoming a psychologist is perfect on an intellectual level, I am naturally inclined to intense introspection which has given me a very in depth view of the psyche and I enjoy learning about the science of psychology and I am sure I that finding a job that allows me to view the depths of other peoples psyches and help them would be fulfilling and would give my life meaning that is bigger than myself which I desperately need.... but, I find the amount of money colleges are charging to be horrendous and with the turbulent political state of most universities and the increasing bias and bullshiting that is running rampant in the social sciences It makes the choice a little harder, its also a value conflict, I want to help others as a therapist because intellectually it sounds perfect, but I dont want to fund these overpriced institutions and contribute to their spread these pathological ideologys. Now heres where the art comes in, with art I am driven like a madman, I am new to visual art but I have done other forms of art in the past (Standup comedy, close up magician) standup was all creativity (4 open mics a night every night for over a year, writing in head most of the day and writing on paper 2 hours a day)  and magic was all dexterity based (5-8 hours of practice a day for a year straight), and visual art adds those two elements that made me obsessed, I am not a good student I am highly unmodivated to do the work, but with visual art granted im very new (only serious now for 3 weeks) I feel like an addict, I have stayed up for days on my art doing studys, perspective, anatomy, gesture yada yada yada. when I cant draw I grow restless and anxious and I have to observe the world around me and try to study life to calm me, I dont sleep anymore, which isnt smart because sleep consolodates memorys so its actually hurting me, but I cant help it I need to draw. I am a highly imaginative person and I have had some very dark traumatic experiances which adds to my art and my deep knowledge of human nature and my compulsivity towards practice I think I could be a decent artist, freelance or illustration I dont know yet. also when I did art a year ago, 5 months in I was able to make drawings that when posted people thought was a photograph untill they looked closer and I was able to create some pretty cool original dark art that when posted on my main account went to the top of a few myers briggs pages, so I do believe I have the talent necessary to have a chance. I am learning now that if im not pursuing something creative I half ass it and I feel like a fucking loser and Im depressed and fall behind (in school currently in CC im a C average, A in psych courses) but when I pursue something creative I work myself to death and I am confident I can outwork anyone because I got enough low self esteem and perfectionism issues and enough repressed rage and a love for isolation while also wanting to be understood and a desire to bury myself into my obsessions to avoid my terrible mental health state and the love for the reprieve of creating with my hands that I could make it as an artist. though only problem is, is I dont fucking know why I want to do art, I just like it, and for someone who needs to analyze every decision, just liking it isnt enough, im trying to accept that my unconscious mind is smarter than my conscious so I should just do what I feel but I fear if I pursue art I wont be pursuing something meaningful and I would regret not becoming a therapist ",21Jan2019,1

318,"Please help me out here, it’s gotten pretty bad and I feel absolutely horrible, but I am finding it extremely challenging to stop. 

I am 21 years old and moved back into my parents house a year ago. Since then I have been consistently attending school and working in all of my free time. I make minimum wage and can barely afford to properly feed myself. Actually going out and buying groceries is like an event for me now as I’m only able to do that if I’ve had a good week at work and can spare the money. 

I am stressed out, burnt out, always hungry, and always sleep deprived. Around 9 months ago, I had the idea to take my mother’s debit card in the middle of the night and fill up the gas in my car while she was asleep to give myself some sort of financial break, as my car is old and eats up a lot of gas (and I have to commute a lot) and have been doing it a minimum of twice a month since. It used to not bother me at all, as I do not have an actual healthy relationship with my parents, so I had an immature sort of “fuck it” attitude towards what I was doing. 

I guess I’ve maybe (hopefully) matured some since, because now I feel absolutely despicable. I just got home around 10 minutes ago from the gas station tonight and I’m so stressed out and disgusted with myself I think I’m going to cry. I think since I’ve actually had to become an adult and the reality that I’m actually having to work hard for my money just to live has fully set in, I’ve realized that they are working just as hard each day as I am to pay for their own bills and groceries and debts and gas and no matter my relationship with them, I am not entitled to their money. 

I truly loathe myself right now and want to stop. I feel like a dirty lowlife thief, and the paranoia of getting caught is in full force as well, because realistically the longer I keep doing this the more and more likely I am to get caught and the longer it goes on the more damaging it will be. Plus the longer it goes on the more they lose and the more miserable I feel. 

But I cannot stop the urge to do it, it is so tempting because having that slight bit of financial break relieves a nice bit stress that I have concerning money right now- it’s like a quick breath of fresh air. I find myself in the cycle of thinking “okay, I cannot do this anymore”, to “okay, this will be the last time- they won’t know”, to “what am I doing, this isn’t right” and the self loathing becomes stronger and stronger each time but the cycle continues and I do not yet have the life experience to know how to break it on my own. As much relief it would bring me to come clean to them, realistically this is really not an option as I would be kicked out immediately and back to living out of my car.

I really want to talk to her in person, but I’m scared that I won’t find a subject to talk about.

329,"Okay so I’m friends with a guy, A, who is in a long term committed relationship with M. They’ve dated since college and have been together for seven years. They’re currently long distance, but M is moving here in the near future. She won’t really have a job here and her field isn’t exactly super easy to break into but she’s coming to close the gap and make it work. She loves him a lot.

Anyway, last Friday I was out and ran into him. We were hanging out when another friend of mine dropped by with friends of hers. One of the girls knew A and after they left he told me that that girl, let’s call her B, had been in his MBA and had hit on him pretty aggressively. That he had to push her back. He was very keen on explaining that she had hit on him and how aggressive she was.

I didn’t think anything of it and eventually he left. A little after he left my friend stopped by to say bye and B asked me if he had left. I said yeah. She came back like three minutes later to ask if he was coming back and after I said I didn’t think so, she came back a bit later to ask in what direction he had gone.

I thought this was really weird and it seemed to match his story but I had coffee with my friend on Sunday and she told me that A and B hooked up several times during the MBA and have hooked up several times here (the MBA was in the different country and well over a year ago).

They hooked up that night and she left to go meet him at his house. My friend has no reason to lie to me and she was just pissed that he was ignoring her in public like that and then booty called her. Apparently he treats her like trash but they hook up regularly over months and months. She’s super in love and wasn’t sure he had a girlfriend.

Like... tbh I know I don’t have all the facts and I had heard from others that he strayed but this happened while I was there. His girlfriend is amazing and I’m sure they have their issues but she’s moving to our country and uprooting her life for this guy. And he’s doing this. This is disgusting.

331,"Hello r/Advice.

I made this account to begin my new life after being given a rare chance. I'm 22 years old and I struggled with schizotypal bipolar disorder and chronic depression since 2009. After graduating in 2013, and spending some of my worst years floundering in uni, I woke up after a particularly harsh episode in May 2018 in which I tried suicide with near death. I was at uni, in my apartement alone, and I'm grateful to have survived. After that day things changed. I didnt hear voices anymore, and at first I felt oddly alone and deathly afraid. I had taken my doctor's advice and started talking to people again and somehow managed to attract my wonderful, supportive  girlfriend, and one of the 2 voices had been replaced by hers. (The other was mine, it was confusing af during an episode.) It was gone too, and there's no mistaking true silence for the facade I learned to embrace. I hadn't been level in almost a decade at that point. I was truly free. I dont understand it, neither does the doctor, but I'm not denying four reevaluations. 

 Since May I've learned to express my emotions, talk to strangers, face fear, and remain calm. But I've realised that I'm out of scholarships, out of money, and have to find a way to support myself. I've also realised I'm significantly behind quite literally most everyone else at my age. I haven't learned life skills, I have no skills that can translate into a career yet, and I think that if I am forced to do something I hate so soon I may return to that state. I want to build my life slowly to prevent going back. I know I have a very high chance of becoming mad again in old age, but I couldn't weather it now realising I have been given the rarest opportunity I could've. 

I know I enjoy athleticism, coding, writing, and video games since they were my escape from my problems and abusive people. I dont know if I could have a sustainable career with those interests at this age, which is still young but old enough for the world to pass one by. What could I do?

334,"In my life I would say I've had 3 friends that I truly cared about. The first I knew since we were 2. I considered her my best friend until high school. While in school I learned that she was constantly spreading stories about me that weren't true, and we stopped talking. The second I met in middle school, I actually switched schools at one point to help her get through it (she was dyslexic and had ADHD and I would help her focus). It was only at the end of my senior year that I realized she was just using me to do her work. once we graduated I never heard from her unless she wanted something from me. The last I made in high school, we had a rocky on and off friendship. She was just making alot of bad life choices, and I guess she didn't like the advice I was giving her. I'll admit that this one may have been my fault, but I really was just looking out for her. I had suspicions that her boyfriend only wanted her to move in so he could pay his rent. Him dumping her once he got a new roommate validated those suspicions, but we still have not spoke at all since then. I've tried making amends with all of them, but I struggled to trust them like I did before so it never went anywhere. Basically ever since this has happened I cant bring myself to be close with other women. I have this feeling that they're going to take advantage of me or stab me in the back eventually. I know that it's ridiculous but I cant help it. I'm still a friendly person, but anytime someone starts hanging out with me often I will slowly stop speaking to them. I'm not sure what I should do.

339,"TLDR at bottom

I’ve recently gone through a breakup with my girlfriend of 9 months, and I’ve completely lost all sleep as a result.


To sum it up as best I can, I posted on reddit talking about how I thought I was unhappy sexually with our relationship, as my brain was spinning and twisting my thoughts making me think that the other people I saw in my everyday life that I considered objectively “hotter” than my girlfriend were people that I was more attracted to. I now know there’s a huge difference between the two, but I didn’t at the time, and since I was too ashamed to talk to anyone, I posted to reddit. My language use and description of my feelings were terribly mean and descriptive, and the more I look at it now (on screenshots since I deleted the post, which a day after originally creating it I thought I had) the worse it looks and the more I realize how terrible it was. Really immature and stupid on my part for not seeing the great thing I had in front of me that was genuinely making me the most happy I had ever been, but that’s besides the point. Anyways she found it about a month and a half later and we broke up. My ex says she feels insecure about her body now, something she hasn’t felt in years, and that really breaks my heart hearing. I’m well aware now how much I hurt her, and it sucks because the whole post was out of a place of immaturity and confusion. I never wanted to lose her, she’s literally the girl of my dreams. I’m a very commitment phobic person with a lot of trust issues (as is she), and so not a lot of people know a lot about me. I can confidently say she knows more about me than my own parents do (in terms of who I am now). I do know that I wasn’t planning on going anywhere anytime soon, as we were starting to introduce each other to extended family and it was all going so well until she found the post. She doesn’t believe me when I say I’ve never been more attracted to a single person than I am to her, but I can’t blame her. What I did was terrible, and I understand fully why we can’t be together. I hope time heals things and we can start anew because I know how much I love her and how much she loved me, so I hope things work out but I know more than likely I have to move on. That’s what I’m trying to do now, I’m distancing myself from her for a little while so I can learn to be my own person (we were really co-dependent for the last 4 months of our relationship, which fucking hurts realizing now). I’m going to therapy for a few reasons (some involving our relationship, some not) and I’m really working on myself for the next little while, but I’m just having trouble getting used to being alone all the time. I really mean it when I say co-dependent, she basically lived with me. She was my best friend, and I’ve never been attracted to a single person more than I am to her. That’s why it all sucks, because neither of us wanted this to happen. 


Anyways, the thing I need advice on is sleeping tips. I’ve always suffered from minor insomnia (if I tried to sleep for 8 hours in the past, I’d probably get about 5 1/2 while waking up multiple times a night), but it’s all gotten worse. I get 2-4 hours of sleep a night depending on the day, and I’m constantly tossing and turning because I can’t stop thinking of her and what I’ve done. It doesn’t ever leave my brain unless I’m ridiculously high (I’m in Canada it’s legal), and I don’t want to rely on weed to go to sleep. I used to love coffee, now I feel like I live on coffee. Any advice on things I can do to try and improve my sleep quality during this whole aftershock phase of the breakup? I really appreciate it.

I started a new “proper” job back in December - that is, a 9-5 Monday-Friday and not retail job. I didn’t actually apply for this position, but rather for another completely different position within the same company. Needless to say I didn’t get the original position, but when I was considered for this one and offered it, I took it, thinking it would be stupid to turn down an offer in such a big company. 

Cut to now, it’s awful. I’ve had no handover (this position is a maternity cover), next to no help from the woman I’ve taken over from who has subsequently now left for a year, I’ve had no training, and I keep getting left on my own. What I’m doing is something I have NEVER done before - literally I’ve come from a retail background exclusively, and I have a degree. That’s it.

My housemate texted me while I was at work what seemed to be a ‘goodbye’ suicidal message. As she has admitted me that she has had mental health issues in the past (and is currently taking antidepressants) I was concerned, especially when she did not respond to my texts or answer my phone calls. Rushed home to find her in the bathtub with a knife in the process of cutting her wrists. Immediately removed the knife from her possession, wrapped her wrists and called the paramedics. She was crying and quite intoxicated and there were half empty pill packets lying on the ground (neurofen and Sudafed). 

Granted, the cuts were very shallow and she was barely bleeding but it was still a very confronting thing to walk in on and have to deal with. The paramedics let her get dressed and took her to the hospital but she tried to refuse to go and kept saying she just needed to ‘relieve some pressure’ and ‘feel something’. They wouldn’t let me come in the ambulance but I followed shortly after when I had collected myself. They apparently had her wait in the waiting room and she got annoyed so she just left and walked home. She refused to let me take her back to the hospital. 

No one rang to see if she was okay or to follow up with her to make sure nothing happened. They just let her walk out of the hospital. 

Since she got home it has been 100% denial. I get that. It’s probably her way of coping and I understand. But what am I supposed to do now? I am so shit at talking about feelings and I’m introverted with a high level of anxiety on a good day. I am tired all the time and I feel like there’s this huge knot in my stomach. I’m not trying to make this about me but what am I supposed to do? It is so awkward and uncomfortable and the one time we tried to have a discussion about what happened I got so mad at her because she kept asking like it wasn’t that serious it was just a ‘release’.

I got a goodbye text. I rushed home from work to find her in the bathtub cutting her wrist. That’s not a release. 

She’s started speaking to her old psychiatrist (psychologist? Not sure which) and had a standing Skype session once a week for an hour (she’s had one so far). So that’s at least one step in the right direction. 

I feel like I’m her parent or babysitter and I’m walking on eggshells all the time now. What am I supposed to do? Move out? I love it here and we were great housemates until this happened - got along great and hung out all the time with no problems.

358,"My close friend (M/15) is drinking alcohol. Last night he posted on his snapchat story of him with 3 other friends, with around 10-15 bottles of alcohol and subsequent videos of him visibly drunk (slurred voice, shouting etc). At first I didn't think too much of it, perhaps drunk off the atmosphere (?) but this morning i woke up to a call from him asking me to have lunch together at this restaurant. I ask him why and he says something along the lines of ""It's good food for hangovers"". Something about that line, probably his nonchalance to the fact that he was drinking underage pissed me off, so i hung up on him then. I haven't spoken to him since, and he seems to have recovered from the alcohol. Honestly, im not sure whether i should speak to him seriously about it, for im sure there are plenty of people our age who drink/have drunk before and im probably making a big deal out of nothing. Though, the thing that bothers me is that one of the 3 friends has a pretty bad reputation, and there are rumours saying that she smokes cigarettes and probably a lot of other things. Knowing my friend, i feel he would be easily influenced into smoking, drugs, etc. I'm not the best with verbal advice and i feel that he may get annoyed at me if i try to bring it up. Should I intervene before things possibly get worse or am I just overreacting?

359,"So here it is. Just to give some background: I work in the costume department for a major tv show. I’m the lowest on the totem pole in my department. Im a costume production assistant.

I require a car for my job, since i drive and pick up a lot, so they provide a company rental car for me. 
However, on this job there are 3 of us all with cars. 1 or 2 of us are out for the whole day doing runs, and one is usually in the office for the day, doesn’t use the car at all. 

We are allowed to take the car home at the end of the day (but can’t use it) since we all work about 12 hours a day. 

Anyway, today was the first day I called out sick without any warning previous. The other time U called in sick was the day after I left early because I knew I was getting sick and left the car so i could stay home. 

The response i got from my supervisor , was I needed to come in anyway so they can have the car. But my sick day isn’t a sick normal day. It’s so painful I can’t move at all. They want me to drive even though i can barely walk. 

Another weird thing: they will have two other people with two other cars. This third car i have won’t even be used. 

But strangely enough, other people have called out with the car and were able to stay home. I am being penalized for some reason. I suspect it’s because she is best friends with one of them, and the other girl she really wants to impress and make her friend. 

I’ve been on this job for 7 months, should i quit and find another job? Or do they have a point that i need to come in just for the car that won’t be used?

360,"Edited to add short version... Please advise. 

I'm a 35F, I met my bf after separating from my now ex husband back in Oct 2017 and we've dated since. He has this ex, they dated for 5 years when he was in his 20s, the relationship ended 10 years ago and they have remained friends. (FYI-- we're all the same age)

There's a lot to be said, but I'll try to keep it to the point. I've never had a problem with him having this friendship... I trust him completely and it never felt like a threat until this person bombarded me with her neurotic behavior as it related to continuing to be friends with him and her entitlement to his time b/c she needs him and he makes her ""happy."" Not to mention she has her own family thing going on with a fiance and future step-child. 

Basically, it seems like he tried to warn me about her behavior very early on, but also kinda made it seem like there was some stock there... Not that her opinion of me mattered but that us getting along was important. 

Therefore I was cordial, despite the things I knew of her from another mutual friend and things he'd shared. She begin by friending me on fb and initiated conversations with me a few times through messenger and I engaged. However when I initiated a conversation with her, she was very short with me. She went on to ask my bf why was I messaging her, and later admitted that she questioned my motive b/c it felt ""strange"" for me to message her 🤷🏽‍♀️.

Some time later she invites him and I over to her home for a BBQ in which she's has the best of the best of her friends there to size me up. All the while acting like she's Sooooo nervous to be around me. Her petite little friend shakes my hand super aggressively as if she had the ability to intimidate me.

Something came up during the BBQ and she learned that I'd be back in the area visiting family a few weeks later. I receive an invite from her to socialize and I accepted, still trying to be the good GF and give my best effort. Well.... It turns into a shit storm. Somewhere into the night she brings up that she doesn't get enough of bf's time, I fall into the trap and began to probe to try and understand her position and from there go on to tell her in short priorities change and that you can't expect for things to always stay exactly the same. From there she gets SUPER upset and lays out that he should have set the ""precedent"" of what to expect from their relationship!... And lots of other ugly unrealistic negativity. Me still being of rational mind asks (if this is your stance) ""what was all of this for, what did you expect to gain from us spending time together"" at which she scoffs with an heir of superiority (like, I have nothing to gain from you). I then moved to end the night and walked away, while she's still walking with me and still talking while I'm through with the whole thing and was probably very short at this point. What's her very next move???... She calls my bf crying about how's she's ( herself) has ruined everything 🤦🏽‍♀️. ( So, why behave like a crazy person???)

From there, I pretty much dismiss the idea that this person and I are going to be acquaintances but I agree to my bf that I can be cordial. However I also expressed to him that there are certain things that are just unacceptable, and that he can't allow her to disregard our relationship boundaries and that he shouldn't be going out of his way/downplaying aspects if our relationship to make her happy. 

Weeks later, she texts with some""Sorry if I did something..."" the rest is irrelevant b/c it was a bs apology, she started off not acknowledging her wrongdoing. Anyway, I gave a short response knowing that I'd take the time to think about things before really expressing how I felt and I did. I basically said to her that I didn't think the apology was insincere and that she and I were not compatible as friends but that I hoped we could be peaceful and not cause my bf any additional stress from being caught in the middle so to speak....I let him know that I sent said text and hadn't heard back from her.  Weeks go by and I realize that he's talked to her, she shared with him that she didn't read the text (dismissing me once again), and he ""avoided"" telling me about it. At this point, I felt it was very important to have serious talk with him about the situation ( I thought we'd had one after the first incident but I guess my expectations weren't clear). From there I told him that it was something that needed to be addressed head-on.

Months have passed which brings us to this weekend...I know he's been talking to her and then Saturday morning he springs it on me that she's coming to town, she's gonna come by his place and then they're gonna go grab lunch together. I immediately feel hurt and threat. Here's my bf happily carrying on with this person who disrespects me and disregards our relationship. I talk to him after they hang out and I say to him...I haven't forgotten about the text situation or the fact that it hasn't been addressed (by him) as promised... And suddenly I get the news that's he has addressed it with her a mere two weeks ago, however I've heard nothing of it!

And now I'm here... Asking for advice. He's admitted that he hasn't handled things appropriately and has avoided conversations/kept things from me in order to not have arguments. However, I know that I can't continue to deal with this, I've tried to establish an amicable understanding... I've tried handing it over to him... The only two paths under my control are calling it quits or accepting that this is how things are going to be if they remain friends (which actually is not an option for me). He's agreed that change is necessary on his part and how he handles things. Honestly, other than this, our relationship is pretty great... However this is pretty significant to me (him protecting our relationship and his acceptance/excuse making for her behavior) and seems to be recurring.
 
Sorry so long, 
Please tell me what you think from all perspectives.

Short version: bf's female bff/ex openly disregards me, blames me for spending less time with him. He continues to happily engage in this friendship, when I feel she does not have his best interest. He does not appropriately address her behaviors and I'm hurt by it b/c I feel that's he's not upholding his obligation to me/our relationship.",21Jan2019,1
361,"So I was on Tinder and I found a friend of my friend there, I read her bio and it was written something like that: ""I don't use this app too much, you can talk with me on Instagram "".. well I tried to 'Super Like' her (which notify that person on Tinder) but since she doesn't use frequentaly the app I don't know if she saw the notification.

Then I found her on instagram and I sent a ""follow"" solicitation because she has a private user (and she needs to aprove me)

Ok. Now my questions.. if her Tinder bio says she can talk on instagram she is expecting to be ""bothered"" right?

Since I know her friend (but I don't talk with her for a long time) maybe is a good thing right? We have common friends.

368,"So this is going to be a bit more of a general post I guess. I don't know how to format it and I'm really just typing as it comes so here I go.
For the last few months/year, I've been depressed, or getting more and more depressed hence why I don't know when this really started. I smoke a lot of weed, and I mean A LOT, (unless your live somewhere where it's legalized then probably not by comparison). I'm 17 now, male, small-ish, skinny and grew up with quite a lot of abuse going on, not a lot of friends, moved about a lot, not a lot of money.. you get the idea (thought an introduction would be nice for perspective or something). So I started smoking weed 4 years ago, it was kind of a way to make friends, kind of a way to forget about my problems and just something to do and enjoy myself. The biggest problem with where I lived was there wasn't much to do, so we smoked, nearly everyday. You know this went well for a whole new smoker and everything I wasn't spending ANY money as I just didn't have it and was getting nicely blazed. What could go wrong? I started robbing vast amounts of tobacco from my parents (£500 worth) to sell and buy weed. I didn't see a lot of this money as I set up a unsuccessful distribution operation, aka got robbed... This doesn't matter I guess but context. Point is I smoked weed and made it my task to do so, I had motivation, and I was very smart if I can even say that. This was in Bristol as well so I grew up in a generally black crowd smoking and breaking into places. For comparison later on.
Then I moved to Wales, 'the valleys' more specifically, and me being me first thing I did was try to make friends with someone who smoked weed at least. There wasn't many options XD, the kid was a couple years older than me but it didn't matter at the time, still doesn't really. The atmosphere was completely different, it was like driving on a busy motorway just to collapse into the centre of the earth ( like the movie ), anyway, it was calm with lots of mountains and forests around, the people were generally really Welsh by stereotype in the sense they were all inbred asf and thought they're 'ard as nails. So this was the new lot? What else can I do but improvise, adapt, overcome. So I did, but there was still one major problem, there is even less to do around here! Unless I wanted to start playing football or mountain biking, which as a very heavy smoker doesn't sound appetising. So weed I smoked, year passes I get into bongs... Big mistake but I loved it. At this point I smoked anywhere from 1-4g a day between 3 people, bong only. This was my everyday goal, this was what got me out my bed and ready for the day. I move again, coincidentally my smoker buddy moved near me, this was good but neither of us had much money, so once again this got me working, I didn't bother trying to be friends with any of the other kids as they were all dickheads, I did have my small group of 4 people but we weren't even that good of friends. Point is I was quite lonely and had a goal so I didn't need or want to make friends or socialize. I did sell fags in school thought this just created the illusion of socialising, while I never really did it. This was also around the time I started to get depressed.
Soo.. shit happens my parents move back together and I'm living back in the original valley. This time my friend didn't move as well. 
Now I'm faced with a big problem that seemed like a blessing at the time. Getting back to my old group (-1 person +1 person so it stayed the same size), getting back to smoking weed, a lot.. 
Now I was actually socialising, having meaningful conversations and having a good laugh. Year or so passes and I'm halfway through y11, this is when I start getting really lazy ( or depressed I still can't figure it out) and my mind starts slipping. I don't mean going insane, I mean I started forgetting things, lost all motivation, lost a lot of hope (which was the only thing keeping me going for a while), and I lost the will to talk to people, I started to chain smoke my fags even more than before, which were what made me money, often this put me into debt with people/friends/family. I also foolishly chose to but weed except of saving or buying more tobacco on many occasions. I kinda lost my judgment. Ever since my state of mind has just been getting worse to the point where I no longer talk to anyone apart from my family members, while this is still quite rare, and one of my friends, the one I mentioned at the beginning which was a couple years older than me. He is the only person I really talk to and we only really talk when we go out for a fag together or go smoke weed. We also don't all that much as I have no will to talk as well as a big blank in my mind. &lt;- the problem
So as we need 2 to tango this worked because there was 3 of us at the time, if one don't talk the other will, but also if one does talk the other won't. This worked for a while, until my one friends, the better of the two, decided to leave because he caught 'anxiety' which I don't believe for a moment. So then there was 2, I'll speed this one up a little, we just kept smoking like nothing happened or tried to until he one day passed out while I was in a shop and you can imagined what happened but imma tell you anyway, I walk out to see two face, he doesn't know what happened and has a concussion. This happened because he was stoned and was in the shop which was extremely warm. he has passed out a couple times before so this was not the first time. Anyway, he quit. So I'm the last man standing, one won't come out and talk to me because he has anxiety and the other isnt smoking which isnt that much an issue but there isn't too much we share in common. So, all this has led me to have this big blank in my head, I shave no problems talking to people other than I just don't say what I think. It's like my thoughts and words aren't even connected, now this is the problem, everything else was just for context so sorry about that. As you can probably tell there isn't much of a thought pattern as I write this I'm leaving out but parts because I just didn't remember at the time and adding small parts because it would make it flow better or something. I'm noticing this myself but can't do much about it as it is a blank in my head. I am somewhat worried that this could be due to me smoking vast amounts of weed ( in a bong as well) during the brain development period for teens, I'm not a doctor and haven't talked to one so I don't. There's also a lead pellet in my throat after I got shot a year ago, still haven't gone doctors, it shattered my voice box but wasn't too severe so I just hid it while it healed, my parents also don't know they think it was small rock off a tire XD, props shouldn't be laughing but I don't plan to cry about it. That kinda mentality is what I always have, laugh at my problems and issues because why be upset over them? This kinda backfired as it turned me into a bit of a lazy guy, and one of those people that laughs a lot for seemingly no reason. I used to be very intelligent and witty, and I mean very, I was always like a year above my class in most things and it really does worry me when I can't think of something simple as a conversation topic. In case I didn't make this clear which I don't think I did the problem I need help with is my big blank mind and how to motivate myself to think again. So this has like no structure I haven't said much of what I actually wanted to say and said a damn lot..Jesus it's more than I thought. So yea any tips to what could be causing this, and don't bother just telling me what it could be, what I really need is someone to tell me what to do about it. I probably just need some human contact to get me thinking again.. also I don't know if this is even in the right place but if not just comment where and I'll change it, but it's advice I want so this seems good? 
+ I think the reason I can't pin point a problem is because there are so many causes and issues, but this adds to the list so why think like that? Just forget about em.
+If there's anything you want me to explain or elaborate on just say so and I will I don't care what.",21Jan2019,1

371,"So, I’ll try to explain the situation as best I can-

I got a drivers permit and held onto it for a few months, but I never went driving much. Because of this, I would always tuck the permit in a coat pocket of mine, and when I’d go out to drive, I’d just wear that particular coat. 

Today, I was asked to check the expiration date of the permit, and when I went to go look for it, I realized that the jacket I always wore with it inside the pocket was gone. Checking around, I found it in my closet, freshly washed, but checking inside the pocket where I always put the permit, there was only grey colored lint. The assumption I’ve come to is that I let the permit go through the wash without pulling it out, which means I’m not getting it back. 

Currently, I’m stuck without a permit and I have to break it to my mother that I let it get destroyed in the wash somehow. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but I’ve always had a hard time trying to tell her about things because she usually gets extremely upset, no matter how big or small the matter. My fear and her rage combined make breaking this information a much more difficult task than I first thought it would be.

So, Reddit, if you know anything about working around the wrath of parents, your knowledge is appreciated. I don’t want to get in massive trouble over a small mistake, so I’m turning here to see if there’s anything you’ve thought of that I haven’t.

372,"Hi! I'm not usually one to ask about a problem I have. I tend to stick to what I think is the right move and then live with the consequences. This time I'm genuinely stumped on what to do. I'd like to apologise for the wall of text, and I'm thankful to anyone willing to give this a read.

Here's the deal. I've been working for this teeny company (4 employees) for two years now. Coworkers are amazing, boss is less so. The company is in financial trouble, so the boss is pushing everyone to pull their weight. This has been the source of serious anxiety for me, as I keep feeling that I'm always inadequate. 

Today, we got a client who wants one of us to go with her to the US for work (we are in Europe), not more than a week, all expenses paid. Now, we could get subcontractors or do the work ourselves. Boss obviously wants us to work, as that means more money for us. We ask the subcontractors, but all of them have other commitments or families and don't want to leave them. 

That leaves me. I am typically pretty pesimistic, but the client looks sketchy. They don't know the exact time they plan to leave and come back, how much work is to be done, they haven't heard of the ESTA (US visa program) nor that the system is shut down since Trump shut down the government, and also, all the work the client wants to do is with private citizens, not companies.

To be completely honest, I'm genuinely worried about trafficing (tinfoil hat engaged) or at the very least something super sketchy.

373,"Crosspost from r/jobadvice to reach a wider audience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a small family owned and operated business and have been for the past 3 years (throughout my university degree). It's not a career, it's a job that I need to afford rent and groceries and keep my car on the road.

The Good: Decent hours in that I don't have to stay past 7pm or get up before 7am, I work alone, ample downtime during my day \*particularly helpful for a student\*, and I enjoy the actual work that I do/I like our clients.

The Bad: I get paid minimum wage, which is fine for the amount and nature of the work that I do, but since the start of the month my hours have dipped to 38-40 hours bi-weekly which isn't enough to sustain myself on (I think they're punishing me for taking more time off over Christmas than I usually do, I anticipate my hours going back up to normal next schedule but it's stressful in the meantime and not knowing for sure that they will), management is terrible - \*see previous statement\* the stores are run very badly and management can (and has) been pretty abusive to myself and other employees in terms of yelling at and calling us names and just generally conducting themselves unprofessionally.

I like my job overall because the pros have outweighed the cons, but the negatives are really negative right now which has me job hunting. Typically interactions with management tend to be kept to a minimum which is why I can look past the behaviour, but recently over the past 3-4 months I've been having to interact with them more and deal with it more frequently and it's not worth minimum wage.

I was offered (and accepted) another job that pays more than my current one ($12/hr for 5 weeks of training followed by $13.50/hr when I'm on the job and significantly more hours than I'm currently getting), but it's a lot more stressful (for me). It's at a call centre and I will have to do considerably more higher-stress work.

Had a crush on girl, got rejected by her a couple of months ago.

Had an argument with her 2 weeks ago because “I wasn’t doing enough” for a class presentation that literally no one cared about. 

She is known for not doing her work and basically is staying back to do an extra year in college where everyone else is graduating in 3 months. 

The argument was pretty big as I felt picked on by her and felt insulted since she’s literally known for not doing her work and she was telling me to stop being lazy.

Here’s the catch: We haven spoken for a solid 2 weeks now and all of a sudden I’m getting a text from her asking for help. I asked her what it is and then she says “ Nvm alrdy, ahahaha. I found somebody else to do it.”

I don’t know. I felt a little creeped out. Weirded out that she texted me out of the blue asking for help but didn’t tell me what it was. 

What do you guys think ?

380,"Any advice is appreciated, it's the only thing keeping me going.

My boyfriend and I just broke up. He was the type of guy who would express his pure, deep, true love for me so so many times a day, and then a few hours later say he wanted to break up. His reason would always be insignificant ""I feel like I need more time alone to play video games sometimes"". But he didnt know how to communicate. So he would act like everything was great and he was super happy, and then out of the blue everything would come crashing down. 

The first time it happened, we hadn't even had a single real fight. In the middle of choosing where to eat, he was like ""hey I wanna break up"". He called me an hour later and begged to talk, said he acted out of character on impulse. And that what we had was so real. 

In the two weeks following, he held me as a cried, telling him how scared I was to trust and how scared I was it would happen again. He wiped my tears and told me he would never do that, that his main goal was for me to trust him again.

After two weeks, we were texting about when to go workout, and he was being short. I asked him whether everything was ok and he insisted it was, and I told myself I was being paranoid. That morning we cuddled in bed and I asked him if things were good and he said ""yes things are great I would tell you if they werent""

A few minutes later he TEXTED me, ""things are not ok I'm so so sorry"". There was breakup number 2.

After the second time he came begging for me. But it was in such a sincere manner. He told me stories of childhood, how he is different now, how his views on relationships changed and how he knows he loves me with his whole heart. He swore that he would never leave anyone like that ever again, that he is giving himself to me purely, truly, unwaveringly, in a way that hes never given himself to anyone else. 

The last two months since then I have been needy and reassurance seeking. I'm sure this was tiring, and I regret that. But I was untrusting. I would cry daily and ask him if he truly loved me, if he really saw a future. He would assure me that his feelings and desire to be with me have gotten stronger by the day. I told him I was scared he would just get up and leave again without warning and he would spend all of his energy reassuring me that he is right there, that he would never leave me again, and that if we ever broke up it would be after months of fighting. He said I would have to slam a door in his face to get him to leave. He told his mom about me. Whenever he saw I was upset he would grab my face and say ""hey sweetheart, things are great!""

I tried to believe him. He seemed so genuine. I gave him many chances to change his mind, and he always insisted that this was it, that we were what he wanted.

The night we broke up he came to my place. We spent every night together. He was wrapping me in his arms and telling me ""do you know how much I love you""? How would you not believe that? How can someone so truly put on an act? I found out incidentally that he had been talking to his ex. He reached out to her right after the second breakup (WHICH LASTED 24 HOURS) and talked to her for a few days during the time in which he was begging for me back.

 He swore he was going to marry me. I thought my anxiety was just getting the best of me, and that with time the wound of the second breakup would heal. I tried to urge him to communicate, and he would always say ""Sweetheart!! I am! What makes you think I'm not? I've been getting so much better!""

I asked him again if he was happy. He said he saw a future with me. And then, as we were about to go to bed, I prodded again. ""Are you sure you're happy?"" 

He was like *no. I'm not happy. I thought I could rekindle what we had in the beginning. gradually I wasnt feeling it. I'm sorry I was lying to you and I'm a monster*

I told him to leave, and a piece of me left with him. 

**The hardest part is accepting that he wasn't the man that he pretended to be. That he wasn't the committed loving man who insisted that he loved me with every fiber of his being, and that he would fight forever for me.**

This was the third time. I know it's over. I know he panics and ends it and then comes running back when he realizes it was a mistake. He even sent me an article a few days back about ""the runner in a relationship"", and told me it was like he used to be. that he loved me. that he was trying to be open and communicate. 

**IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.**

Please, Reddit, please help me see this man in a light that isn't the loving, caring man that he made himself out to be. Please. Because I know he wasn't my perfect person, and I know I don't want a relationship with someone who cant communicate, who isnt sure, who lies repeatedly..

But all I can remember are the times he wrapped me in his arms and told me he loved me. and that happened 5 minutes before the third breakup and every second before that. 30 times a day he told me how much he wanted this. Has anyone had anything similar? Other than this he was SO smart, level headed, rational, kind.. and I'm left trying to make sense of it and I cant.

*tl;dr* Boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue 3 times. Each time swearing more convincingly each day that he loved me more and more. How do I let go of the loving, beautiful image I have of him in my head and accept that he was a liar and a flake?",21Jan2019,1
381,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

So school starts tomorrow for me (Electric and Computer engineer major with business minor), I'm only taking two classes because I have a full time job (Utility Locator at $16.00/hr). My job usually works me from 6:00 am to 3:00 pm on regular days (my supervisors and state directors know that  I am in school). However, last Friday I worked until 8:00 pm, which made me realize that this might not be the job for me if I want to stay in school. Especially since I want to start to go to school full time.

&amp;#x200B;

I live alone with my girlfriend, who just got her first job (part time at $9.00/hr). I figured that with her job I can maybe get a part time job elsewhere (we share a joint account). The reason I'm debating getting a new job is because I just got promoted to area lead (basically I assist the area supervisor as well as do my regular work and assist and perform audits on other locators). On one hand I really want to go to school full time because I want to get my degree and essentially find a better job. But on the other hand, I think that my new position will greatly improve my resume.  

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get a new job that will allow me to go to school full time? Or should I keep doing two classes per semester until I eventually graduate?",21Jan2019,1

My mom's youngest brother is in my grade, and he harasses me all the time and gets his friends to harass me too. He's the biggest dick ever, and I'm still expected to treat him like a best friend. He comes over to play Fortnite on my Xbox One and yell racist words at my friends, then break my controller if he loses. If I have any problem with him whatsoever, it gets taken away from me for a week because I was equally responsible for ""fighting,"" even if I just walk away and tell on him.

383,"aight, so, i know this isn't 'advice', but i've been pondering over this for more than a year and i can't think of any other place to ask this, i'm sorry. this is pretty long, but please, someone hear me out. please.

so, around 3 years ago, i was terribly depressed. without any reason; felt like i wasn't enough, barely had any friends and i was good at nothing + my parents expected too much from me and i never lived up to their expectations and i hated myself even more. used to be over-active on social media, too, so yeah. i used to have disturbing mood swings, got into self-harming and smoking, lost my social skills and ability to concentrate. i was (literally) a teenager full of angst who was good at nothing. i hadn't found myself. i was empathetic as fuck and surrounded by toxic people who exploited me.

i ruined my life then. i talked about my problems to my teachers, sometimes. because we've been told they'll help us and they care for our mental well-being and we can trust them. i was fucking stupid and vulnerable. i vented to them, only to have them label me as someone i wasn't. (i didn't vent to my parents since i wanted them to think i was ok and i wanted them to be happy and not worried)

long story short, the teachers had a meeting with my mom one day, 2 years ago, and told her everything in the worst possible way; that her daughter is a 'psycho' with 'mental issues' who has a 'weak and messed up relationship with her parents'. they told her that i self-harm and i spend all my days crying because my parents are harsh and toxic. i NEVER said that. i had a public break down only once. and as far as the self-harming is concerned, it was more like a rumor which they believed in. yes, i did self-harm but i had never told anyone. they didn't have any proof either since i had no scars etc.

anyway, my parents talked to me about it and i didn't deny anything. i didn't want to explain anything to anyone, i was so hurt. i felt betrayed, befooled, shattered and numb within. i had trusted those people and this was what they did to me.

to make things WORSE, my parents used to ridicule and tease me every time i messed up by saying 'oh go on, go tell strangers about how we are to you'. i was teased every where by many people but i never bothered explaining, since, i believe, that time will reveal everything.

i forced myself to focus on other things in life then, and i somewhat did, but it's been bothering me A LOT lately and i hate pretty much everyone around me now. i cannot trust anyone or let anyone close. i am sick and tired within. i feel scared and hurt. this is something i'm trying to get over but failing. i've been upset and hurt about it for so long and it's difficult to be around people. it isn't 'something big' but it has disturbed me a lot. it cost me social life and self-esteem due to the labels i have been given.

and i feel like whatever happened is all my fault.",21Jan2019,1
384,"So my best friend 24f has basically told me we will never speak again. I said some things that she felt came off as very judgemental &amp; rude. To me, I was just being honest and not sugar coating shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little back round, we live in different states &amp; met when we worked together. We used to talk on the phone everyday &amp; I would tell her everything as she would to me. I miss her terribly as I'm a bit of an introvert &amp; I've had trouble making good friends since I've moved. Some days we'd be on the phone for 5 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is why I've been a bit of an asshole lately. We are COMPLETELY different. I have had a job since I was 14, never not had one. My work ethics are very strong. I'm now 25, own a house &amp; car, etc. 

She on the other hand lives in a shed with her boyfriend. Didn't graduate highschool. If she doesn't like a job she just quits &amp; then complains about how little money they have. She pees in a gd bucket at night. She just got her license when she was 22 &amp; has not gotten a car. So, we are completely different but I love her and I think she can do better, just needs to try a little. No one has ever pushed her. 

So, the reason we are fighting is because they got pregnant. ON PURPOSE. At this point they have been dating 5 months, been shedding up for a couple &amp; decided it would be a splendid idea to have a baby. The moment she finds out she's pregnant she decides she needs to get on welfare because they can't afford a baby. She does get a job (kudos) and fails to tell them she's pregnant ( I guess Id do the same) but two weeks after shes hired she brings in a doctors note basically saying she cannot perform the job she was hired for. So they obviously stop putting her on the schedule &amp; she is baffled as to why because she believes they should make a different job for her (???). 

At this point she is 6 months pregnant or so and all she does is sit in the shed, complain &amp; bitch at her bf (19) as soon as gets home from work. She doesn't do shit for him &amp; her excuse is that she is pregnant. OH YEAH she also smokes cigarettes.

Anyways, none of this is my problem. I obviously do not have to live with her or deal with her pregnancy, but it was driving me fucking crazy. Like why are people so fucking lazy I don't understand. I don't feel as if i'm being judgemental, I honestly think I am giving her advice in hopes that she will wake up one day. Maybe i'm wrong??

So she wants me to come down for her baby shower which is in March. I was legit thinking about going, we were talking about plane tickets. Originally I was going to make the 12 hour drive by myself but nah I hate driving lol. So anyways, she tells me id have to fly in after 5pm so her BF can pick me up. ( I only planned on going for the weekend Friday - sunday) so if I was going to take the Friday off I wanted to leave early. Plus ticket prices were better flying early that day. So I make a comment as to why she couldn't just drop her bf off at work &amp; she pick me up at the airport (they only have his car). She goes on to say that there is no way she is driving that far (45 min). But yet she wanted me to drive 12hrs straight ??? okaaaaaaay

So at this point im annoyed &amp; I say fuck going to the baby shower &amp; quit looking at flights. You don't make the effort, im not going to. 

So that was the beginning of her annoyance with me as well. A few days later we are texting and I ask her what she is up to, even though I know the answer (NOTHING). She tells me nothing, just laying around. I ask her ""don't you get bored, doing nothing all day?"" &amp; it was downhill after that. I knew she was going to get mad &amp; I still continued to say things I (maybe?) shouldn't have said. I told her I didn't think it was right of her to purposely get pregnant while living in a shed &amp; having no money &amp; that other people shouldn't have to pay for her stupidity. She's always sick so I mentioned that drinking soda &amp; smoking cigarettes all day probably is the dumbest think she's done thus far (beside planning a baby in her position.) Along with some other things. 

She's said this before that I am very judgemental of her lifestyle. I have asked myself this before as well, why am I friends with someone like her? I don't think it really matters where she is going in life as we clearly are not going down the same paths. I almost feel like I want to fix her, she shouldn't suck so fucking much. But clearly, she will do as she pleases. 

Am I wrong for telling her the truth or am I just being a judgemental bitch? ",21Jan2019,1

386,"Hello, I’m a 22 year old girl and I have been working at a corporate restaurant where I’ve been experiencing sexual harassment. I posted something about advice for this a while ago, I think. Anyways, I decided to quit the restaurant and drop my lawyer for several reasons. 

I’m quitting the restaurant tonight with a resignation letter, and I e-mailed my lawyer a few days ago to tell her I didn’t need anymore legal help. 

I’m in school full time and I really don’t want this dragging out into my semester, as I get stressed out enough already. Not to mention that corporate has done nothing anyways, I’ve practically been made a joke of, and they’ve rewarded him while punishing me at the same time. Personally, I want tot just drop the drama and the stress and move on with my life. 

The place has cut my hours, my friends hours who vouched for me, made me choose between working with him or losing shifts, they showed him everything everyone (including me) said in their interviews, and after talking with my managers about not being comfortable with seeing him, he’s still been there when I’ve gotten there for my shifts on several occasions. Among other things. 

The problem is that my parents are criticizing me for making this decision. They think I should get another lawyer or get mine back and got full force for this company. But the guy has had several claims filed against him and corporate has done nothing, so it’s fairly obvious corporate doesn’t care about its employees that way. My mother especially is really judgmental about this and thinks I should keep working there while I work on a legal case. She uses the argument that I should want to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anyone else. Of course I don’t want it to, but I don’t feel like there’s much I can do at this point. My claim was filed two months ago and corporate has told him his job is safe and he has no reason to worry. I personally have no evidence against him, just events and times and dates of things happening which clearly didn’t matter. 

Am I wrong for making this decision? Am I wrong for wanting to move on and be done with all of this? Maybe I am, I don’t know. I feel like it’s my choice and I’m not crazy for making that decision, but maybe I am and I should keep it going? I don’t know. ",21Jan2019,1

All I ever do is think about money! I’m not exactly sure what I’m hoping to get out of this but maybe some advice on how to reduce my cost of living? How to make a budget?

388,"I will start with a little back history. I am currently a student at a local public university, about to graduate this spring with a degree in fine arts (focus in graphic design). February of 2018 I was able to secure an internship at a local print production company. It has been great overall with a few minor hiccups here and there, but despite constant tension, I have learned a great deal from the designer here, we will call him Jack. Jack is a perfectionist when it comes to his work and his operating system. So for the past few months I have been shadowing him and learning certain technical skills that will make me a better designer down the road. Jack is a very particular person, some might refer to him as isolated and very much an introvert. I noticed early on that Jack and the other shop manager, we will call her Katie, love and thrive off of gossip. They focus more on placing blame in the workplace rather than fixing the problem or conflict. They gossip constantly about other employees behind their back, even gossiping about one another. This is something everyone knows they do and we all have just accepted it and move on. I particularly have confronted multiple times by fellow coworkers telling me Jack and Katie have been talking bad about me behind my back and blaming me for mistakes not even in my department. I have thick skin so this kind of stuff doesn't get to me. I can still keep face with them and remain professional, but recently they both have begun to be harsh to my face. Now I am a student trying to further and improve my skills. I know I am not perfect and that I will make mistakes once in a while, but even with that considered, I did not deserve what came my way. Because I am still a student, my hours are not full time. I work MWF and I come in on afternoons for Tuesday and Thursday on an as need basis (if we are overly busy or not). I was called in this past Thursday and came into work after I got out of class. It seemed to be a normal day, I was pretty busy getting everything out for shipments and making the deadline for the day. On an average day I leave at 4:30 PM, I had everything done at around 4:20 PM and was the 2nd to the last person here at the shop (just Jack and I). I clocked out and left. I was on the road when i received a phone call from Jack. He proceeded to cuss me out over the phone, telling me I was lazy and useless. When I say it was bad, I mean it. I have had total respect for both Jack and Katie up until recently. This unprovoked verbal harassment from Jack was the tipping point for losing all respect towards him. With Katie, it was the constant lying to my face that lead to losing my respect. For me, respect and trust is a two way street. I cant full respect someone who so blatantly treats people like crap. I am at a loss as what to do after the situation. It is extremely awkward at work, Jack is stomping around slamming doors and whatnot like a toddler. We are NOT on speaking terms what so ever. I feel as though I am working with two 40 year olds who act like they are in high school with all this drama and petty behavior. I learned soon after this horrible phone call that Jack in fact has done this to a recent past employee and because of it, she had felt she had no choice but to quit. I dont see this getting any better after this tipping point and it is starting to seem like the only solution for me is to move on to another job.

I know exactly what I want to study, and the career path I want to go, but I won't be able to do this in England because of International University fees. If I stay in Australia for the next few years, I can live at home, continue working (full time hours but with casual pay teehee love my job xoxo) and get the degree I want. On the other hand, I am so desperate to get back home to England, even thinking of waiting six months just kills me. My parents remind me constantly that I'm young and they'll support anything I do, and that if I change my mind about anything there's no shame and no problem.

395,"I feel like this is the kind of epiphany that should take paragraphs to explain, but it's a fairly new one and you know what? I don't like talking about it all that much.

The poor thing is more literal. I grew up upper middle class and my parents, whom I love dearly, were super open about spending money on school stuff for me - like, every single trip or field trip I had the opportunity to go on, they'd pay whatever they had to and then some. I didn't think much of it, but I'm in my first semester of college now and because I can't exactly call my parents whining for money (they have a very strict no beggars policy for adults in college, at least my dad, and they've already given me money paying for the *best dorm and my classes the whole semester*). And so part of our orientation is driving into the closest vacation spot with everyone else in my dorm and for the first time, I don't have the option of going. I don't know if I ever wanted to go, but it still kind of shocked me into realizing how all the other kids who missed the big field trips felt. More importantly, my spending money has come from my own paychecks saved over like a year, and I spent so much money on taxis and more food than I actually probably need to eat, and I suddenly realize that I might now have enough money for books, and not enough time to earn the extra couple hundred I need without missing out on homework assignments. I might have to drop a class or two solely because I can't afford to purchase the text book, which gets me reallllly riled up about the college system.

The second one is.... less easy to admit. Basically, I'm coming back to college after a semester of dropping out, and after a rough breakup. There was also a period of alcohol dependency and medical diagnoses for several physical ailments that caused mental ailments (oh, I'll just say it - my thyroid made me fat and very fatigued and depressed). And I'm sure you can imagine it's been a rough year. Yet, I've always prided myself on my ""strong spirit"". You know, I wasn't afraid to do what I wanted instead of what I was told, I've always been one to go first into dark scary spaces or kill the spider, and more importantly I've always stood up to bullies and gone against the grain and for most of my life, this was awesome. But I realize now that when I dropped out of the other, better college, I didn't do so because I was an ""independent soul"" tired of ""Working in the cogs of the machine""; no, I was afraid of failing for the first time in my life academically. And so instead of powering through and just working to at least eke together some credits, I called it a waste of money and dropped out. And then with my relationship, I thought I was being ""brave"" or ""strong"" or ""standing up for myself"" or *whatever* because of the way I was always trying to communicate when I felt hurt, but you know what? I just came off as a huge nag and probably controlling and unfun, and more importantly, my reason for doing so (and, subsequently, clinging so hard when we broke up - ugh, a fact that makes me cringe when I look back) was because I was afraid of being alone. And if I had just been a little more secure, independent and brave, I think we'd be really happy, because he was actually a really nice guy.

Anyway. I'm so scared. I'll admit that. I'm terrified. And I'm alone, at least in the literal sense, and I don't really have anyone else to turn to because after my ""drop out year"" (and some messy mental health stuff), the last thing I want is to provide my family and friends with more drama or cause to worry about or judge me. On a separate note, if anyone wants to buy a printer or some feet pics or some really shitty art or, God, I don't know, some empty whiskey bottles for around $300, DM me and help me pay for books./s",21Jan2019,1

401,"Hi /r/Advice, I need your advice on how to stop myself from constantly drifting away.

Let me start by giving a small introduction to my issue. I can best describe my ""dreams"" as being fantastic what-if scenarios. Most of my daydreams are me imagining myself in some sort of situation where I am significant to another person or group. To put it in Reddit terms: I could daydream about how posting some meme is going to be found hilarious and yield me many internet points. I can genuinely feel happy about how such an imaginary scenario played out in my head. This tends to make me lazy, because it removes any incentive to actually make an attempt at gaining the laughs and internet points.

I started noticing this about myself around two years ago, but I have done it for as long as I can remember. When I was much younger, most daydreams were of me in a heroic setting. I always interpreted this as me being unhappy and wanting to be in another situation. Right now this explanation no longer makes sense to me. In general I would say that I am very satisfied with the way my life is right now. I just finished my master's at university and have a well-paying job in the economic sector.

410,"So I'm a writer who's very nearly finished writing my first novel.  I'm starting to think about publication -- reaching out to agents or publishers, or possibly (last resort) self-publishing.  I need to make a decision soon about what name I should publish under.

I can't use my own real name -- I happen to share the same first and last names with another writer in my city.  He's a reporter for our local newspaper who has already published a book of his own.  In order to keep my work distinguished from his in the marketplace, I need to alter up my name somehow.

I've narrowed it down to two possibilities:

1. I could publish under my middle name instead of my first name.  This has the advantage of feeling more ""honest"" about my identity, while still making a distinction between my writing work and my professional day job.  Disadvantage:  this variation of my name is very similar (but not identical) to an author I like who's done some very high profile work on a popular TV show.  (Think of the difference between the names ""Roberts"" and ""Robertson"".  It's not exactly that, but similar.)

2.  I could keep my real first name, but change my last name.  If I go that route, I've chosen my grandmother's maiden name, which is one that I like a lot.  It's not a very common one so I wouldn't be stepping on anybody else's professional toes.  And it comes with the advantage that it's alphabetically *adjacent* to the last name of two other authors I like (famous father and son).  So if my book is picked up by a traditional publisher, it would be placed right next to theirs on the shelves in any store.  Good marketing.

What would you all do in my situation?

So I (F 21) have this close friend (F 21) since the very beginning of college (3 and a half years now). We've lived together for 2 years and have similar values and some overlapping interests.

I always felt like I had to make conversation with her, even though we have been friends for a while, because it doesn't flow naturally. I thought it was that we didn't have that much in common, but then I spent time with her and a close camp friend and there were lulls there too. Is it that my friend just isn't that interesting? 

As of late, I've felt like I'm just blabbing to keep from awkward silence (yes, I know that silence isn't awkward always and yes, I have also tried keeping quiet to see if she'll spark conversation, but no matter how long I try to give her chances to talk, she doesn't). She's not a shy person, which is the weirdest thing. I just feel like we're STILL not comfortable with each other even after this long.

With lack of a better word I feel like I have a ""fear"" of studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Short summary about me and how (I think) I ended up like this: I'm 26 now. I have an associate's degree in programming, but I've spent a lot of my 4-5 years since I graduated not working. I allways struggled with studying, even in elementary school and most of the time I would just get decent grades using logic. I believe myself to be intelligent due to achievements and events throughout my life that support this claim, but I know how pointless these claims can be on the internet where you can't really back them up with proof. I am a scientific person, and I was allways drawn to subjects like mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and I allways had a very high interest in psychology even when I was very young. I allways struggled with subjects like literature and history.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to get through all my schoolings with barely studying anything at all. In my associates degree the first time I studied at all outside of school was after 5 months for like 15 hours in the span of 1 week to pass an SQL exam. I feel like I could learn everything I learned in that school during my 2 years in 1 month or less. That is not to say the school was bad. I actually think it was really good and they taught all valuable subjects and I had some really good teachers.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the point: Whenever I am trying to study/work on programming(not just programming but that's 90% of the studying that I do) I get super stressed. Way beyond the point where it's normal, and I actually have simptoms. I was allways told, and thus allways thought that I was just lazy. For a very long time I would just think that I was lazy, and I'm just not disciplined enough to study. I thought this until I got my first job, and the time I started to seriously work out, which was around when I was 22-23. Until then everything I did that required discipline and dedication was studying, and I was terrible at that, so I thought I was lazy. When I got my first job(which was not programming/coding related) I was really hard working and achieved outstanding results due to my efficiency and hours put in. I would regularly voluntarily do multiple hours of overtime because I wanted to finish the task at hand instead of leaving it for the next day. I would get promoted after 5 months and had people working under me. Same thing with workout. I had multiple weeks where I put in 90 hours of work. I managed to get very good results, tracked my workouts etc. I gained around 12kg of muscle in 3-4 months and the longest chain of workout I did without missing a day was something in the 60-s.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I no longer thought I was lazy. If I was lazy I wouldn't have been so successful in my work and my workout. So I thought it must have had something to do with studying. I study on a computer, but my #1 hobby is video gaming. So I thought, ""maybe I'm addicted to video games?"" That I also disagree with because I can stop playing video games, but it won't result in me studying. I did an experiment to not play any video games for a week, and see if it improves the time I spend studying, but it didn't, or maybe just a tiny bit. From that I concluded that I am not addicted to video games, and it's not the thing that is stopping me from studying more.

&amp;#x200B;

When I try to study programming or write a program or just code I get really stressed. My hands start to shake. I get nervous and jumpy. I need to stand up and go to the bathroom around every 10-15 minutes because I get nervous shits. My hands really shake, like I can barely type this post(I tried to study today all day). My heartrate goes up. Sometimes I even start to sweat on my head. My palms allways get sweaty really fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Studying is the only thing that does this, and it's not like I hate programming. I actually love programming. Writing code is super interesting. I managed to make a phone application around 1.5-2 months ago for practice and it was really fun. But I get these symptoms every time I try to work and it really hinders me. Obviously I'm also procrastinating a lot to get away from study. I have no exams, nobody to lecture me if I fail to do something coding related. I have no deadlines. No reason to be stressed out about my performance. Yet I still get this stress.

&amp;#x200B;

With lack of a better work I allways just say I have a ""fear of studying"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone can say anything to this, or share some advice? I'm trying to get rid of it, and I feel like maybe I could get rid of it after a while with regulation, and sometimes it does get a bit better, but I fall back and lose the progress I've made after something happens. Like before christmas and New Years I felt like I could go like 2 hours without stressing, but I didn't work for 5-7 days during the holidays and I'm back to not even being able to start.",21Jan2019,1
421,"My mother divorced my father when I was nine, and just remarried a year ago. Ever since she got married, she has been sending me off to stay with my grandmother three-four days a week so she and her husband can get some alone time together. My mother is desperate to have another child in this marriage, and every month when her attempts fail, she spirals into hysterical states of crying, shutting us off and just being in a very bad place mentally.

She's not talking to me and treating me in kind of a blaming manner for this whole thing, and she's mentioned she wanted me to agree to staying at my grandmother's again.

It's very unfair to me because she doesn't really care for what I want as opposed to what she wants.

When I was younger (I can’t specify what age because I honestly don’t remember), I had an ear infection, went to the doctor, was prescribed antibiotics that I finished, and the pain of the infection seemed to go away but there was a problem that persisted. I couldn’t seem to fully pop my ears. My hearing was fine, as in I’ve always been able to hear what people are saying very clearly. In terms of being able to hear the words that *I* am saying, that’s a different story. In a quiet or moderately-noisy room, I can hear myself just fine.

When i got there both the husband and wife called me daddy, so i thought it was a joke. Half of the party was up stairs the other half down stairs. Me, her, and two other guys were up stairs watching a movie and her husband was downstairs drinking with people. The two guys and i go downstairs at one point. The husband is telling stories how he met his wife and then something happens where I am left downstairs with my closest friend. 

I don't know what happened but the wife comes down the stairs and slams the door to her room. My friend sorta looks at me and there's a mutal sense we need to leave. We go upstairs, the party is dead at this time and theres a few people left, including the husband. He says he's done for the night and says goodbye. I stick my hand out for some sort of hand shake and he ignores it. He also ignores my closest friend. The roommates are trying to make us stay and at that point I'm willing to do anything to get out. 

In the uber I realize I don't have my watch. I Text one of the roommates and he says he can drop it off at my house if needed. He made it sound like I shouldn't go back to the house. 

Forgot to mention she puts pictures of me on her snapchat story with the caption daddy etc... Its just really weird and I don't want to lose friends over this.

432,"Hello,   


I am working on a business with my boss and his wife has offered me to do some work for her digital marketing agency. Some translating, copywriting and Photoshop work. I don't want to come off as arrogant and ask a lot of money and ruin our relationship, but I also don't want to ask for too less, since I need as much money as possible for college.   


She has told me that these clients pay well, so it's not like I have to ask for chump change either. My issue is that I don't know how to value it properly, since for the most part, these tasks are easy, just time consuming.   


Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",21Jan2019,1
433,"So a little backstory: My boyfriend (24M) and myself (22F) have been dating for about a year and are in a very serious relationship. We’ve talked about possibly getting engaged within the next year or two and moving in together once I’m finished with school. However, his parents refuse to acknowledge me as his girlfriend and he’s been married before and his dad states that “god only acknowledges a mans first wife as his only true wife.” On top of this, his dad hates me also due to the fact that I’m a psychology major and he believes psychologists are scam artists detouring people away from the one true saving grace of the lord as they encourage individuals to acknowledge their own issues rather than “surrendering their sins to god to have them absolved.” 

Here’s the thing, my boyfriend’s first wife turned out to be a lesbian. His dad told him that she’s just confused and he needs to “show her the light” and it’s a mans job to direct a woman when she gets confused. His parents are beyond dedicated Christians to the point of almost being cultish (his dad made him pass out flyers that the world was ending when he was a kid ago due to “the prophecy”) 

And here’s the kicker. His dad has been married twice. After divorcing his first wife he “found the light of god” and decided to marry his second wife, he was 32 and she was 18 and proceeded to have 10 kids with her if that gives you any insight into what kind of guy this dude is. But apparently his first marriage doesn’t count as he hadn’t found god yet. 

Thus far, their denial of me hasn’t caused any issues since they live in Connecticut and we live in Arizona, I’m just concerned for when the day comes that we have children it may cause issues. Should I be concerned about this? Is there anything I can do to win their approval? I hate thinking about the fact that my partner’s parents despise me. ",21Jan2019,1
434,"Hi, I am currently 22 years old, and ever since I was 11 I was always afraid of death, mostly because of the movie Click with Adam Sandler making me realize how fast life is and wasted in the grand scheme of things. The idea of dying and what might happen after we die scares the living shit out of me. I get spontaneous thoughts about it, which instantly takes all the air filling my lungs and magically disappear. 

Over the years, I've talked to teachers, significant others, and my parents about how this scares me and they've given me advice like distract yourself with things to do to take your mind off of it. I do this and admittedly it works for the most part, but when I'm trying to sleep, I'm trapped in my thoughts and just go back to the idea of death, how my loved ones will die, how I will die, and how they may or may not be a life after that. It stops me from sleeping and thats why I am unable to work around a normal schedule.

This problem and fear has plagued me for more than a decade, so I'm just hoping there are people out there who can share their story, give advice, or even want to talk about it out loud so we don't feel so God damn alone. If Hamlet can feel what I feel, I know there's gotta be at least one non-fictional person out there who feels how I feel. ",21Jan2019,1

We’ve been talking almost every day on Messenger and we’ve also been sending each other weird selfies on Snapchat (you know your average teenager thing), but I also want to talk to her more in person.

I briefly dated a guy approx. 8 years ago. We were friends before and have remained friends after. For me, I’ve always just looked at him as an old friend but for him, I think it’s more like the one that got away. He moved to a foreign country a few years back and whenever we catch up, we talk about me visiting. I have been talking to him about going in two months; however, I want to ensure that he knows the trip is purely platonic. Plan is to stay with him for a few days and then head to another city together. How can I ensure he gets the message and that nothing gets uncomfortable prior? I don’t explicitly want to necessarily say “you know this will just be a friendship trip” but still want to make sure he knows that. Other concern is many hotels in the city were going to only have one bed. Or two but for outrageous  price. Any advice would be appreciated. ",21Jan2019,1

439,"Hello, ever since freshman year of high school my parents insisted I join the military to become an officer. They pushed me to take JROTC, apply for ROTC scholarship, and now I'm a freshman at a senior military institute with a full ride Air Force ROTC scholarship. This seems great, except after seeing the hazing, hypocrisy, and unfairness by those in charge, I no longer want to join the military.

I bought into my parents' advice and seem to have dug myself into a hole now. My parents are both government employees and my dad a former enlisted Airman, so they say how veterans get so many benefits. Additionally, they've wanted me to be an officer for a very long time and I feel I would disappoint them deeply if I decided not to. I've also already been contracted under my scholarship, and my parents need me to keep that scholarship to stay afloat financially. I'm applying to transfer to a regular college and continuing rotc there since I really dislike the atmosphere where I am currently.

I know it would be best to stay on track and just do my minimum 4 years of active duty and then get out, but I really dont enjoy the military lifestyle. Can someone convince me I'm wrong and that itll be okay once I'm actually an officer? I think maybe my perspective is skewed because the military college could be very different from actual service. I plan on practicing medicine both in the Air Force and after, if that makes a difference with my plan.

TLDR: Contracted under AFROTC Scholarship at a senior military institute rn, hate it here. Am currently applying to transfer to regular school and doing rotc there since my parents really want me to be an officer and rely on my scholarship to pay for college. Is my perspective skewed, is the real military (air force) actually not that bad, or am I in for a rough 8 years?

441,"""Ann"" and I have been dating for nearly 8 years. We started dating at the beginning of college and are still going strong to this day. Looking back, we were both young and immature at the start. There are reasons both of us could and maybe should have broken up with each other early on. However, being where we are now, I appreciate getting to grow with eachother and watch eachother transition into adulthood. 

For the longest time, our biggest issue was and has been intimacy. I blamed her for not wanting to be intimate as often as I would like, to the point that she felt broken. I've been looking inward a lot lately and doing some reading, I'm starting to realize that 99% of the issues we've been having stem from my behavior. Short version, I'm obsessed with sex and use it for validation, and have created a toxic environment where it is difficult for either of us to be vulnerable when it comes to sex. 

This cycle got really bad a few years back, I was always in a bad mood, she developed a lot of anxiety surrounding the bedroom. Sex dropped to 1-2 times a month, and when it happened it was very robotic, just going through the motions. 

Things have gotten better, we now have sex 1-2 times a week, it's very genuine and passionate. Despite this, I still keep getting in my own head and find myself getting frustrated. There have been a few weeks lately where we even had sex 3 times, and it made me more anxious because all I could think about was how I wanted that to continue and I would fear a week like that wouldn't happen again. Sometimes I don't even know if I want sex, or if I just want to see that she wants me and that I'm looking for that validation. 

I've made a point to be aware of the situation and go in with no expected outcome. If I feel frustrated I tell myself that's just my brain being weird, she's allowed to not be in the mood, and I need to go on with my night. Sometimes it works, other times I can't help but ruminate about why she wouldn't want me then and there when everything seemed so perfect at the moment. 

I am madly in love with ""Ann"" and want to spend my life with her. I bought a ring, now it's just a matter of choosing a time and a place. Since buying the ring, my mind has started going even crazier. Things are going well with intimacy and are still improving, I know I can trust her and she trusts me. My mind will flip between being really excited about what I'm about to do and being freaked out that in 5-10 years when we have kids or when life gets tough that our sex life will tank again. Even though I know the only reason it tanked the first time is because I created a weird environment where she couldn't feel safe with me. I'm afraid my unhealthy obsession won't go away and it will continue to be a self fulfilling prophecy. What are some tools I could use to cool off and not think about this shit all day long? 

**TL;DR: I have began to realize I have an unhealthy relationship with sex and fear it could poison my relationship. I need to stop thinking about it and don't know how. **",21Jan2019,1

443,"I've been going to my therapist for around five months now, since I had a severe mental breakdown in August of last year. And so far, other than talk therapy, they have offered *no* attempts to help. They have a grading system that we fill out after the end of every other session, and they actually got pissy when I gave them poor marks.

I'm a patient person. But as of right now, I'm living in a toxic home environment, and my therapist is essentially one of those cliche cartoon psychologists who goes ""and how does that make you feel?"" ad nauseum, sans the couch. They're barely even *trying*, but I'm afraid to tell them off because the place I go to to get therapy is also a place where people with disabilities can go to get help finding jobs, and I'm afraid they're going to stop that service if I stop getting therapy or tell them off.

445,"I have enjoyed a very good sex education, know how things work and am usually very responsible. However right now I'm scared shitless and very worried about a possible pregnancy situation.

I have a new FWB and we had sex this month on the 1., 2. , 7. and 11. and 12. of January. Multiple times each day. Of course I always did use condoms, just for the fucking sake of not getting STI's or an unplanned pregnancy. However, since I do not like to rely solely on condoms, I asked her if she is on another form of BC the last time we have seen each other. She is not and came off the Nuva ring end of November. So to asses a potential pregnancy risk I asked her, when her last period was and she said she had none since the usual withdrawal bleeding when coming off the ring. So I asked how she sees abortion in a possible case of pregnancy and she said she could never do it (which I of course accept). However this is when my alarm bells began ringing heavily.

I remember that in the heat of the moment ""flipped"" the condom at least two times before rolling down after it was the wrong way around initially (this maybe also in ""round two""). I know that this is not proper condom use and that this poses a medium pregnancy risk up to 5-7 days before ovulation. I'm also scared that while fingering her I inserted semen into her vagina. I do not recall having any substantial amounts of cum or precum on my hands from previous rounds. However I do recall not washing my hands every time before the next round and that there maybe a risk due to some traces left I did not notice. Of course I spoke to her about my scare but she is not worried at all. However, I am. Very worried, especially since she is 22 and a fertility machine in this age according to my biology knowledge.

I know that it is normal to have irregular cycles after coming off BC (but 60+ Days?). I know that my stupid handling of condoms leaves me somewhere between typical use failure rate of condoms (18%) and perfect use of withdrawal (4%, since I never came in her). I know that statistics do not change reality and are just an average over humanity. I also know that the only way of knowing for sure is doing a HCG test on the 26. of January earliest, probably better on the 31. of January to avoid false negatives.

But the uncertainty until then cracks me up. I think children should be raised in a good socioeconomic environment. We both are in midst of our education and do not have the resources for a child right now nor do I know this women very well and am not sure if we would be good parents. My mind has been restless for one week now and I do not get my shit together anymore at daily tasks. All the internet posts of women getting pregnant from precum, whitdrawal , despite using condoms or right after coming off BC brought my mindset from being a little bit worried about a unlikely chain of events to being fully convinced that she is pregnant for sure. I am usually a very calm person but I have never been so scared in my life. My rational side has left me days ago. I do not know how to handle this or how I should survive the next 10 days.",21Jan2019,1
446,"Apologies in advance for any odd formatting, i’m using mobile. I’m also sorry about the grammar, I’m just an idiot in a rush. 

I’m in sixth form (I think it’s the same as junior year for Americans) and we’re studying for A-levels, which are pretty important as they give us our grades to determine if we can get into university, so obviously it’s important to be present and to put in lots of effort. 
There’s this guy who’s in my circle of friends and he’s also in around 4 of my classes, and he’s a little rude sometimes, he gets in everybody’s personal space, interrupts conversations and sometimes just kinda stands there watching as you talk to people, so you can see why my friends and I aren’t exactly in love with him.
He skips days of school because he can’t be bothered to come in. (he messages our group chats telling us he doesn’t plan to come in because he’s tired or he doesn’t want to) It used to be around 1 day every two weeks or so, but now it’s at the point where he’s off at least once a week. 
A few weeks ago we were supposed to do a presentation together for one of our classes, and the teacher specified beforehand that there would be no excuses and that on the day, even if one of the pair was ill, the other would have to present the work still. He knew about this, he did three bullet points for it, and I ended up having to put everything together in the end, as when we were supposed to work on it I waited for him in the library and he didn’t show, he sat in a different part of the school, with our friends, who told me the next day that they’d been with him and he’d joked with them about how he was supposed to be doing work with me but couldn’t be bothered. On the day we were supposed to present, he didn’t bother showing up and left me to present all on my own, and then the next day he had the nerve to ask me for notes on everybody else’s presentations! 
Because we share the same circle of friends and we share the majority of our classes he messages me asking for notes and if I’ll photocopy my work for him, etc. I feel rude saying no to him but at the same time it’s at the point where I’m spending my free study periods copying stuff up for him instead of adding to my own work. I feel like if he’s taking advantage of me in a way, so that he can stay home and relax but still get the notes.

450,"A bit of backstory: My dad is a retired USAF Colonel, and now works in an office doing Navy research. He’s been working at his desk job for around 10 years and has been pretty vocal about how much he years to get back into flying and to find a new, more fun job. I’m an only child and I’m headed off to college this Summer. 

Okay, so I’m scared for two reasons. Number one is for my mom. Again, I’m an only child that’s going to be in college starting August/September. Knowing commercial airline pilots are away from home a lot, my mom would be alone for a significant time multiple times per year. I haven’t asked her about how she feels about that, but I’m worried she’ll become lonely and depressed. Granted, I got my introversion 100% from my mom (my dad is the biggest extrovert in the universe), so she’ll probably be okay for some time. But even an introvert can become lonely after a while, I know from experience.

Number two has to do with my dad’s safety. I’m pondering on the fact that I may be overthinking this one considering the exponential safety measures on airplanes, but I cannot knock these “what ifs” out of my head. What if his plane becomes a victim of a terrorist attack? What if the airplane mechanically fails? What if he or his pilot/copilot makes an error and dies in an accident? I feel like any sort of validation and provision of airline incident statistics will squander this worry, so anything like that or experiences from people in my situation / airline pilots would be very much appreciated.

Considering the last part of my second worry, I feel like my major worry is about my mom. Again, telling of experiences is very much appreciated. Thanks for reading.

451,"I've been talking to this guy for around 2 months. At first, he seemed really into and would do really sweet things that I've never had anyone do for me before. But then he stopped really making any effort. 

For the last 3 weeks, we have really only talked because I've initiated it, and we have really only hung out because I asked him and made plans. I've been to his place like once, he mostly comes to mine. I've offered numerous times, but he said he'd rather go to mine. He has met my roommates and I've talked about him with my mom and sister and friends, but last time I asked if he ever did that about me he said no. I've never met any of his friends. Like 2 weeks ago I asked if he wanted to exclusively date, and he said he did not although he has said in the past that he was open to a relationship.

Recently, he lost a bet we made playing a game so he had to make me dinner. I was supposed to go over to his place, but he ended up saying he wanted to do it at mine. While he had a week to plan, and I even sent him a recipe for something and said I'd make the dessert, day of comes qnd he didnt even look at it until it was time to go shopping for supplies. This kind of made me feel some type of way, because what made me like him in the first place was seeing that he put in effort for things like that.

Anyway, we ended up cooking the stuff and while we were cooking, I told him straight up that if he ever felt like he wasnt interested to just let me know, and he said he would.  Normally he would stay the night. We have never had sex though, by his choice. I ended up falling asleep while he was watching a documentary, and like an hour or so later he woke me up saying he wanted to go home. I was really confused, he had never done that before, and thought I did something wrong but he assured me I didnt.

I dont feel like he is really into me. He never asks me about myself, or tries to learn new things about me. Anytime I'd ask if he wanted to know anything he'd just say no. I rely on emotional connections, so while I was really into him, it has pretty much died out because i no longer feel like he cares. Also, I thought we'd finally have sex last night or the next morning but... idk.

Part of me feels like I want this to work because I havent liked a guy as much as I liked him in a few years, but the other part of me is so used to just cutting people off.

Also, he is white and I'm black. I never really went out with a white guy before, and I'm worried that this is just a phase? His last two girlfriends were Asian. Idk if this is pertinent.

I was never great at school just average/below average grades (I never handed in homework and rarely showed up) but now  ive grown past that and I try my best at my jobs although I am still rather lazy.

I have never had a passion for anything other than video games but I only play them for fun and only recently got a computer so I know nothing about it/ I am not artistic at all so design is out of the question. 

Sorry for the depressed attitude but I am just so lost and any kind of help would be so appreciated! Thank you!

We first noticed them in our brand new refrigerator, black soot like marks on the inside that wipe clean pretty easily. 

Now we’ve found them on the outside of the kettle and most recently, inside of a TV cabinet in an upstairs bedroom. 

Any ideas? Could it be harmful?",21Jan2019,1

460,"I have a very big problem of self loathe. It's because of my country. I am Israeli and unfortunately I feel like my country is my image. Israel is a bad country 'cause it's the most problematic country in the world with many people disliking its policies, it depends on the US which makes Americans condescend Israelis, seeing them as inferior (while they view people of other nationalities like Canadians or Brits as equals), it has many problems with other countries and has a shitty government. I honestly see no reason to be proud of who I am. I firmly believe that the man's country is the man's image. Therefore I embody everything that my country does. Every time I go to America I have to lie to the locals who kindly ask me where I'm from due to my country's flawed relations with their nation. ",21Jan2019,1
461,"I've even been wondering if this deserved attention in the first place.

I've been at my new job for around 4 months now. I'm 23 and a woman in a high tech company.

It all started off when I was going home in November and some random dude stopped to talk to me at the bike parking lot. He said hi, asked if I worked at the company and which department, all apparent casual talk. We had a short cordial conversation and I say I need to go home (tired). He asks if he can join me on the bike ride for half the way since we were (apparently) going in the same direction. I agreed and later on say bye at some junction. THat was the first and only time I had a f2f conversation.

A week later I get an email on during working hours from the guy saying I should join him in gym ""x"" since he wants to train with me. I ignore the email since I'm not even interested and frankly didn't even have time to think about it.

Week after that, I get a whatsapp message asking if I want to go for coffee. I say no, I'm busy. 

Christmas break comes and it's quiet. As soon as I get back I get another text message saying we should meet up for coffee to discuss what we both did over christmas. I'm laughing to myself thinking this guy doesn't know when to stop. I ignore the message.

(Btw, during the whole time this is happening I see this guy maybe once or twice a week in the same building I work in, in some meeting room or across the hallway somewhere)

I get invites on the rest of my social media, including a message saying how ""beautiful I look"" in one of my (professional) photos (it was on LinkedIn)

Then comes the scary stuff. Two weeks ago I get this REALLY LENGTHY AND ELABORATE LinkedIn message from this guy saying the following things (summarized):

\- He has not been able to stop thinking about me, has fallen in love with me and I give him ""happy feelings inside him"" everytime he sees me;

\-He has been checking my Outlook agenda at work to see whenever I'm ""free"" so he could bump into me ""by accident"" (thankfully I have this on private, he can only see when I'm busy or not)

\-He has been waiting ""for hours"" at the nearest coffee machine to hopefully strike up a conversation with me (I was always with colleagues, because they're fun so I'm hardly alone)

\-He has been **""waiting patiently for me at the parking lot""** for me (I only saw and spoke to him once there...)

\-He tried to befriend a colleague of mine to ""get closer to me""

That's about it, but it's all screenshotted and saved in my pc. The first thing I did was anonymously contact the ethics office in my company, showing them what I've shown here, and they told me to tell my supervisor and/or HR. Since my supervisor is very approachable, I told him my concerns and showed him the message. He also said he thinks this is very wrong and could understand why I felt the way I did (I haven't been able to sleep properly (it's triggered some old things for me) and have been anxious and nervous at work in fear of bumping into this guy, I've also not been able to work properly as I can't stay concentrated). My supervisor asked if he could speak to this guy's supervisor and I agreed. Meanwhile my supervisor is on vacation but says to keep in contact, then says that he spoke to the supervisor and she told him she's ""Not suprised"" by the guys behaviour since ""he has shown difficulty in communicating properly"" and is known to be ""Intense""in the way he speaks to people. She also suggested something about autism even though there is no proof (or relevance??). My supervisor then texts me saying she wants to talk to me, and if I agree. I have agreed and we're to speak tomorrow because she wants to know from me what happened. I regret this now as it feels I am being made to defend why I made a deal about this and am regretting having spoken about it. My supervisor is on my side, 100%, but I don't think the other one is. I feel vulnerable and honestly this whole situation is just being prolonged and so far the only one who is getting backlash is me.

Does anyone have any insight or advice on even hwo to speak to this woman, seeing as I've already agreed to meet with her? I somehow feel like I'm being sidetracked or made to explain ""why"" I feel the way I do with the replies she's given via my supervisor. I don't know what to do or even what I should be feeling.

Thanks

462,"We (NH)  received a legal notice yesterday that someone has purchased the two lots across the street from our house and has filed to have the lots (approx 1 acre each) combined and build a large multi-family unit. There will be a public hearing in 2 weeks. The property is currently zoned for 2 units per acre and they are asking for it to be increased to 6 per acre. I'm assuming we're talking a 12 unit complex total. This really isn't ideal  in our quiet neighborhood. We are planning on attending the public hearing to voice our concerns (noise,traffic,etc) but are a little clueless as to what sort of research we should do, so we don't just sound like grouchy neighbors.

463,"I've been staying with a friend for the past week. The reason is because I'm applying to live in another country, and the consulate of said country is in his city. 

He's a good friend, no threats to my safety or wellbeing, but we are vastly different people. His sense of humor is a bit emotionally painful to me (mainly giving each other shit), I find him a bit draining, and he is very loud and a bit annoying when he talks. 

The initial plan was to stay for 2 weeks, but then I discovered yesterday that I might not even be able to apply at the consulate.. reason being I need to get some more documents which I can't here now because of the U.S. government shutdown. 

To be honest, I was relieved. Today I was going to call the consulate and see if I could apply without said documents, knowing that they'd say no, just so that I could fly home tomorrow (Tuesday). 

Yesterday (Sunday) the flight home for Tuesday was $50. It is now $218. I am blown away and very distressed of this massive change. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are all $200+ as well! I've never seen flights do this! 

So I'm basically here in the suburbs with a friend I don't enjoy, lonely &amp; distressed, with a bit of extra $ and considering to spend it to get home one week earlier. Another 8 days would feel like hell. 

Here's the kicker: I just discovered one way that I might be able to get my documents to apply at the consulate in 3ish days (an expedited service to get my documents that I couldn't get normally because of the shut-down). 

So here are my options. 

I can fly home tomorrow, spend $250 (flight + bag) and then order the documents to my place. I'll then have to fly back ($100 roundtrip-ish) and stay at a hostel for 2 days ($50ish) in order to apply at the consulate. 

The big pro to this scenario is that I'm home, have a car, with family, with better friends, etc. for the next week. The con is increased cost. I'm not in a financially great state, but I'm certainly not at all in a bad state. I live free w/family. 

Furthermore I am already depressed for other reasons, and so being around this depressing friend is not helping at all. Like I said I was really relieved Sunday night when I saw a $50 flight back home. 

My other choice is to stick it out for another 8 days, order the documents here, and hope they arrive before I leave. There is a small (though unlikely) risk that the documents arrive too late, in which case I'll have to stay longer with my friend then buy another flight home. 

The pro is saved $. The cons include that I'm not around friends, family, and I'm stuck far from the city in the suburbs (1 hour+ train ride) with no car, and my friend has an expensive car so he won't let me drive it without him. The other con is being around him, and I'm starting to get frustrated. Also back home is down South &amp; warm, here... let's just say super cold so I can't hardly walk outside 15 minutes due to the cold. 

I feel like I'm stuck in a prison here. I know it's just 8 days, but I really want to go home. 

I don't know if I should take care of my $, or spend a bit to feel free and be happier for the next week then return WITHOUT the friend (he's leaving this city in 1.5 weeks anyways) to apply at the consulate alone. 

Should I spend the $ to go home, or save on costs and suffer another week? ",21Jan2019,1
464,"So lately my emotional state has not been ideal. And I've mostly been vague about it to my friends. To more or less compound this situation for myself I'm writing down what is wrong, and maybe along the way figure out how to solve these matters, maybe by myself, maybe with help from others, I'm open to suggestions at this point since it's a pretty untenable situation.
I generally don't share my negative emotions because I don't want to bother others with it. And I feel a lot of shame about them. They are there though, and there are a few. It's a bit of a deep dive but I'll try to be as objective about it as possible.

**Depression** - is something I have been struggling with for a long time. This started at age 13 when the home situation wasn't very good. My parents weren't shitty people, but they had a lot of shitty things happen to them and they never resolved those problems for themselves. Instead, they just forwarded it to others. And who easier to do this than to a child who can't fight back, and if they do blame them for it. Instilling a feedback loop of futility in confrontational matters. As an example when I was 15 my mom got very drunk in the afternoon and started threatening me after I got home from a terrible day of school where I got bullied. She pushed me so far I was about to hit her to sort of emotionally defend myself, and just this sort of line of computer code flashed by me, as you see in movies with all the possible outcomes of this action, and none of them were good. I restrained myself even though I was emotionally devastated by all that transpired that day. I went to my dad's office in tears and told him about the situation he replied ""she's bothering you again? Good, then she'll leave me alone."" That was the point I didn't love my parents anymore. I sat out my time at home till age 18 and moved out breaking all contact for almost a decade.
My school like for most people wasn't much help either. I was a completely out of place weirdo without any friends at all. Partly because I felt bad, I went to a completely shitty school. I am fortunate that even though at one point I literally had zero friends I bounced back pretty well on this front. I have a lot of friends now.

**Aspergers** - is something you can only manage. Unlike depression which solvable. Aspergers is not going to go away and I am pretty good at hiding I even have it. It helps I have a fairly mild case of it and enough insight/intelligence to deal with the consequences. It does require a bit more downtime than for most other people. And it does lowkey have a lot of impact on my world though. While making friends nowadays through the magic of having a great hobby (music) it's still really hard to connect to people I have little common interests with. There is also a lot of social anxiety that this brings with it. Making things like dating a nearly insurmountable task. We humans all want to be loved, but finding love is already complicated enough if things are 100% great. But that mountain only gets steeper the further that number sinks.

**PTSD** - is mostly solvable. But lately, a lot of things from my past have been catching me off-guard, now that I have been having a lot of nightmares. Sleep is a pretty essential part of life and while I am sleeping a lot due to depression I am not well-rested and the quality of my sleep at this point is not good. Sleeping is better than be awake until the nightmares show up.

**Gender** - is a complicated one. And I don't really like to talk about it. Because of the following reason on the list.

**Trust issues** - is probably something everyone deals with at this point. We've all lost a few people I considered friends in really shitty ways. I trusted some with things that I considered really private and they either took advantage of it or showed they didn't give a single shit. Maybe I'm too trusting because my theory of mind concerning others is the projection of my own feelings placed on them, and I like to think I am trustworthy even though that might be a somewhat controversial thing to disclose about oneself.
Not too long ago while having an Asperger meltdown (it's a complete sensory overload, somewhat similar to a panic attack but still quite different) someone suggested that if I was feeling so badly about everything and so without any improvement for such a long time I maybe ought to consider a 'more permanent solution'. This hurt, this hurt even more because at that time I was at my absolute lowest moment I had been for the last few years.

**Employment** - is something we all want. At first, I thought none of us wanted to work, but spend enough time on a couch doing nothing and realize how unfulfilling it really is. I spent 10 years working at one of the best places ever and now I'm sitting at home for the last year doing nothing and it's eating away at me. I try to fill this time by doing as much as I can working on myself trying to improve the situation I'm in. But it's reliant on others and therapy and there isn't enough time available. If anything I would want to take a whole workweek of therapy for a couple of weeks or months just to sort things out. But it's impossible. There are 45 minutes a week per issue and that's all the time that's available. Meanwhile, life is moving on and I'm stuck at a point that the only way forward for me is external input. As the past 20 years or so I've pretty much done all I can to resolve it by myself. Because I don't like to ask for help. I detest the fact I even need to get someone else involved in my matters. 

**Romance** - is difficult. The last couple of times I was going out with someone there was quite a bit of disparity between what I was looking for and what they wanted. ""I'm not looking for a relationship at this point, I want it to be casual"". Proceed getting dumped because they found someone else to start a relationship with. It hurts never being that actual special someone in somebody's life. Especially when you keep thinking they might be yours. Experience this situation a few too many times and your dating self-esteem just tanks. Doesn't help my first, and last actual ""relationship-relationship"" was when I was 17 years old. I'm twice as old now but a couple of times more disillusioned.

**Helping others** - is something I really respect in others. And seeing people do this makes me aspire to be like them. I try to do as much as I can, but everything I do feels like it's never anywhere near enough.

**Sharing feelings** - is difficult for people, doubly so for men. Growing up a man you are constantly berated for infractions that are deemed unmanly. I know this is becoming less of an issue nowadays but I had a father that was born before, and lived through the war (western-Europe) and still had many pre-WW2 notions of what was and was not manly. No room for emotions, you just do things, ""you are a man! act like one!"".
""Don't cry, it's nothing!"" while I was 4 years old and I slipped on ice and half my chin needed stitches. Also, society doesn't help much in this regard. Just stomp it down the overflowing rubbish bin instead of taking the trash out in an expedient manner as a more sensible person would.

**Accomplishments** - I've organized dozens of music events, played at big festivals, and events across multiple countries and continents. I got a great house which is totally paid off. I recently got back from the vacation of a lifetime to the country that was #1 on my list of places I wanted to visit. It was truly amazing. I have enough capacity to analyze what's wrong. And I know rationally I am not a bad person. But knowing this rationally versus how I'm feeling isn't helping the situation much. I know I shouldn't be looking for some sort of external validation but I can't help the fact I feel like I have never been loved and I seem to be unable to find this in myself.

**Professional help** - I am currently seeing a psychologist for 45 minutes about every 2 weeks (previously once a month) for a myriad of things. Another person (not a psychologist) is helping me for 2 hours a week with my Aspergers for more practical tasks that need to be done. I feel though that these things aren't enough. I am insured, but the mental health sector is severely overloaded at this point due to cutbacks. I am on the list for depression therapy, but it might take 20 weeks to get to an intake meeting.

I needed to vent. Sorry. =(

470,"During a backpacking trip, me and a friend of mine agreed to share a bed in our first night. For some reason in the middle of the night, while I was asleep, she decided she could grab and play with my breats. I woke up with her hand underneath my shirt caressing my left boob and for a moment, I froze. When I felt her reach for my right boob, I instantly turned my back to her. She decided to get closer and spoon me, and then tried to put her hand inside my shirt once again. At that moment I pushed her hand away, and she backed off. I did not know what to think or do, but I spent the rest of the night half asleep and half awake, yet too afraid to move and show her I was up.

I talked about it with a mutual friend of ours that was backpacking with us. He told me I should confront her, but since I was too scared to give that occurrence its due importance, I merely asked the girl about it and told her it was not cool. She told me ""sorry"" with a half-smile twice in a row and asked me not to mention it again. It felt as if she did not really mean her apology (is saying ""sorry"" a good enough of an apology anyways?) but I let it go for the time being.

A week later, she proved untrustworthy to even show up for me when I needed her so I decided to end our friendship. When I did so, however, she told me I had the tendency to push people away and that I was overreacting and that she had apologised for everything but I refused to forgive her. That made me think that perhaps she did not understand the severity of the situation and so now I feel like I need some further act of closure to end this once and for all.",21Jan2019,1
471,"I moved to a new city for my university studies and now I’m living with a friend/acquaintance I’ve known for several years - we were classmates in middle school. 

We used to get along pretty well while we were just highschoolers, but now, when we live together, we often argue over small things. 

She’s very argumentative, quite short-tempered and she rarely says “sorry” if it’s her fault, she doesn’t care about things like empathy and doesn’t like to help people (these are her words). More than that, she’s veeeery lazy and I often have to do the house chores so that we won’t live in a stable. When I try to discuss with her on these things, she would say “that’s her” and “I can’t change that”. 

I want to find another flatmate, but I’m afraid to stay with a stranger (even if we would be both girls). I’m afraid things will go worse with someone else, who knows what person I will need to stay with. 

This girl that I’ve just mentioned is the only friend I have now...I’m really bad at talking to people, as I’m anxious and it’s very hard for me to make new friends. 

She has a larger group of friends and going out from time to time helps me, even though I don’t really like their presence. I would isolate myself too much if I had no one to go out with. 

What should I do? 

TDLR: I don’t like my flatmate’s personality (meaning that she would often make me cry and think that it’s my fault when it’s not in reality). I want to stay with someone else, but I’m afraid that I won’t be lucky enough to find a person on the same wavelength with me and it would be worse. I don’t have any friends in this new city and it would be a bad idea to stay alone.

472,"Okay, so my GF, who in have been with for 10 years, live with and have a child with, has given me a ""hall pass"" to screw around without her there. A few things to know, 1. She cheated on me a few years ago (we've gotten past this, and before you ask the kid is DEFINITELY mine). 2. I'm bisexual and the hall pass is for a dude.

Now my question is this: Should I do this? I mean. I've been flirting with this guy for a while and we've met up (nothing beyond making out a bit), but while we've made plans to meet up a few times, something always happens and we cancel/reschedule. This has kind of turned me off. 

My GF says she's okay with it because she ""owes me for the cheating."" But I can tell she's not actually 100% on board, which is making me question this whole thing.

473,"Alright, so basically I've been wasting my time behind my PC for most of my life (21 years old right now) and I want this to change. At least since I was 8 years old my routine has literally been wake up, go to school, get home and sit behind the computer until bedtime and I want this to change. As a result of this routine I've had most of my life I feel like I haven't developed proper social skills and I would like to develop those as well, but when I go to social events I usually end up just sitting there looking at other people thinking to myself ""So this is how normal people interact with each other, huh?"" wishing I could interact with other people just like that. This also happens when I'm drunk by the way so that's how I know it's not just something that's because of some sort of anxiety. 

Now some of you might suggest that there is some kind of therapy for this and that I should go talk to the doctor, which I did, back in 2015, I ended up getting referred to some organization (""only"" a 6 month waiting list) which diagnosed me with PDD-NOS and ended up not really helping me at all and after a year or so they sent me to another organization (another 6 month waiting list) which was all just a massive waste of time and money. The second organization also required all ""help"" to happen at home since they didn't have any offices where they allowed clients in, which felt very intrusive to me so after 5 months of additional stress, wasting time and money I ended up stopping with that. So now we're in early 2018 and this is where I started drinking (up until this point I never had any alcohol in my life, mind you) and I feel like alcohol has been more helpful than all the supposed mental healthcare (which in hindsight probably did more harm than good) I received. Obviously drinking alcohol isn't sustainable in the long run and weed just makes me lazy so I ended up making another appointment with the doctor partially in the hope to get prescribed something safer and more effective, but antidepressants just made me more depressed, antipsychotics are basically pharmaceutical lobotomies and with benzos you run into the same problems as alcohol, so I'm stuck with beta blockers, which are in all honesty mediocre at best. So needless to say, my faith in believing that mental healthcare could help when a literal solvent did more for me in terms of improving my situation is very low.

Another thing is that I don't really seem to be able to enjoy most solitary activities any more, for example I've been going to the gym since 2012 but nowadays I find myself to be unable to enjoy it any more. Video games, anime and browsing the internet aren't enjoyable to me any more either but I still end up wasting my time behind my PC because I just don't know any better. In an attempt to combat this behavior I literally destroyed my desktop PC, but now I find myself doing the same shit on my laptop, which I can't get rid of for academic reasons. So part of my question is: How can I combat this behavior so deeply ingrained in me? One of the things I did for the next period was signing up for extra courses next period (because this would limit my time being at home and thus limit my PC usage) but you're limited to 2 extra courses per period and I don't know if it's going to help or not (the next period starts in February).

I've never really been good at telling stories so I'm sorry if this is all an incoherent mess.

478,"Hi!
Me and my family did a secret santa thing in December. I had to get something for my brother (16). He likes video games so I got him a lil mario figurine, made him a tiny head of the Knight from Hollow Knight out of clay and a sword that the guy has in the video game, and a voucher for a website similar to amazon in my country.

Now, my brother had to get something for my dad. He got some cooking things and an advent calendar. When we got home after we gave each other the presents, I asked my dad and brother multiple times if we could scratch open the calendar now, and they each time said okey. So I'm opening each little date before we scratch when my mom comes in. She gets all pissed because 'my brother got that for my dad' hurr durr. Now I understand this, and it wouldn't be a problem if the next thing hadn't happened.

A couple days after we did the secret santa exchange, I come home and my mom tells me my dog chewed up the sword. No big deal, I laugh it off. Next, the dog kind of chews op the mario and my brother says he doesn't want it anymore. I also crafted a platform that spinned around which looked pretty cool imo, for the hollow knight head. Spent some time on that (also said he didn't want it) A couple weeks ago I'm in my parents' room when I see the hollow knight head on my dads desk kinda covered by some papers.

I just told my mom and brother about that at dinner and how I thought it was pretty shitty considering my mom freaked out about the damn calendar so much. She brushes it off and walks off to the kitchen to get some more food. When she comes back I address it again, hoping this time maybe she'll care. My dad asks what it's about and my mom says 'shes angry because the figurine isn't in [brother]' s room or something in a pretty (didn’t know proper english word for this so im just gonna change a word from google into an adjective im sure you'll get what i mean lol) disdainy tone. Stayed silent for the rest of dinner

I know this really isn't a big deal but damn my mom just wouldn't take me seriously. Just needed to vent but if you have any advice thats appreciated. Thanks ",21Jan2019,1

Just starting a discussion, as of Friday being a shocker to me.

Short and sweet, new owners took over the business and have made changes to staff/everything and let me go on Friday since ""I don't fit into their vision of what they want the company to be.""

I intend to implore about unemployment, but I know with the government shutdown it might be delayed or unfruitful but I will still check it out. Worker retraining also interests me due to my desire to find a career.

I know I can Google and look though the resources, but I was curious if there are any little-known things or tips that people can offer that I might not see with a cursory glance of some Google pages.

485,"I need major advice. Please don’t stop reading just because this is a really long story!
Where do I start? I love my mom. She divorced my dad after he cheated, and is basically the only care giver for me and my sister. For the 15 years I’ve known her, she’s never had a boyfriend, and for the 8 years where she’s been single- raising me and my sister, it’s just been us girls. Seriously, our cat and dog are female. There was no testosterone in our home. 
However, spring 2018 she started dating this guy. She never really brought him over because me and my sister are really nosy- so they’d go on dates and we’d hear about them and we were really happy for her! But then in July she went on a week vacation with her, leaving me to sleep on my cousin’s couch while my sister got to be home alone (she was 18). Of course this made me angry! How can you go away with this guy you’ve known for like 2 months and practically abandon your kids?? Whatever. I’m over that. But, my sister started college. And I was really looking forward for it to just be me and my mom until I graduate. Then my mom’s boyfriend started coming every. single. weekend. He would sleep over too. So he’d come Friday and leave Sunday at 5:00 pm. This bothered me and it STILL does. My mom insists that he’s not even here that often, but for me- where the weekends are my only time to take a break from my stressful high school life? That’s a lot. Flash Forward to this past weekend. I insisted that I was allowed to stay home alone while her and her boyfriend stay at a cabin for 2 nights. She reluctantly let me. Saturday morning I get sent a picture of her ring. Yep. Her ENGAGEMENT ring. She’s engaged now! And I’m angry! I’ve told her multiple times I do not like this guy and she’s done nothing. 
Does she not value my feelings?
I was just getting used to her having a boyfriend and now she has a fiancé? 
I’ve been freezing her out since she’s come back- I’m feeling really hurt.
There are so many red flags with this guy, but my mom is just love blind. Please give me advice.
Thanks. 
P.S I’m sorry if this is riddled with typos. This subject makes me angry which makes me type uber-fast. ",21Jan2019,1
486,"Okay let’s see
The story starts at November of 2018. A couple of my friends from school asked me to go with them to hang out at some shisha bar (where I live it’s nothing unique and it’s normal) I said yes cause I didn’t have any plans. So there we are 4 guys one has a girl friend and 3 more single girls. I’ll name them Michel, Veronica and Milly cause why not. So milly is a really close friend of mine and she is like a sister to me and I told the other single guys that she is off limits for them. But then we have Michel and Veronica who were friends with the guy that has a girlfriend and we met them for the first time. We all hang out and go our separate ways. All of that happens at the end of November. Fast forward to the beginning of December and one of my good friends says he likes Michel and my reaction was a normal guy reaction “okay good luck if you need anything I got you just ask”. Fast forward to the middle of December and the guy that likes Michel tells me he needs something from me
Me:sure what do you need?
Friend: I need you to be close with Veronica and maybe be with her
Me: But I don’t know her 
Friend: trust me you will like her
So as a favor I decided to text Veronica (over Instagram cause everyone talked over insta). Nothing weird she is just an average girl. After some more time I learn more about her and I start liking her. For example she likes anime and that’s one of the things that I really like talking about. So I go to talk to my friend again 
Me: ey (fake name) do you still like Michel
Friend: yes a lot why?
Me: cause I kinda like Veronica
Then I told him everything that he needed to know and he supported me for 3 reasons 
1. He knows we have things in common and he supports me as a good friend
2. That would leave with an inside man
3. He thinks Veronica likes me
So all that is great until New Years where I started talking to one of the girls from school and she may not like anime but we have different things in common. Tho Veronica is awesome the school girl (let’s call her Lily) is easier to talk to and I talk to her almost all the time and unlike with Veronica where I ask all the questions Lily usually is the one leading the convo

So TL;DR: I like 2 girls one is from school the other one is not

 I am 18 years old and I work as a Grocery Clerk.  I make slightly above minimum wage, (they matched my raised pay from previous job), and I am looking to earn more. I have approached my manager inquiring about any courses or training I could take to increase my value for the company and my skills. He said he would look into it, but no further discussion proceeded. My employee review is in 2 months.

 I have been thinking about applying to other jobs for leverage, but two situations have me unsure of the correct course of action:

1. I am planning on going to Europe in June 2019 for two months. I will discuss this with my manager 1 month before hand as I feel it will limit possible advancements I can make if I tell him now. 

2. The assistant manager gave me a $25 dollar gift card the other day and said “Thanks for your dedication and work ethic. You’re one of the best employees I have.”  I feel like the option of leverage job offer is killed now - loyalty seems to be working.

I’m not entirely sure where to go from here. I would like to make more money as well as build valuable people and management skills. Any advice on how I can advance with my situation would be greatly appreciated.

There was like a black scab that grew on the side the more it kept happening. It eventually fell off and my toe was going back to normal, no more swelling and it felt good. However I had a really big stub about two weeks ago with the corner of my carpet that caused it to bleed. The black scab is back but it's still here and is currently comparable to the size of a booger. I just noticed last night that there's a part of my toe nail (the pink part) that's now gone and I can see the skin where I would bleed from with too much pressure. The nail itself is kind of turning yellow with either dirt or dried blood in it I can't tell. 

If I have tight socks on the swelling gets red again and it will bleed. However I've been wearing these bigger socks with more room and the swelling goes down a lot. It even gets to the point where it's like walking on a cloud. I'm going to start trying those home remedies where you put your foot in warm soapy water to see what happens.

506,"I graduated in December with a Bachelor of Information Technology and a minor in business from a state university in the Midwest. I've had my sights set on being a software developer since my freshman year

During my senior year, I had two software engineering internships. The first internship was for a small cloud based parcel auditing company. I developed solutions in python that helped predict, diagnose and capture instances of cloud resource misallocation. In most recent role I provided full-stack web app maintenance for a large non-profit medical association. 

The smaller company that I interned with invited me back to interview for a full-time role. I was hoping that since I was a developer for them during my internship, I would be offered a role in engineering.

So I interviewed with several teams and the next day, they offered me the role of business analyst as opposed to software engineer. I neither accepted nor declined the offer. I simply asked if I could have a week to consider the offer.

I am conflicted. The compensation for this role is $50K(again, midwest bucks) + Benefits... This is more than I have ever made. 
My fear is that if I accept this position as a business analyst, I will be limiting the scope of my career. I also feel like it will be harder to land a SWE position if BA was my last listed role and my first role out of college. 

On the flip side, if I reject this offer, I would be passing on a job that pays a decent salary for where I live.

I am just wanting insight from someone who has been in a similar situation. 
Should I:

-Accept the offer and hope that the skills are transferrable to software engineering role. 

-Accept the offer while simultaneously applying for SWE roles. 

-Decline the offer as it does not align with my desired career path.

-None of the above (with closure)

So here's something I'm thinking a lot about these days. Quick background, last year I decided to chase my dream job of becoming a police officer. And since than my days revolve around that. My exams are pretty close and while I'm confident in that I'm gonna pass physical exams I do realize that during the whole proccess someone can just say that I don't fit the role and send me home. And for a long time I had this bad thought in my had about what will I do when I get rejected. But thanks to me working months to prepare for these exams and slowly learning about discipline and consistency I realize I can chase more than one passion.

And so lately I'm not even stressing about my exams, I know there's other stuff I want to do too if I fail. I love coding, I may just move that way. I can work as an EMT which I'd enjoy too and I enjoy working as a nurse too.

What I'm wondering about, is this kind of mindset wrong? Shouldn't I be 100% set on passing the exams? Plus on top of that my job as a nurse isn't paid that good, and I'm getting pressure from my family to do something with higher salary (jokes on them, cops around here are paid worse than nurses).

517,"Newbie here! Also I made this account as my bf is on reddit. 

Sorry its gonna be a long one, so sit tight please. 

Me(22f) and my boyfriend (23) have been going out for about 2 years. The start of our relationship was fucking amazing. We had so much chemistry and felt like we were quite literally made for eachother. He kind of saved me from turning down some dark paths and made me a better person (in all ways, mentally and physically). He treated me like a genuine princess. He looked after me emotionally. He listened to me and helped me. He held me when I was reduced to curling in a ball. He made me feel like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. 

Honestly, there were a couple of red flags in the beginning, like he would get a little bit jealous over male friends or moan if I would go out too many times in a week but I put it down to him wanting me to be the best version of me and tbh the male friends he was worried about were absolute sleaze balls but I had known them 10+ years and there was a good gender mixed group of us that were more like family than friends. Other flags included the amount of holes in his bedroom walls from obvious punching. But he said it was from his teenage years which again is pretty understandable. 

Fast forward to the real issues. We are now so far apart. We basically live together but that consists of me sitting on my phone whilst he plays consoles. I am in a relationship with a child. He has no empathy for anybody. He speaks to everybody like absolute shit. He has major anger issues. He refuses to go anywhere with me. He doesn't spend time with my family or my friends. He will quite happily go out for about 5 nights in a row with his mates and we literally will not see eachother. We don't have sex. We don't communicate about anything. We don't agree on anything (politically or just general affairs). He will throw insults at me like cunt, bitch, whore like they're nothing. He has no respect for any body's property including mine. It's like living with a mentally ill teenager, constantly creeping around to not wake up the demon inside. There are some days where we have a good day, but it's just not no where enough to make up for all the absolutely shit times. I know I deserve better. 

I have felt this way for at least 6 months and I have attempted to break up twice, but both times he's given me reason to think that he will go back to that person I absolutely adored. He'll keep it up for about a week or so and then it's back to the old ways. 

I guess I'm either asking, is it possible for somebody to actually change? Or how is the best way to break up with someone when you know it's going to be messy? We have a dog, we have credit loans, and mostly we are two very toxic people. I do not claim to be innocent, I have my ""quirks"" but we are just clashing on everything and anything and I know if i break up with him, it's going to be a long, messy, horrible, process. He still tells me I'm his life and he wants me to be his wife despite how shitty he is, he will not take it lightly. 

Please help, I am so mentally drained at this point that I have contemplated killing myself to not have to go through this. I know if not done right, he will make my life hell.

519,"I’m 24 years old, my Mexican family is extremely strict and still stuck in very old school, traditional ways. My mom raised me on her own, plus I’m her only child so we’re very close. Recently she’s just constantly all in my space, if I had a bad day at work, I just wanna lay in bed and rest, but she comes barging in and bothering me, sometimes I don’t want that from her or anybody. She has a huge mess around the house and I’ve tried cleaning it up, but she has shit she doesn’t wanna throw away or important paperwork she can’t get rid of, but she just leaves it all out in an ugly mess. She leaves her shit all over my own dresser, moves my stuff around, and can never remember where she leaves them so I’ll be having mini anxiety attacks trying to find whatever I need. I’m at the age where I should have my own place and learn how to live on my own without her, but her and my family are always like, “You’re not moving out til you’re married.” 

Her and my aunt moved out of my grandma’s when they were in their mid-40s, and even then my grandma and their sister (my other aunt) did not speak to them because they “felt betrayed.” I just feel like it’s a lose/lose. If I move out, they’ll be upset and won’t speak to me, if I don’t, I’ll be miserable. 

Also, I know if I tell her I wanna move on my own, she’ll say something about my boyfriend moving in. Which is most likely going to happen because he makes more money than me and can be beneficial, plus we are ready to take that step in our relationship. But Mexican mom mentalities don’t believe in that step. I understand where that coming from, but I’m just not happy living at home anymore. ",21Jan2019,1

524,"This is going to be long 

Ever since High School I can vividly remember girls my and my age disliking me before ever even getting to know me. We’d play a sport and I would score id showboat a little and would receive dirty looks or even comments from the girls on the opposing team being rather abrasive. But it only seemed to happen to me as other guys who scored and celebrated would not receive the same treatment. Other examples include during class I would get an answer wrong and some of the girls would be really bitchy to me for getting an answer wrong but for other guys it wasn’t the case. Moving on to being older I’m 22 as of now and have sensed the same treatment from most girls my age. I will be fine starting off having a laugh getting to know them but after a few days the tone changes that same attitude comes up where i feel as though there’s anger towards me or they just disregard what I say and look for another person within the group to listen to. There’s almost always a snide remark. But it’s strange to me that if I’m 1 on 1 with them they will never do this it’s only if there is a group around. I used to do improv for awhile but after a certain class we had to do an exercise where the class would come up with hobbies we look like we’d do and we’d have to nod and agree quietly. My turn was up and one of the first things said by a girl I had only just met was “ He looks like a molester” and everyone was like omg I totally agree. Needless to say that was my last time there and I haven’t done improv since. This leads me to believe they are uncomfortable around me and only reveal how they really feel when there’s others around. I can be friends with any guy I come across instantly but for the opposite sex it’s not the case. Ive become extremely withdrawn over the years as a result and always watch what I say becoming extremely self-conscious not to step on people’s toes or come off weird. I personally think I’m an easy target which sounds a bit “woe as me” but I feel it’s the truth. If I’m out with friends and something happens I’m looked at as the culprit. I understand it’s coming off as I’m perfect I’m being abused by everyone around me buts it’s simply not true. I understand my faults and the way I act once I get used to someone is very eccentric and I can come off as annoying which is why at a certain point girls tend to get turned off from me personality wise. I need to know what I could do differently to keep friends or things will only get worse and I will become more withdrawn.",21Jan2019,1

530,"From my last post, I've mentioned my first bf, and we haven't really ended on the best terms...

I really didn't want to tell anyone or share it because I was so disgust with what happened and I never really understood what happened... But here's my little story.

My first ex, let's call him Anthony, I tried breaking up with him about 3 times in our 2 year relationship but somehow because I was weak minded I always gave in to the whole ""I'm sorry, it won't happen again"". So I decided to make him end it with me, by distancing myself and just not caring as much and to be honest, it was easy to be mad since nothing in the relationship was anything happy. So, Anthony and I ended it. It wasnt so bad, we were somewhat friends or moreso acquaintances. But then the ex-friend of mine went to Vietnam and I was just here alone with no one to really console me or even to talk to about how I felt or anything. So when she came back, that's when the incident happened... I've forever till this day regretted everything.

My ex-friend came back from her visit, and Anthony and I were so-so at this point. So when she came back, because we worked at the same place at the time, Anthony was there and we both tried our souvenirs from Vietnam. (little back story: Anthony, when we were dating had the best knack of cracking my back to relieve my back pain and it was honestly the only thing I missed) So, my back was a bit stiff and I asked Anthony if he could crack it. Just in the store, like there was no need for privacy, just crack my back like the usual, nothing special. But then he said ""Let's go to the park instead, I'll do it there.""

I was confused, since he can just do it at the store and I can merrily be on my way. But he said that which made me feel a bit off about the situation but what the heck right? Wrong.

We from the subway from downtown to the park near where we both lived, mid bus ride we were just having a somewhat casual convo. Then one thing led to another I said ""Haha lov-..."" and I stopped there. So I almost said love you too but meant it as like ""hahaha love you too"" like as friends do but I stopped since it didn't feel right.  So then, of course, Anthony wanted to know what I was about to say, and I said ""nothing. Don't worry about it.""
So he said that he wouldn't crack my back until I said it.

Thinking about it now it was dumb of me to probably even converse with him at all but I was 18 and I thought we were cool, like friends....

We arrived at the park.
And I told him, and he was like ""Oh.""
So he cracked my back and we just laid on the slides. ( the ones with two right attached to one another.)

*This is where I start hating myself*

10 Mins into our catching up conversation. He pulled me on top of him and he kissed me.

I pulled away. And asked him what he was doing.
He did it again.
I pulled away. And looked at him, told him it felt wrong.
He said. We aren't dating anyone so there's nothing wrong with this.
I got even more confused. And at this point, I don't even know what I was doing anymore.

We got on top of the playground. I gave him a bj hoping that was enough.
He wanted to go all the way. I said no. Just finish in my mouth. I didn't want to go all the way...
He pulled my pants down. And we did it.

(sorry I don't want to go even more into details)

Later on after we finished. We parted ways, he said bye and left.
Me on the other hand, just processed what happened. Bent down and just started feeling disgusting and just felt like I've done the most disgusting and terrible thing and it still feels that way.

He felt nothing and it was apparent when he kept showing up at my workplace (because my ex-friend worked there but he still tried to talk to me). But me, every time I saw him I threw up, I kept gagging. It got to the point where I had sore throat from the gag reflex and my stomach couldn't keep anything down. It was a miracle if I could keep anything down at that time.

I only told two people (and reddit haha..) and it took me 2 years to tell them. I haven't even told my second ex and he got me through it, I just felt so fucking disgusted with myself that I felt as though if I tell anyone they would think that I was bullshitting or even just wanting attention.

Later on I found out that my ex-friend and Anthony told others I was a sex addict. And that just sold the deal of me keeping everything to myself. So yea...

Am I making a big deal out of everything... Since he felt nothing... Or was this rape like my friends say. Because even now... I don't know anymore. I want to know where to start. ",21Jan2019,1

533,"I've had this friend for a really long time and continued being friends with him because he's generally a good-natured guy.
About a few years ago, he got into a relationship with someone.
Because I've been friends with him, I've had the opportunity to see how their relationship grew.
During this time, I've also had the opportunity to make a new friend.
It all came crashing down for me when she told me things I wish I hadn't known.

Though I can't be sure because I do not know ALL of the details, generally speaking, she has revealed to me that their usual sarcastic remarks and bickering has been somewhat semi-serious and it makes both of them feel terrible. On the other hand, all that my friend had to say on that matter ever is that ""we're just joking"". Perhaps that was his way of saying stay out of their business or perhaps that he really doesn't see that it's a problem - either way, I am not and have not been in agreement with their method of engaging with each other.

She claimed that it makes things lighthearted, but contrary to that, what I've observed is that it has created a toxic cycle in which if by chance either of them say something mean, they *could* write it off as a joke, but actually get feelings hurt and later go into honeymoon mode after talking out how much their feelings were hurt. I've seen this happen a few times now and I doubt that it was just those few times that I've seen it because the way she was complaining about this issue seemed to encompass the entirety of her relationship. 

What's screwed up about that is the fact that she went on to say that many people in her life have told her to leave my friend AND that she feels frustrated at her significant other's slow growth into her ideal man - that perhaps she misread my friend's true character. She feels frustrated that her significant other seems to be shutting her off and getting mad at her for the smallest things. She already had the feeling that her relationship would be off, about a year into their relationship. Even after saying all that herself, she still went on to say that she wants to continue being with him because she longs to see the ideal version of my friend.


And with all that said, why am I the one feeling like I am the worst?
How could I have been so passive about their ""joking"", now that I know they weren't really joking?
Why did I just let it all slide for all this time, even though I had the feeling that they weren't really joking?
I wish I could have been a catalyst for growth in their relationship because I feel that I absolutely could have if I had known - if I had known for sure.
Because I didn't know for sure, I stayed silent.
Because I didn't know for sure, I suppressed my own thoughts.
Because I didn't know for sure.
Now that I'm here, more aware of their drama than ever before, I can no longer stay silent - the frustration growing because I *must* stay silent.
I can not directly convince my friend to change his behavior, for he does not know that I know.
I can not be the one to mediate their differences because it will come to light that she has revealed their personal matters to an outsider, which would start another one of their cycles. 
I can not tell her to end the relationship because she doesn't have anywhere else to go, but most importantly, because she is ""fine"" with what she has.
If she ever wishes me to be the one to save her, I would do so without missing a beat - but I must not.


How can I go on with fixing this to maximize overall happiness?
Or rather should I even continue being involved in this?

537,"     My sister (Jenny 22F) is my(21F) “roommate”. She is missing a portion of her cerebral cortex but  she is pretty able and if you met her, you may not even notice she was developed any different than you, unless you paid real close attention.
     Example, she walks with a slight limp and drags her feet. She does mentally process things slower. One time she went to the mall with a friend, said friend said something Jenny didn’t like, so Jenny punched her in the face in public and Jenny didn’t understand or care that it was wrong because that’s just not how she works. 

My parents divorced and my dad kept full custody. My mom left and is currently incarcerated.

I moved out at 18 because my dad was really rough with me and I wanted to explore the world. 
I did the exploring, moved to Texas with my dog, rented out my own house for cheap, then moved back home at 20 to go to college with my dads military grant.
When I moved back, my dad and I got in an argument and he told me to pack my things and get out. I began to pack and he immediately switched and asked me to stay.
     He revealed to me that he feared Jenny would become homeless without help. She wouldn’t make it. She does have a problem. He wanted to fulfill his dreams of moving to Alaska and couldn’t do it without me. So I stayed home and silently watched over her from a downstairs bedroom (she has the whole top floor to herself so we have some privacy).
    One day, I came home to her showing a dude the spare office downstairs. She told him this would be his bedroom. I tried to protest and she is extremely violent and larger than me so we had a really scary altercation. The guy moved in against my will and ended up sexually assaulting me, denying it and threatening us all with suicide. My sister let him stay in our home an additional 3 months because she couldn’t count 2 months right. Not even being fucked up, it’s what happened and she gave him a wrong date to move out. She did NOTHING to handle that properly and his response when I would speak to him as an adult about not smoking inside, not leaving the doors unlocked, he’d say “I go through Jenny so worry about yourself”
In the fucking house I grew up in. 
I eventually had to evict him myself and his family also threatened me and told me they’d come after me if anything happened after forcing their way into our home to help him move out a goddamn mini fridge from his room.
    My sister then let her boyfriend move in and he’s the laziest guy ever. He’s never taken out the trash, he’s never done dishes. He’s not even paying rent and my dad still pays her bills. It’s not fair and I’m moving out in September.
   She is violent, jobless, refuses to accept my offers to drive her to therapy or the social security office so she can get an MRI and look into benefits, and my dad just left me to look after her and clean up after her and get sexually assaultEd in my own home by a 29 year old random man and I just am so miserable. I know I sound ungrateful but she is mean, messy and I’m so tired. I’m a 21 year old working at an ice cream shop going to school and I just want to be ok.

Anyway over the last few weeks I've made a new friend from work. My regular social group was out of contact and I like keeping socially active so work related texts wound up being conversations and now evidently she doesn't talk to anybody as much as she talks to me

I know I'm very old fashioned and that's becoming evident in this situation, but I feel like I'm going crazy - single teenage girls and married adult men shouldn't be interacting, correct? FWIW I draw a hard line at in person socializing, I'll drive her home if she needs and we'll talk at work but I've explained that it's a total no-go if she wants to go have lunch or come over to my house.

I asked her if she thought it was weird and she said of course not, so I asked my spouse and she said it's totally normal, so I asked a few friends who said there's nothing wrong with that. You know who wouldn't find it normal? Her parents - if I was the father of a teenager and I found out a grown man in his mid twenties was messaging my daughter in the middle of the night I'd get him fired and probably get physical too. It's insane how no one sees things this way. 

So I'm crowdsourcing an opinion on 1) if I'm right and it's abnormal and 2) what should be done. My mindset is to just stop talking to them and deal with the awkwardness that ensues at work. Better than messing with a kid's head and having them think they're an adult when they're not - I might be platonic and respectful but the next dude in his twenties will definitely not be",21Jan2019,1

During the talk, my gfs co-worker said accused her of some minor stuff, that she oce went home too early, etc. Almost everything was a misunderstanding/explainable and when my GF asked for More Details, she received an answer like ""thats not a specific Problem, just generally"".

My gf is very Kind and switched her earlier job because at the last Kindergarden she worked at, her co-workers were liers and not really teamworkers (snitching in the co-workers, for example, or not talking face to face with someone if there is a Problem, but rather directly talk to the boss). 

My GF was really disapointed, that her co-worker put her in such a Bad light in Front of their boss, and didnt try to talk to her alone first, as none of the mentioned problems were really huge, and most of them were misunderstandings.

Shes not the Kind to argue, and felt as the victim in that Situation. Of course she questioned a lot of the statements, but was always legt with open/broad/General answers. She was also disapointed by her boss, as it looked like she was in a 1v2 Situation, and her boss didnt question my GFS co Worker at all.

So it is obvious  that my career should have something to do with my interests therefore ideally I see myself working for a company like boston dynamics  as an engineer here is what I don't know   
which engineering field i should go in   
\-electrical  
\-mechanical   
\-software (I think AI is a very exciting  field with decent demand )   
what should I do to build a portfolio so that I can get work  in automation or robotics or a similar field    
I also don't know if I have the aptitude to actually succeed in any of these highly competitive  fields since maths isn't really my strongest subject but I would rather fail trying than quit while I am ahead   
as of now I have tried to actively pursue robotics and computer science as much as possible by participating in regional events eg-

Robo-wars x2 - won 2nd both times 

Web designing - won 1st

Science fair - tried to design a software that could guess probability of having or acquiring certain disease over lifetime by use of a questionnaire

I also have my collection of personal projects from including but not limited to converting a few switches wireless (fans and lights ),a  solar tracker , an automatic plant watering system which has been working without any major problem for about 4 months now , and many more small and mostly useless arduino and  coding projects (snake game etc)

But at the same time i realize that i have not done anything that could distinguish me from the crowd of millions of other students who are much better than me deserve more than i do and have more resources at their disposal then i have  how can i compete with that ?

548,"I have two sons, the first is 20 and has a car and is covered by my insurance. He has gotten into 5  accidents, most his fault, and as a result the cost has skyrocketed. He pays for some of his share but its still a ridiculous amount. He drives to work every day (less than 15 minute drive) and is soon going to move with gf closer to her college (he does not go to college) My other son is 16 and has his license. We were going to buy a cheap car (split the cost) so he could drive to school and the library since he studies a lot and has a lot of extra-curriculars (5.0 GPA whoo!). The only problem is that adding another teen driver would really increase our premium, regardless that he is accident free with good grades. What should I do?

550,"Background: I'm (24F) living in a foreign country right now and to meet people I started going to these events at bars for international people. I've mostly stopped going now, because at these events, which supposedly have a strict no-romance policy, I kept giving my contact info to guys (often much older than me) simply because I couldn't think of an excuse to say no, seeing as how they're events for meeting people. Shortly after I'd have to turn down their invitations to dinner, clubbing, etc... Very frustrating, although I perhaps could've thought of an excuse to say no. 

One of these guys didn't give me the feeling that he was interested in more than friendship, nor did he seem too interested in hanging out or whatever, we got along very well too. For info, he's not from a western country though lived in different cultures during his childhood, is fairly religious, and probably in his late 30s (I'm 24, when I first got his number I assumed he was younger). I don't know his age because I feel weird asking and the one time someone else asked, he was cryptive and changed the subject. I've spent some one-on-one time with him, he has always been chill and never weird or flirty. But over text he is super awkward and clingy. Possibly it's a combination of the cultural differences and English not being his first language. He often uses weird names like ""danger girl"", ""swan"", ""your highness"" etc, which often come off as flirty. Once when I told him I went out with friends for drinks he said ""good for you, except the drinks, I like the lady before the drinks"" - just an example of weird stuff he says. He responds to my Instagram stories making weird comments and saying he wished he was there to get food with me, etc. It's not uncommon that'll he message me on Instagram and text me in one day. I also once told him I had a date, and he jumped to the conclusion that I had a boyfriend - which I allowed him to believe - but this didn't seem to change anything. 

Basically, these interactions are kind of annoying and sometimes make me uncomfortable. Even aside from all this, I'm not sure how I feel about having a guy friend who's 10+ years older than I am. He's a nice dude, he just doesn't seem to understand social norms or that he's coming off really weird and clingy. He apparently has other female friends, so I dunno if he's like this with everybody or what. My friends have told me to just ghost him but I feel pretty bad since we've established a friendship. I was hoping that he'd stop texting me eventually if I didn't always respond and didn't make time to see him, but no luck.

How can I deal with this without being mean? ",21Jan2019,1
551,"Up until I was 18, I had grand plans to be in the fashion industry or something in entertainment, seeking fame. I entered fashion school, but dropped out a week later due to my extreme social anxiety and lack of confidence in my skills. From there I joined a community college, thinking I’d figure it out eventually. 

Then when I was 19, my dad was killed in a horrific freak accident and it completely ruined me. I lost all interests and will to live. The only thing that kept me going was fear of hurting myself and leaving my mom. I managed to get a BA in Communications, but only because it was an “easy major” and I cheated my way through. Most of my college years were spent running out of class crying about my dad. 

Since then, I’ve spent hours/years applying to well over 10,000 jobs. I’ve gone to career groups, agencies, everything. I’ve revised my resume more times than imaginable. But every time I landed a big interview, my social anxiety got the better of me and I bomb. I spent another 8 years on anti-depressants and doing CBT therapy. During this time, my mom went crazy and my family life had suffered immensely (prison, losing a home and life savings, death threats, etc). 

I’m now 3 months shy of turning 30...and I feel incredibly depressed and lost. I’ve managed to last at a receptionist job for 1.5 years, but my days are slow and the pay is awful. Everyone around me has a great job and are settling down, and I’m still working a job I could’ve done as a teen. 

I try so hard to enjoy life, but the truth is I don’t have any hobbies. And although I think I have emotional intelligence, I’m not smart. When my colleague tries to teach me something, my brain shuts off and it’s hard for me to comprehend. Though I’m painfully shy and anxious, I was always considered “the hot girl”. Now that my looks are fading, I don’t even have that as an advantage...since I can’t rely on being smart to get ahead. 

I’m terrified I will end up a loser forever, in a dead-end admin job with low pay. I see myself living at home forever and never amounting to anything. I take all the necessary steps to improve myself, but always end up where I started. Waking up everyday is so painful and I feel like my life has no purpose. What should I do? :’( ",21Jan2019,1

553,"I work part-time at a doctor's office (orthopedic surgeon). Been there 4 years. I'm 27 now, and single. The last two years I was going to college part-time. I'm currently having difficulties with my classes and put off college for a semester. The last 4 years I've been busy but with my down time lately, I've noticed how messed up my mom and her bf's relationship is. Ironically, the doctor's office I work at, the office manager is my mom's bf's SiL.. and the doctor is married to the office manager. My mom's BF also works there part-time and that's how I got the job there. My mom and her BF have been together for 8 years.

When I met the office manager (mom's bf's SiL) and started working at the office, she seemed like a nice generous person and knowing about her friendship/relationship to my mom and her BF, I really liked her and trusted her. She seemed like a total sweetheart and very understanding. She seemed genuinely interested in me and my life. I was drawn to her and looked at her and even the doctor as family - she treated me better than my own relatives. She and the doctor were the ones that encouraged me to attend college.

Here's where the drama comes into play: My mom's BF is 71 years old, my mom is 65 - both widowed. Her BF lives with his son in his sons house. His son is 47, doesn't work, and his dad pays for every thing. His dad also supports his alcoholism and marijuania issues. His son drinks and smokes weed all day and his dad gets frusrated and vents to my mom about it. My mom gets tired of hearing about it and doesn't see their relationship going anywhere. Her BF is a weak guy and doesn't stick up for himself or my mom. My mom also gets tired of hearing her bf's swearing 24/7 and burping and farting all the time along with other childish issues he has. When her BF is around his SiL, he acts like a completely different person and kisses her ass and cleans up his act. He goes out of his way to control his image to his SiL and gets offended when my mom calls him out in front of her. Which in return makes him run to his SiL and try to reestablish his image so she doesn't think any less of him. I'm pretty sure he runs to his SiL to blab when my mom and him have an argument or disagreement. Her BF also runs to the office or SiL house with the doctor to work. He's never with my mom hardly and my mom gets tired of it. It's to a point where my mom calls them his mommy and daddy. My mom has said things about his SiL because of how she acts and she's tired of it. SiL runs his life 24/7 and is giving him a paycheck to help him because of his lazy son.

The SiL has changed in my eyes. I've found her to be a liar and manipulative and a control freak. I've found her to be really insecure and competitive towards me. She also competes with my mom over moms BF. She didn't invite my mom to her grandson's BDAY party and my mom has went every year. On other occasions she has left my mom out until the last minute. I feel like the SiL's existence with my mom's BF is purely based on what SiL can get moms bf to do for her. If he jumps to her every need, she treats him like royalty. She uses his kindness to her advantage. As soon as he doesn't do something or do something right, she makes remarks about him. She loves it when the staff kisses her ass. I think my mom has called this out numerous times and the SiL doesn't like my mom cuz she speaks her mind.

I can post more later based on replies but I feel like I can't explain them all in one post lol

557,"This is a long post, sorry about that. 
Apologies if my formatting is bad, I'm on mobile and new to reddit. 

The (long) backstory: My aunt from my moms side got a divorce about a year ago and decided to move to Chicago to meet a man she met through Facebook. At the time she had 2 kids (from a previous marriage).

When she left my family and I had very little way if contacting them. From what we picked up on the new boyfriend was very controlling. He would allway have to be present for her to make a phone call, and would limit the when she could call us. 

It then came out that she had gotten pregnant with the boyfriend. At this point my aunt decided to move back. While she got back on her feet my family offered her tobmove on with us. No one was certain on why she moved back, but she mentioned that she had enough of her boyfriend. 

A little while later the baby was born. It was if the whole family including me had completely forgotten  about everything that happened prior. I ended up loving and caring for this baby so much that she left like a sister to me. 

At the time I was going through some rough times with starting college and almost dropped out. But seeing how happy this baby was gave me the push I needed to keep going. I wanted to show her a good example when she grew up. 

Then my aunt asked me if I wanted to be the baby's godparent for baptism. I can't even put into words how happy I was to be chosen. 

However: It has now come out that she will be moving back to Chicago. With the old boyfriend. 

We had know that she was still in contact with him and still was trying to be as controlling. He would require my aunt to send him a picture of the baby once a day and would need to know her location at almost all times. 

Now I feel awful about losing the person who gave me reason to do better. I dont how to handle this situation.

558,"So I'm in college doing an exchange currently and laundry at my new school is really expensive, especially since I'm used to free laundry. I don't have a lot of clothes so I was thinking I could just wash all of it in one load to save some cash. Problem is, I just bought some new clothes (black jeans, black shirt, red sweater) and I don't want them to bleed onto my other clothes. I don't wear a lot of light colored clothes, so all I'm really worried about are some lightwash jeans and a mint green shirt. Most of my clothes are black so really no problem there. I normally wash all my clothes on cold anyway to avoid bleeding, but I always separate lights and darks unless I know everything is old and I don't care if some colors fade a little.

Does anyone know a way I can do everything in one load and not worry about color bleeding? Or should I just suck it up and do two separate loads?",21Jan2019,1

561,"Back story to show how ""deserving"" is based off her feelings and no actual legal or lawful thing I've done wrong. My room mate (ex best friend), myself, and her boyfriend all moved into an appt June 2017 and did a one year lease. After a 6 year abusive and manipulative relationship (3 years living with her) I finally saved up enough money to leave her and move in with my boyfriend by June 2018. I have texts/documentation of me telling her months in advance that I am looking for a place to be out by June. Asides from her basically rushing my actual moving so she can take my key a month early from me, I decided to let her keep the $300+ worth of heavy craft supplies and furniture she and I had bought over the course of three years. She blocked me on all social media and my phone, got her parents and a few other friends to block me. She's mad because she doesn't have the control over me that she usually has and that I didn't revolve my moving around her finances, which she and her partner make three times as much as I do considering Im a full time student working a 26 hr a week job. She claims that I financially damaged her although she and her partner only had to pay an extra $175 each on rent as I increased my rent by $175 also just to be out of the place and in my new home.

Regardless after I left I told the condo agency that I was gone as of June, they told me they could not split any checks and that the deposit check will be given to them but will have all our names in it so that she will need my ID to deposit it. Today I get a message from her boyfriend (I blocked her number) saying that she doesn't feel like I ""deserve"" the full $350 of my deposit and will gift me $100 for the trouble of going to the bank with them.

I literally don't give a shit about a meesely $350 even though I could use the money, quite frankly I didn't even expect to see the money considering I was originally told the bank would just need my signature and figured she'd just forge my name considering that's something shitty she would do. As you can see from her message what a self serving, ass hole I'm dealing with and am unsure of if I should just expend the energy to take her to small claims court, should I just give her the money because I would happily spend $350 to have her out of my life, should I tell the banker while I'm there that I'm owed $350 of the check although I'm 100% sure she's going to have it put into her account and not cashed. What do I do Reddit? I want to be done with this person, I am doing so so so much better without her toxicity in my life. ",21Jan2019,1
562,"When I was living abroad in China I was staying at an international dorm/apartment building for students. All the foreigners knew each other, hung out, and drank.

I was flirting with Muslim man from Mauritania off and on, chatting but also getting up to leave and chill with friends for periods of time. I was hammered by the end of the night, and I had lost my room key. Because I had lost my room key the previous night, and it was 4am I didn't want to wake up the nice cleaning lady to let me in. The guy saw me shivering on a bench and told me I could sleep on his couch. When I got to his place, I undressed and rifled through a pile of old shirts on the floor (again I was on the verge of blacking out so I only kind of remember this) to get something besides my sparkly club dress. He curled up next to me and started groping me, I pushed him off the couch but he tugged and I tumbled on top of him. He proceeded to have sex with me as I drifted off into drunk half sleep.

When I asked for an explanation the next day, in hysterics, he more or less said that I was inviting him by taking my clothes off and wearing his clothes.  That he never imagined a woman would do that if they didn't want sex.

564,"I'm not an incel, I promise. Actually, I guess I am by like textbook definition, but I'm not one of the guys who talk raping girls and tell women they're flaming pieces of shit or whatever it is they do with their lives. I blame no one for my issues other than myself. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never been kissed (except when I was six but I don't really think that counts). I've never had sex (obviously). And I'm almost 21 years old. When I was 18, I promised myself that this was no longer going to be true. That was basically four years ago. I assure you I have made no kinds of progress whatsoever except brief (and unsuccessful) stints on Tinder. If I don't fix things within the next few months I'm afraid I will wake up at 50 with no meaningful experience of intimacy whatsoever.

Now, you make be thinking obviously this girl is like coyote ugly. I kind of wish it was true because then I'd obviously understand why I'm in this situation. I'm not trying to be narcissistic but I'm attractive (allegedly according to other people). I've had strangers tell me this and honestly, I still kind of think they're full of shit but everyone can't possibly be conspiring to lie to my face. I never ask anyone if I'm pretty, they tell me this of their own accord. I dress well, I take care of my appearance, I'm really into fashion, and I don't smell bad. So I don't really think attractiveness is a factor here. Also obviously looks don't take you very far or else I wouldn't be in this situation.

I think I'm awkward but like a weird kind of awkward. I have friends but I have difficulty establishing close relationships with people. All my life I kind of have had this weird barrier with other people. People describe me as outgoing and friendly but, I  really feel like I have very few close friends (like one and a half). I feel like the people in my life are always really temporary. I'm always afraid of pushing myself onto people too much and I think that kind of makes me hold everyone at arms length. I'm afraid of texting people too much or trying to hang out too much but, I think people might also see that as a lack of effort on my part. I don't really know how to get over this. In the past, my desperation has led me to be friends with really shitty people just because they were wiling to ""let me in the group"" if that makes any sense. I also think people assume I'm this confident and cool person, when I'm clearly not. 

An example would be in high school we wrote letters in like the 9th grade to read when we graduated. Inside one of my friends letter she talked about how I was her best friend. I never mentioned her once. I even listed people I considered good friends and had to hide mine from her. I would have loved to have been her best friend, I just didn't realize that we were. I was also kind of too busy trying to be friends  with the shitty people I mentioned above so that might also be it. 

I literally just went to a club with these new people that I met and a guy asked me for my number so I gave it to him because I thought this would be a great opportunity to try and put myself out there. He texted me all weekend and I barely responded. 

I think the problem also might be that I do some really strict vetting. If I've assessed the fact that you're out my league or will expect too much out of me, I won't give you the time of day. Example: if you're someone who works out, very confident, look like an Abercrombie model, you have zero chance outside of my daydreams. I am terrified of embarrassing myself. Who the hell wants to explain why they're a mess like me without the anonymity of Reddit???? No one. That's who.

I think what I'm really hoping for is to one day run into somebody who is exactly like me. But that will never happen because people who are like me, never, ever follow through. I once ran into a guy who I thought was perfect (as perfect as someone can be upon initial evaluation). He was cute, matched my style, really sweet, and the perfect amount of awkward. Instant connection. Asked me for my number. Never called. If we're being honest I'm still slightly mourning this (and if by some chance you're reading this, fuck you man, I would have fucked you...maybe. Idk...you might have dodged a bullet). 

How can I overcome this?

During that brief time I attempted to shove him out of my mind and find distractions so I would be less weary.

Fast forward to today, I often think about my friends more than him and it makes me feel guilty.

He’s always making excuses as to why he’s not getting the real amount of money he should be getting and that’s where it involves his work. Let me clear something up real quick. My father has been working in the same place for 15 years. The managers and assistant managers know him very well since they’ve been working together for a long time. Whenever my father is in need of money, they’ll give it to him but ask to return the amount he borrowed by taking money out of his paycheck. My father has accumulated a large sum of debt because of this and he won’t tell my mother exactly how much he owes. This has been going on for 2 straight years. Last year after my parents got their tax returns, he had to repay over $2k worth of debt and most likely will repay a larger sum once they receive their tax returns. Why does he need money before his paycheck? My mother and I are assuming he’s become an addict. My father has shoulder and internal issues which developed from standing for over 11 hours.

(I don't think there is a word for that in English, but it's just about the friends attitude he has, I assume. As I said I'm not even sure if she likes that guy, I don't even who he is.) She added something like she wanted them to be closer than that  and the whole call was her being mad about something he did. I feel guilty because I eavesdropped the whole talk after I overheard some of it. I want to know more about the situation and talk about it with her but would that be okay? I think she wants to keep her life private to herself but I'm not sure. How would you react if you were in my mother's place and I asked about those?

582,"Hello,

I’m an 18 year old White female. My father has been racist since I have been little. I’ve been brought up that way. I grew up in a predominately White area. He forced a lot of his views on me growing up. My father was never fond of Blacks, Hispanics, Middle-Easterners, etc.

From how I was raised, I have always been taught that Black men can hurt you. I really do not mean to be scared of them, but when I see a group of Black men my first instinct is fear. My father brainwashed me growing up that Black men will hurt you, they will steal from you, etc. He’s made similar comments about Hispanics saying things like a lot of Hispanic men are in gangs and are dangerous. The comments he made about Middle Eastern people or Muslims are things like, they are terrorists or they will kill you and you need to be careful around them.

All of these things my father said to me growing up has kind of sinked into my subconscious mind. I really do not want to continue this thinking pattern.

I’m now in university, and I’ve seen and met plenty of Black people, Hispanic people, and Middle Eastern people. Most of them were nice people, but the things my father have told me about these groups are always in the back of my mind.

It’s so hard to unlearn what you were brought up to believe. I could really use some advice on how I can completely unlearn what I have been brought up to believe.

**tl;dr: My father raised me to be racist. A lot of the things he told me about Black people, Hispanic people, and Middle Eastern people, I've been trying to unlearn. It is so hard though. I'm now in university and I have met people in each group who were nice people. But the fears my father has instilled in me are always in the back of my mind.

585,"Adopted a cat from a shelter as a group (everyone split the cost). Immediately, one roommate became possessive and assumed ownership. We bought food since he had been feeding her out of his own pocket, and he immediately became defensive &amp; asked us to not do so in the future. To counteract this, I bought her toys, multiple beds (one for each room in the house) and a cat condo so she can climb. He took every bed I bought besides one, and put it in his room in hopes she'd stay with him, but she still prefers to sleep in my room. 

**Some background:**

I leave the door open at night to allow the cat to roam. There have been multiple instances where he has let himself in if in because he thinks I'm asleep, and will try to take the cat from her bed. I have also heard him outside my room trying to lure her with whispers or a toy. (She will not reciprocate) He will also refrain from feeding or giving her water until very late at night in order to gain more attention from her. 

She will be cuddled sleeping in her bed or window sill, and he'll grab her. She'll react with unhappy noises and grunts, and will try to claw him to get free, which he retaliates by holding her neck and paws. This has gotten to the point where he has deep scratches up &amp; down his arms. He will also hold her down to look at her nails, which she clearly doesn't enjoy, and has used human nail clippers to cut her nails. 

He constantly feels the need to hold her when she does not want it, and if she tries to get out, he'll put pressure on her so she can't move. Once, he told me that she clawed him so he held her neck so tight she could not stand correctly afterwards...

I have repeatedly tried to explain and show how uncomfortable this makes me, and that he should stop being so rough with her. With our lease ending in a few months, I have decided to move elsewhere, but fear he will refuse to let me take the cat, but there is absolutely no way I can let him keep her. Originally, I thought about offering him money to cover the cost of care for the past year, but I'm afraid he'll refuse. How should I approach this?

He broke my trust a few times in the past but promised to do better. Not cheating but lying about where he went and such.

We had a massive fight last friday. It was about my trust issues. Saturday he had to work for 8 hours. His work is physically demanding and he always sweats a lot.

Saturday evening he came home and told me he forgot his working shirt in his car, that he will wear it sunday again because he had to work then too.

This is out of character he always brings his working clothes home. Anyway I was suspicious so Sunday evening he came home with his work clothes. I inspected it and they looked clean.

When I sniffed deeply I could smell some light sweat in the armpit area but that's only it. His shirts usually stink bad at the end of the day. And he worked around 14 hours in this shirt.  I confronted him and he said he just went to work.

588,"This will be kinda long, tl;dr at the bottom!
So a little background:
I’m a semi-recent college graduate (may 2018) with a degree in Psychology currently working just over part time hours in my field. I hope to eventually be a therapist working with people affected by trauma and mood disorders. In order to do this though, I need at least a Masters degree. 
The dilemma: 
I have found three available routes so far to make graduate school affordable. 
1. My dad heavily advocates me going into government work. Get a clearance and get a gov job which often comes with benefits and tuition assistance in STEM fields. He figures I get the clearance (which I’ve already started filing for because I got a job in June which initiated the process then the job fell through, now I just have a pending clearance process) which opens the doors to more gov jobs which will likely fund my degree. 
2. Apply to grad school, take out loans, pay them later with a degree which doesn’t necessarily make a lot of money. 
3. Apply to grad school and get a stipend or similar scholarship to help defray costs. 

As it currently stands the process of getting the clearance sounds like an increasingly unhelpful idea because it’s a lot of time and effort (4-6 months) to get something which *might* help me get a job which *might* help me pay for graduate school. Moreover, I don’t even want to work in government within my field because I want to work with the general populace not super small groups of people in a research context and I want the freedom that comes with working in a privately owned clinic. However, I feel like if I stop the process now then I’m throwing away an option. 

Tl;dr
Do I keep putting time and effort into a security clearance to get a gov job (even though I don’t ultimately want to work in the government) to pay for school or do I say fuck that shit and try to go directly to graduate school  and deal with the debt after the fact?",21Jan2019,1
589,"Last year I did a co-op placement  at a magazine and my supervisor gave me her phone number and I used it to contact her a few times throughout the semester but when the semester ended we rarely contacted each other (last time was April 2018) and if we did it was via email. 

I’m going to university next year and would like to use her as a reference for a scholarship I’m applying for. When I emailed her asking her, I got an automatic out of office reply (she had a baby last spring and is on maternity leave).

A while ago I made a post about how I was kinda getting bullied at school by my own friends. Since then I have been seeing them a lot less often and tried to hang out with other people. However, my ‘persona’ at school is someone who is always joking and making light of situations. It has gotten to the point where I can’t tell anyone about how I feel because they expect me to be happy. The school I go to is the typical bad British school full of people who think they are hard and I don’t fit in much so I don’t have many friends. I’m also not that clever so I get bad grades in tests most of the time (which I then kind of have to joke about because my friends expect me to laugh). Loads of people also pick on me because they know I’m not the type to fight people and I’ll basically do nothing back. All of this has been really getting me down and I’m just lost. I feel sad most of the time and all the stuff I have to do is all floating around my head constantly nagging me (like I have 3 tests this week and I can’t stop thinking about them and I think I’m  gonna do awfully). I’m also scared to say anything to my family so in their eyes my life is going fine.  As soon as everything shuts off and I’m in bed I immediately think about all the stressy things and usually just lie there crying.

593,"I go to a boarding school (high school at the moment), so I only get to stay with my parents a handful of times in the year. They don't live together either, so they complain they barely see me (I was previously day-schooled).

The number of times they call me is absurd. They both expect to speak to me everyday for over 10 minutes, and since I barely have any free time, it's incredibly frustrating.

It's alright with my dad who's understood now, but my mum's just texted me a tirade about how I never speak to her, I only do so on alternating days, and only speak for 60 seconds. In reality, I had just called her for upwards of 5 minutes, and proceeded to get ranted at about my dad, her work, etc..

Not only do I not want to hold a conversation that only hurts me, but it's a massive time consumer and I hardly get to actually speak about normal things. I've expressed my frustration to my parents multiple times, but my mum's not budging. It's unreasonable of her to suggest calling so often and for so long!

They also have normal conversations with them, where there parents aren't complaining about each other. :/

598,"Hey there, 

&amp;#x200B;

So my company has an annual review process and I just received my completed review from my higher up before our meeting to discuss it Wednesday. I agree with many of the critiques on it for sure, I had a lot of cleaning up to do in 2018 of some processes and creation of some that didn't exist, it held me back from really planning and making major headway as the Marketing Director. It's a one person department (me) and they had no one to do it before me so it's a lot of starting from scratch. 

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that many of the comments are about me not talking more in meetings or directing conversation in my checkins with my boss. It's interesting to me because he's never brought that up as a point in my 2.5 years working in some capacity at this company (I was his direct report the entire time). These sorts of comments docked a lot of points across all these different areas on the review. Looking back, we've never discussed his management style and what he prefers/dislikes. I was sort of thinking if something wasn't going how he wanted it to be, he would let me know? This is our first formal review since I started with the company part time in 2016 and then was bumped up to full time Jan 2018 for some context. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning to really argue my case for a major raise on Wednesday because I currently handle all the marketing, graphic design, web design, content creation, volunteer program, email and social media marketing functions for the business. In total I received 77/100 points based on the criteria in the review although I exceeded all my goals for 2018 in terms of revenue associated with marketing efforts generated.   


I'm trying to figure out how to still argue my case without making it uncomfortable in the discussion. I've frankly lost a lot of motivation to stay but I want to help the company succeed and benefit from it. I also don't want to blame him for not communicating how he prefers our meetings to go, I should have also asked for feedback, but I didn't really know there was a problem until this review. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering just being completely candid about all of my thoughts on this but also not sure how unprofessional that would be considered. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just lost, guys. If I had to grade myself adjusted for not knowing how he prefers our interactions to go, I would have earned closer to a 87/100 and would feel much better about asking for the raise.

The place were moving into has 2 bedrooms that are the same size, but one has its own ensuite bathroom.

615,"There is a lot behind this, I’ll try to explain the best I can. 

Mid last year my best started do date my best female friend who just got out of a seriously abusing relationship. A couple months later she cheated on him for her ex that was abusing, she lost all of her friends including me at that time. However she has left him again and apologised to all of us, we have decided to give her another chance and let her back into the group. 

At the same time as this another one of my friends was dating the sister of the friend who got cheated on. They were always on and off but it’s finally ended the other week but they are both super immature about it all. 

Just recently my female friend has become a thing with the guy who dated the sister, are you following? This had made things really difficult, we are going into year 12 which is the year we should all be together, but everything is falling apart. 

That is the main drama however there is plenty plenty more that’s going on with other friends in the group (we have quite a large group of friends). It seems to never stop and I’m done with it. 

I plan to just leave everybody and stick to myself, be because being alive is better than being around this. However I’m not really sure, nothing will fix this and there’s no good scenario in which this finishes.",21Jan2019,1
616,"This might be long, I apologize. 

I'm currently living with my mother, who I love deeply, but she is a very co-dependant person. She has supported my abusive, unemployed, drug addicted father for many years. My father was in prison for robbing a chain of gas stations with a gun for most of my childhood so I grew up without him in a very loving home. When I was a teenager he got out of prison on parole and my mom gave him a chance and let him come live with us. It was a terrible decision, and my father turned out to be one of the worst people I've ever met in my entire life. 

I moved out of my parents house when I was 17 and started working, and I just kind of didn't talk to my parents for years. I suppose I was angry with them. I am now in my mid twenties and due to getting fired right before christmas of 2018 I had to leave my apartment and come live with my mother again for the first time in 8 years. My mother has been taking care of my father all this time. During my time away my father has racked up numerous theft charges, drug arrest, a DUI, and three separate family violence charges. Now that I am back home, I see the extent of what he has done to my mother over the years, and how he is continuing to live his life. 

He does drugs in our backyard and will passout in our driveway infront of the whole neighborhood, I will find him bent over barely able to stand up in the garage due to drugs, and when he is sober he is very mean to my mother. I called the police, but they told me without an eviction which takes weeks to process they cannot physically remove my father from the house unless he hits one of us or is doing something they can catch him in the act with. 

My mother has agree'd my father has to leave. We lock the doors on him when he is outside but it makes him angry and he will go walk into the city and wait until night-time and then sneek back into the house through windows while we are asleep. He refuses to leave. I also fear he might get violent with me if I keep pushing the issue. 

I do not know what to do. I'm just trying to protect my mother and make her life better. I won't be living at this house much longer, but the time I've been here I've seen how my parents lives are now and it breaks my heart. Any advice on how to get him legally removed from my home or thrown back in prison? He has a massive criminal record, the police will believe me over him, I have a clean record. ",21Jan2019,1
617,"I am a 22 yr old female who recently went to a bar with my friends. As we were paying our tabs my boyfriend (25M) noticed a a metal trophy on the wall and dared me to take it (it was about the size of my hand). I took it and flirtatiously asked him if I should keep it and the manager yelled from across the bar ""Don't do it!"" and came over to confront me. I immediately put it back and my boyfriend assured the manager that we were just messing around and obviously we would not have taken it. It only escalated though and the manager wouldn't drop it.

They think I am not ready. They have been saying I am inexperienced for about 2 years now though (I never asked them if I could drive alone before I had my license of course.

620,"My girlfriend was never vaccinated, for anything, HPV, polio, MMR, nothing.  And so the college we go to is trying to get her to vaccinate, but she doesn't think they're necessary because she's never gotten sick from any of those diseases.  I've tried talking to her, and from what I can gather it seems that she just thinks that they're not necessary for everyone as evidenced by the fact that she's never gotten sick.  I also think she thinks there's a natural way to prevent yourself from getting sick, and obviously there is for some diseases, but tell that to smallpox or polio or measles or any of the other devilish diseases that almost never happen now because of vaccines.

While I'm glad she's never gotten sick, I've tried telling her that it's probably because of herd immunity and everyone getting immunized that she's never gotten sick, and that she's just lucky, but I don't think she really believes me.  I wanna be a nurse, I'm in college for that right now, and I wanna work specifically in the NICU, so I feel a bit more of an incentive to convince her.  And she wants kids, and so do I, and even though we're nowhere near there yet, I still feel responsible to either our future kids or the kids she has with someone else to convince her that they're a force for good.  Cause I'd feel terrible if I couldn't and her kid contracted some horrible disease and suffered lifelong consequences because of it.

624,"Hello Reddit, I'm 22F and I'm using a throwaway for privacy. Over the past year or two, I've noticed a complete loss of motivation to participate in hobbies and activities that I used to enjoy. I've become extremely withdrawn, introverted, and disconnected from others. I've lost motivation for all of my hobbies and I have to force myself to take initiative to hang out with my friends. I love spending time with my family, but making new friends or even hanging out with dear old ones just seems daunting and exhausting anymore. When I'm with people like at work or class, I'm very outgoing and extroverted. But as soon as I get in my car to go home, I crawl back into my shell and become closed off. 
What's strange is that I'm very invested in my work; I do extremely well and I enjoy it. I'm genuinely happy when I'm at work. I've also been a college student for a few years now, and I enjoy it very much. It's almost like a hobby/obsession for me, as weird as that might sound to some. I might temporarily lose motivation to do homework or get burnt out, but I feel lazy and directionless when I'm not doing work or school. I don't think I'm depressed because I'm fine with those two areas...it's just everything outside of that. 

Here's a list of hobbies I used to enjoy or have been interested in getting into recently:
- running/working out
- rock climbing
- hiking
- dancing
- yoga
- music (writing, playing instruments, learning new songs, performing)
- photography
- exploring/roadtrips
- scuba diving
- reading

So it's not a complete lack of interest, it's more a complete lack of motivation to participate in any of these things or to cultivate any new or existing friendships. I get comments all the time from those close to me about how much time I spend on my phone. I'm usually just scrolling through Reddit or watching Netflix because it's where I go to escape and not have to think. I have to be begged or arm wrested into playing games or doing activities with family over mindlessly staring at my phone. I hate it but I don't know how to change it.

627,"Hello reddit. Throwaway account for privacy reasons.
I am going through a divorce. I have been the victim of my wife’s domestic violence for a long time and finally had the courage to get a restraining order and file for divorce. Trouble is, we have 4 children together. Late last year, she revealed to me that she had impregnated herself with our fourth child by using my sperm against my will and without my knowledge. (Please don’t ask, I do not know) but clearly it happened after a sexual encounter with her. Generally speaking, she would absolutely not have told me this if she had not actually done it. She has been nothing but a complete narcissist the entire time I have been married to her, and I am realizing now this was a way to ‘trap’ me even more in the marriage. She has been extremely violent towards me, and has even pulled a gun on me, and I am seriously afraid of her. I have gotten a restraining order and an attorney to handle the divorce aspect. After finding this out, I feel extremely violated and though I love my daughter, I cannot help but feel a certain way after finding this out. I want nothing to do with the mother, but is there anything I can do or take action on in this matter? I seriously do not know what to do. She is a complete maniac and I now have temporary custody of my kids until the divorce proceedings take place a few months from now. What is this classified as? I am very distressed about it and I have told my attorney but only recently hired them, so I have not really heard back from them on any of this. 
For what it’s worth, I am a 100% disabled veteran with a traumatic brain injury and PTSD. I was completely deceived by her and would like to know what, if anything, I can do to take action?
I liken it to consensual rape, and now there is a life brought into the earth that I did not willfully father and though I love my daughter, I would like to know what legal actions, or any other actions I can take against the mother. She is very deceiving and conniving and I now have to raise this girl and quite possibly pay child support on her if court does not go my way.

New England Area  


I've lived in a household I've considered emotionally abusive my whole life. Probably had depression the whole time as well. Was harassed almost every damned day in public school, until i left for a catholic school in 8th grade. Incidents became more and more sparse until i graduated high school.  


My parents are somewhere between 55-60 years old. Mother never wants to leave bed. She bitches about every damned thing. I try to help but if i commit too much ill lose entire days. The depression shutting me down after awhile doesn't help. Dad works his damned ass off (60 hour weeks driving a tractor trailer in state) and probably has has explosive tendencies, as well as impulse problems.  


When i was growing up, i was basically confined to my room. At first it was because my mother was too lazy to watch me, then because i was too scared to go out and get seen by kids from school. I still feel woefully uneducated in the social department, but ive improved... as of a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a CD from my Paternal Grandmother that was going to pay for my first car and most of my first 2 years of college. My father proceeded to burn almost all of it impulse-buying me a 2002 Impreza with a dead engine, and hired my deadbeat brother to fix it. That car still sits unrepaired in the side yard of the house.  


We got a dog in May 2017, but her trainign went completely south (mom, dad, and brother did vastly diffrent things, she ended up just doing whatever she wants, only getting scolded when she gets caught being bad). She loves my father and my brother, but attacks me every chance she gets. I didn't do shit to her, and my father beat her up several times during her first 6 moths. He stopped, thank fuck, but I get attacked anyway!  


My current job is a cart-pushing job at a grocery store. I make 100$ a week, no chance for a raise, and i almost get run over by people going 45 in the damned populated parking lot.  


My main reason for posting this Wall of Woe is because lately my depression has gotten worse. My parents have been using guilt-trip tactics to shame me for not ""pulling my weight."" I've grown addicted to blunt self harm (punching myself in the face, and whatnot.) I have no damned clue where to get help, ive tried therapy, but all the bastards in my area do is write shit down and provide no fucking input on how to stop. I feel like the Prozac i was prescribed barely works, considering i haven't missed a dose and im still getting worse.   


I just had a row with my mom after the dog raided the kitchen while she was cooking, and i impulsively fuckign slugged myself for not doing anything about it (although what the fuck COULD I HAVE DONE?). She immediately started screaming and crying and making it about herself ""I get abused by you and your father more than you do to the dog (bitch what?) I'll never ask you for anything again, just get out of my life as soon as you can!""  


My request, r/advice, or anyone, for that matter, what do i do? I'm lost. I can't figure anything out. If something i said didn't make sense, ask me. I'll try to make sense.

629,"Hey reddit,

Basically my former best and definitely oldest friend is posting really disturbing and creepy stuff on Facebook involving the name of my family (especially my parents).

We were friends between the ages of 4 until around 23. Between the ages of 6 until now our families are neighbours as well. We are both 28 now and haven’t talked to each other in around 5 years due to a fight about me supposedly not having his back (Mutual friends were teasing him about being a virgin). Afterwards he completely cancelled all contact with me. I regret never going over to his house and apologised/talked to him about it.

Either way according to his Facebook statuses he clearly has some mental problems or at the very least some issues. I can’t see them because he blocked me from Facebook. A mutual acquaintance wrote me yesterday on Facebook about it and sent me screenshots of his new status updates. The ones that concerned the most and made her call the police on him, where about him casually talking about killing his dad with pliers. Another loosely translated status was ‘fuck you all, I’ll only call the police after one of you suffocated in their own blood pool.’ The police took it pretty serious and were at his parents house last Tuesday but apparently didn’t do much.

His parents are apparently aware as well, and trying to help him, but honestly i think they are the main reason he turned out this way. Well them and his 4 older siblings (2 brothers, 2 sisters).
As a kid he would spend most of his afternoons after school at my place, because his siblings would bully him and his parents had little time and affection to give him. So apparently he saw my mother as his second mother so to speak as my mum apparently was way more loving and supportive to him. I never realised this until now.

The part that worries me the most though is not that he keeps on mentioning my families name in his Facebook statuses. But that he attempted to commit suicide around 12 years ago by stabbing himself multiple times in the chest in the school cafeteria over some girl... He survived as he missed all vital organs. I was living in a foreign country at that time with my family.

Although he was never a violent person (at least to others), I’m genuinely concerned on what he is capable of doing, especially after his dramatic suicide attempt. In my country guns are basically nonexistent, however, anyone can get a hold of a knife. I wanna help the guy, because I still view him sort of as a friend, but he legitimately scares me with his recent behaviour.

What would you guys do in this situation? Just ignore it? Try to talk to him personally (my mum is a psychologist and said that might be a bad idea)? Go to the police?

TL;DR My former childhood friend seems to be psychotic and recently posted some disturbing stuff on Facebook involving my family name and the first names of both of my parents.

So I smoked yesterday and realized that I really have become a piece of shit. I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing with my life anymore. I should really get it together. 

I scribbled it all down on a piece of paper the shit I need to start doing. “I need to start working out again, I need to stop drinking so much, I need to make a plan on what I want to do with m life, why do you lack motivation you actual piece of shit. You keep making up excuses for yourself. “

636,"This might be kinda long but I'll do what I can to keep it short. Also I'll put the actual question at the end if you want to skip the story

So the actual breakup happened 2 months ago when she dumped me out of nowhere. We met freshman year of college in a class we had together and quickly became friends. For about 2 months we were just friends but one day we were hanging out in the Student Center and I realized I wanted it to be more so that night I called her and asked her out on a real date and she agreed and that started our year long relationship. 

In October of last year she called me one day out of the blue crying and broke up with me. I don't want to get into the specifics but she gave me the usual ""it's not you it's me"" thing and that was that.

I was fucking devastated, I'd had a ""girlfriend"" in high school but it wasn't that serious for either of us, nothing like this.

For the first month after our breakup I was a mess honestly, I rarely went to class and would spend whole weekends watching Netflix and listening to sad music in my room and when I'd see her around on campus it's like I could barely function as a person for a few minutes. It was insane but I got better and by the end of the semester I was doing a lot better. I'd still think about her a lot but it wasn't crippling anymore. 

But recently the next semester started and last week I was at a bar watching the playoff games and we saw each other. After that it all hit me again like a ton of bricks and it's got me down ever since. 

It's been 2-3 months now and I feel like I should be back out there. I matched with a few girls on tinder and I've been talking to them and they seem cool but I don't even know if I want to ask any of them out. I remember how it felt when I asked out my ex, I was so pumped, it was honestly the best feeling in the world, I don't even know how to put it into words. 

With these girls on tinder I feel like I'm just thinking ""well we've been texting a couple days I guess I should try and make plans to meet up"" but honestly I don't really want to. It just doesn't feel the same.

Is this what dating is like? Are you just kinda meh until the connection grows? I don't know it just doesn't feel the same

637,"I'm 19F in a something-ship with a guy a few years older than me. I say ""something-ship"" because I'm not sure if it can be considered a relationship or still in the casual ""talking"" phase. He does things that make me think both ways. 

This guy is pretty nerdy and really into anime and cosplay, and goes to an anime convention at least every year (I think Momocon or something, I enjoy anime but I don't know much about conventions). He's also very friendly, kind and open and can make friends with pretty much anybody. 

The other day he posted a selfie on instagram and a girl commented saying he looked good. Given that I'm not sure if we're exclusive or anything, if it had been just this single comment it wouldn't have bothered me. But he replied to her comment saying that he loved her posts on instagram (which is 90% cosplay outifits with her bare ass being the main focus) and said she was awesome and cool. They then went into a whole conversation saying that they hoped to meet at a con at some point. This made me uncomfortable, as it seems like flirting to me but it could also just be him being friendly as he is with everybody. It also worried me because she's a pretty popular cosplay account with around 24k followers, so I found it weird that she commented on a random person's selfie with barely over 100 followers, but maybe that's besides the point. 

I asked my best guy friend for advice and he told me to definitely be worried. I listened to his reasoning but also took it with a grain of salt because we have a bit of history, but I won't get into that as it wasn't very serious. 

Considering that this is the first time this has ever happened with someone i was ""talking to"" or what have you, my initial reaction is to be worried but I also worry that I'm just being irrational. I also don't know if I even have a right to be worried as I don't know if we're an official thing or not.

I have exams coming up which essentially effect my future in regards to my university choices, I don't want to be going and meeting new people at university with a fucked mental health, and I certainly don't want to fail exams which I have been preparing well for because of this. I don't want my life, my social life and my feelings to others to go down the drain because of this situation. I want to live a normal life with the parents I've so dearly loved all of my life. 

But this isn't all about my mental health, I want to have a rational conversation with my mum about the situation but she's very stubborn. My dad is very much regretting what he said to my mum and is crying at the thought of what happened, he wanted an adult conversation with her about why he was feeling said, even if it was a mistake for him to say what he said. 
My mum, while being very intelligent, is feeling (as you would), very strongly about the situation. She's gone to her mums house and told everything about what has gone wrong and is refusing to talk to me, saying things such as ""shut up, he's leaving"" etc. 
I want my mum to realise that my dad knows he's fucked up, I don't want my mums side of the family to demonise my dad because I know my dad is one of the best people in my life and I don't want people having a negative perception towards him. 

I'm rambling too much but some advice would be so so appreciative in this situation as its something I've never experienced, I want some advice on not fucking up my life. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this monstrosity. 

Tl;dr - My parents split up and I don't want it to bring back previous mental illnesses and fuck up my future.

When I left the interviewer told me she would call me FIRST as soon as the background check cleared and I would have to do paperwork online after. So 8 days past by, and I decide to call to see if it’s done. She then tells me she sent me an email when I got it to do my background check. She never told me that I would have to do that. She said I would have to wait for her call. It turns out I accidentally gave her the wrong email anyway so I called her yesterday to let her know I changed it to my other email. She says okay. Still didn’t send it yesterday, fast forward this morning I call her to see what’s up AGAIN and she said she’s gonna call me later once she goes over my application since I had to change the email. It’s been 6 hours since then and I know damn well it doesn’t take that long. I don’t want to keep calling her to bug her but I’m getting pissed the fuck off.

645,"Hi everyone,

Would you go through a move for your kids if you're suffering from an anxiety disorder? 

Their mother lives in the new town and we both think it will be easier for all involved but mostly the kids. 

Everything is working out perfectly so far, with my job and with finances. The only problem is that I'm really nervous about all of this. I'm afraid of sticking with this decision because I'm nervous it will make things worse for me. In reality, as an anxiety sufferer, I'm always skeptical about events/people/things that will make my anxiety worse or better. I sold some some stuff online in anticipation of this move and they sold so quickly that I almost had a panic attack. The reality of moving setting in makes me really nervous, I'm afraid of change, but I also know that I need to move eventually, I've wanted to move ever since my divorce over a year ago. 

I'm currently in therapy for my anxiety right now. I've also taken alot of steps to work on my physical health as well.

647,"So I broke up with my ex 4-5 years ago and we stayed friends. I still loved her untill 1-2 years ago and when I thought I was getting over her this happend.

So we get in a cab with 2 of our friends. We were sitting next to each other and another friend in the back and 1 friend in the front seat.

649,"Hi All. 

Not sure if you get a lot of relationship questions here but I have one relationship-specific dilemma I've been struggling with for a while. I'll try to keep it as succinct as possible, as it's given me a headache just thinking about it and I imagine it will give you's a headache *reading* about it, too.  

Last night, I discovered a few photos depicting my year-long bf and his female colleague having a swim at a Christmas work party. The two of them were nestled far enough from shore to have the water reach their shoulders. In one photo, there's a safe, comfortable distance between the two of them but in another, they seem alarmingly close. (I imagine as the party progressed, as the booze set in, they just seem to 'settle' into whatever they were doing). I'm just a bit unsure what to make of this, as my bf, when he told me about the party, failed to mention that he spent what looks like the majority of his time *just* hanging with her. Maybe he omitted this fact to prevent me from getting unnecessarily upset rather than from trying to hide something? Anyway, I find it dubious, at least. Especially considering the fact that I noticed they were especially chummy at the afterparty - this one I was, at *his* request, able to make - and broached it to him. They engaged each other continuously across the room and even shared one silent glance (I witnessed). When I went to use the bathroom briefly, I came back to find that she had went to sit by him (they were discussing accommodation as it was getting late and my bf lived on the outskirts of the city so she was offering *us* a place to stay the night for reasons of safety. He made up a couple of excuses why we couldn't). When we bade everyone goodnight, she had hugged him a total of 4 times (all of which he, out of politeness he says, he returned). So, yeah, just unsure what to think.

Anyway, a few details worth mentioning: I was invited by my bf to the party but couldn't go because I had a family thing on simultaneously; I think the female coworker's hubby was present at the party; my bf gets along well enough with her husband; I've met the female coworker - though I don't know her very well - and she's from the same province as me and knows some of my first cousins. 

If you's can give me a bit of perspective, that would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",21Jan2019,1
650,"Prepare, this will be a long post. 

Hello fellow Redditors. Made a throw away for this post because I felt insecure about using my main account. Insecurity will probably be a recurring theme though.

So first off a little background. 
1.5 years ago, started doing my Masters degree, and decided to do an internship abroad. I just came out of a long relationship of 4 years (bad break up) and wanted to get away from it all, but also knew this was good for my resume (abroad experience works allot in my field). So I set in a procedure to do a 6 months internship at a prestigious university in the US (I am from the Netherlands, to clarify). I got an offer from my former professor to do an internship with a college there, working on a cool project. This took a while but after some months I finally got everything in order to leave January 2019 till July. 

Here comes the problem, because when I was setting things in motion, around November 2017, I came across a girl. I knew her from my study, and we found out we had a lot in common. We were first just talking, then things clicked and so started dating. A few weeks later we had our first kiss. Everything went on and on, and we started our relationship. I was insanely happy that it happened but we both knew that I had my internship for 6 months in the future. We decided to carry on (best decision). She is my soulmate, and we have been super happy together ever since. We were together allot, basically everyday, but we both didn’t mind at all. We still did our things separately with friends and what not but just at the end of most days we would be happy sleeping together. 

Fast forward about 10 months, and January was getting closer. We talked about it a lot now but since I already set everything in motion I couldn’t really turn back, as it was still one of the best opportunities in my life. Last few days in December and start of January we were inseparable and very happy together. But then came my flight day off (8 of January) to the US. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing ever but we both knew we would see each other in 2 months (she’ll visit me for a week). 

At first I was fine! Yes it was hard, I missed her and my own place and family, but it was okay. But than after a day or two I became really insecure and sad. I always was (unreasonably) insecure, even when I was still home with her. I trust her 110% and I knew she would be forever faithful to me, but a voice in my head kept saying that she could just leave me whenever she wants. This made me even more insecure and drove me crazy. I talked about it to her and of course she told me she would never do something and be with me forever. Problem is, I really need to talk about my feelings. I need someone to help and listen to me when I’m feeling down. She on the other hand would rather not talk about it because it would remind her how much she missed me. This was and still is very hard because I have to give her space but I can’t really because I want to talk to her. So to sort of replace talking to her I now talk to my friends and family a lot, but this is sometimes really hard because I miss her and talking to her the most.

So we do talk once or twice a day, but it is hard talk. I am sort of pretending that I am fine to help her, but inside I just want to go home and cuddle her. I have enough to do here (made friends, have enough to do for my internship, can walk around and discover etc), so it’s not that I can’t distract myself, but my head just won’t stop thinking. The evenings are fine because then she is asleep and I can’t talk to her and my head can rest because it thinks nothing can happen now, but the mornings are though because I then want to talk to her but she is doing whatever stuff so we can’t really.

Going home is not an option really because I invested so much money in this internship, and would bring my former professor to shame, let alone the place I am now. I know she will come in 7 weeks and I also know I have to give it more time since I am here for only 12 days now, but there are times that I just break down and feel so intense dark/sad that I can’t really think about something else than going back home and be with her. Due to me being insecure, I am sort of a ‘doom thinker’ meaning that I am imagining all sorts of crap which I know is not true (She doesn’t love you, she found someone else, she is happy without you) but I can’ help thinking those thoughts. We talked about it, and she said to just don’t think that and that she’ll love me forever and that I am hers forever, and that helps every time she said that, but a few hours later  after we talked the sadness an insecurity slowly creeps back.

So, I can go into way more details but I think you get the point now. I am out of ideas to set these thoughts out of my mind. Read all sorts of guides online to stop homesickness and the feeling of missing someone. But I still feel so empty and lonely especially when I think about the fact that I have 7 more weeks to go till I see her, and after that week, 4 months till I am finally home and I am just here for 12 days now. I don’t want to count down the days but my head keeps doing just that. I am supposed to enjoy this super cool and adventurous period I am here but my head just keeps thinking bullshit.

Any advice?

TL:DR: Am 6 months away from home, feeling lonely and miss my girlfriend allot, but don’t know what to do to stop that feeling.",21Jan2019,1

652,"Hello all!

So here’s the rundown. I am a 30 y/o M living in Alberta working as a journeyman plumber/gas fitter. Last year I made about $75,000 Canada bucks. Unfortunately I’m realizing that plumbing is not the job I want to be doing. I’m fed up with the attitudes of people in my industry, the expectation that the job should be the sole focus of your life, and that you should work until you drop dead. I am unhappy with the direction my life has taken and want to make a change. 

I’ve been looking into online classes to try and get a degree that will allow me to enter the IT field and work as a system administrator. Unfortunately I’m not sure exactly what’s required as I’ve been told by some that a degree can be more of a hindrance in some cases. As well, going back to school as a full time student is not an option for me as I bring in 95% of the income between my girlfriend and I. 

So! I’m wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction or advise me on some steps to take. Someone on Reddit already mentioned that getting my A+ cert would be helpful but other than that I’m a bit overwhelmed. On the off chance there are any fellow Albertans here, I will say that Athabasca University is the online school I’ve been looking at.

I can't stand the subject and I really wanted this prelim to be some proof to my Dad that I just can't do the subject, he says the subject choice isn't my choice at all but the parents, (is this true?), and according to him, dropping the subject is completely out of the question.

666,"I'm a 24/f college student living on my own with my bf. 
I currently attending both university and work full time. 
I think I already know my answer, but I'd like some outside perspective. 

I also really apologize in advance, 90% of this is a rant :/
But I'd appreciate your time 😊

I currently work for a small private company in a small city with little opportunities. I'm fairly lucky to have landed this job as I come from a family where the best job anyone had was working for an oil field, which is still strenuous and body degrading. I am one of four CSR's for the front desk and many of my responsibilities include dispatch for aircraft, billing for maintenance, light accounting work, general paperwork, and of course cashiering and service. My shifts are generally very demanding and mentally taxing for me. Things would be great if my team all worked together, but I find myself bumping heads with my coworkers who have been working there for years and my higher ups who choose to ignore these situations. 

There is a lot of ""seniority"" thinking and the world of aviation is generally set that way. I'm often times uncomfortable with my work and have brought up to my higher ups many in appropriate instances between customers and coworkers that I feel uncomfortable with. Nothing could be done or even attempted about the customers but luckily I haven't had a huge issue with many of the men working there anymore other than them being extremely cold and difficult to work with. I can't do my job properly if they don't and I've brought this up many times, but my superiors decide to ignore it. 

The only one HR is a woman whom many dislike and continues to make my days working there a pain. I was told not much after my reports about inappropriate mannerisms from customers that I should instead wear pants. The one day I chose to wear my hair down, she made me leave my work to have a talk about how I can't wear my hair down and that if I start then everyone else has to have that choice too...idk how she could manage to say that as her, my coworkers who work the front desk with me, and the remaining 5 only other women working there all wear their hair down and one their hair long enough to cover her behind..

I have tolerated much of her bs for a long time. At first I didn't think it was such a large deal, but she continues to make little comments about my work that are disheartening and messed up. If I'm doing a poor job I have no problem assessing that and am more than happy o improve but I've made suggestions about how I can make some of my tasks that aid in the accounting department easier by creating a new system. Before I have time to finish my idea she says it won't work and it wasn't a good idea. I felt defeated but I just accepted okay fine. Idk why she's even called HR, she hardly even does anything to serve that title and acts more of a boss. I couldn't do anything different without her knowing. She has no patience for one on one discussions and recently told one of my co-workers who asked for a 2nd day off to try going back to school that it wasn't a good idea for him to try and if he went to school she'd have to let everyone go??? Wth. 

I have made many reports of safety issues and bad procedure but have yet to receive any change. If I make one small mistake I'll have hell to hear. 

Honestly, the may be stressful, but on the weekends I have so much time to study it's amazing. I love that my 9hr workdays are either 7-3 or 12-9 but it leaves little room for school flexibility. 

I've got discouraging comments like, why am I at school all the time you should be here, or your'e just another pretty face huh, and have heard HR mutter my name in a curse because I left a damn smudge on the glass door. I swear if I mess up the smallest I get hell, wtf, if you don't want me then get someone else, don't treat me like shit just cause, at least hold a performance meeting with me if I'm performing bad, and I suggested that and they told me that it sounds like a good idea and then she trailed off with an idk. I literally had an idea and my coworker took it and claimed it and ""HR"" praised her and told me I should make sure to thank her because it makes everyone's job easier...sigh wtf 


I recently got called for an interview that I have yet to call back and am really contemplating leaving. At my current job I get bonuses every quarter depending on sales, full coverage insurance, PTO, and for the first time in my work career lunch breaks lol. I hate the business side aspect about everything and the people I work with. My frield coworker just left because though he got paid decent it wasn't worth the trouble. 

Should I take this offer to work part-time at a grocery store right across my home? It pays 9.50 little to no benefits. Or should I really just tough it out with this job? It's a decent job, the people I work with...ugh make it so difficult. It isn't like I can avoid them either it's a small company of 50 people. 

I can't exactly afford a pay cut as I pay for my car, rent, light, water, etc etc 

What's the smart choice?? I want to know what someone else has to think about this situation. Thanks in advance",21Jan2019,1
667,"So basically I went to university studied for 5 years got two degrees , wrote all my board exams , did my internship for 1 year and after7 years I was finally admitted as an attorney. 

After being admitted as an attorney I decided to take a few months off  to complete my masters degree and that’s when it all went down hill .

The masters degree was part time which meant I only went to classes at night . My days passed by me over thinking everything and going into a depression ( have had mental health issues for many years ). My depression got so bad that I couldn’t finish my masters degree .

I haven’t been working for a year and when people asked why I said it was to finish my masters . Now that I haven’t been able to finish masters and still haven’t gotten a job I feel like I’m useless.

I don’t want to go out in public because I don’t know what to say when people ask me what I’m doing at the moment . I feel like people are constantly judging me and think I’m a failure . I make every excuse not to meet people outside my immediate family . 

This whole situation has made my depression even worse . I have been seeing a therapist but nothing seems to be working and all I  feel is like a failure who is too ashamed to meet people in public because of the anxiety that I have to tell them  I’m jobless and haven’t finished my masters degree .

I have a friends bridal shower coming this weekend and I don’t want to go because I will see old friends I haven’t seen in years and they will ask me about my current situation. 

Any advice on how to deal with this would be much appreciated.",21Jan2019,1
668,"I don’t have a very good job to begin with, but I’ve been working there for nearly 4 years and have been promised a promotion for the better part of two years. I approached my GM about this, since other employees have been receiving promotions that they’re not qualified for, mere months after being hired. I asked why I haven’t been given the promotion yet, and they told me it’s because I have bipolar disorder and they’re not sure I can handle it. 

Mind you, I’m on medications for this, and have been since before I was hired. It is 100% managed. I don’t have outbursts, I don’t act irrationally, and I’m absolutely stable. To top it all, I’m good at my job and receive praise from my boss’s boss on many occasions. 

I’m looking for another job, but I was wondering if there’s anything I can do in order to bring the discrimination against mentally ill employees to light to our RGM. Anything is helpful, thanks in advance. ",21Jan2019,1
669,"Obligatory throwaway for obvious reasons. 

NOTE: Before you read this, I'm aware of the mistake I made so please don't bash at me... 

I'm 15 and I met someone on Reddit whose 19 almost 20. His post are filled with NSFW content and he made several sexual comments on other people's NSFW post subreddits. Anyway, he lives in another country where the age consent is 15 to date someone 18 or older while I live in a country where it's illegal to be 18 or older dating someone under the age of 18. This person and I dated online and I sent nudes. My face was NOT in the nudes and I did delete them from the chat right after he saw them. I hate myself so much for this but we did sext. I did send selfies OF MY FACE but I deleted them from the chat right after he saw them. I asked if he saved my nudes and selfies but he claimed he did NOT. 


I realized how this was so wrong and blocked him then the next day he messaged me saying he would expose me if I didn't explain why I blocked him. I quickly explained myself because I was so scared. Long story short story, we got back together because I was scared that I would be exposed. I asked him several times if he had my photos and he said he did not but I'm not so sure about that. He could tell I was only staying because my anxiety told me that if I didn't I would be exposed. 



In the end, he confronted me that this wouldn't work out and blocked me. 


Im posting on here because Im so worried/stressed/scared he would expose me and my life would be ruined. 


Thank you for listening.

671,"After graduation, I plan on going to California to live. College isn't a definite future for me, although it is still on my mind. I currently live in Ohio, and have taken the ACT and got a decent score of 25. I was told that when I move, schools are less likely to take the ACT score because the SAT is taken in California. Should I go ahead and take the SAT, or just stick it out with my ACT. (keep in mind, if I can go without taking another test I will. I have such bad testing anxiety I almost broke down during the ACT)",21Jan2019,1

I'm really not sure what I should do now I that I kind of have a chance to have a fun birthday this year. I feel like it's a bit of pressure to think about.",21Jan2019,1
