1,"I'm a 16M and I feel extremely pressured to have my first kiss. Most of my mates have had their first kiss and are always going at me for not having had mine yet. It's not that I haven't had my opportunity, I have. I just feel uncomfortable about the situation and I'm not sure about what to do.

Any advice is welcome.",07Jan2019,1
2,"I'm at university working towards a Bachelor's degree. For our final semester we've had individual projects. This project will essentially be what makes or breaks our degree - we've been working all semester, and we've all been assigned a supervisor who's supposed to help us by regularly checking in on our progress and letting us know what works and what does not. My own supervisor has been super helpful but I know many others weren't as lucky and have had to be quite insistent in order to get any help at all. 

Before making final revisions and turning in our finished project there is a seminar at which our examinator (the person who will ultimately grade us) and one of our classmates will give us their opinion on it and let us know what needs to be fixed before handing in the finished thing. When I first saw that I'd been assigned to review L's project, I was so happy - I'm super nervous about this seminar, and L is one of the few people in class I actually talk to. We're not *friends*\-friends, but we've hung out to study together quite a bit, and always chat before lectures. I like her! She's really nice!

Unfortunately, my good mood entirely vanished once I actually took a look at her project. There is no *way* she will get a passing grade. Her arguments are circular. We've been repeatedly told we must have a clear thesis statement, and I can't even find hers. She has *one* properly peer reviewed source, which she uses only once. These aren't things she could hope to fix in two weeks - and two weeks is all we have in between the seminar and the final due date. She's going to have to basically entirely start over - go back to the source hunting stage and try again - and wait until next semester to submit it again... and if it takes longer than 1 semester to finish the project, we are no longer entitled to supervision. She'll have to do it with no help whatsoever.

I feel like it's my duty as her friend to tell her this *before* the seminar. Partly because if I was her, I would definitely not want to hear it then (in front of all of our classmates), and partly because I really think she should go to the higher ups of our department and complain, because her supervisor should have told her *way* earlier in the process that what she was doing wasn't working. I don't understand how she got to this stage. (The supervisors are supposed to advise against submitting it if they think we're not ready for the seminar stage!) 

Am I right in thinking I ought to tell her before the seminar, and if yes, how do I break this to her? I don't know her well enough to know how she deals with criticism, and I want to hurt her feelings as little as possible. 

**tl;dr: I've been assigned to critique my classmate &amp; friend's final project (the last step in getting her Bachelor's degree). The project is not good enough to get a passing grade. Should I tell her in private before I'm forced to tell her in public and how should I go about breaking the news?** ",07Jan2019,1
3,"I am 41 years old, and my husband of 8 years is 43. I have severe PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome) and hardly ever have periods. I may have 1 or 2 a year, and there is obviously no way of predicting them. Thus I have been told by 3 OB/GYNs that I won't be able to get pregnant without some outside assistance. That was fine with my husband (Mark) and I, as neither one of us wants children. I don't even like other people's children, to be honest. We have many reasons why we don't want kids, but it can be simplified into 2 points: first, we are selfish and are happy with our lives. We like being with each other and being free to do what we want when we want and for how long we want; and second, we don't want to pass on problems that we have (Mark: Crohn's disease, which both he and his brother have; me: bipolar II, borderline personality disorder; and we met each other in AA so there is alcoholism/addiction thrown in there.) Because I believed I wasn't able to conceive, we never use protection.

Well, I found out 2 nights ago that I'm pregnant, and I'm terrified. I don't know what to do.

Since I don't menstruate, I have no idea how far along I am. Far enough that I'm having physical signs, which is why I took a pregnancy test. I have made an appointment with my OB/GYN but she can't see me until the 17th. Tomorrow I'm going to call a few other places. (Side question: do you think I could get an ultrasound at an urgent care? The OB/GYN has to confirm the pregnancy first, and then I have to make ANOTHER appt for an ultrasound. Time is a factor here...)

At first I wanted to abort it, without question. My husband was on board with this, although he told me that he would support any decision I made since it was my body etc. But after having a couple days to think about it, I would say I'm more 50/50 on the idea. There are a LOT of pros and cons, and I'm not going to make this post even longer than it already is by listing all of them.

My concern is that my husband has made it known today that he definitely doesn't want a kid, and I think his initial statement of respecting whatever decision I made was what he thought he was supposed to say. When he woke up I told him that I was having a lot of difficulty trying to decide whether to abort the pregnancy or go through with it, and I told him some of the things I was thinking. He really did nothing but point out all the negative things about a pregnancy (and there are legitimate concerns between our ages and the fact that I'm not exactly mentally stable.) I read him a pro/con list I have been making in my journal and he told me that the pros didn't outweigh the cons, and said that some pros weren't important (like the fact that my parents would be absolutely over the moon.) My husband is NOT an asshole - he is generally a really thoughtful, sensitive person. I know that he is scared. We both are.

So...any advice on how to proceed if I do decide to go through with the pregnancy? What do I tell my husband? I don't want him to resent me for the rest of our lives if I end up keeping the kid. I can't talk to any of my family about this because, if I decide to abort, it would be better if they had never known. (Please don't take this as a moral issue. I believe in a woman's right to abort if she chooses and, at this point, my mind isn't going to change. Thank you :) I really appreciate you having taken the time to read through this! ",07Jan2019,1
4,"I have been working in Human Resources for almost two years but this will be the first time after a long time that I’ll be going through a job interview, ironically, I’ve handled recruitment back then and I always told my candidates not to be nervous but good heavens, now that I’m the one in their shoes it’s making me extremely nervous. Please help me get through this, how can I surpass this feeling? I wasn’t able to sleep well last night even though I tried so hard to do so. ",07Jan2019,1
5,"Sorry this is a venting session..a bit long.  My parents have been supportive monetarily, but never actually supportive in anything I’ve done. When I decided biology wasn’t what I wanted to do, my father tried to force me to go into finance. But after failing one course, I fought him and ended up finishing with strong management and linguistics degree, and then went on to get my Master in International Affairs.  I now am employed in a fairly prominent government job right now.  If I had listened to my parents I would still be working in an office supply store.  My parents never took a ducking risk I their life, kept the same job for forty years and have fought me on every decision I’ve made though it usually (at least the big ones) turned out to be right.

But I still resent them because since I came back right after grad school while I sorted out housing, they’ve (mostly my father) have taken advantage of me. I have done all the cooking, cleaning, General errands.  When I’ve asked for a little help or they’ve offered help...they suggest what I need rather than listening to what I ask them to do.  I resent them even more because they never and continue to ignore the fact that I had a weight problem, and I need support. I went from 6 ft 250lbs to 6 ft 1 185 lbs after I left. Don’t buy so many sweets, I ask them and I don’t like to eat after 5 most nights because I eat rather late at work. Don’t buy two dozen doughnuts or pastries...there’s only three of us. They’ve not once tried to help me with one I ask.  On top of that I driver over two hours a day, it’s just been way to much. I drive, work, get home, cook (for them), wash dishes and go to bed...repeat.  They’re both retired and do nothing, they’re both completely healthy just so fucking lazy.

They used to make fun of me for being stolid and showing no emotion. They called me doc Martin.  Never did they ask, “are you depressed?” Just laughed, then brushed it off when confronted. I was never bad or mean spirited just unhappy and stuck in fucking suburbia with nowhere to go.

Now they call me an alcoholic because I have wine with most evening meals, and enjoy a cocktail sometimes.  So I have to hide what I drink from them. Maybe a bottle of wine a week or she bourbon once a week. Everything I do is scrutinized, it’s infuriating.

One time my father said he was going to cook dinner but just waited for me to get home, asked me to do all the prep and most of the cooking, then he started to yell at me after I to,d him how to cook something, after he had asked me “how do you cook this?” 65 and pouting over just being nicely told you need to beat the eggs first and temper them with the hot liquid otherwise they will curdle. Screaming like a three year old.  For fuck’s sake I don’t know how I turned out so normal.

Since I came back I’ve gotten in screaming matches with my father about money.  I have savings (soon to be less because moving and furniture is expensive), and make 60K a year. Not a lot, but definitely enough for one person.

Even worse, I’ve never shared anything about any of the partners I’ve had. Just yes I’m dating someone. I don’t want them to meet my parents because they’re still of the persuasion that I’ll marry whomever I’m dating.  The current arrangement I have with my current gf (she’s poly and I’ve begun to come around to the lifestyle)....well they certainly wouldn’t understand or comprehend it. If I hadn’t gone from friends to lovers I wouldn’t have a gf right now because I can’t bring anyone home.  It’s certainly been a while since I’ve had consistent sex...which is really frustrating. They don’t seem to understand that sex is a necessary part of a healthy, happy life.  My father is never dressed, the tv is always on and my parents never are, inviting...more like a Spanish Inquisition.  I don’t interrogate people because i don’t’ like getting interrogated.  If someone wants to share something with me, that means it’s earned.

Don’t they understand that it’s natural to move on, and given where my career is headed, I will probably leave the US?

I’ve tried to rationalize things, but I’m always better off without them. I don’t want to cut my mother out, but she’s incapable of not involving my father in anything. Separate they’re fine, together they’re nuts.

I’m out of here this week but just needed to vent because the holidays have been hell.

TL;DR; I don’t feel my parents see me as a capable person despite evidence to the contrary. I’ll have no reason to really contact them outside of familial obligation.  Outside he fact that they’ve supported me, they’ve never respected me or given me support where I actually needed it. Am I being an asshole by severely limiting my contact with them?",07Jan2019,1
6,"I’ve been working in the mental health field now only 4 months. I graduated in 2015 so there was a fairly large gap between my education and when I started working in the field due to wanting to stay home with my daughter after she was born. Thus, I’m not as knowledgeable of our relevant ME state mental health/education/etc. laws and regulations, social resources and providers, and anything else relevant to my job. My inexperience has made me a little bit less than confident, especially when surrounded by other people who have been working in the field 20+ years. I’ve learned SO much in the past four months, but still... I am only 26 and look much younger (many think I’m only 18 and are surprised when I tell them my age). Combine my youthful look with my, sometimes obvious inexperience, it’s hard to get some clients to take me seriously. But I’ve gotten by just fine and grown in confidence so far.

...that is, until I did the intake assessment and paperwork with this one mother (well grandmother, but she’s legal guardian and besides the point). She adopted her grandson at a young age and she’s very protective, and understandably so. She’s also one of those “I want to speak to your supervisor” types to a T. She’s intimidating. Very blunt and honest. Doesn’t mess around and makes her expectations very clear. In some ways, this kind of parent is a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other families that aren’t as engaged, but it still intimidates me nonetheless. And so far... we have had less than pleasant experiences and I’m not quite sure how to handle it from here.

For example, the very first time we met, I called her to let her know we received the referral and I’d like to schedule a time in which we can meet. She instantly responded quite coldly, “Well, who are you? Where’s Karen, and why did they send my referral to you?”. I explained to her that Karen hasn’t worked for our agency in over a year, and she did not hold back in expressing her disappoint me. It kind of hurt my feelings, but I wasn’t going to take it personally.

We met, completed the intake, and scheduled our 2nd meeting to work on a treatment plan. However, I tested positive for the flu that morning AND we had a terrible snowstorm that resulted in our agency closing. My boss made it VERY clear that, when we close our offices due to storming, we are not to do ANY work and need to go home. I called my client to let her know I would need to reschedule and she really “let me have it”. She told me, even if my agency was closing and I was sick with the flu, I should have given her prior notice. I told her that my boss didn’t order us to close until that morning so I had no way of knowing, but she accused me of being unreliable and that that wasn’t good for her grandson who has trust and separation issues and needs stability in his life. I’ve never even met her grandson, but that made me feel terrible.

The next day, I went into work for about an hour JUST so I can fax over some releases for her to sign that she insisted on and then going back home because, again, I was sick with the flu and had a fever of over 103. I let her know the paperwork was faxed, and she started questioning why I would fax releases if we signed them during the intake. I explained to her how we only signed releases for existing services and providers, but not for ones we planned on sending in referrals for after our initial conversation. She never responded to my email.

I reached out to her the following day asking her if I could attend her grandson’s upcoming med management appointment. This is extremely common, of course, and I’ve never had a family NOT want me to attend. Families have always invited me to come right away as a form of advocacy, care coordination, and support. She flat out just said “No.” She agreed to meet me after the appointment, but I was a little insulted again she didn’t want me to attend an appointment I attend for all my other clients. She wants me to be in regular communication with her grandson’s counselor, so I knew it’s not a privacy issue she’s concerned with. Ever since I’ve had to cancel due to weather and the flu, she seems to be resentful and untrusting.

So,  I meet with her tomorrow. And I have no idea how to approach her or what to do. I’m so nervous, and I hate being made to feel how she’s made me feel thus far, i.e. incompetent and unreliable. Even if I didn’t know how to do something, I have plenty of colleagues and peers that would be able to help. And as much as I know about her grandson’s situation and struggles, there’s nothing at this point I wouldn’t know how to help with. I’m confident in that. 

Does any one have any advice on how to handle a client like this, or even regain her trust? I want her to feel as if I’m capable of truly helping them because I AM. I just have a lot of anxiety over this and would appreciate any insight given. ",07Jan2019,1
7,So I (18m) met this one girl (18f) on tinder a few months ago and we really hit it off. we talked for about a week on snap chat. She asked if i wanted to go on a date and i said yes. When i met up with her she had her best friend with her. At first I was a little irritated by that but I kinda understand she was probably there for safety reasons. It did make things awkward but it was okay after a while. Throughout the date she did make it obvious that she was into me. We didn't touch or anything because her friend was there. Overall It was a good experience. We talked a little more online. We tried to plan a second date but it was going through a lot of stuff at the time. We stopped texting each other. I really wanna talk to her again. But idk what to say to her or how to keep her interested.

10,"This Friday my two best friends Meg And Kev and Megs boyfriend John all had a sleepover. The sleepover was taken place at the Johns house. Before I continue the story I consider my best friends boyfriend John a very close friend. He is the one that had initiated the plans because his mother and step father were gonna be upstate for the weekend so we would have a free house to our selves. He was also very persistent on making sure the plans went through. Friday night was fine, and all four of us had enjoyed our selves while cooking dinner and watching movies. My best friend Kev and I were sitting on the floor with blankets while my best friend Meg and her boyfriend John were on the bed. The bed is able to fit 3 people, and as usual me Meg and John all sleep on the same bed (this is our second sleep over at Johns house). Once I started to feel tired I went on the bed. My best friend Meg was in the middle while  her boyfriend was on the right side of her and I was on her left. I had went into the bed around 2am very tired so I fell asleep fairly quickly. My friend Kev stood on the floor and also fell asleep. But Meg and John stood up. I was already asleep but sleep positioning had changed. Now my best friend was no longer in the middle, it was her boyfriend john. One time during the night I felt the covers being pulled off me. But I didn’t think much of it. I slept through the whole night after that. The sunlight began to glare through the window signaling it was morning. But I was still half asleep. While dozing back off the sleep I felt someone pull me into a spoon position. I didn’t think much of it because I thought it was my best friend Meg and it is not uncommon for her to put her arm around me while we sleep. I was now resting on my right shoulder when I felt a hand being placed on my upper thigh and butt. I then felt like I was very close to the edge because someone was pressing up on me. The hand then began to rub against my upper leg and down to my vagina (on top of my shorts) the hand then began to go up my shirt. This is when I was fully awake and knew it wasn’t my best friend Meg. I froze and didn’t know what to do. The hand began to caress my breast. But this had only lasted about 15 seconds until my best friend Meg came through the door. The hand flew off my body as if the person was very startled. My best friend says , “babe move over, you’re all on top of her”. It was then very obvious to me that it was her boyfriend John that was the one touching me. I pretend to sleep for another 5 mins or so and put my head under the blankets and had a panic attack. After finally pretending to wake up I found out my best friend Meg had mad breakfast for all of us. This means she was most likely out of the room for a good 30 mins while it was just me and her boy friend on the bed. I’m not sure I anything else happened. And also to mention again he had slept next to me the whole night. People may ask me why I slept next to him? I have very big trust for him and consider him a close friend of mine and something like this never crossed my mind. I’m not sure on what to do. I’m not sure if this I consider sexual assault or if I’m being dramatic. I have not told anyone. And now 3 days later I don’t think anyone would believe me. If I were to bring it to Megs attention it could ruin our friendship, we’ve been friends for about 9 years now. I feel like if I say something everything will crumble. Im not sure what to do or think. Im not even sure if anyone will read this but I’m all ears for advice.",07Jan2019,1
11,"I transferred to a smaller university recently who sorts advisors by last name, and gives different advisors to transfers.

I have some credits from a well-known EU member university, online classes I might add so I didn’t even leave the country (8 credits foreign language) that a bigger state school had no problem accepting. The EU Uni provides a free translated document along with credential evaluation (determining grade from 1 - 5 to match F - A).

A more widely known school had no issue accepting my credits and it’s reflected on my transcript.

My advisor called me when I transferred and said I needed to provide the credentials. She was afraid of the name of the school (spoken slowly and like it was the freakiest thing in the world to her).

I asked if it was enough that it was on my official transcript from a different school - nope, has to be resent. Okay no problem.

So I get it re-sent.

So the advisor opens the document the EU Uni sent, which is in a foreign language but literally beneath every line it’s translated to English.

She tells me that I need a translation. I keep telling her it’s translated beneath each line. She says “I don’t think we’re looking at the same document...” it takes me 5 - 10 min of explaining on the phone (she’s getting frustrated at me) before her “aha” happens and she sees the English.

Then she says there’s no way she can make sense of it because they gave me a “4.” I tell her that my grade is right beneath it, a “B.”

Too late, she’s already decided I need an interpretation. So I get totally blocked and told to go to a credential evaluation agency.

Literally had NO problems with a more well known school.

So I go to this credential evaluation agency and they want over $200, but they ask me what degree I was pursuing, etc. Their services basically are to interpret my course and see what grade I made, if the course is worthy, etc.

It really looks like something for international transfer students, or people who need a translation or interpretation, not a couple of foreign language credits that have already been translated and interpreted.

This lady is not willing to budge and is super ditsy. Sorry to call her dumb but when I said the name of the foreign country she recoiled like I was talking about something totally wacko and bizarre.

I don’t have the documents the agencies want (they want documentation as if I was an actual student at the school - I wasn’t. No ID, no school account, just a couple of foreign language classes). And frankly I don’t want to spend $200+ for them to say “he got a B”

What the heck do I do? I don’t know who to escalate to, but my impression of the situation is she just got scared of foreign words and jumped the gun to dodge having to deal with work (a “not my problem” situation).

Really frustrating. Advice? Similar experiences? I don’t want to throw away money. ",07Jan2019,1

13,"This happened just yesterday and I don’t know how to live it down. I know it’s long but I just remember the whole ordeal and would REALLY appreciate some advice. A female friend of mine, Ashley, was having a birthday party. Her 18th. It was at her parent’s house and I was the only guy there. I didn’t expect to swim, so I didn’t have a bathing suit when everyone else started to get in the pool so Ashley’s mom gave me one of Ashley’s Dad’s old swim shorts. By the pool there was a bathroom on one end, where all the girls went to change and an L shaped hallway leading to a garage on the other side. Her mom told me to go change in the hallway while all the girls, 7 of them, went in to the bathroom and then she left to run an errand.

One girl I hadn’t met before, her name was Lucy, and another girl got out of the pool before the rest of us and changed. Dan also went home to get changed. When I got out I went down the L shaped hallway to get changed. I took off the swim trunks and turned around to get my clothes off of the shelf. They were gone and the door to the garage was open. I said “What the hell?” and heard someone behind me say in a giggling voice “What?”. I turned around stark naked and Lucy was standing there holding the swim trunks and my towel. Her eyes went up and down on me. She giggled and quickly went around the L of the hallway. I stood there, not wanting to follow because I could hear the other girls out there. They began trying to lure me out, telling me to come get my clothes. I was trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the garage door start to lift open. This would put me in plain view of the street. It was Ashley’s mom pulling in to the driveway, so I went around the corner covering myself.
All the girls were standing there giggling. I had nothing but my hands covering me. They formed a half-circle around me and were saying things like, “You’re going to have to move your hands to get dressed”. It seemed like this had been going on for a long time. I finally decided that if I didn’t seem embarrassed they would give me my clothes back so I moved my hands and asked for my clothes back. The girls started roaring with laughter and pointing. They were whistling and cat-calling me. It didn’t occur to me until that moment that there had been disposable cameras, (the old cardboard 35 mm kind), on the tables as party favors. A couple of the girls snapped some pictures of me as they began to sling my clothes around the yard. A girl named Rebecca decided it would be hilarious to throw my clothes into the massive field of bushes over Ashley’s fence that could only be accessed if you had the key to it’s gate (which itself was a 10 minute walk away) The seven girls were laughing so hard at this point some were literally rolling on the floor and others could barely breath. Then, just as i thought it couldn’t get any worse, Ashley’s mom walked out with the birthday cake in her hands. She looked at me and said, “I think you should get dressed before we cut the cake”. All of the girls, of course, started cackling uncontrollably as I turned bright red. Before I could get a word in Rebecca yelled out, “he can’t he threw his clothes into the bushes!” This must have made Ashley’s mom think I did this for attention and just regretted it because she said, “well if that’s what he wants he can stay like that!” By this point girls needed breathers and some were almost to the point of tears. I explained to Ashley’s mom what actually happened. I’m pretty sure she didn’t believe me but told me to get dressed anyway and told Ashley to help me find something to wear. Ashley and I walked into the house and the 6 other girls giggled and tried to follow but Ashley’s mom stopped them.  Ashley barely even looked then brought me back outside and between fits of giggling loudly proclaimed, “there just simply isn’t anything for him to wear!” The girls erupted in laughter again and Ashley’s mom had clearly had enough and told me it was my own fault for throwing my clothes over. They cut the cake and continued the party as normal. The girls had laughed so much that they couldn’t even manage to laugh anymore yet I still managed to be the girls’ main focus in the party. While they didn’t laugh the whole time they never stopped smiling and giggling. The worst part is I had to walk home! And even WORSE was that I had to walk home the same direction as another one of the girls!

14," I've  always had math issues as a kid, but my job has required me to get  better at mental math problems.I  (somehow) got a job as a Casino  Dealer, and I am pretty efficient at Black Jack, but it only requires me  to count to 21 so I got pretty fast at it. However the supervisors have  been wanting me to 'git good' at Roulette, or be replaced. I am ashamed  to say I have a hard time keeping large numbers in my head and adding  them together for money Payouts.

I  can remember what certain payouts pay just by memorizing 1-thru-20  times (sample; 17x17=289 , 5x35=175, etc) but for some reason when I'm  adding them together I freeze up, starting forgetting what numbers I'm  even adding together, or getting my calculations completely mixed up,  like the numbers start disappearing in my mind and I have to struggle to  mentally visualize them. I don't have this issue doing math on paper  sense the numbers are all laid out in front of me.

She’s putting the blame on me and is telling me that she is now in pain because of me. I re assure her that I’m clean and that I always scrub down there especially before sex.

21,"Back over a year ago, I was staying with my girlfriends(ex now) house for a while as her mum and fiancé actually wanted me to move in. I enjoyed being there and so did they. The finances dad passed away and he ran into some life insurance money.

He insisted I have £600 because I was low on money at the time. I accepted and said thank you and I offered to pay it back when I could , but he insisted that I keep it and don’t pay him back as it was him just being nice.

Later down the line my ex’s mum had split up with her fiancé because they were constantly arguing and it wasn’t working. He spent all of his wages on coke each time he was paid and the bills were not paid because the mum had to try  cover  t herself. 

He moved out and he had agreed to help her with money because he’s a fucking idiot addicted to coke and wasted it all instead of looking after the family.

I was living there so I offered to pay £600 towards rent as they would be homeless otherwise. She paid the rent and all good.

Me and my ex have been split up for 6 months, on not the best terms. He’s messaged me on Facebook messenger basically threatening me saying ‘I know where you are so it’s up to you to pay back ASAP” along with accusing me of other things which aren’t true, saying I was making him look like a cunt, when he was the one ruining everything.

It now seems the fiancé is seeing my ex’s mum again too.

I don’t know what to do. Like a lot of people, whenever I don’t know what to do I crank out my phone and “google it”. This goes for everything, I’m surprised to be able to google anything. From relationship problems to abstract topics like lucid dreaming.

I’m stuck, No amount of googling would help. I’m in my early 20’s still living with my parents. I work with my dad along with a trade company and don’t like a single bit of it. I get paid good. The money has kept me there since I can pay my car and other necessities. Here’s my dilemma.

I can’t stand working with my dad, he’s teaching me but I hate what he does. He’s mean and says things that make me cry when no one’s around and I just stay quiet for the sake of not arguing. My dad wants me to get into real estate along with our trade to make more money. It’s not what I want and have wasted a lot of time since high school graduation. I want to do something else, I understand I won’t be as content but I just want to get away with being with my dad. I can’t stand him. There’s a lot of resentment I have towards my parents since they used to have marital problems. My dad cheated on my mom and that made her insane. When I was younger, me and my siblings saw things we shouldn’t have and suffer in the form of social and emotional disconnect today. This and other tiny things just built up and I just can’t stand it. I get really warm and tremble, I’m not sure if it’s because I’m pissed or scared but it’s probably both.

I told him that this upcoming week was my last. I’m done with him. I’ll have to find a new job within that time. Within the time I was working I was saving up whatever I got. I was going to use it to pay for my license for real estate but since I don’t want to do that I’ve lied and pushed it off whenever it was brought up. If I get a new job what do I have waiting for me? I dropped out of school because it was tough working and taking 2 classes (9-10 units). Working to make money to pay for community college then getting crap grades only to re-do them again?

Got a pretty nice job with good money, fairly easy and awesome hours that suit me.

The thing is, for the past month or so I've had what feels like pain in the back of my left lung for a week or so now (possibly longer) and I've started to notice it getting gradually worse (or more noticeable). That could even be the result of me worrying about it tbh.

I did some research and read something about pleuritis which sounded relatively harmless when I first felt the pain, so I put it off.

I do smoke (on and off occasionally, only cannabis + hemp paper, no tobacco) so hopefully I don't have lung cancer or something awful.

I've read about blood clots, I haven't coughed up blood or anything so the only symptom I have so far is the strange pain, it seems to go away if I lay in a certain position.

I could go to the doctors about it first thing in the morning, but I'm currently in some pretty important training for work (2 weeks 9-5 mon-fri for training) so I don't have any time to book an appointment around work at the moment, but I'm afraid it's one of those things that could be a lot worse the longer I leave it.

The big thing is I'm of course still in probation, and the policy at this place is pretty strict, 2 occasions and you're out- and I've already missed a day 2 months ago.

Do I call in and make an appointment possibly sabotaging my career (I worked very hard to get this job) or should I wait until my training ends in 2 weeks and make an appointment after?

37,"I'll try to keep this short.

On NYE, I met this guy and we really hit it off! We talked quite a lot, he bought my friends and I shots, bought us food afterwards, and was a gentleman overall. We ended up hooking up in my hotel room and man, it was pretty hot. It didn't feel like most hookups, where the guy only cares about their own pleasure.

...There was an awkward moment though. I didn't want to go all the way because I'm still a virgin (Just waiting for the right guy tbh, and some of the guys I've dated never really respected me so I'd end it before if could even go there). So when he asked why I didn't want to have sex, I kinda got teary eyed (Keep in mind, I was really, REALLY drunk), and explained to him, and he didn't judge me at all. He comforted me, held my face, told me how beautiful I was, blah blah blah, and we just continued hooking up (but not all the way). Afterwards, he said he wanted to see me again and later texted me goodnight.

Since then, we haven't talked. Maybe he got turned off me getting emotional/the whole virginity thing, I don't know. I don't usually do random hookups, but when I do, I just leave it at that and never contact them again (in fact they usually contact me again but I shut it down).

40," 

I’ve never posted in this subreddit before—please excuse me for my tremendously long backstory.

So pouring out my business to strangers online is something I try to avoid but I think it is probably necessary in order to get some of the answers I need.

A few years ago I met a guy who I would become extremely close friends with, in a very short amount of time. We met at the start of college and formed a really strong bond based on personal interests, but also because we were in a very intense program at our school which is very challenging and known for having a lot of dropouts based on its difficulty.

Though we had never been a couple, I did realize in retrospect that I was very much in love with him. But I never made a move to make that known when we first were friends because he had a girlfriend.

Some time passed and he and his girlfriend broke up after our first semester. I wasn’t sure how I wanted to move forward because I didn’t want to seem desperate, so I did not make my feelings known despite having the feeling that he felt similarly about me. However, as time went on, our friendship went south because he began having a lot of mental health problems that I think were at least partially triggered by the difficulty of our school.

Over time, he gradually began speaking to me less and less. Eventually, I would say he just ""ghosted"" me. But what I found to be really odd is that he did this not only to me, but to all of our other mutual friends. He kind of just faded into obscurity. The last time we spoke, I think I forced it, which is something I regret. I was adamant about trying to understand what was going wrong, but I told him that if he wasn’t ready to talk about all of it at length, that I would just appreciate if he could tell me that he wasn’t well and that maybe we’d talk again at some point in the future. I felt that might give me closure. But he was never able to provide that, and for the past 3 years, our mutual friends and myself have always just wondered what ever happened with him, as he later just dropped out of our school and transferred to another school in another country.

He has no idea, but I really suffered as a result of his leaving my life. I sent him a message about a year after our last interaction to apologize to him about how I may have come off during that interaction because I thought that perhaps I was being too hard on him when he was going through some serious anxiety/depression issues. I’ve also battled with mental health problems and mental illness runs in my family, so severely that I’ve got several family members that have died by suicide. So while I was just intending to be empathetic in my asking him if he was okay, I could see how that, and my need for answers, may have just been added pressure on him in an already less-than-ideal situation.

In any case, he saw that message but never responded. As I said before, I really suffered emotionally as a result of his leaving my life. I just felt such a strong connection to him, despite our never being a couple, that a part of me felt dead when he left my life. I got into a terribly emotionally abusive relationship about 3 months after the last interaction that I had with this guy. The relationship lasted about 2 and a half years. 

I used the relationship as a way to dull many emotions that were hard for me to face at the time. Part of it was having been let down by the other guy, but part of it was also that I had been running from some other personal issues of my own… childhood traumas and such. I’m an empath and so having someone to channel my empathic tendencies into felt good for a while until I fully saw how much I was being belittled and taken advantage of. This person made me lie to my friends and family, forced me into nonconsensual sex, would constantly talk about how bad I was all the time when I was always making my best effort to do good in the relationship, and even told me he wanted to kill me. He even was married the entire time (as well as much older than me) and tried to brainwash me into a polygamist arrangement despite my telling him that I was monogamous (which like, it’s fine to be poly, but I told him I wasn’t and yet he would tell me that I would be degrading myself to leave this relationship in search of a partner who is a better fit after “all we had done together,” telling me that no man would want me… when he could’ve just broken up with me since he knew I was not down for a polyamorous/polygamist arrangement... but he didn't because he enjoyed taking advantage of my not wanting to hurt him by being the one to end things). 

When I broke up with this guy, which I did about 6 weeks ago, things got so bad between all the texts/voicemails/emails he was sending (which were either just degrading and humiliating toward me, or they contained threats, or both) that I had to get a restraining order against him. This whole situation has been so stressful and so upsetting, but if anything good came out of it, I’m back in therapy and finally addressing some of the issues I’d been putting to the wayside. Over the past few weeks, I analyzed everything I just wrote about, within my head, to try and see how I ended up where I ended up in order to move forward. Until…

2 days ago when I get a Facebook message from the guy who I was friends with that left my life 3 years ago.

He comes forward to tell me how he was sorry about the strange and sad note we left off on. He says that he knows it's been a long time, and that he’s finally recovering from his depression so he wanted to address the friendships he’s lost over the past few years. He then thanked me for my friendship and support, and told me that I have his gratitude and respect. And then he said we should perhaps meet up (he had been suggesting Friday and Saturday, as he was on a trip in my city during that time), but said that if I didn’t want to, he’d understand.

So I didn’t see his message until about 15 hours after he sent it. I responded to tell him I’d be willing to meet Saturday. Saturday goes by, and Facebook says he’s been inactive all day. Then in the evening, he sees the message and I get no response. As of now it’s going on about 24 hours with no reply.

Frankly, I don’t think I’m going to do anything if he doesn’t send a message back. Being an empath, ""old me"" would’ve blew up his phone with a bunch of messages about wanting to see him and just saying generally needy things as well as demanding reasons as to why he didn’t text yet, but since I’m back in therapy, I’m trying to avoid that behavior and just focus on myself in the event that he’s not serious at all. But I can’t stop racking my brain with all the things I could say, and I just overall feel really shitty from the suspense all of this has caused me when I’ve actually got some really important stuff that I need to focus on within the next week. I am very interested in rekindling the friendship with him, but I don’t think I should act if he doesn’t message me back since I’ve already put my half of the bridge out there, if you get me. However, I’ve come to Reddit to talk about this because I want to know if any of you think he’s serious, if I’m being dumb, and anything else.

I don’t know. The whole situation has been really confusing and while I’m willing to talk to him, I’m really not willing to go through the emotional loss I went through several years ago the first time he cut our ties. I’ve also just been through a lot recently with the abusive relationship and I have a really hard time trusting men now and I just generally feel like this guy is fucking with me even if he may not see it, which is incredibly annoying. I have a lot of sympathy for his illness, but I think I’ve always tried my hardest to be understanding and accommodating and I sort of feel like my emotions are always taking a backseat to those of others.

What do you all think?

46,"TL:DR How do I tell my boss, “My last day is Friday. Oh, and I’m not coming in this week.”

My months-ago-planned last day is this coming Friday. I told my boss and HR way back in August that I’d be leaving in early January,  and it caused a cascade of problems with HR way back then, but I respected my boss and company and wanted to give them as much unofficial notice as possible. My boss asked me to guarantee that I’d give him a formal one month notice as the date approached (would have been Dec 21), and I said I would. The week that I was to give my month notice there was a flurry of interviewing he was doing for some untitled position that wasn’t discussed with me (yet he wanted me to polish up my job’s description)... I heard a rumor they’d hired someone that I was going to ‘share’ my office with, and that person would be starting Monday the 24th. I truly believed that had I actually given my formal notice they would have just accepted my resignation on the spot and escorted me from the building that day (so they wouldn’t have to pay me for the holidays off as well as three personal days I’d accrue on 1/1). 

Instead, I did NOT give my notice and told my boss I’d actually be leaving much later in 2019 than I originally thought. Come to find out on Monday that the person they ‘hired’ decided not to take the job... 

Through all the holidays and the new year, I’ve not told him that I lied to keep my job as long as possible and will be leaving this Friday as originally planned. In addition, I scheduled my three ‘personal days’ for this past Friday, tomorrow (Monday) and Friday the 11th (so technically Thursday would be my last day physically in my office). Except....I’m thinking of taking sick days Tues, Weds, and Thurs, technically having gamed their system. I hate myself so much right now for putting myself and them in this situation.  

Originally, I told him so far in advance because I respected my boss a lot, but now that their plan to just let me go that December day was painfully obvious, I don’t necessarily feel I owe them anything, but that’s no consolation...I still feel like crap about all this.

I need advice on how not to be such an asshole here. Do I grow a pair, not call in sick and talk to my boss tomorrow (instead of taking a personal day) and let him know this is my last week? Or do I let the week run its course and give my one week notice via email tomorrow? Or do I wait to give my resignation on Friday, basically blindsiding them (as they would have done to me), but having gotten to use all my benefits and some accrued sick time? 

My boss isn’t stupid. I know that he knows that I know that he knows that... it’s such a stupid game. I cleaned my desk and office out over a week ago, and he hasn’t given me any new work or included me in any meetings for almost a month. And I may be an asshole for this whole situation, but I didn’t leave any loose ends or screw anyone over workload-wise. As a matter of fact, I’ve already done most of my position’s daily work for the next three months, so they’re good to go until I’m replaced. 

Also, sticking it out past Friday isn’t an option because I’m leaving the country on Sunday for a few months.

47,"Just some information about myself: I’m a 21 year old film student and I’m living on my own away from parents in order to be able to study film.

Growing up my parents struggled with money, but always wanted to make sure I had some money saved up for when I went to university.  I was always extremely grateful and never asked them for more money than they were willing to give, because I knew even just that amount was too much for them.

The past couple of years I’ve worked a bit, but not a lot because my parents kept telling me that they will provide for me, and that I should focus on my schooling.  I’ve never been against working, and I would work as many hours as I need to in order to live, if necessary.

Recently, my dad has started to complain about how he’s spent so much money on me and that I’m not grateful enough for all his hard work, that I keep spending too much money, that I’m not saving enough, etc.

I told him that the past few years, there have been many times where I offered to get a job in order to pay for my rent, or food at least, and every single time he’s said no, that I should focus on my schooling.

I also mentioned that never in the last few years did I directly tell him that I needed him to give me money, that he willingly decided to pay for my tuition and rent.  If at any moment he told me that they were running low on money, I would have immediately sent out resumes everywhere I could in order to support myself at least a bit.

He got really angry at me, because of everything I told him, and basically told me that he thinks I’m incredibly ungrateful and basically guilt tripped me about the fact that he has spent so much money on me, telling me that hes worked so many years to give me so much money and I just take it for granted.

I basically ended the really bad argument saying that I no longer want a penny more from him and he told me that he’s no longer going to give me anything either, and that he doesn’t care if I can support myself or not.

My mom told me that she doesn’t think its fair to stop supporting me right away, so she’ll try to help me as much as she can from her income until I can find a job.  This also might cause more problems though as a family, since I don’t want my parents to start fighting about it too.

Basically, I’m asking for advice on how I can deal with my new situation, and also how I can hopefully better my relationship with my dad at this point, since its been strained quite a bit. Any advice will be appreciated!

TLDR: My dad guilt trips me about the fact that hes given me so much money for tuition, rent, and food, even though I’ve offered many times to get my own job and make my own money.",07Jan2019,1

49,"I went into my freshman year as a mechanical engineering major. I quickly decided this wasn't for me, and by the end of my first semester had switched over to a history major minoring in museum studies. I enjoyed my classes so much, from my ethnic arts class to intro to museums. Then, over the summer, I started to have doubts. I knew changing my majors to history was risky. It's generally regarded as a useless degree when it comes to getting jobs out of college... or even, you know, years after college. But I wanted to give it a try and do what I love. Then the more I thought about it the more worried I got. Of not finding a job, not having a steady income, not being *happy*. For my sophomore year, this past fall, I added accounting as a second major, figuring I could use the credits I'd need for the history major towards the CPA requirements. I took an econ class and an accounting class, and while I hated the former I did tolerate/like the latter. But now I'm confused again. I don't know if I'm making the right choice here, if I'll regret going into a career that I may not enjoy, or if I'd regret following my dreams without guarantee of a safe income even more. Last January, one of my uncles passed away suddenly. The last thing he said to me was after dinner one evening in my first semester, when I had first decided to switch out of engineering. He said, ""whatever you decide to do with your life, I know you'll succeed."" Sentimental? Sure. He was adventurous. He's climbed six of the seven highest peaks in the world. He's traveled extensively and hiked constantly, always putting the natural world over the manmade. I think all of that has been manifesting itself in my doubts lately, and I just need advice.

I was pretty alarmed but ended up not doing anything about it because at the time honestly I didn't really feel that calling the police would have done anything for the situation. But there are women like me who run these trails alone, so I feel guilty and think I should have called the police - even if they thought I was being stupid for calling.

We are trying to decide when to start trying for our next baby, I say now, he says in 6 weeks when we get to our new home in Mississippi. We discussed the same terms last year when trying to conceive our daughter (now 1 year old) but things happened, we tried earlier and got pregnant 6 weeks earlier than planned. It didn't change anything as we moved into our house that we have now, so I don't think it'll change anything now.

The stress of my job now is affecting him greatly, as I work overnight and rarely see him or my daughter. However, the new job in Mississippi has a strict, normal schedule, so I will see him so much more and help with the baby/ies more often. My mom will also be living near us (she lives with us now), so we will have a lot of help. 

Ultimately, he wanted to hear an unbiased opinion, since I am YES, my mom is YES, he is NO, his mom is NO, so on and so forth. 

Anyways, what are your guys' opinions? Of course, I will not force him into having another baby (that's cray cray), but I don't see what's stopping us from trying early.  Do you think trying 6 weeks early is okay? I want to hear all of the pros and cons! Thank you! ",07Jan2019,1

1. Stay with my current comapany, get a small raise in 2 months and a possible promotion in 8-12 months. I like my job and I like my company since I helped it grow, but worry about stagnation and being underpaid. We are growing very fast still but since I was promoted internally I get paid much less than I should/could.

2. Take an offer for Sr. IT Manager from a very very large and well known company who has attempted to recruit me. This would mean double my current salary but working in a very large corporation with less workplace benefits. On the other hand, it would solidify my position in software management and that is very important since I do not have a degree. On top of this, it's working on a really cool product.

3. Take an offer for Product Manager at a startup that builds software for other larger companies. It has around 150 employees and probably one of the best company atmospheres I can think of. They also allow remote office and some kick ass benefits. The salary is slightly lower than the larger company, but so slightly that it's negligible.

72,"Dear redditors, 

A little heads-up; I usually lurk Reddit, the story will quite possibly be long-winded or dreadful. Sorry if this is the case. I will do my best to be as clear as possible typing this out! If you have a question, want me to elaborate on something, or want me to correct something please let me know!


I have been dealing with a burnout for the past 8+ months, which has since helped me develop insomnia and a minor depression. My psychiatrists current hypothesis is that the insomnia is the biggest problem at the moment, keeping me from recovering well and resulting in the minor depression.

Since acknowledging that there was more going on than mere stress I have been really motivated to get on top of the situation, pulling trough numerous sessions with different psychologists and psychiatrists and the heinous waiting periods in between. Going on finally seemed to pay off halfway through November, because that was the first time the actual hypothesis was set(?). Since the hypothesis I have been enlisted in the waiting period for group therapy for my insomnia. A month and a half later I still haven't heard anything.

A common theme since reaching out for help has been a lot of irrational guilt. When I first reached out to the psych I felt guilty for not being able to fix my situation on my own. For taking a spot at the psych, while there are people waiting that are in way worse situations than me. For not being pleased with the help I received from said psych. Later I also started feeling guilty for receiving food packages from the local food bank. For receiving social assistance for freelancers. For telling the people close to me I'm ""still not doing fine"" for months and months in a row. Etc etc. I think you get the gist of it by now. 

The stupid thing is that I know that most of these are irrational, but despite that i can't seem to shake this feeling of guilt. I feel like a fraud, feel like I'm cheating the system, feel like I'm always complaining, feel like I'm ungrateful for not being happy with the help I'm receiving etc. 

I can counter all above with rational thought, I know that it's okay to not be able to get trough this on my own. I know that I deserve a spot at the psych as much as he next person, and that I have every right to be critical about the help I receive. I know that the fact that I'm getting the social assistance and food packages means that my current situation is bad enough for me to be considered for the support. And I know by heart and constant validation that my friends and family don't mind the slightest bit that I talk about still not being in the best of situations at the moment. 

For some reason I can't connect these rational thoughs to my irrational feelings. If anyone has a bit of advice that would be much appreciated. 

I hope the 'essay' above is somewhat comprehensive. Thanks for taking the time to plow trough my shitty typing skills, hope I didn't bore you to death!

78,"I'm a 25 year old male who has a bachelor's in public health and is in a master's program which ends Fall 2019. I am currently living with my parents and pursuing a master's degree in IO Psychology while I commute 2 hours each way to class twice a week . My house is filled with negativity and my parents are both so verbally abusive that my mental health has declined severely and I have had depression for over a year because of it. I feel trapped and like there is no way out and even though I know my life will improve once I graduate with my master's degree, I feel like I won't survive until the end of Fall 2019. I really want to move out and find a job in Orlando but I'm not sure what job I could do to pay the bills. I was a public school teacher who taught in a high school in the past but it was work that I disliked and there was no room for growth. I should add that I am open to career changes especially in the tech field (IT, Programming/web dev). If anyone has any suggestions or advice on how to get through this situation or maybe some career paths I could pursue that has room for growth while also allowing me to survive in Orlando, I would greatly appreciate it. 

TLDR: 25M mental health compromised from living with parents in a verbally abusive/oppressive household. Need advice on if I should continue with my master's program and try and tough it out or move out to where I want to live (Orlando FL) and try and survive and grow there. ",07Jan2019,1

For a long time, we have wanted to visit the US and do a road trip from the west coast through to the east coast and see many of the famous places we’ve seen in films. We might actually go there later this year. 

Some of our parents and relatives have expressed concern about us driving across the US in light of recent events surrounding police brutality against many black people. We’ve seen the videos so we are actually taking this into serious consideration. 

What I would like to ask is if you kind people of Reddit think we would be putting ourselves in harms way by making this trip and also if there are specific places like cities or states that we should avoid.

96,"I'm a second year lawyer who did his summer associateship at a smaller firm. Immediately, one of the partners took me under his wing and we quickly grew very find of each other. He was the guy who had my back, made sure to teach me the ""why"" and not just the ""what,"" and just made work enjoyable. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly of a heart attack who no one (and I mean no one) saw coming. He was very healthy and only in his mid-60s. We were very close both personally and professionally. I still tear up when thinking about him, but consider myself lucky for the time I did get to spend with him.

Once he was gone, the other partners at the firm saw an opportunity to split up his work and cut an expense (me). They literally gave me two weeks' notice merely two weeks after his funeral. Through a strange series of events, the partners then asked me to stay a week after giving me the two weeks' notice. But the writing was obviously on the wall. Someone who previously worked for this firm and actually interviewed me for the summer associateship heard about my situation and reached out to me about joining her current firm. The interviews went well and within a few weeks I started my job at this new firm.

As you can imagine, at first I was a little hesitant about reporting to a new person because I thought that no one could ever replace my previous mentor. But, to my surprise, we really clicked. We became very close and she enjoyed the role of being a true mentor to me. I know that she could not fill the hole left by my previous mentor's death, but things were as good as I could have imagined. Well, last week she told me that she is taking a job in house. When she told me, it felt like I was losing my first mentor all over again. It really tore off the scab. We were both in tears. I know this is the best move for her and her family, but it still really really hurt.

So now, I'm left to see how the dust settles at my current firm. But this has me thinking, how important is a mentor? I can't imagine the odds are great that I will find a third attorney in a row that is willing to serve in that role. Would that stunt my growth? Any advice on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

I didn’t necessarily want to work there but I accepted anyway because I new it would make him and my grandfather, he started the business, very happy. Everything was going well and then one day he invites me to go to lunch with him and a business associate, let call her Carole. After lunch and we depart he asks what I thought of Carole. I explained she was fine for a business associate but I wasn’t too fond of her for various reasons. Fast forward a few months I see that he is working on something odd for the Carole’s business. I shrug it off. Now it Xmas season  and while doing some database related stuff I find a weird table and decide to investigate. Turns out he was using the company’s server to facilitate communication between him and Carole to hide their affair. I read everything and was, I am still very much so, furious.  I kept it bottled up until after Xmas because I didn’t want to ruin Xmas for my whole family. Come the first of the year I confront him and force him to tell my mother and everyone else. Which he does but he try’s to minimize the severity. He and my mother eventually start working things out and things seem to be on the mend. About six months later, my wife and I are getting ready for bed and receive a phone call from my mother crying and explaining that my dad has just hit her  repeatedly and she’s called the cops. Where did the assault happen? At his business. I promptly drive up to her. When I arrive there several officers with my mother and they explain my father is jail for the night and my mother can file for a restraining order. I dont trust my father any more so I encourage her to do so and she does. Over the next several months I continue to work at the family business but i dont say a word to my father unless it is needed. But eventually I leave the business because I can’t stand to be around him or at the business any longer. I left about a year ago and haven’t really said too much to him since. As for my parents they are separated and my dad wants to get a divorce but hasn’t moved forward which has left my mother in limbo.

 Now for the question. Sorry that was long. my wife is pregnant and I don’t know if I should bring him back into our lives. My wife doesn’t trust him and doesn’t even know if she can be around him. I don’t trust him either but I also don’t want to be the dick that never forgives. Yet he hasn’t proven himself to me either. Any suggestions as steps I can take to test him or mend the relationship.

Turned out that instead of growing watermelons, it decided to move further and further into the yard. Every time I give it fertilizer (once per 1-2 weeks) it just grows more and more.

110,"I really do apologize for the length and complexity of my post and situation, but am in dire need of advice. Please mention if my formatting could be better for others to read, apologies as I am on mobile.

I am an eigtheen year old male living in Perth, Australia with my family who recently moved here for my Dad's Uni Course. I moved from Adelaide, where I completed my final year of schooling in 2018. Within a week and a bit, University Offers will arrive and I will have to make a decision about where I want to go. 

LIST OF TERMS AND PLACES: I thought I'd simplify terms for a better understanding. 

Adelaide - City in South Australia

Flinder's Uni - University in South Australia, further from CBD

Adelaide Uni - University in South Australia, within the CBD. 


Perth - City in Western Australia

UWA - University in Perth, across the road from where I live


CITIES AND MOVING: So originally I'm from Adelaide, South Australia and absolutely love the city and am familiar with it. Were I to move to adelaide I would have expenses upwards of $20,000 per year, not including tuition and educational expenses.

Staying in Perth means I'm right next to Uni, don't have any expenses, and have familial support. The nightlife and overall things to do are better here than in Adelaide.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY: Two of the biggest factors impacting my decision are the friends I've made in Adelaide and my family here in Perth. 

My friends are a tight group of 8 who've spent the greater part of the last two years together and developing an incredibly tight bond. Regardless of having moved almost all of them still want to maintain a relationship, make an effort to speak to me even though I've moved and consider the group's friendship to be the type that lasts a lifetime. So far most of my friends will be studying in Flinders Uni with a couple at Adelaide, none of them will be living on campus or within the city. 

I know almost nobody here in Perth and will have to make friends through Uni when it starts. 

My family on the other hand is mostly dysfunctional. My dad is successful, intelligent and hardworking, whereas my mother is the complete opposite. This creates tension often, however, a possible split is out of the question. My sister is irritating to live with, and so are my family as there are arguements fairly often. My parents are almost helicopter parents and I believe will prevent me from enjoying University Life and the fun associated with it. 

GRADES AND UNI: Last year I didn't acheive the ATAR (Tertiary Ranking, Final Grades) I wanted and the ATAR I needed, to compliment my UMAT (Medicine Entrace Test) Score and Interviews for Dentistry and Medicine. I recieved a 91st Percentile in the State of SA and an 85th elsewhere. I've always wanted to study Medicine, and can bear Dentistry as a secondary option, however, this pathway seems to be unattainable with my performance. On the other hand as a backup career I've always considered Law. This is where my options start: 

Dentistry at Adelaide (VERY Low Chance although ideal)
(Pros: Adelaide, Friends, Independence, Course. Cons: Literally None)

Law and Med Science Double Degree at Adelaide, 5.5 Years (I'm above the minimum score someone last year got in with but I haven't formally recieved an offer yet) 
(Pros: Adelaide, Friends, Independence, Possible entrance into Medicine, Backup career in Law if Med falls through. Cons: Living Costs, Family Less supportive, Career in Law is a compromise compared to Med)


Law and Bio Technology at Flinders (SA), again haven't recieved an offer but is possible. (Pros: Similar to above, Friends Majority at Flinders. Cons: Similar + Living Costs, Flinders is arguably less prestigious for Law)


Biomedicine at UWA in Perth GUARANTEED (3 Year bachelor with entrance into Med, Dent and Pharm assuming high GPA and GAMSAT score, but no guarantee to get in to further study)
(Pros: Liklier entrance to Medicine. Cons: Will Live with Family, Dead End course if I do not get into Medicine, Dent, Pharmacy, although I wouldnt want to do Pharmacy)


Medical Science at Adelaide (Similar situation with Bio Med just in Adelaide)


Repeat Year 12 in Perth:

Although this would be relatively easy as I know all of the content, if I slack off like I did last year it will be a wasted year hence, were I to do this I would have to divert my full attention to this and not waste time like I did last year. I am capable of getting a 99 ATAR but tend to burn out halfway through the year and am afraid of that happening again. The content being stuff I know may also cause me to slack off again.


My father suggests repeating assuming I am serious about it as it opens up the most doors, however, many things can go wrong. 

I feel like I am rushing into making a decision that will lead me to compromises in my life, because of a thirst of independence and getting away from the family. I also feel as though my friends seem more important than they are and are a large factor pulling me to Adelaide, that may not be a good deciding factor.

Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR
Move to Adelaide for a compromise in career choice, Law vs Med, good friends, Independence and more living costs.
OR
 Stay in Perth with nagging family, financial security, less fun, Repeat Year 12 or do Pre Med Course",07Jan2019,1

112,"As a young kid, stuffed animals were my everything. Not a ton has changed, honestly. I still have several I have no intentions of ever letting go of, and that's not even getting into my beloved Beanie Baby collection. But at this point I'm a literal hoarder.

It might actually kill me to just put them to the curb. I can't do it. It's going to hurt enough letting go of them, and the one thing I'm holding onto is the hope that they will give a children joy. I don't care about money at all, I just want to get them to needy kids.

114,"My family recently got a new sofa set, consisting of a two seater and a three seater. We intended to throw away our old set, but ended up only throwing away the old three seater because it is in really terrible condition. The old two seater is ripped in a few places, and looks a bit worn, and my mum refuses to throw it away. So now, the old two seater is in this awkward position in the living room, and we had to move a few chairs to accommodate the size. We have three people n our family, and now we have space for seven people on our sofas alone, and a few chairs strewn around for more people to sit on. The old two seater sofa is an eyesore to me, because it takes up so much space, and I was intending to use that space for a dog I wanted to adopt/purchase. The old sofa set has served its purpose, and has served my family well for over 19 years. The intention of the new sofa set was to replace the old sofa set, and make our living room more pleasant looking, but instead it has made our living room more cluttered. I really don't understand the need for this old two seat sofa, which is ripped, and the bottom of the sofa is falling apart.

She keeps talking about how much money she has spent on this old sofa set (it is a leather set), but I am sure we got our money's worth for over 19 years, and the old two seater takes up so much space considering we already have a new set. Please help! How do I get my mother to agree to remove this additional old sofa set? I have tried talking, and reasoning, but it becomes an argument all the time. ",07Jan2019,1
115,"I live in an apartment in Ontario, Canada with two roommates (20M and 26M). 20M's room has a closet that holds the furnace, water heater, etc. When I turn the heat on to about 73F (\~23C) it causes 20M's room to heat a little warmer than the rest of the house. In response to this, he turns the heat off. Not down, completely off. I'm sick of coming home or waking up to a freezing (60F or 15C) house because his bedroom is 77F (25C) and he can't handle it. My other roommate, 26M, has agreed the house gets too cold but doesn't actually say anything to 20M (and wouldn't if I asked him to). 

**I want to confront him and ask that instead of turning off the heat, he turn it down a few degrees instead. This way his room can cool down but I avoid freezing for hours while I wait for the apartment to reheat. Does this sound reasonable? It's his apartment too, so I don't know if I'm asking too much.**

I am not a confrontational person and I worry that he will somehow turn this around on me. I have thought about suggesting he use the fan in the closet if he really puts up a fuss. On the other hand, I feel he may turn it around and tell me to go buy a space heater, despite the fact that it is only his room that is a few degrees higher than the rest of the apartment.

A big problem is that he is kind of a difficult roommate. The apartment is in near pristine condition for student living (some crumbs on counter and floor but that's it) and he insists on hiring a maid, which I have told him I will not pay for. I also gave him money to purchase cleaning supplies which he spent entirely on 10L of dish soap, for what reason I don't know. 

I know this is stupid and petty but I'm freezing and it's just another log on the fire (I wish) that's driving me crazy. 

(Actual question in bold)

TLDR; Roommate turns off heat and leaves house freezing because his room is slightly warmer than rest of the apartment. Is it too much for me to ask that he not do this?",07Jan2019,1

118,"I live in potentially the most LIBERAL place in all of Illinois, USA. There is a coffee shop in my area called the Jackson Avenue Coffee Shop (AKA The Jac).

So I did 7 weeks of comedy, you could only go to the open mic on Thursdays, so 7 times of comedy technically. I started strong, got weak, ended strong. But the problem is a bunch of the SJW idiots in the area made complaints I was too offensive. I got advice from a fellow comedian but it was horrible. It feels like my effort and dream is just crashing. Should I give up comedy or keep trying to get back in, the open mic is the only one in my area! If I get banned from this place for essentially no reason (I was too offensive apparently, they took everything out of context) that stayed.

I fixed my cussing, which was a problem, But that is a dumb rule for them since no kids even go there.

I didn't make offensive jokes, the ones that were close were highly exaggerated and taken out of context.

I keep a notebook of all my jokes and have a recording of my first ever performance. I could post it here by request if this topic gets something going. I really love comedy but.. maybe it's NOT for me after all...

If I should keep following my dreams, what do I do? Should I try to work something out or just say fuck them and look somewhere else.

122,"Hi everyone, I'm going to be turning 20 soon and I'm still unfortunately a virgin. I've had plenty of partners and a few girlfriends. I'm quite experienced when it comes to kissing and being with women, until it comes close to sex. I feel very nervous whenever things start to get close to sex. I just don't want to disappoint whoever I end up having sex with. I'm a fairly confident guy and I'm told I'm also quite attractive. It's just that I'm so old and I feel like I should have a lot more sexual experience. 

I grew up in a very strict household so it made it very difficult to have a girlfriend. I found myself hiding all of my relationships from my parents. Most of the girls I had romantic relationships with were my friends with benefits. So that's part of the reason why I think I'm still a virgin. A good situation never appeared for me. So here I am at 19. Still living at home, and still a virgin.

I'm going to basic training at the end of January and I feel pressured to lose my virginity before I ship out. So I've been debating if I should keep trying to go on dates and meet someone nice or if I should just hire a prostitute and get it over with. I find it extremely difficult to think about the idea of becoming a 20yo virgin. How should I proceed?

I'm a burden to everybody. I just make everyone angry by worrying. Everybody blames me for being the problem. I suffer from bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. I just did a terrible thing months ago, and I still couldn't recover from it. I almost had a fight with someone, and almost got into trouble. I worry about it, and still can't recover from it.

But damn, I tried hard to solve that. I tried to do research on moving out of my parent's house (I'm giving them a hard time). But it's too competitive to get a job in South Korea. Sometimes, I wish to go back to US, but it is hard for someone without a graduate's degree to get a job there either. And think about taxes.

But I'm confused. Should I just hide my feelings? That makes them comfortable. But what about me? If I want a true healing process, this issue must be dealt with. It's been years, and my parents are done supporting me. But I still have a long way to go.

I know that US has a support program for penniless undergraduates. I don't know if it works or not. I hope I do well in classes, or else I won't get the support. And after I graduate what then? Computer Science is very rough and competitive.

126,"So uh hello? This will be my first actual Reddit post. Hopefully I can get my mind at ease. Disclaimer! I’m not that good at grammar so I apologize in advance for anything.

Here’s a little background.-So. I’m 19, I live with my parents. I have a very bad issue with my eye. I can’t drive (yet I’m hoping I can, but I’m not here to talk about my eye. If I need to go into more detail i will) I’m just either at home or at work. I’m a very self conscious guy. I’m emotional and I tend to get excited very easily. I try my best to make everyone laugh. I love to see people smile! It makes me happy, but I hate letting people down. It really sucks. Especially whenever it’s my parents, or friends. My friends are in high school together, and I graduated two years earlier. I live roughy about 45mins from them.

So about the story-
Since my friends lives 45mins from me I rarely get to see them! I have to gain the confidence to ask my parents if they can take me somewhere. Cause I don’t like being dependent on someone, but I’ve been dependent about all my life. I really hate it. Anyways...My mother said she would take me if need too. So today was the day that we hung out. My friends said that they can pick me up. I told my parents that didn’t have to worry about bringing me. But guess what happened? My friend car broke down. So they had to tow there car to their house. (45mins away) and come back to pick me up. My friend asked if I could meet up half way or something. So I asked my mother if she could take me and the response was “yeah of course!”. My dad had another choice of words to say. He didn’t like it. So I hung out with my friends! (Went to see AquaMan!) So I came back, and my dad talked to me. I can’t really remember his exact words but he said around “That was disrespectful towards your mother and I to make a snap movement like you did today. That was not just plain dumb. If that was my mother I wouldn’t do that cause I love her and respect her. If you do that again you won’t go out.” Now I don’t ask to see my friends allot. I think last time I did it was around the start of November. 
I can understand why they are upset towards me. Cause I made last minute plans, but it wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. 

Should I just stop going out so that way he won’t be butt-hurt anymore? I’m just very loss. It feels like I can’t hangout with my friends who I rarely get to see, but it seems like I can’t really make anyone happy. So I just want to make myself miserable. 

So does anyone have any advice on this? It would be helpful.

131,"So... I have a situation. Will give you some background history. It’s my first time posting here so forgive me for any mistakes.

My grandfather is in his 70s. He emigrated from his country (Italy) in the 1940s as poor as it can get. He’s now rich (A lot) and because he’s had a hard life he thinks he can do whatever he wants with us (the family). We also believe he has killed people and know he has a daughter out of wedlock - he’s not a good person at all. He’s my mothers father. They (he and my mum) have a complicated history, he basically neglected her her entire life and made her life an actual hell until she finished her studies and married my father - making her live a lesser life than he could afford (and he didn’t do that to her siblings) for the simple reason that she went to uni and didn’t stay in her hometown and married someone he wanted her to, unlike her sister and her brother - my mother would literally cry frantically just because she spoke to him through the phone, even though we live thousands of kilometers away. Now, we (me and my parents) don’t depend on him for anything at all, unlike everyone he knows (that makes him mad apparently), yet he tries to intervene even when my dad wants to buy another car, for example.

The entire family has issues because of him, my female cousins, my aunt, my mum and my grandmother have it worse, and I thought it was because he is pretty misogynistic and/or because he thinks he can buy everyone, no matter what atrocities he commits or says... until I read some stories here on Reddit. Now I’m rather sure he molested/raped my mum, my aunt and my cousins and I have no idea how to have my mum to tell me the actual truth.

I am a 20-year-old, 6’5, 90kg male. I’m not violent, but I can, and already have been. I’ve already talked extensively to my parents, therapist and psychiatrist about how I think I might be a psychopath (I’m not, just a cold individual). My mom knows that I don’t react lightly when I know someone does anything I do not appreciate to her. So I think she’ll lie to me so I won’t do anything to hurt my grandfather (and if the situation is truthful I most certainly will end my grandfathers life in the most painful way I can imagine). That’s why I don’t know how to get a real answer and resorted to people that don’t know me or my family to give me some advice.

What do I do?",07Jan2019,1

ok so last night I was watching the first austin powers movie with my dad. We were having a great time with popcorn and maxibons and it is a very funny movie. we got up to the scene where austin Powers had entered alotta fagina’s (a spy on the evil side) apartment. Austin and Alotta end up going intimatee and alotta undresses.

My 2nd degree would be network specialist (IT), I currently have computer support specialist. A 4 year degree would be also in the IT field.

I can afford or mostly afford the 4 year degree on my own but it'd drain my savings which isn't absolutely huge since I live with my parents still but I can look for scholarship opportunities and possibly get something through FAFSA.

144,"Context: I’m 17 and from a Mexican-American family with divorced parents and live with my mom, younger sister (14). and older brother. Since my parents’ divorce though, I’ve felt the need to step up as a somewhat head of the house due to my older brother not caring about the happenings in our household, and my mother not knowing English.  

For about the past two years, my sister’s behavior has changed so dramatically to the point that she’s tried running away, disappearing for hours at a time without telling anyone to go with her boyfriend, stealing money from my mom’s purse, and even attempting suicide. My sister and my mom are constantly fighting (at times getting physical) over what each of them is allowed to do: sister claiming that my mom’s doesn’t want her to be happy and she should be free to do whatever makes her happy; mom claiming that she’s an out of control street rat who doesn’t care at all about anyone/anything, not even herself. My dad still lives in town, and is used as a threat by my mom, but my siblings and I are so turned against him that it doesn’t work as a threat anymore on her. Each of them are incredibly unhappy and childish at times, but each of their arguments seem somewhat valid yet wrong at the same time so I can’t side most times.

I’ve always been the mediator in our family as I’m the most rational and least temperamental, but over time have gotten backlash from both sides for supporting the other. Attempting to deal with all of this at home plus my own problems at school has just devastated me mentally to where I’ve been seeking help and have been instructed now to not meddle in their situation anymore. But since I’ve always been the one to “fix” and work out since my parents separated, my mom just always expects me to be on her side and back her up no matter what, despite the drawbacks doing so has on me and my own relationship with my sister/siblings. She depends way too much on me and seeing as how I’ll be gone for college before too long, it’s not good for anybody. 

I just don’t want to care anymore. No matter how much I just want either side to understand each other.  But I just can’t anymore- it’s not good for me. Am I doing the right thing for backing out of this situation- even though my mom would have no one/my sister would remain the same and the situation would still be just as broken?

149,"So before anyone gets mad over this, I have my reasons so let me explain

I was raised in an abusive household. My father use to beat us (mother, older siblings, dog, and me) relentlessly. But when I was 4, my parents got a divorce so it was bye with him forever. But my mother is also abusive. Leaning on the more mental abuse side, with a few physical abuse incidents. So I finally moved out recently and said goodbye to her. And all my best friends were supper supportive and they all helped a lot with the process, which I am so grateful for and will continue to be grateful for the rest of my like. But one of them (who I’ll call Mandy) is in her own abusive relationship. Her “boyfriend” is this crazy asshole who controls her, gaslights her, cheats on her, pressures her, and throws shit at her. And the kicker? Last week, he actually beats up Susan’s mom. And she defends him at all cost. When he hit her mother and threw her to the ground, when he pulled her out of the car by her collar only to shove her back in and slam the door on her and leave with her keys, when he CONSTANTLY puts her down and follows it with “you’re lucky I even consider even being into you”. And I have tried to be the supportive friend who will be there for her no matter what she chooses, who will even be nice to that monster she’s dating, who will pick up the pieces of her mental stability just so he can break it again. I tried to call him out and tell him to GTFO of her life while Susan was out of town visiting family. I have tried EVERYTHING that I can think of to get her to realize that he needs to go. But I’m over it. She fought tooth and nail for me to get out of my abusers grasps, but she refuses to let me do the same. Even when I’m being the nice and supportive friend, it always comes back to bite me in the ass. But also, it’s so hard for me to watch her get abused because I have been in that situation. I know. And I didn’t fight me ENTIRE life just to watch someone I love so very much fall into the exact same trap that she just helped me get out of. It’s deteriorating my mental health because it’s just reminding me of absolutely terrible situations that I want to leave in the past, but I also want to give her the same support she gave me.

151,"To start things off my girlfriend has only one close friend due to her crazy work schedule. One of the reasons her and her friend got so close (same schedule) I was a little curious about questionable behavior from my girlfriends friend about six months ago which you can read about on my profile if further info would help. We do a lot of activities with her friend. She goes many places with us because we usually drink together on the weekends and work out with each other around three times a week. 

The reason why I am questioning things is because every once and a great while we will have a sketchy moment or night with one another. I dont wanna sound judgemental saying that her friend is just easy when she drinks but signals are just really weird. We get along really well with one another and have a ridiculous amount in common. To explain myself upfront I'm in no way wanting to end things with my girlfriend as I am very happy and have been with her for 6 years. I'm just curious as to others opinions. Throughout normal activites things are very platonic and never usually out of line by any means. However, when we go out on the weekends or special events (thanksgiving,christmas,new years eve) things get a little different. She sits down beside me almost everywhere we go and feels the need to touch everything I'm wearing like a soft sweatshirt or sweatpants and not just the clothes she will rub my body part for a split second. Now it's never in an inappropriate spot but it's usually by the side of my leg or up by my bicep. 

We got a little tipsy at the bar about a month ago and my girlfriend wasn't feeling well so she didn't wanna drink that night. She asked me if I would go look after her friend to make sure no creeps tried to take advantage with her while my girlfriend caught up with some old high school acquaintances. When I went to check on her friend I saw her mingling with a few people. I tapped her on the shoulder to say hi as she did not know I was there. Her face lit up with a huge smile, she screamed my name and jumped up and gave me the most intense hug/body wrap I've ever gotten(she almost knocked me down lol) I was kind of taken back by this because she's usually never that hands on. She has never hugged me before. She asked where my girlfriend was and I told her she was inside the indoor/outdoor bar. (We were outside.) Once I saw that she wasn't alone and there were no creeps around I told her I was going back in she forcefully told me no and pulled me in close and put my arm up over her shoulder where my hand was almost cupping her breast. She kept dancing up on me to the music that was playing while she was talking with friends. People asked 5 times if I was her boyfriend. She ended up doing this for about 2 hours. She asked me to go escort her to and from the bathroom and held my hand like a girlfriend the whole way. When we went back outside she did the same thing only this time she was rubbing my hand and forearm with her fingernails in a very flirtatious way. That's just one of a few nights were something that intense happens

The next day I explained it to my girlfriend and my girlfriend kind of laughed it off by saying that's just how she acts and that's just her being nice. My girlfriend also said that I was being a little conceited thinking her friend was interested in me",07Jan2019,1
152,"Long story short, I currently work in a job that could potentially be an awesome launch pad towards a successful career if I go to seminary and become a minister. It is only part time (15-20 hrs) due to how I ""used"" to be a student getting my undergrad while working at said job. 

The hard truth is, a part of me really had a calling for the field of education, so I decided to switch majors my junior year to Secondary Ed. This switch adds an additional 3.5 years to what could have been just 1.5 more years (graduating a semester late). I did this btw without informing my employer, because I really did not think it was necessary. I was supposed to graduate in December of 2018, and my employer still believes that I did - and that I will be going to seminary either this fall or next. I am stuck between doing education or continuing down the path I have chosen job wise. I feel like I am sitting on the middle of a teeter totter with both options perfectly balanced on either side. I am very indifferent and it is eating me up. Furthermore, if I decided to go to seminary, I would want to switch my major back to what it previously was and drop the education degree path to graduate in 1.5 years from today. 

Final kicker, classes start tomorrow at the college I have been attending. My other option would be to go to school online at a different institution, and that could expedite my degree to 1 year, instead of 1.5 if I chose another option besides finishing out education for the next 2 years. 

I am sorry if this is confusing, my thoughts are so messy right now. It is so hard to be coherent. All of the decisions and pressure is really making me more depressed than I have ever been, and I can feel how much it is taking a toll on me physically. This is my last place to turn...

154,"My name is Jenna, and I’m a high schooler in America. I have quite a long story, but the easiest way to put it is that I used to be VERY difficult growing up, everyone hated me and I mean 80% of people had a disliking of me. The other 20% had no idea why the 80% felt that way. Anyways, I was always bullied and I always talked back and gave people a piece of my mind. I was pretty obsessive and the teachers hated me a lot too. They had the right, I never had bad intentions but I really did the wrong things. And this lasted until I was 12. But when I was 13, things FLIPPED. I can’t describe how much I changed, and people noticed. I became pretty well liked honestly, among my grade and the grades lower. there are and were still a few people (maybe like 10) who still dislike me for who I used to be, and the other people are like siblings to me now. However, the grade above me, who left the year I changed drastically, still know me for who I was. And it’s really not helpful in a tight knit community like mine. An entire grade literally despises me and I’ve grown to be kinda awkward from how much I care about what people think of me. I don’t know what to do, my grade loves me and the grade above me hates me. We’re moving soon and I do have the opportunity to switch schools, but I don’t know if it’s worth losing the countless good friends I’ve made these few recent years. The grade above me thinks I’m annoying, difficult, and looks down on me in a sense, but among my grade you could say I’m among the top of my class. Teachers like me a lot too, and I’m taking impressive courses. I don’t know what to do, no one actively hates me or shit talks me but I really don’t want to be looked down on or be considered annoying when im really not. Help? ",07Jan2019,1
155,"TLDR at bottom.

I'm 31 and currently work in the oil patch in Alberta, Canada. My past experience and credentials include: welding for 13 years (every aspect from owning my own company, running a multi-million dollar manufacturing shop, and working in the field), pipefitting (short 3 year gig, enjoyable, but hardly a sustainable career, layoffs and uncertainty are constant), welding inspector (never really panned out, hard vocation to enter and entry level positions pay very low), and within the last year did online correspondence and became a licensed 4th class power engineer (might have been a mistake, have been applying for work for over a year with no luck, it appealed to me because it is intellectually challenging and not as laborious as previous jobs. Power engineering goes as high as 1st class, but that would be years of studying and practicums/work experience). 

Currently I'm working as a hydraulic fracturing operator (fracing) to pay the bills. It's hard work, a rotational schedule, I'm constantly away from home and the oil patch isn't doing well, so work is spotty at best. I had an epiphany the other night, and realized that I hate working in heavy industry. It's a roller-coaster for consistency (recession every 4-6 years), hard on the body, hard on relationships and it employees some pretty toxic people. I'm considering going back to school and starting over, but have financial responsibilities and am afraid of racking up thousands in student debt. Married, no kids, have a mortgage, 35k worth of debt and a good emotional support group. Paralysed because of all the possible choices. Start all over and try a whole new career? Try and continue down the power engineering path with no guaranteed job in the end? Sell the house and move back to BC with a wife and dog and live with the parents? Stay in Alberta and make a go at going to U of A while still retaining all existing assets? Stay in Alberta and sell everything to try and lessen the load and go to U of A? Any advice or experiences would be awesome.

TLDR: Invested 15 years into the oil patch, sick of it and want something better. Have an established life and don't know the best option to continue with. New schooling? Continue existing schooling? Sell house? Move in with parents?",07Jan2019,1
156,"I'm not sure if this was the right subreddit to post this too or not but I'm going to post it anyway. I'm looking for an answer as to what I saw because it makes little sense to me.

 In September of 2018, me and 3 of my friends were walking through our hometown in northeast new jersey. We were walking through our friends block when we decided to head to a neighboring town via abandoned train tracks. Were all stupid teenagers so we thought nothing of it. As we looked down the tracks we saw a strange man come out of the bushes with 2 bikes with him. Almost right next to him we saw a strange all black human looking figure move and duck down near him in the bushes. Me and my friends were scared and confused by this. As the person with the bikes got closer, my friend who I will call Danny, recognized it as his friend who I will call michael. Michael told us he found one of the bikes on the tracks. We all told michael what we saw and he began to panic a little telling us he saw nothing. After talking for a couple minutes, Danny and my other Friend who I'll call Cole decided to walk down to where we saw the person. They didnt see or find anything and signaled us to come over. I dont know exactly what it's called but we were chilling out under and overpass that want over the tracks near where we saw the thing. Cole and Danny again decide to head on over to bushes and start hearing rustling and leaves/branches cracking. Cole signals us to get down and get out of there. After about a half hour of walking, we got to the town we wanted to get to. We met some other friends a small end of the summer festival in one of the parks. A cop approached us a little while later telling us about a suspect they saw in the town we were just in that was related to the kidnapping of 2 girls. The description matched to what we saw and we had a basically wondered if we possibly led this man back to our town. 

As time passed on from this, me and Cole were one day out on his polaris off roader in October/November  on some dirt bike trails near his house. Along these trails is a long trail going to the same town we had walked from on the train tracks. As we approached the peak of steep hill which lead to the main trails. I noticed a man in all black (I couldnt make out any other features) near a small power station on the side of the trails. I immediately told Cole and he drove right down the hill as quick as possible. I tried keeping my eye on the man but the grumpiness of the hill and the dense shrubbery made it difficult but I saw him run off  into the forrest. Cole and I stopped right where I saw him. We couldnt detect and possible footprints and we found nothing at all in the small forest. It was strange because we got to where he was so fast and he ran into the small woods so quickly we couldn't find him. I'm almost positive it was a person because I saw the arms and legs move like a person running. This was the last time I saw this thing.

160,"I have a problem. I am a 22 year old man. I was raised entirely by women and never had a father figure/male role model. I love my mother and she has done her best for me but she was also a domestic abuse victim, I think it has caused me some problems. I am not blaming the way I am on her as I have anxieties and issues outside of this, but still the issue is this.

I don't feel like a man. While growing up masculinity wasn't shunned or opressed in my family but it was never encouraged either, I have never really felt like a person on the inside, I feel as though I have no identity, no place to draw from. When I see other men I fear, I think it is a trait I picked up from the women around me as I have so many others, however I think due to lack of any male guidance I have grown into being passive, unassertive, indecisive, complacent, and weak. I am not saying women are like this because I know that isn't true, I am saying I have no concept of typical manliness which is supposedly quite opposite to traits like this. I have no desire to protect or provide for my loved ones, I cry very easily and I am overly effeminate and emotional, I lack whatever manliness is, I hate conflict (probably a normal ome eh?), I am a procrastinating weak boy. It is all just a void to me, a hole that is agonising and empty. I do not know how to fix things, or interact with other people (women included). I don't have any ego, which could be argued as a good thing but it isn't to me, I have no drive to succeed, to impress, to become better. I am a quitter, a loser, a let things happen and avoider, I am cowardly and submissive. Whenever arguements happened at my house for example we would just be screamed at to stop, rather than try to hash things out or fight it out and I feel like this attitude is so engrained in me now (to stay comfortable) and I am weaker for it. I guess I do have some desire to change but often no will to enact the plan, to become who I want to be. I feel like I never learned how to be a person and live in the world properly or push myself for something, and that I was raised with love and care and looked after but I never learned how to operate, I feel like a manchild.

I know the phrase is considered harmful but I need to 'man up'. How the hell do I do that when I feel as though I have no pull towards it. Does this even make sense?",07Jan2019,1

I know she travels on the highway very close (10 mins) to where we live reguarly and sorta hinted at how close to the highway we are for her to drop in and say hi and grab the stuff.

164,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re having a good new year so far. Also sorry for formatting and whatnot, I’m on mobile. There will be a tldr at the bottom. 

I’m in university but currently on a 12 month probationary period where I can’t move further in my program or earn any post secondary credits. I was placed on academic probation due to a number of factors that left me in one of my worst depressive stints and my grades suffered. I’m unable to return to school until the summer term. 

The thing is I want to be a doctor one day and furthermore I want to be a surgeon. I want to know whether I’m delusional to think I can turn it around with having first year D- grades on my record. I failed my core science courses first term, and barely passed the second term repeating those courses. I now have one attempt left for those courses. I haven’t done all my research of what medical schools accept repeat grades or lessen the weight of your first year but I’m scared there won’t be many. 

I know that when I return to school I’m going to work my hardest to dig myself out of this hole, but I want to know if people think my fate is set and it’s pointless. I feel so angry with myself for letting my external problems get the better of me. And I’m making a plan (getting a new therapist, and getting back on a consistent antidepressant regimen, learning better study and time management skills). Maybe I just need to hear that people have been in similar academic trouble like I’m in and have been able to turn it around. Thanks for reading this, I appreciate it. 

TLDR: I’m on academic probation and unable to return to school until the summer. I want to one day be a surgeon but want to know if I should give up that dream and be more realistic given my D- grades this past year.

178,"Greetings all. 

I’m writing this post in search for advice and guidance on how to fix a dilemma of mine. It goes as follows. 

I recently graduated High School and I’m very happy to be somewhat closer to independence now. However, the past 4 years were extremely difficult for me. I had several serious mental health issues, mediocre grades, terrible social skills, and more. I also procrastinated a lot. I would put deadlines off until last minute + I would turn things in late, and overall I cannot honestly say that I worked to my full ability. 

On top of all that, I worked a lot during High School. I had expenses put on me really quick and anyways, our family doesn’t make a ton of money. Luckily we manage to get by. 

I procrastinated so badly, that I missed all the college application deadlines. At the time I was going through a lot and I don’t really know what got into me. 

Fast forward to today, and I really want to go to college full time with a great passion. However It’s more difficult now than it seems. 

I want to go and study Pure Mathematics because I love math. I basically spend all of my free time doing math. You should see my room, there are thousands of miscellaneous books laying around from Multivariable Calculus to Princeton’s lecture books on Complex Analysis to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations and thousands more of just math papers. 

Because of this, I have my eyes set on places like MIT and universities of that genre. Here is where things get tough for me. 

- I am currently attending my local community college part time because I can only afford to take 1 class at a time (yes I missed the financial aid deadlines too #megaOof)

- I plan to go full time to my community college next September because by then I will have filled out the financial aid stuff for Fall of 2019. I will complete an Associates degree there. Luckily I have a 4.0 GPA so far

- When I graduated High School I only had a 3.4 GPA which isn’t at all impressive for schools like MIT. 

- Also the MIT acceptance rate for transfer students is significantly lower than it is for freshman applicants. And as many know, the acceptance rate for freshman applicants is already low. Like 7% ish


So putting everything together gives the following situation. 1) I’ll have to transfer to a school once I complete an Associates. 2) MIT (if accepted) would have to place me as a sophomore because they don’t give out second Associates degrees and 3) for other schools (non MIT), I really wished I had gotten something higher like a 3.8 GPA. 

Essentially I’m hitting myself because if I had just turned in all of my work and if I had actually met the application deadlines, my entire future would have been different in a positive way. Instead, I’m out here slaying away at work 13 hours a day at minimum wage hoping for September to come so that I can go to school full time. 

So my questions are, 

• Is there any hope for me still getting into MIT somehow or should I wait and apply there when I apply for grad school?

• Is there any chance of me getting into a great mathematics school with only a 3.4 GPA?

• How do I handle my regrets and past actions?


Thank you!

180,"I've posted about these problems before on reddit, but this is my first time compiling it all into one post so i'm sorry if it's too long.

I'm a 17 year old female, in my senior year of high school. I live in a small town, with the option of one other public school in the area. I go to school with my younger brother (15), who is much more popular than me (he has his own problems).

I was bullied for several months in grade 8 by my close friends. I dropped out to study online for grade 9, and have been going to the same school, as my grade 8 year, for the past 3 years. 

I haven't had any friends for the past couple of years, partly due to the town and my own social problems. I had been talking to other students in my classes, however, once in a while. This year I've been completely isolated, being that i'm taking less ""forced group project"" classes. I rarely speak to anyone while at school, other than occasionally my brother. 

I suffer from social anxiety and depression, although it's been my anxiety that's really affected me lately. I've seen a counsellor in the past, and am trying medication for the first time. 

I would like advice for two problems I have, if it's not too much to ask. 

1. How do I get through the next couple of months? Even just hearing that I have to simply stick it out would help.
2. Prom and graduation season is coming up, and my parents want me to go. With no friends or anyone to even ask, is there a point?

181,"This is stupid. I moved back to my mother’s house after graduating from a university. I’m also looking for a full-time job so I can just get out of here.

Anyways my eldest sister, who will be 31 this year, has also moved back. The reason is that my mother and eldest sister are codependent on each other.

Every single damn day, they watch a TV and raise the volume high enough where I could hear it from my bedroom upstairs. I often ask them to lower the volume otherwise neighbors could complain. We live in a semi-detached house.

They’re not deaf so they can certainly hear how loud the TV is. On the other hand, when I’m watching TV, I put it on mute. I’m deaf so I don’t need any volume and my family gives me shit for it because I need to “practice” listening.

183,"So there's this guy that I met 3 years ago that's constantly leading me on. I see him every summer because we work the same place, but it wasn't until the 2nd year that I started to get to know him. He invited me to dinner with some of our friends/co-workers and they told me that sometimes they fool around with each other and basically asked if I wanted to join their orgy and said ""you look like you'd be a good time."" He immediately apologized after I was like wtf dude and last summer even took the time to thank me for accepting him and all the stuff he got into last year. 

Anyways it's like there's two sides to him. On one hand he's really sweet to me. He always invites me out with his friends/suggests we hang out, helps me out, offers his stuff up if I don't have mine, and is kind of a show off when I'm around. I've caught him staring at me a bunch of times and he always hugs me when I leave his house. Lmao he does stuff like picks lent out of my hair when he sees it and one time he sent me this long apology because i was telling him about how i broke my foot and he accidentally said ""that's cool.""

On the other hand though sometimes he can kind of be a jerk. He's called me a bitch a lot, not out of anger, but just kind of joking around. And even though my girlfriends and I toss that word around I'm not used to guys doing it idk. He ignores me somedays and can be really dry when he wants to. Usually though he apologizes for stuff but i just have no idea what's going on with him!

&amp;#x200B;

We're in high school if that helps any and he got a girl friend at the end of last summer, even though I'm pretty sure he's single now. Is all of this irrelevant and I'm just seeing things where they're not because I have a crush? What's going on???",07Jan2019,1

186,"I'll start off by saying that my husband and I have been together for 10 years. When we first got married my family was against it and one of my closest friends begged me not to go through with it, because they were concerned about my well-being. 

At the start of our relationship there were a lot of things that if I were entering a new relationship now, I would see as red flags and never put up with. People close to me expressed to me many times that he was not treating me well and that they were worried about me. At one point the same friend who begged me not to marry him said that she felt I should get a divorce. 

TO CLARIFY:
He's never been abusive or an objectively bad person. This is what has made it difficult for me to discern whether things were that bad or not on many occasions. He's never hurt me. He's never been controlling of me. He's not a name-caller or someone who intimidates me. Never cheated on me. He's just... kind of an asshole a lot of the time. 

I love my husband. He does a lot of nice things for me. I can have deep conversations with him, he listens, he cares about me. He is capable of being thoughtful,nurturing, and wonderful company. In many ways my parents like him and they have established a good relationship. It's also worth mentioning that my husband has also, within the past year, gone to therapy both individually and as a couple to help resolve some issues. I have seen that he at least *tries* to an extent... and some things are considerably better than they used to be. 

BUT. This is also someone who will yell at me over getting a parking ticket, drive aggressively in a way that makes me anxious, who will make ""jokes"" at my expense even when I have asked him not to and pointed out that it actually hurts my feelings and sometimes it's crossing a line. Somebody who will be irritable with me for absolutely no reason that I can tell. Who will take it out on me by being short tempered whenever something else is going wrong in his life. Who during our worst argument has punched a hole in the wall and spat at the ground in front of me, thrown things, etc. 

This isn't a secret. My family knows. Our therapist(s) know it happened. That level of shit was a pretty extreme example and it's never happened since (this was 6 mos ago). Like I said he at least tries some. He'll complain about going to therapy, but he'll go. I'm trying to stick by him and work on things. I always try to be accommodating and do MY share, though even he will say that he doesn't have any complaints about me, I'm not the problem, etc. He'll be the first to admit he's been the cause of our issues. 

Sometimes I wonder if he's incredibly immature in some ways. Idk if it's that, or a personality flaw, anger issues. I don't know if he'll ever REALLY improve to the point where these things aren't a significant issue. I find a lot of the time as much as I love him I'm not happy because he makes me feel like shit over minuscule things. It's hard to constantly be around someone who's in a bad mood and treats you like everything is your fault. 

Don't really know what to do at this point in my life. ",07Jan2019,1

188,"Okay so. I have had problems with drug and alcohol abuse for like the past four or five years of my life, I'm 20 now. A lot of this stems, I believe, from my mother's mental health and drug issues. It's been an ongoing struggle but because of all of that, I made the decision a year ago once and for all to use drugs and alcohol more responsibly and after that I chose to end contact with my mom because she refuses to seek help for her own issues which was obviously a really hard choice to make. I have been doing really well in my own recovery, I haven't touched anything stronger than coffee or kratom and if and when I do drink, it's in total moderation. I feel like I built a lot of will power and self-esteem. In an effort to better my life and escape the pain of my family, I even moved a thousand miles away from my hometown. I got a job cleaning house for an older woman and sometimes I house sit for her, as I am doing right now during the holidays. 

The problem actually began over Christmas, I'm all alone in this house and it's my first year away from my mom. Christmas, my mom's birthday, the anniversary of our last contact, and my birthday all happened in about a span of a week here and I didn't handle it well at all. Feeling incredibly lonely, I did manage to reach out to friends and an online therapist during this time but I also would have a beer or two at night, nothing crazy. One night, I got really bad insomnia, something I also struggle with when I'm really emotional, and I looked for sleeping pills in the house. In her bedside table, I found morphine tablets (opiates were definitely my doc). I don't know why I didn't just ignore them and forget about it, I have stayed in the house before and feel like I've even come across them in the past. There were 48 pills in the bottle and I took about half of them over the course of two days I spent alone in the house. I kept trying over and over to not touch them or think about them, but I didn't. I feel absolutely terrible and ashamed about this. 

I feel like there is no way she wouldn't notice or care and even if she did, I really respect the woman I work for and I can't lie to her. She has done so much for me, she's even provided a letter of recommendation for my college app. How do I bring this up to her? How do I tell her the truth without burdening her with my whole life story? How do I give her room to be angry at me and not make this all about my emotions? I feel awful.

195,"Basically, I had a really rough semester last semester. 

My grades were fine- three A's and one B- but I was so mentally and emotionally exhausted by the end, and it was super hard to get those grades, not because of the classwork as much as it was my total inability to focus on any task for an extended period of time. I could barely sit still, which isn't terribly surprising given I have restless leg syndrome, but nothing would make it stop. Eventually, the physical feeling of restlessness became paired with a feeling of impending doom. It got worse in the evenings and some days it was like the sun going down flipped some sort of switch in my brain to enter panic mode. But it didn't only happen during the evenings. I could just be walking across campus and I'd suddenly see images of terrible things happening and feel like I was going to die. 

I found that counting calmed me down. I'd count the bricks in my dorm room. I'd count my steps. I have hockey cards and I'd count those. 

I've also dealt with repeated thoughts of terrible things happening to myself, strangers, and loved ones, but it's gotten worse recently. Same with repeated thoughts of myself committing terrible acts to myself, loved ones, and strangers that I'd never actually do. I can usually ignore it, but there have been some particularly bad ones recently.

But the issue is, how do you tell what's something everyone eventually goes through and what's something that's worth talking a mental health professional about? Because my parents (I'm 20 and in college if that's relevant) have always acted like I exaggerate, even including physical health issues (I have trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, restless leg syndrome, and GERD), and also act like another problem would be both ridiculous and another inconvenience to everyone, it's kind of difficult for me to tell when something I perceive to be a problem genuinely merits looking into.

196," 

This is a long post to get comfy. All the backstory is essential to my problem with fulfillment. Be patient.

I lived with my Mom since the age of 8, when my parents divorced. I grew up with her and started Taekwondo in my freshmen year of highschool. Ever since I began I always loved it. I would go 3-4 times a week for 1-2 hours each day. Everyday that I went, I always wanted to work harder than the last. I wanted to push past every boundary that I could find within myself mentally and physically. My Master saw this in me and pushed me to become a very good student. After a year of training (I was about half way to blackbelt), he offered me a position as a part-time instructor. For anyone who is fluent in marital arts, THIS WAS NO MCDOJO. My Master was born and raised in south Korea and came to America and began this dojang. All black belts were well deserved of their titles and my Master was no exception. So obviously I had shown some promise in his eyes. I accepted and started coming 4-5 times a week. It was often that I would have to come in at 3:30 while my school started at 3:00. I did not have a car so I would rush home after school (walking but awkwardly fast) and make myself something to eat. Usually I would have just enough time to finish eating and arrive to the dojang on time. I did not have a car at this time which made getting a ride difficult at times, but I always seemed to manage a way to get there. On the days I would come in at 4:20, I would always make sure to come in at 4:00 to be there early before any kids showed up. Sometimes my Master would have me train with him for the short time there was before the kids began to show. With being an instructor I had to know a lot of information as well as being able to teach it. I soon began to learn that this was something I loved just as much as training. Everyday I would do my best to teach the kids discipline, respect, hardwork, and precision with their training. This rubbed off on myself when I would be training as well. Constantly finding errors in what I was doing. I soon became obsessed with perfecting my craft. This cycle of training and teaching went until I was 2 belts away from black belt (about 2 1/2 years into Taekwondo). I became very depressed after a recent breakup and found myself going less and less often. One day I just became so overwhelmed in shame depression... I stopped going. Bad things led from this point. I got into drugs and a lot of interpersonal conflicts with myself as well as others. I found myself a point where I never thought I would be. Taekwondo always kept me grounded and focused. But now I was lost. Fast forward to my summer of Junior year (about to become a senior). During these years I was working with my Fathers business (since my parents divorce, the court had ordered that every weekend I had to visit my dad. He lived about an hour away so you can imagine the drive after 8 years lol) So during these weekends I began to become involved with his businesses, but it was never something I found myself deeply interested in. One Summer day my father sat me in a room and told me ""Son you have to decide what you want."" He explained how many opportunities I had through his businesses and how I could not continue any further from living an hour away. If I wanted to exploit the opportunities that were available, I would have to move with him. Living an hour away is a HUGE barrier to business. Over the course of a few days I thought of my options. At this time I was still a big drug user. I was over my ex but the constant use of drugs kept me depressed. Living with my Mother was doing no good for me. I had bad friends who did nothing but do drugs so a fresh start was exactly what I needed. I chose to move with my father. I am currently in my last year of highschool living with him now. At a new school, in a new city, new everything. All that aside, I am working with his 2 businesses and we are currently in the process of creating another. But everyday I work on these tast I don't find myself fulfilled. Everyone tells me ""Do what you love"" or ""Be passionate about your work."" Don't get me wrong I enjoy it. But i don't find myself in the mindset that I was in while I was in Taekwondo. I believe that was a taste of passion that could fill my soul. I would always want to improve and work harder. But with business I do not have the same mindset anywhere near that. I'm confused on what I should feel. I obviously have good things going for me on this path, but I don't feel like this is where I should be. I'm lost and in need of advice. If you made it to the end I really appreciate it. I was feeling stressed and wanted to vent, hopefully someone reads this. Goodnight... also i'm not proof reading it so mind the typos.",07Jan2019,1
197,"So it all started with me accidentally finding some pictures of his friends in bikinis on his phone, of course I asked him about it and at first he acted as if he had never seen those before, which very clearly he had. I insisted and after a lot of bad lying, he admitted that he was horny so he used the pictures to jerk off, but he was also kinda drunk when he did it so I didn't find it so awful. Men are weird, and drunk people do stupid shit so I understood and only asked him not to use pictures of girls we both know (because the girls were his friends but are also kind of my friends as well), and also asked him to be more honest with me, since he lied when I confronted him.
Now he's admitted that he jerks off to his friends' pictures often, about 15 times, (maybe more, when I asked the names of the girls he said there were “too many of them”), in a period of 7 months. It shocked me, as a woman I don't think I've ever masturbates to a picture of any guy friend I know, let alone a MUTUAL guy friend, so before I go all crazy on him, I want to make sure if this is an abnormal behavior.
It made me feel incredibly sad, since I don't have the highest self esteem, but again, I know guys are fucking gross sometimes so, is it normal for him to do this? I ask the guys of reddit for help, and the girls to tell me if this has happened to you, and how did you manage it?",07Jan2019,1
198,"I spent a lot of time making money to move out of the small town I grew up in. I made about $5,000, turned 18, and moved from Atlanta to California. 

I don’t dislike it here, it’s great and my sister is close to me. However, I realized that my # 1 priority was education. I am super ambitious and with this move I put off college by about 2 years.

201,"TL:DR: My friend has shown to be rather lazy with anger issues, and I'm having cold-feet about moving out with him alone. I don't know if I'm overreacting to this, but him leaving us in the dust to do the bond clean just another dude and I has peeved me to the point that makes me think while I may like him as a friend, I don't like him as a housemate.

 

I'm having second thoughts of moving out with a good friend of mine so I want to get some context and see whats the right decision, because to be frank I can see them both being bad.

I have the option to move into a 5 bedroom house with some good friends, that I'm not as close with for cheap and near my university. I can see it being really good for me to go there because it would make my life very easy to live and keep my socially active while working and at uni.

My other option is to move out with my one friend, who vouched for me to move into the house I'm currently renting with 4 different blokes and leaving very soon, who I've become better buds with.

My problem is I told my friend I'd move out with him we both have temporary places to stay for 1-2 months, but mine, the 5 bedroom house, could be a permanent option I could take.

reasons for going with him are first off I told him I'd move out with him. He's done me a couple of favours here and there vouched for me at this new house and had a lot of heartfelt talks with me. He's really done a lot of big favours for me or been there in big moments and I told him I'd move out with him and I was keen for it until I recently.

Recently we had to move out of this house and look for a new place that means a huge bond clean. Now that we have a huge bond clean for the 2 years of near 8 different people living in this house with no yard maintenance done in those two years and a piles of shit we've accumulated as students he's buggered off for a month to somewhere else and won't return until literally two days before the professional bond clean we have scheduled comes in. So basically there is a shit ton of work to do and he's fucked off, with some valid reasons to catch up with family, for a month while me and one other roommate sort out this house that previously had 5 people + 3 girlfriends living in it. I've been told he basically fucked off last lease as well at the end of the bond clean doing almost the exact same thing. Now whether this is malicious or not isn't the point it just seems like such an outstanding lack of self awareness. He's done things like this before, like during the time when it was just me and him living at the house because of the holidays I had a ruptured disc and could barely move and I was doing more cleaning than when we had the three other people there and all the cooking for us both because we agreed to share meals to save time and energy. So basically for a month I spent slaving around the house with a fucked back and he didn't seem to realize i was a bit fucking grumpy about it from lack of self awareness. Now I'm not perfect either after those holidays I had to get a new job so got a real shit job i could do with a fucked back and did it for like 4 months to make enough money to survive, get work experience, and enough money to rehabilitate myself later. During this time I won't lie I became a bit of slob and a bit unpleasant it wasn't a fun job to do for around 40 hours a week with a fucked back while doing school full time, but that doesn't excuse my behavior so he isn't the only person with problems I definitely am not great all the time and especially for that period. I also find myself becoming more like him and he has some very extreme views and is a bit misogynistic and I can see that coming out in how I talk from time with him. I just feel I become a worse person with him around and his lack of self awareness really irks me the wrong way, one of our other roommates said he's lived with him for three years and if you can change him I'd be surprised or if he does anything with his time he'd be surprised. I just find myself falling into a trap of being way too anti-social with him, picking up his ideologies which I don't want, and smoking way too much weed with him which is a serious problem on top of his continuing trend of being good for not doing much at all.

Now you may ask why not talk to him about this? Well that's another problem he has some serious anger issues if you talk to him. I beat him in a game of NBA 2k once and his reaction was ripping the arm off his chair and smashing a hole in his desk. He just has a continuing trend of just anger when things don't seem to go his way, and honestly I am not a fan of it. I've tried talking to him reasonably about his anger, but it hasn't been much a difference he just says how good it feels to be angry sometimes. I get it I'm competitive too, but I can feel that anger pass on to me sometimes because you become like the people you spend most of your time with.

I'm really torn whether to stick with him or not. I don't know how he'll react if I say no, but we both at least have to move into temporary accommodation for a month or two so I can see where it goes from there.

On the other hand this guy has been a good friend to me in more serious instances and we've talked about moving out together for ages, but that bond situation is kinda the straw that broke the camels back for me that just shows I may be lighting myself on fire to keep someone else warm.

I don't want anyone to think I'm perfect. I Know for sure I'm not and maybe I'm just blowing this out of proportion because I'm grumpy as about the shit ton of bond cleaning for the house and yard. He has honestly had very good, deep emotional, and important talks with me and done big favours for me here and there, its just a lot of the little things seem to make for something to would change me into someone I don't want to be.",07Jan2019,1

Me(M19)
Her(Mid 20s?)


So I’ve been working at my job for almost a year now and recently I found myself infatuated with this woman at my job. She’s been there longer than I have and I must say the few times where we talked made me love her personality. I’ve done a few favors for her which led to us getting acquainted. We joke with each other in each of our encounters and just seeing her smile makes me adore her even more. I want to get to know her better but I feel the age gap would make it very awkward for her and probably me as well. I know I shouldn’t confess to her because 

1:it’s a workplace 

And 2: if the feeling isn’t mutual, it’ll damage our current relationship 

What would you guys do? 


To be short, I’m a 19 year old male who has a deep interest in an adult woman(mid20s)

So my SO and I don’t come from great families. It takes a lot of hard work for us just to get by. For my SO it’s always been so much harder. 

We’ve been together for 2 years and I love them so much, but the stability of their financial situation is constantly in free fall...and it’s draining. I feel so bad saying that because you’re never supposed to love anyone based on their wallet. But every week I swear there’s some new catastrophe that we need to address because of their financial situation. Life with them is constantly worrying about money, wondering if they can afford xyz, making sure they’re eating, always trying to think up of new solutions and budgets and ways around issues that never seem to stop popping up. It’s so emotionally draining. I feel drained and like a husk sometimes, but it’s good knowing I helped my SO avoid a disaster. I know they appreciate it beyond words.

A lot of times I feel like all my energy and effort is put into them. I sometimes feel I don’t have much left in me for anything else...which is bad. I’ve let my mental and physical health slip, my grades in college slip, and after putting another fire out I feel like just laying in bed and going to sleep and never getting up again (but I obviously have to). 
Maybe it’s the fact that I’m constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop when things are going too smoothly for too long a period of time that’s wearing me down so much...but the other shoe ALWAYS drops. I feel like I’m rotting from the inside out, but if I don’t help things often go to shit and they go to shit fast. If I was in my SOs situation I would love any help I could get...and because their family is awful normally I’m the only support  they’ll ever get. Plus even though im not in good financial shape either...it’s still better than constant free fall to constant unpredictable things. It would be so selfish of me to say “sorry, I can’t help” or “I’m not going to help as extensively as I can” when I have some of the means to do so. If I have time on my hands it means I should be helping out, right? 
I’m  so conflicted, I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless, but I shouldn’t because I need to be grateful that I’m in a better situation than some other people and dating my SO has revealed that to me. I want a little piece of me back or to not look in the mirror and wonder why I look so tired and exhausted all the time or what the heck happened to my body.

210,"Hey guys,

So this has been an issue for basically the last 7 years. My younger cousin (now 13) is XXY positive and very clearly so. He’s taller than the rest of my family already, and pretty much hairless with less muscle development than other kids his age. Here is where the worry and uncertainty starts for me; he is also extremely overweight (waist size 38) and has the mental maturity of a child much younger than him. I do not know enough about XXY to understand if this is normal or not, but there are so many red flags that keep popping up. For example; just a few days ago I accidentally stepped on his shoelace and he got very flustered when I asked him to tie them up again (he said he didn’t know how). Now, I know that he might have some coordination issues but could this be just my aunt “babying” him? (She ties them for him and he’s even expressed that he knows how to do it, just prefers not to). She insists that he can’t do certain things such as zip his jacket or button up his shirt without assistance because of XXY.

My cousin, although undoubtedly smart and kind, is behind on education. This, I believe, also contributes to his mental immaturity as he is only exposed to kids younger than him. He goes to a school with “kids with problems” (my cousin’s own words) where he seems happy yet in my opinion unstimulated. In this school there is little to no physical activity, several age groups are put together, and he is the oldest kid in the entire school by at least a full year.

Whenever I confront my aunt about what I’m seeing, she seems to use this syndrome as an excuse. So I’m asking for help in understanding if this is truly a reason for his behavior and shortcomings, or if she is using it as an excuse.

If anyone could direct me to success stories, any steps to take to help my cousin, or helpful information about XXY, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

Thank you for taking the time to read this!",07Jan2019,1

I have had a weird couple of years since i broke up with a manipulative ex. She had me stop talking to my friends, and tried to distance me from my family. I realized the problem after my sister made an offhand comment about how she didn't like my ex. This isn't what the post is about though, its just a bit of context. I don't even know if its relevent at all, i just think about the situation, and her more than i should. I don't think i like her, even as a friend, but i'm still in love with the memory and the idea of her, despite all the stupid shit she put me through. 

Since the breakup, i have had really high ups, and days where i pathetically mope around and just be a jackass to my remaining friends. The entire time i'm moping around, i think to myself that i'm just pretending for attention, or that i'm only doing anything because i think somebody will talk to me. It's pathetic and i don't know why i do ANY of it. the moping, or the self criticizing and doubting. When i have any sort of problem, i think i'm blowing it out of proportion or overreacting. its like i'm trying to call myself out on bullshit, despite it i can't stop the behavior. its like i'm calling myself an attention whore in my head, but i can't do anything about it. And i don't know if any of my problems are real or if i'm just trying to pity MYSELF. 

over the last 3 months my sister was taken to the hospital for being suicidal 3 times. the stays last between a week, or a weekend. but the first time it happened i got all mopey and depressed. I kept telling myself i was just trying to get pity, but when somebody asked me about where my sister was, or why i was acting so sad. i just shrugged it off and made a stupid joke. The 3rd time she was taken i was on a week long high, and i almost didn't even notice that she left. i was so happy about everything. people asked me where my sister was, and i remembered that i should feel sad but i wasn't. 

When i'm having a really good day, like a high, everything is great, and i ignore all my problems and i have unlimited motivation. i workout i focus and take actual notes in classes. and then its over, within an hour, and i'm either completely numb and neutral towards everything, or i'm depressed and i don't shower for a couple days because i can't make myself care about it. 

While i'm writing this i question the legitimacy of everything i write, because i'm trying to get karma or some stupid shit. but i KNOW that i'm not because i made an alt account because i don't want this to follow me.

i'm an 18 yr old male in my senior year of high school. I shouldn't have problems like this because i'm going to have to live on my own in a year and a half. I shouldn't be as mentally weak as i described above. I hate myself, and i hate myself for hating myself.",07Jan2019,1

213,"
btw it’s a long story. 

{prologue} 
So this high school year (sophomore) started out just like last year’s. I had a couple friends that i had from freshman year, life was good, etc. I’m a kinda tall, kinda overweight class clown and I don’t really care what people think about me as a person. I’ve showed it multiple times that I’m a “don’t give a shit” kinda person, and I don’t get too stressed out about things. Mostly personal reasons, but that’s besides the point. My friends kinda made fun of me last year, get this, for not being able to get a girl on my Snapchat. Which I didn’t. I’ll admit. But I didn’t really give a shit about it. I didn’t care about it because it wasn’t important to me. 
At all. I had enough shit to deal with just attending the school that freshman drama didn’t affect me nearly at all. 


I haven’t even gotten to the good part. 


Once sophomore year had rolled around, there was this tradition of the upperclassmen to, I don’t wanna say harass, but kinda fuck with the newcomers. To see what grinds their gears, and pick out who the decent freshman are. The usual. I just took the opportunity to talk to new people, because my class was boring as shit. 


This is all in my perspective, I guarantee it will happen to next years freshman. 


About 1/3 into the first quarter, I had a few freshman friends. It might be good to note that I fuck with the entire school, because of the small community. Freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. I even know some of last years graduates. 


At this point, still have no girl in my Snapchat. Yes, this is a reoccurring theme in the story. 


One of my freshman friends, we’ll call him E, gave another freshman girl my snap. She just fucking showed up in my contacts one day.  We’ll call her Z.

I didn’t know this at the time, but apparently E “””bragged””” to Z about me? I don’t know what conversation they had. I just heard it down the grapevine. 

Z came up to me during lunch and said hi. I said hi back, nervously trying to stir my bowl of ramen. We talked about I don’t even remember. And then went on with our days. 

Eventually, we talked more and more throughout the months, and became pretty chill around each other. It got to the point where my friends would jokingly say “ when u gonna ask her out?” “you two dating yet?” But I really had no intentions on dating her, simply because she would probably turn me down most likely than not. So we stayed friends. 

I don’t remember exactly how or why, but I got my phone taken away two weeks before Z’s quinceanera. I had no idea it was two weeks away, because she sent me an invite through Snapchat( oh yea and I got her snap) and she never mentioned it until literally the day before. 
I got my phone back after I went to the party and holy shit it was a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be. She had a pool (I kept my shirt on for personal reasons, not just because  I was overweight) she had food, cake drinks, loud ass music, it was a full on fucking party. I was not expecting this shit from a freshman. I had to lie to my parents to convince them to let me go. A couple other good friends of mine were there, too. The party was a lot of fun, in a nutshell. When it got really late, me and a couple other people were invited to spend the night so we could get more food and do stupid shit. I stayed, cuz why not. I don’t remember that much past 11, but Z says I made her laugh until she fell on the floor so, cool I guess. 

My friends and her friends still talk about that party to this day. I had little groups of friends that she would follow me around in, and TRIED TO BREAK ME APART FROM.

ringadingding juicy part of the story incoming

This one time, me and her went to our schools football game, cuz I didn’t have shit to do at home. I swear on my entire existence I hear her  quietly say “aren’t you going to flirt with me?” I shit you not the millisecond those words entered my ears I turned and said “WHAT?”  She just looks me and says “Nothing”.  As if  Z controls time and expects me to unhear those words. I forgot about it.  Another instance, I’ve been to the movies with her and two other friends (shit went down between the other two people lol) and people who weren’t even fucking remotely involved with the event try and tell it to me like we went on some romantic date or some shit. Another time I went over to her house to hang out, because there’s nothing to at my house. We went into the garage and she showed her hover board (get your mind out of the fucking gutter).  I’m shit at riding hover boards, so I didn’t really wanna get on it. I don’t know how it got to this point, but she had me stand at one end of the garage, while she went at full speed towards me. One time, okay haha funny, second time, she told me not to flinch, while she’s speeding toward me at 30mph. Stupidly, I said ok. It ended up with her literally half a fucking millimeter away from me, us both facing towards each other, me shaking to the point where every bone in my body dislocates, and then we just laugh it off. A bit of a fucking eyebrow raiser is it not? Meanwhile, she had to actually go on her snap and explain that we are not dating, and me almost doing the same thing. That’s how fucked the situation is rn. 



I don’t know what to think. Is she just really friendly? Is she trying to get with me? I’m confused. I’m scared. Help.

Oh also i suddenly I have my entire schools female population’s snap for some odd reason.  

Fr tho I’m confused someone help.

214,"Hello, I am currently a freshman from California attending Louisiana State University on my second semester. Sorry if this is long but I feel I must get it off my chest.  I have had a really tough time having a good college experience and fell into a deep depression last semester impacting all aspects of my life.  I struggled with making any good friends, even after my first semester I have no one to hang out with, I think this may be because I haven't had to make friends since my early elementary years and have always been a fairly shy person.  I tried reaching out to multiple people but they usually  don't share any of my interests and drift away.  I enjoy gaming and watching movies as well as listening to all types of music, and don't drink any alcohol or participate in any drug related activities as I wish to become a police officer after college and have decided to be completely drug and alcohol free my whole life.  I have been happily with my girlfriend for quiet some time and she is currently living in California so I often miss her as well.  My roommate can be quite unruly, he refuses to do anything with headphones in and often calls his girlfriend around 2 in the morning on speaker, he also plays fortnite late into the hours when he isn't out getting loaded, often stumbling into the room loudly and turning the lights on after. I want to enjoy my time on campus and make this semester the best I can. If there is any tips or ideas anyone would like to share that might make my experience better, please feel free to share.

216,"Recently I have ben stuck in the middle of friends in my friend group falling out with another friend who I am sympathetic to.  I will refer to this friend as Larry. 

Past Info: The reason they don't like Larry is because  Jame's girlfriend Katherine finds him to be racist and misogynistic. In the past she has been offended by his obsession with Japanese culture without having an understanding of it, and saying slightly off putting racist things but in a joking manner like for instance: using a fake asian accent. After a year or two of not saying anything to him, she sent him a facebook message telling him that she doesn't want to be friend's, and the only reason she will ever be around him is because he is friends with her boyfriend James.  (James, Larry and I have been best friends for years, and they were really close.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that happened about two years ago and since then it has blown over and we have all started to hang out again. We were never sure if she just forgave him or let it go. James and Katherine live in New York and on facebook group chat invited my girlfriend, me and Larry to stay at their apartment for a week and experience new york. Everything is going fine until one night we go to a restaurant for dessert. According to Katherine, Larry saw a waitress he thought was hot and said so to the table. She saw the waitress hear him and look back at our table uncomfortably. Larry did not mean for the waitress to hear this and I think the comment was slimeballey but still pretty tame. I did not see or hear this as I was enjoying a delicious piece of carrot cake mmmm. I also did not hear what happened next. Katherine scolded Larry in front of the whole table and told him never to do that again. Larry sat there with what I can only describe as a ""white people smile"", straight mouthed, (look it up i can't describe it) and shook his head up and down in embarrassed acknowledgment. On the way home it Me and my girlfriend, Katherine and Larry were all sitting on a bench waiting for the subway car. Larry was sitting in quiet anger looking down and shaking his leg impatiently like he was trying to tell himself not to explode. 

Katherine: Is everything okay Larry, do you want to tell us what's wrong?

Larry: Yeah you're and asshole and I don't want to talk to you! (Imagine him being angry grrr)

Everyone stopped talking and the ride back was really awkward. Now remember we are staying in Katherine and Jame's apartment so it was an awkward situation that Larry was angry and ignoring Katherine. The next day Larry, my gf and I are sitting in a pizza place and discussing the situation. My gf tells Larry that he needs to apologize or find another place to stay. Larry says he does not want to apologize, but we tell him it would just make the rest of the trip easier. My girlfriend told me later that Katherine told her she always hated Larry, and that while he has been better than in the past, she and James will not talk to him after the New York trip ever again. I asked my girlfriend later why Katherine and James even invited Larry if Katherine has always hated him so much, and gf told me Katherine said she wanted Larry to come because he is my friend and I would be sad if he wasn't there which is kind of ridiculous. Larry never apologized for the rest of the trip but again this was all kind of ignored and blown off the rest of the week.

When we all come down to Florida for Christmas break after NY, gf and I hang with Katherine and James multiple times. James will have a New Years party at his house but I am told Larry can't come because Jame's parents do not like him. (unrelated reasons) I wonder if James just doesn't want to tell me he doesn't like Larry anymore, and is using his parents dislike for Larry as an excuse. James tells me at the party he doesn't hate Larry. I wonder if he is just appeasing Katherine to an extent. He is angry that Larry didn't apologize and still stayed at the apartment though.  

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't talk to Larry all break and I don't think he found out we all hung out without him, but he left the facebook group chat this week. I feel like it can be pretty horrible to feel like you have lost all your friends at the same time, which is what Larry must be thinking. To be invited over to New York by someone who still hates you only to be ignored by one of the hosts for most of the trip, and to be screamed at for something kind of insignificant in front of all of his friends even though she could have taken him aside. Should I talk to him? Should I tell him we are still friends and I just can't control who Katherine and James invite to things? Should I totally stop being his friend? ",07Jan2019,1

236,"He said he doesn’t have the same feelings anymore, which is understandable. It happens, people fall in and out of love. I cried obviously, he was also my first boyfriend/love. I honestly feel so relieved in a way though, because now I feel free. 

He made me so sad so often. He is a nice guy, but he really was just not a good boyfriend. I ignored it though, because I loved him. He would shame me so often for my likes and interests, it made me feel awful. Especially because I always worked around his interests. It’s absolutely one of the most horrible feelings giving so much and just not receiving it. I think I went though the break up in our relationship though. We also did long distance, so that was really hard. 

What I’m saying is, is it wrong for me to feel some sort of relief now after crying? I feel like a part of me has come back. After being so depressed/ doubting myself / lonely, I feel confident again. I already want to go out and meet new guys/ talk to more people. My adventurous side that I felt he was taking away for so long is back. I feel confident, which is amazing. I feel like a new door is opened. I don’t know, if anyone else has ever felt this way, please let me know. I’m still obviously sad about the break up, but I feel so good right now at the same time. ",07Jan2019,1

238,"So, I’ve been working at this forever 21 knock off retail store for a little over a month. The policy there is weirdly ridiculous, as they’re very strict on dress code and also certain other things I don’t find very necessary or productive. 
Anyway, the problems start from the moment I came in to start my onboarding online paperwork (w-4, payroll, forms to sign, etc) and the store manager asks if I can work that same day of the blue.  I accept, but dress code and store policies were never discussed. I get a write up warning for coming a week later wearing name brand shoes, for which I had no idea about. First actual write up is for wearing leggings to work. Second write up is very understandable and I’m not upset because I deserved it. I was 2 hours later to my shift, yeah okay I deserve it. So I have 2 write ups and the third means termination. 
From the beginning I decided to keep my job hunt going, because already I have an uneasy feeling about this new job. I get an offer as a bank teller, and I start on the 16th. Okay nice, I give me week notice yesterday. 
Now, yesterday I was put on register and they will give you a write up for being short or over on the cash register. I ended up being $9 over and I have no idea how. Today, I’m told I might get a 3rd write up for being over $9 on the register, which would maybe mean I will be fired. 
I’m leaving this company anyway, but I also don’t want to get fired because then that would mean I’ve gotten fired from a job (which has never happened before). 

Should I just quit now to avoid getting fired despite my week notice ? 
Or should I just let myself get “fired”? 
Technically nobody is sure, as it’s up to my store manager to decide if she wants to terminate me even though I’m already leaving. ",07Jan2019,1
239,"I'm a 19 year old guy. I've always been shy throughout my life. Six months ago, I signed up for a retail job. At my job I mostly stock shelves but a few times throughout the day I serve customers food one-on-one at the store's deli counter. I've seen most of my colleagues get gift cards/awards/praise for being so amicable and friendly to customers. I've always tried to make conversation as well as being as helpful as I can to customers and have yet to receive any positive comments. There's been a handful of times where I managed to get a good connection going, but most of the time my conversations/interactions with customers fall flat.

I feel discouraged because I want to switch to a job that will get me even *more* exposure to people to break me out of my shell and increase my social skills. But considering how I am now with talking to customers just several times throughout the day, I feel like I'd fail miserably if I was to do it all day. I feel no more skilled at talking to customers at my current job then the first day I walked through the door. I'd like to do anything from working in a mall clothing store to a sales job. Problem is, these jobs openly state how social skills/outgoing personalities are mandatory. I really want to improve, but when I look at what's happened so far I wonder if that's possible.

242,"Hello - Throwaway Account.

My ""problem"" is unique that over my years of working I have accumulated enough money where if I was to stop working right now, I would have enough to live on (Comfortably) for the next year and a half, give or take. While that's not a massive amount of time, it's still a while away. I do have a part-time job, however that's on holiday for the next month or so. 


I spend my days playing games, browsing the internet etc as in the back of my mind it's ""Got enough money, don't need to work"" when in reality eventually it will run out. I'm pretty lucky in the sense that when I go for job interviews, I even got a text the other day where someone wants to hire me. I'm fairly confident I can get a job (Although take nothing for granted it's just finding the motivation in the first place because right now I don't really need to.


Does anyone have any ideas on how I can motivate myself? I'm floating the idea of moving slightly out of town for new surroundings etc.

243,"Time to explain. I've been in high school for close to two and a half years, and ever since i started, my scholarly skills have been kind of in a limbo. Ever since i started in high school my grades have been much worse than when i was in ground school. I also had to redo my second year due to failing grades. RIGHT NOW I don't have horrible grades, but they're certainly not improving the way i want them to either, and ultimately i can't help but feel like there's no point to continuing on like this. I also don't feel like i can dig out the motivation to actually learn anything new. 

I've entertained the idea of dropping out and getting a job instead so i can begin supporting myself rather than wasting my time with something that ultimately doesn't make me happy, but here's the thing: That would mean giving up on a dream of becoming a video game developer. And there's only a year and a half left of my current educational level, until i plan to take at least one sabbat year, and then begin to go to college so i can pursue a higher level of education.

In case of TL;DR, i have two choices. I can drop out and begin to search for a job, ultimately ending this endless limbo of feeling like i'm wasting my time, OR, persist for the last year and a half, take a sabbat year or two, and then get back into it with a fresh start so i can pursue my dreams.

246,"Using a throw away account.

So I'm not the kind of person that asks strangers on the internet for advice, but I genuinely have no idea what to do, I'm desperate, and I thought maybe someone here has gone through something similar and can help.

So my nephew, we'll call him Tom, was diagnosed with mild schizophrenia, PTSD, and some form of bipolar disorder. I don't know the specifics of his medical condition but I know that was the diagnosis. During his sophomore year in high school he started experimenting with drugs and hanging with the wrong crowd. I always brushed this off as standard teen stuff, I was the same at his age, maybe even worse. Then in his Junior year he started showing signs of mental illness, seeing and hearing things, becoming overly paranoid, and becoming aggressive with his parents.

Me and Tom have always been close, as I am his youngest uncle and closest to him in age, he has always come to me for advice and been really open. That being said, he has talked to me more than anyone else (truthfully, I think) during this whole process. When he had his first big break down, he left school, beat up his little brother, tried fighting my brother in law, ran away from home, got picked up by the cops, put into a hospital, escaped the hospital with another kid and beat up an old security guard who worked there, and then got caught and taken to a care facility. It was bad.

Tom was in the care facility for a few months, got diagnosed, seemed to be getting better, and was brought back home. Thanksgiving was the first time I had seen him since he had been back, we talked for hours about it but he basically said the care facility was bullshit and he ""did good"" so he could get out sooner. That was a big red flag for me and I tried to talk to him about any positives he may have gotten from there, he ended up agreeing there were a few. 

Fast forward to Christmas, where he had another break down. He was yelling at his mother, tried fighting his father, they ended up locking him outside the house, he started punching the door and smearing his bloody hand all over the window, drawing upside-down crosses in his blood, which I'm sure modified his *very* Catholic grandma (my mother) and then he got picked up by the police and taken to a hospital where he has been since Christmas. I should also mention I wasn't there during the 2nd break down, I was told all this after it happened. 

So my sister calls me today and asks if I could go with my brother-in-law tomorrow (his Dad) to pick him up from the hospital, but ended up just having his grandparents go with him instead. I was pretty bummed and said I wanted to go anyway but apparently his grandparents insisted on it just being them... Anyway I'm planning on going up to visit him next weekend and try to talk to him, but I'm at a loss along with everyone else. My sister quit her job to try and get him help for the past year and a half but he has little luck, she's feeling defeated but still trying as hard as she can. Apparently they have had lots of problems with their insurance and are having a hard time getting him the help he needs.

My bestfriend went through something similar a few years back, except he had severe PTSD and schizophrenia, but he ended up getting a heavy drug addiction and has been god knows where for the past few years. I lost my bestfriend to this shit and I still feel like I didn't do enough to try and help so I want to do anything and everything to help my nephew not go down the same path.

I just need some advice on how to approach it from here. I'm worried I might say the wrong things of not say enough. I have an opportunity to really communicate with him because we are still pretty close and he's still (hopefully) willing to talk to me. I've never come here for advice and am not one to share personal stories but I figured someone might be able to help, and I need any help I can get. I'm trying to come at this as rationally as possible but I'm feeling scared and anxious that I'm going to lose him/his trust or that he might do something horrible sooner than later. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read all this, and to anyone with any advice.

247,"So love April this last year I was homeless and I was staying with a friend's brother. I'm 4 years old I'm going to be going through a divorce I was married for 18 years I left my husband because he was mentally abusive their three children and I was left with nothing basically. So at this point I don't have a car and have a job and at the time I didn't know it but this guy was a drug addict particularly a methamphetamine addict. So he's going through withdrawals and asked me to go with him on a trip to get his shit down in the city which was about a half hour away they chose to do this at like 2 in the morning and I only went because I was wide awake and dealing with my own depression and problems so I was like fine I'll come with. We get down to the city and it turns out he's never dealt with this person before and it was a black guy and long story short with that one the guy had us drive in somewhere wherever like maybe six blocks from where he picked them up and my quote friend game 50 bucks and the guy went in and all of a sudden my door opens and I got a gun in my face and there's this but looks like a kid telling us to give him all of our money. I've never ever been in this position before and I was scared out of my mind my so-called friend had his whole paycheck on him which was $700 and this guy just ended up leaving after I just looked at him and said sweetheart I ain't got no money. I said we need to get the hell out of here and we laughed and it was about you know a half hour drive back to his place. About 15 minutes into the drive back he says he's tired and asked me to drive so I said fine and side note that he never lets anyone drive his vehicle and being a meth addict he's a paranoid freak half the time which I thought was just part of his mental problem he might have had. So he had me take the back roads and we're about two miles from his house and it's 4:30 in the morning and it just kind of snowed a little tiny bit and I was driving slow because I was afraid the roads were slick and because I was driving his truck. so we come upon a hill and a Crest almost and there's about seven deer in the middle of the road well thinking of his car I didn't just plowing to the deer I swerved and there was a lower shoulder with gravel and he appreciates hires answer the forerunner so I think the center of gravity on this thing might have had something to do with it so I lost control the vehicle and it rolled 7 times I asked him specifically when when I got into the car to put a seatbelt on because I never not wear my seatbelt. so the car rolled seven times he was a ejected when it stopped I was unconscious and must have hit my head and when I regained consciousness I was upside down so I got out of my seatbelt and I looked around and I didn't see him and he was probably about 10 ft behind the truck cuz the truck landed on its roof. my adrenaline kicked in I was in a panic I ran to him I took my jacket off and put it on the ground I stayed with him and make sure he was alive and I ran up a hill and banged on a door in a house nobody answered so I came back down to be with him and he said he was getting cold and his legs are cold and I sat and held his head above the ground and then the first responders came and not even caring about what was wrong with me I had a herniated disc in my neck I had glass in my head at a concussion was bleeding, it took me to the hospital and it took him flight for Life while he was paralyzed from the waist down haven't talked to him at all and I had to deal with what happened by myself cuz I really don't have any friends and I don't have family. I got back to his place and I packed up all of his things because he was getting evicted because he spent all of his money on drugs. so six months later I get a call from a detective and he wants to talk to me and he's asking me where this guy is and I said I don't know how to talk to him and it just have just wanted me to come in and talking I didn't think it was a good idea without a lawyer so I didn't go in to talk to them. In hindsight now maybe I should have. so then I get a letter in the mail basically giving me a citation for failure to keep control of vehicle and also a court date for OWI with bodily harm charge which is a felony in my state carries a penalty of from 5 days to 30 days in jail possible prison because I'm already a felon from something long time ago hand it's just my life is ruined now I think does anybody have any advice for me anybody really suicidal now I'm going to go to my court date which is tomorrow and I can't afford an attorney and my boyfriend won't even help me I found a lawyer for $2,000 but he won't help me.

248,"i first want to start off thanking those who reas this entire post. it means more than you think.

there are a few areas of my life that i really need to get better. i’ll try to split them up.

background: 21 male, 6’3”,  170lbs, white, college student (senior)

first is fitness and physical appearance. this one isnt too bad and is probably the least of my worries, but nevertheless it is a worry. im a hairy person. not the most hairy, but enough for it to bother me and i don’t know what to do. shaving and stuff doesn’t necessarily irritate my skin too bad, but it does leave it stubbly/prickly, so it doesn’t feel smooth and it’s not even worth it since i’m not getting what i want out of it. i’ve waxed my front before, and from what i remember it was pretty smooth but how can i keep it smooth always? eventually it’ll grow back and it’ll get prickly and stuff and i don’t think waxing will work on that length. i do not want hair removal surgery. the other part of this is gym routine. i’m so bad when it comes to knowing what to do at the gym, but i do a good job of hiding it. someone in my family gave me a routine and i’ve literally been following it exactly (with weight increases of course) for years because i don’t know how anything works and it’s embarrassing. i don’t know names of things and i don’t know which machines work out which part of the body. normally i could just look it all up but i never remember. it never sticks. while i’m on this topic, does anyone happen to have any good routines for someone my age? i’m mainly looking to get bigger arms and legs, and at least some abs (not ripped, but enough to show off a little), but i do want to work out everything including chest back biceps triceps shoulders legs and cardio.

this ties into the next part: diet. i know nothing about food as well. the only thing i know is that if you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. and if you burn more calories than you eat, you lose weight. i have no knowledge on types of food like “protein” “carbs” “fats” etc. its embarrassing like im in my 20s and i dont know this stuff. i don’t know what to look for when going grocery shopping and which food is better for me or when it’s an acceptable time to slip in a snack. also protein shakes - no idea like i want to be able to do these things for myself and be a healthy person but im so dumb and i don’t like it and end up doing nothing about it. it’s time for that to end.

now for the more important stuff, and things actually related to my future. im a senior in college and i’m freaking out about what’s going to happen after graduation. i will absolutely hate myself if i end up moving back home and doing nothing. that cannot happen. i love my family more than anything but i need to be on my own and cannot rely on them any longer. i’m worried about getting a job. my major is computer science and i fear that i won’t be able to land a position somewhere that will pay will and give reasonable benefits. geographically i’m leaning towards some big places like boston or california. those are the kinds of environments i want to be in. the things that i’m worried about however is cost of living and getting a job in big areas like those since my school isn’t that well known outside of the surrounding area. i’m not sure what else to say about it. i would just like some tips and advice on what paths i might want to take. i have no confidence and feel like no matter how much i try, i will just end up graduating college and going back home unsuccessful. it fucking sucks knowing that it probably won’t be any other way.

tying into the final thing i’ll bring up, the work life. i’ve lived my whole life without a job, and i have a feeling i will not adjust well. i’m used to being able to do what i want whatever i want (outside of school) with no restrictions. i feel like the obligation to work every day for 8 hours will make me severely depressed and without time to do anything - especially in computer science. i feel like i won’t be able to have fun outside of work since by the time i get out it would be time for dinner and time to get to bed and just do it all over again the next day.

don’t know what to do.  just want to be happy and successful!

i feel like what i’ve typed so far doesn’t do it justice, but it’s the best i can do now so i might as well submit the post",07Jan2019,1

It’s not that I think the events are a waste of money in the way I wouldn’t spend the money myself, it’s just I don’t think he should spend his money on me. (I can’t afford going to all the events he invites me to though, so I can’t afford to offer to pay on my own)",07Jan2019,1
250,"So my boyfriend and I have been living together for about two years. Over the course of this time I’ve noticed his snoring has become worse and worse. I’m not sure what changed but it’s really bothering me to the point I go into work quite often now with 2-3 hours of sleep under my belt if I’m lucky. 
I thought it was just a typical snoring problem. We tried remedy it with breath right strips, mouth guards, nose vents everything. You name we have tried it. The reason I know he has sleep apnea is because my stepdad has it bad. He finally got a machine and sleeps like the dead now. So I know the signs. I know the patterns. All I’m really missing at this point is a medical diagnosis. My stepdad even recommended a home sleep test that is DMV and FDA approved that can diagnose my boyfriend with so we can get some kind of treatment from there. 
Here’s the problem: I found the test for him, asked him if he’d be comfortable using it, he said he would, but when I sent him the link for the test and he saw how much it cost ($160) it suddenly wasn’t a priority anymore. It was a “we’ll see” and “I’ll have to save up for it”. I tried to explain to him that it’s MUCH cheaper than a doctors visit/tests and we can do it in the comfort of our own home so he could actually get some sleep. He said that’s true and then very promptly changed the subject. 
I’m truly at a loss here. My job is stressful enough without having to go in exhausted. I’m currently on the couch trying to hold it together and get some sleep but I can hear him through the wall anyway. I would really appreciate any kind of advice as to what I can tell him so he gets the treatment he needs. For his health and my own as well. Thank you. ",07Jan2019,1

259," So, my parents run their own business for almost 20 years now. In the last 3 – 4 years things have been changing, some people of the office department left the company causing my parent to be the only people left. After a while they managed to hire two new people, hoping they could help to reduce the workload/burden. For some time this worked out okay, but now one of the two new employees is leaving the company already due to his mental illness. This causes again a lot of stress and workload for my parents, meaning that they have to work even more than they already do. During the Christmas holidays, my dad had to work almost everyday at home in order to keep up with the work. Also during a regular day, my mom needs to do the laundry, dishes, clean the house etc. 

I am student who lives from Monday to Friday on the campus of the university, in the weekends I go home. But hearing all these stories my parents have to deal with, and see them struggling to keep up with the work, social life and household, makes me sad.

272,"I’m coming here because I’m not sure what to think about my brother’s behavior or what actions I may need to take to ensure my family’s safety.

- My brother is different from the rest of us. He has difficulties socially and is very awkward when trying to make conversation. There is a belief that he may have Prader-Willi Syndrome, though he’s never been tested.

- He seems to be stuck at a young age mentally (12-14 yrs). He often wants to relive events from his childhood and often brings up the same good memories over and over again for a laugh. He has nervous laughter or will leave the room if there is any romance in a movie or on tv. As we grow older, this becomes a pressing problem. All of the siblings in our family are getting married, moving out, and having families of their own which upsets him because he wants to maintain his childhood.

- My fear is from his repeated signs of potential violence. About 6 or 7 years ago, he asked a question to me and my siblings that shook all of us and we still remember to this day. He came down from upstairs, where his room is located, walked into the kitchen and asked us, unprompted, (I paraphrase but to the closest memory I have) “If someone were to come from upstairs and start shooting, where would you run and hide?” 

- When a kitten we had at the house had died, his reaction was to take pictures of it.

- He makes the occasional “joke” about shooting people. This past weekend, he made a joke in bad taste. No one laughed and told him that it wasn’t funny. A few hours later, he grabbed a wii remote controller (the type that is shaped like a gun) and went through the house pretending to shoot each person individually, then machine-gun style, sound effects and all.

- I’m unsure whether his actions are just representative of the mind of a 12-14 year old or if I need to be worried about my family. Currently everyone lives in the same house but me and my husband. Recently, we celebrated NYE at our house with 2 of the 4 siblings. My brother was not included in this gathering and kept trying to invite himself over. We said no because there would be drinking involved and not enough space for everyone to sleep over. We didn’t want anyone having to drive back. He was angry and the next time we saw him was when he pretended to shoot us all.",07Jan2019,1
273,"this is a throwaway, the girl in question knows of my other account.

so I have a girl I love and she loves me, but we're an ocean apart and I unfortunately cannot visit her IRL for at least another few months, if not more than a year.

This is the main reason for my question because she has been having trouble with dreams, she doesn't always know whether that dream is a dream or reality, as an example: she dreamed that someone killed me and she was visuably upset and wanted me to text her back as soon as possible so she knows that nothing happened to me.

now this is in itself not a problem, I replied within 5 minutes because I happened to see it, and I calmed her down.

But is there anything else I can do to help her, maybe to resolve those dreams or to make it so she is aware of when she is dreaming? or alternatively for me to comfort her better? I really wish to do so but I can't physically be there which really sucks, hence why I am asking here

275,"I wrote a really long post and deleted it, hopefully this will be short. Edit: It wasn't, sorry.

I've spent most of my life doing and being something I'm not. I'm not even sure who I am anymore. I'm in my mid 40s, I've moved back home due to a breakdown essentially, and am trying to recover. I haven't been able to return to work, and I've been out of work a long time. I can't return to my old career, I just can't do it anymore. I've gone back to it more than once and I'm finally done for good, I can't figure out anything related that doesn't just cause me to shut down completely. I swore I'd never return to this city again because it is so soul crushing for me, but I really had no where else to go. 

I came back home to stay with my dad till I got my shit together, I thought it would be a max of a year. Three years have passed, and not long after I moved back, within a year I met someone new and he loves this city and never wants to leave. I was really not looking to date, it was the furthest thing from my mind when we met, we just really clicked and neither of us really clicked with anyone else for a long time. My father lived his whole life here and is starting to need help, he hides all his problems from me as best he can, he's very independent and fights me every step of the way. He's very difficult and resistant to change, so now I feel like I can't leave because of him. I was very close to him, but I'm really starting to hate and resent him now. My SO loves it here and has a niche career that would be hard to get employment elsewhere. 

Basically I feel like I'm slowly drowning. I've tried to make the best of it. The first year I just explored the city as a tourist and met my SO so it was better, I got to see places I never saw growing up, so many things had changed since I left. Even though I was really in a battle mentally and emotionally I felt more alive, I believed at first that I was going to leave in a year, maybe two max. My father seemed ok the first year, but got ill the second. My SO didn't seem adverse at first at the idea of moving elsewhere. But then the second year passed and I realized he and my father are pretty much entrenched in the city. I'm doing everything I can to recover but I'm getting pulled downwards. It's a fight every day to even do simple things I didn't think about, like brush my teeth. 

In my heart I dream of things like living in Berlin for a year, or moving to Portland, OR. At least when I visited them a few years ago they seemed lovely, with things how they are now, I'm not so sure. I just want to be in a quieter city, near nature and places I can explore. I love travelling on bike, by public transporation, or train. I am a kinda hippie person at heart, I know it's not for most people. I loved portland because people are passionate about protecting the environment, I am quite happy at it being normal to sort all my trash into different bins and composting, going to a cafe that makes kombucha and finding funny notes people left drawers of old secondhand tables, and sitting on worn chairs that furnish the place, buying food at a farmer's market where people will tell you exactly how something is grown and be excited about it, etc. I enjoy hiking, I made it up to the top of Mt St Helens back when I was in a lot better shape. The weather was terrible, I could barely see my hand in front of my face the whole way up, the last 1/4 mile was 1 step forward, slide 2 steps backwards in ash. It was a pure hellish slog. We didn't even really get to see much other than the edge of the crater (I almost fell in) but it was still awesome. I want to see it again. I miss bike racks on public transit. I miss biking fearlessly everywhere, even late at night, because drivers expected bikes to be on the road. Everyone there rode bikes, not just the hardcore commuters and exercise nuts, I'm not a hardcore bicyclist, but I enjoy it. It was very safe. It's not the same here. I'm not sure how environmentally friendly berlin is, I was only there a few days, but the neighborhood I was in was so quiet and lovely, and there was so much to see that could be easily seen via public transit. 

I think I'm happiest the first year or two of most places I've lived when everything is new and you get to explore everything. I feel like once it becomes familiar I start to become bored and depression starts to sink in again. I love walking down all the streets and finding hidden gardens, and secret places, and poetry benches, and the little libraries people have in tiny house like configurations. I'm always branching out into new neighborhoods to explore, by bus, by bike, etc. I guess if I can't hike, I'm wandering a city. Once I've seen it the thrill wears off.

I've always lived at home with my mom, but will soon be moving out to live with my boyfriend (3,000 mi across the country).

I'm excited and eager to move, but there's a few things holding me back emotionally that are making it difficult.

My mom seems supportive of the move because she can see how happy and excited I am about it, but I get the feeling there's more she isn't willing to tell me.

Another factor is that I just recently adopted a 3-year old stray cat from the humane society back in October (moving out wasn't anything more than a ""what-if"" idea then), and this cat is honestly a bit of a demon lol. I love her, I know how to deal with her but she is very rough and scratchy, and has only had limited time with the other animals in the house (another cat, 14 yrs, and a Yorkshire terrier, 8 yrs). My mom says not to worry, that she can take care of her, but I feel guilty burdening her with this crazy cat when I'm moving 3,000 mi away (new apt doesn't accept pets). My mom's also diabetic and really can't be risking cat scratches, too.

Am I overreacting, overthinking? My relationship with my mom is quite rocky, I've been in therapy a few years and my therapist has brought up the term ""enmeshed"" a couple times, so I'm aware that the foundation of our relationship is already unhealthy.

My teenagehood was pretty much wasted but over there I realized the extent of my issues. It's near impossible for me to get intimate with others and despite my best attempts I never got comfortable with the other foreigners. I deeply long for meaningful relationships but am completely unable to make real friends, I was by far the most weird among groups there.

289,"I've been dating a guy for about 6 months now. About a month ago, in one of those days when you don't feel at your best, I asked him whether he would like me more if I lost some weight (I'm 20, 5'5 and 132lbs, BMI of 22.0), to which he answered with a ""yes"". Later on he elaborated that he finds me attractive the way that I am, but he wouldn't mind if I got more toned.   
I consider myself to be somewhat athetically built - I workout 5-6 times a week (tennis, running, gym and pilates), with some curvy hips. I've never been a skinny girl; I prefer being more muscular and strong, but I think I could use losing  some fat. Overall, I like the way that I look, I'm healthy and of normal weight. Before this conversation with him, I didn't consider changing my looks.  


I know that his type is the ""model"" type of figure - his ex used to be quite thin and I've seen the girls he's claimed to be attractive to him.   


Since that conversation I've been very confused - he's told me not to do any kind of weight loss activity unless I felt like it and that it wasn't really necessary, as he repeated numerous times that I'm ""fine"" just the way that I am. But I can't help and consider his remark that he'd prefer me even more if I was skinnier. When he's touching me or when he sees me naked, I can only think about whether he's judging the way that I look. I began feeling very insecure.  


Thus, I started exercising more vigorously, counting and restricting my calories, although I'm not completely fine with it; I feel as though I'm doing it to please him (mind you, at least he's not pushing me into doing these things). I wouldn't mind getting fitter - stronger and more toned, but I don't want to be the slim type of girl, especially for someone else.  


So, my question is: what should I do? Keep doing what I'm doing? Change my regime in order to be who he wants me to be? Is he in the right to ask me to do it? Should I talk with him about my insecurities? ",07Jan2019,1
290,"Hey guys. My heart has been a bit fragile these last several months, and I’m trying to figure out how to cope.

Here’s some background: Girl is “homeless” for 3 weeks. Girl meets boy from college class. Boy offers his couch up until girl finds a home. Girl and boy hit it off &amp; start dating. Girl ends up moving in with boy. Fast forward 8 months, girl tells boy she loves him and he didn’t feel the same way. Girl still lives with boy.

I have no idea why I wrote it in a non-personal 3rd person narrative lol but you get the gist. We broke up 2 (almost 3) months ago, and we still live together and still sleep in the same bed. We live well together but we both know it’s not healthy but we’re both respectable of each other and him being the one with the better finances, doesn’t want me to have to move out if I don’t have optimal stability. Rn living together is financially beneficial to both of us. So the plan is to stay living together until our lease is up in May, also my graduation.  

He’s completely unphased by the breakup and honestly kind of acts repulsed by me sometimes... I am so in love with him and the breakup really weighed me down and greatly affected me. It sucks living with him and seeing him everyday and not being able to kiss him or hold his hand. It’s so hard. But also part of me is glad we still live together because I DO get to see him and still be apart of his life. He’s my best friend.

Whilst on my commute I managed hit every red light, 3 different rail road crossings and the normal Monday morning traffic. I got to work 5 minutes late, which I think is impressive considering all the delays and not at all a big deal, but now my boss is threatening to take it further. 

I take being on time seriously but I know there's at least 5 or 6 other colleagues that do the same thing at least once or a twice a week. The attitude of my boss is fairly laid back most of the time so I feel like I'm being treated unfairly for such a small issue. Or maybe it's just a scare tactic? Besides being late a couple times I do my job as well as I should and I'm actually really enjoying it but now this is spoilt my motivation a little.

Any advice?",07Jan2019,1

294,"I posted this in r/anxiety too but I need some help quickly so here it is. If you want some background you can look in my post history, it's all there. Today I'm having a particular bad day because I didn't get much sleep and there's so much to do. Here is the text I copied from my original post:

Christmas break is over and it's starting out just great. I just came back from the dentist (I hate dentists and I was shaking while I waited), and now I've got to text two people and call two more. They're all pretty important so I can't skip out on them but I just want to crawl away in a hole and forget about it. Maybe someone can give a few tips on what I can say? Here's what I need to do:

1. Call doctor to clean out my ears. I was in a mountainous area for the past two weeks and my ears wouldn't pop all the time so one or both ears were constantly plugged. I think they need to be cleaned out. Making the appointment isn't really scary but the thought of having to explain what's wrong is... Also during the actual appointment...
2. Text the parents of the kid I'm going to tutor next Thursday to send me some more info on what this kid needs help with so I can prepare better. Probably the easiest one on the list cuz I know what to say and what to do. Thinking of the actual tutoring does give me massive anxiety though.
3. Call back some company where I can get a job, after having called two or three times already. Everytime I called, the right people wouldn't be available and the last time I called (before Christmas) I would be called back but they probably forgot. I haven't tried since even though I could've so I just don't know what to say anymore... 
4. Text a friend of mine that we should look at which weekends we can get off to go ski for a long weekend. This is definitely the hardest... There's time pressure and I feel a lot of pressure for her to like me so I'm always very careful for what I send her. It's so much easier to just talk to her but if I called, it would be weird (I never call any of my friends and I believe she knows that). I mean, I'm really looking forward to being alone with her for a couple of days so I really want this to happen. But I just feel like everything I send her will annoy her because she's so busy studying all the time. So especially planning something like this is difficult. It was her idea to go after all so I feel like it's my job to come back on it (also because we'd go to my parents' holiday house so I have to ask that first, which I finally did yesterday). I'm also afraid that I write with the wrong urgency. Like if I said ""if we still want to go ski we should look at which weekends would be good some time"" I feel like I leave it too open and if I said ""we need to go look at which weekends we can go ski"" I'm being too urgent. But at the same time I need to be urgent because the best weekend for me is already in two weeks so we need to plan that right now then... It's so hard man...

Anyone got some tips on what I can say to all of these people? Any tips on how to calm the fuck down just a little bit?? I just want to crawl in my bed with music and let it all solve itself but I just fucking can't.",07Jan2019,1
295,"Some days are better than others and sometimes I’m also really chatty. But for the most part my team are very loud and talk amongst each other about non work related things for a large portion of the day.

I’ve tried ignoring, using earphones, joining in and letting it go but sometimes this really affects me and it impacts my work. 

I’ve spoken to my boss about this multiple times but she’s also a chatter. I am the only one in the team of five who is the ‘introvert’. I don’t want to be seen as difficult and complaining so I guess the only options are leaving (but what if I leave a good job and have the same issue somewhere else?) or letting this not get to me.

296,"My memory sucks so the details will be hazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Around a bit more than 10 years ago, in my mid twenties, my younger brother had been dating his first girlfriend for 7 years. My brother and I were pretty close. We'd never really wronged each other. I'd never had a girlfriend before, except for a very passionate affair with a married woman when I was 20 that lasted a few months. I was raised by cold, harsh parents, and finding love is all I've ever wanted. To this day, I still haven't been in a real relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't like my brother's girlfriend. She was manipulative, and all brains and no heart. She seemed to just take. But she started seducing me. My brother and I were late to leave the nest, so I still lived in the next room over to my brother. She would do things like come out of my closet only wearing my shirt which was much too big for her and her underwear. She would say things that made sense to me, like we weren't built to be with one person. No one owns anyone else. As a lonely person, I was very confused.

&amp;#x200B;

So I kissed her, wanting to like it. But I didn't. I asked to see her in her underwear, wanting to desire her. But I didn't. And when I eventually couldn't euphemistically dodge the question of whether I liked her or not anymore, that was the end of it. She despised me for, in her terms, using her, and soon after, they broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what she told my brother we did. We never talked about it. I'd never had sex with her. The only things we ever did were what I mentioned above. But I heard later, I forget from who - I think his now wife, that he'd started cutting himself in the wake of that breakup. He started becoming a fuckboy, telling women what they wanted to hear so he could hurt them emotionally once he had them. Cheating on them. He says cruel things to his wife.

&amp;#x200B;

He tells me he loves me. He's very convincing. But he was very convincing towards the women he slept with afterwards, too. I buy him stuff he really wants. I moved in with him to pay him rent so he can afford to keep his house, and I rent my house out now. But he lies to me about his real feelings. I know I don't deserve to know his real self. He treats his wife and kids poorly - not physically or anything, but he's quick to anger and is constantly checked out on his phone or watching football. He still brings up his first girlfriend from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm one of his wife's best friends. She confides in me about the pressures she's under. She cries. His two daughters love me and are much closer to me than him. When he is far too harsh on them for no reason, I can't say anything, because I'm not the parent.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help. I want to reach him so I can help fix him. I want to help him be a father to his daughters, who I love and don't want to see suffer. I want his wife, my friend, not to suffer. I screwed him for NO reason. I made my little brother cut himself.  


I don't know what to do. I never apologized. I never told him what happened. I'm afraid it'll make a tense situation with his family worse. I'm afraid it'll torture him. I'm certain that the reason I haven't told him yet is non-selfish. If he decides to kick me out of his life, I'll deserve it. But I'm afraid for him and his family if he takes it badly. Again, not in a physical way, but... I want them to be happy. I'm the only person in his life right now outside of his wife and kids, because he has to work so much nocturnally to keep a house they can't afford because my parents backed out of helping them with it at the last second.

I've had this guy be my friend for the longest time, we used to have a great time and he was just a normal dude to me at the time.
Then one day he throws a massive fit. Don't remember exactly why? but he storms off like a child. we where like 16 when this happened?
anyways he just kept getting worse and worse and he started getting into arguments over nothing he does a poor job at acting depressed he gets all huffy and loud when anything and I mean ANYTHING doesnt go his way and when he was 17 he started dating a 13 year old girl and I was HEAVILY disturbed. I'm glad that thats over and he became homeless at one point for like 4 months? and he used it as an excuse to be a complETE asshole to everyone and he got really greedy he wasnt like actively depressed he used it as an excuse to get shit from people. This is where everything goes even further down hill my birthday comes around and I have been given a bunch of birthday money (this is after he already has a new home) I ask him if he wanted to go to the mall with me and I was very clear that it was my birthday money but I will gladly buy you a meal
I go spend majority of my birthday money with him and then we eat at the food court....
He gets the most expensive thing there and I spent 30 bucks on a meal for his fat ass (hes 300 pounds and he used to be skinny he has no motivation to get fit even if he says he does he breathes like an airplane) and then on the way out he's all mopey I ask him what's wrong and then he says ""IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AT LEAST LET ME GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT""
that was on my birthday. Last year. I dont know how ya'll where raised but I was always told that my birthday money is mine and no one esles and I bought him a big fuckin lunch and he still acted like an ungrateful piece of shit despite making it clear ahead of time that it was because I didnt want to go alone.
and then this happened...
He's known me for a long ass time he knows my life and everything it's been rough for me. not gonna get into details at all....
but he wants to hang out and things are hard for me I tell him sure and something comes up I reschedule it a few times and he FLIPS THE FUCK OUT and decided it was a good idea to ask me why. I wasnt comfortable with saying but he decided that I was lying to avoid him and he just flat out says ""you don't have a life, you have no reason to be depressed""
he apologized. whatever at this point im very mad at him and I love his family he invites me over for dinner and I say sure
they broke as hell
I have 40 bucks
I buy dinner for him his dad me and his brother 
I tell him he owes me and he gives me his wii because ive been looking for one and then he decides to rant saying that I already own everything in the world type of shit
the thing is im broke too the shit I have is shit I collect and it took me my entire fuckin life to get some of these things and bes actively talking iut of jealousy now
I dont honestly know how to deal with this I really want him out of my life but his family is super important to me they treat me better than my own and jf I do or say anything to their precious manchild they will flip out because of how they are. Very family oriented.  I dont have many friends to begin with and I get lonely a lot so like
idk what the hell to do anymore
he did this shit agian recently where He wanted to come over rescheduled it I asked him if he could tell me what was up and he just replied ""because I have a life unlike you"" and then started getting jealous ove my material posessions again like some kid.
I have a smaller apartment than him, he gets government support, he can act however he fuckin wants without consequences and its KILLING me that he thinks that because I have all this stuff he thinks I have no reason to be depressed even though he fully knows that stuff happened in my past that makes me anxious and paranoid all the time and he knows everything about me and all of the shit I had to go through.

She got an E-Mail that looked like it was from apple support, saying that she had bought credits in a game (she does not have any games installed). Looking at the Mail, it was easy to spot for me that this was some scam.

The Mail contained a word document, supposedly the bill, which she opened. She was redirected to a website that looked like an apple website and asked her to enter CC details, e-mail adress and password. She did all of this.

After telling her that she really messed up on this one, I made her change all passwords associated with the e-mail adress she entered into the website. She also removed her credit card as a payment method on the App Store.

How do I continue? Should she have her credit card frozen and get a new one, or just wait for suspicious activity?

My girlfriend is in the US Marine's (I am male). We recently got together and it was overall good. However, when we went to bed she was very aggressive and even when I said I didn't want sex at that moment she held me down (although I am bigger and taller she is much more wiry and aggressive than me) and somewhat forced it on me. It was very scary and I am quite worried.

My girlfriend has distinguished service but I don't like the side that came over her. Although I am not going to go to the cops as it was just the once, I have thought about contacting the Marine Corps and saying that I have noticed she has been more aggressive recently as I am a bit worried about her mental state and I think the Marine Corps deserve to know this (if only to get her help she might need).

&amp;#x200B;

So basically i grew up in a house with my 3 sisters, my dad was abusive and he and that whole side of my family were emotionally manipulative to us all while growing up. My mum left with us when we were little (i was 9 and my sister was 6) to live with another man, who recognized her situation and wanted to help financially. We all lived together for a while and went to a new school, i went off and made friends and did my own thing but my little sister seemed to get the brunt of the hardship from our childhood and had a real hard time making any friends.   


She was always the naive youngest sibling who was shielded from most of the stuff our dad did, and i feel like she made it her role when we were growing up to stay out of everyone's way and try to not to 'disturb the waters'. At school she used to get picked on a lot because she had dyspraxia, and for whatever reason she just didn't have that stage of just going out and making a bunch of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, she's moving to the city i live in now to start waitressing while she looks at getting her own place here. I want her to be able to start enjoying life and overcoming some of the inadequacies she's been conditioned to think she has, (because i know she's insanely capable if she believes in herself like most people are), and it's my role as a brother to try and help her get set up.

313,"I work in a very small team where we are all good friends and all rely on each other a lot. Because we’re such a small group we’re all also hugely invested in the business regardless of our positions, however any drama ends up not only affecting people personally but also the entire business and how well it runs! 

I wasn’t there at the time, but one of our coworkers was recently spotted on tinder at work, which no one would care about, except he makes a massive deal of being the devoted boyfriend type, even relocating across the country to fit in with his girlfriends plans. This has hugely affected peoples opinion of him, and he’s generally lost a lot of respect as a result. 

However, I used to be on tinder and am bisexual, so whilst I never came across his profile, I did come across his girlfriend’s and I know they are looking for other women to have a threesome with. I never spoke to the girl through tinder, and I recognise her from his social photos etc. but we’ve never met so I doubt she would have known that I knew her boyfriend. 

If I told my other colleagues about this, it would save his reputation, however I’m not currently out at work. I’m 100% sure they would have no problem with it, but of course it does change how people see you.

316,"Um. So. My older brothers and cousins got into percocets almost a decade ago, thinking it was just a good time. Things have been snowballing from there. Now into oxys, hydros, morphine, or any opioid pill really.

My oldest brother is hooked, my dad is hooked, my step mom is hooked, my nephews mother is hooked, several of my cousins are hooked. Those are the ones that are still alive.

A few years ago one cousin killed himself after another cousin OD'd and then what seems like weeks later another cousin OD'd. And then the next year my other older brother hung himself shortly before my birthday.

Never in all this was I silent, I voiced my opinion the entire time. I tried explaining to them how close it is to heroin in nature, and no one believed me. I've had several psychotic episodes and mental breakdowns over the years and regularly visited mental hospitals (arguing with drug addicts will do that to you.)

2 years ago, I ended up on the psych ward after a particularly ugly argument with my brother about his drug use. That's when I quit drinking. Booze obviously didn't help, it made me lose it whenever I thought about all the shit these drugs have brought into my life. 

I smoke weed, so, like, thats a drug too, and to them that invalidates everything I say. To them, the weed is just as bad (even though it has never taken 4 of my family members. Am i a hypocrite? Going to quit this year anyway)

So, I've stopped pressuring my family to quit. I'm sick of hearing ""its not your problem"" and ""you smoke weed shut up"" and being outnumbered at every avenue.

Now I feel I'm just waiting for the next phone call to get ready for the next funeral.

318,"-I will mention anything in which I find important in the story.

Basically, two years ago I lost my pet bird. The thing is, I was obsessed with birds all through childhood because of my bird. He was pretty much my only friend and I still have sketchbooks filled with birds. I bought everything bird related and what not, but you get the point. Now, when my bird was lost my parents didn't seem to care. I got extremely depressed for about 3 months, crying and not wanting to do anything productive. 

Another thing is that my parent's relationship is bad, but sometimes it gets to the point where I don't want to be near them when they're together. My mom has told me that she's going to separate from my father soon. This has impacted me because my father was in my childhood for most of my life. But at the same time my mother suffers with his BS daily so I feel like a bad person not wanting to. Sometimes my mother has broken down and has broken through my windows. 

Six months ago was the happiest time of my life. I had conquered social anxiety which I had been facing for 3 years, and I had gotten into a great relationship. I was able to make friends easily starting the new term. I didn't really think much about my parents or my bird at this time, occasionally I would think about it and cry a little, but fall back asleep.

As the year progressed, one out of three of my friend groups started to drift apart. It's also important that they are my closest friends. I feel really bad about it but I try not to think about it. My boyfriend helped me through this. 

The second friend group was cut by myself after noticing that I was not liked by them. Basically, they never wanted to talk with me and gave me the stink eye whenever I did. They called me annoying and when I talked to them about this they called me crazy. I stopped talking to them and I felt terrible. One of them shit talked me and made up rumors but my closest friend didn't seem to care. She kept hanging around her and that just made me feel worse. 


I had a shitty professor that gave me an F for my test which ruined my grade. It's a really long story, but it was really unfair because I had worked so hard on it and that made me break down a few times and from there on I honestly hate going to college. 

At this point I had almost no social interaction on a daily basis. My boyfriend was busy with his own college and work, while I was busy with school. School seemed so meaningless at this time. I would skip many days and I felt bored out of my mind there. My boyfriend still talked to me for a little bit. From here I started to feel really weird about my boyfriend.

Basically, I started to question whether he was honestly busy with college or he was just lying because I am a pretty boring person. There were Saturdays where he wouldn't message me until 6 pm. I don't even know why this bothered me. I know he is a busy person and he doesn't have a lot of friends. And I know that he cares a lot about me. Still, I kept doubting him. I started to get bothered by the smallest things. For example, sometimes he would ignore me when talking with his friends. I felt like a terrible person for feeling bad about this but at the same time I couldn't anything about it. I got angry at him for not being able to read my emotions. There was no need for me to get angry if I never told him about what bothered me. Everytime I got angry, he would apologize and try to change himself for me. I broke off our relationship because I felt like I was too emotionally unstable and got bothered super easily. He told me that he didn't care if I wasn't perfect and asked me out again. I really missed him during those times and so we went out again. 

I kept getting bothered by the little things still, but except I talked to him more about it. He didn't judge me and tried to fix it. I would honestly occasionally get a little jealous when he would talk to his friends more than me. I don't know why I still feel like this. I was friends with his friends. One day, one of the friend he talks to a lot was rude towards me unrightfully, and I told him about it. He agreed that I was right and that his friend made a mistake. The next day my boyfriend kept talking to her like if nothing had happened and that just made me feel terrible. I felt as if he didn't care about me because he never really defended me. I told him about this and he apologized. He was confused on what to say and he promised me that he would say something. When he did, nothing really changed but I'm glad that he did.

Right now, he still talks to her the same as before. I am cruel and manipulate wanting him to stop talking to her. I know he loves me very much and just sees her as a friend. Still, my feelings don't follow my thoughts at all and when I try to control them they just get out of hand. I get upset when I find him texting her in a group chat when he's texting me at the same time. It makes me even more upset when he takes longer to respond because he's texting in a group chat.

 At this point, I clearly know that I'm a terrible girlfriend and person. I over analyze everything and don't stop thinking about it. The fact that I don't have any friends either doesn't make it better. Right now, it's 5:31 am while typing this. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night for 4 days in a row. At first it was because of them, but now I don't really know. It could be everything mixed in and I don't know wtf is happening in my brain. When I go to sleep, I don't think of anything I just feel extreme sadness. I lay there in my bed, trying to sleep. I just cry and cry for no apparent reason. I don't want to go to my classes anymore and I'm so scared to lose my boyfriend because everyone else was lost in this year. My question is, what is really affecting me? And what is wrong with me? Why do I keep getting these feelings that don't belong, and why can't I control them? And lastly, what is your advice to me? I'm afraid this is my last resort because I haven't had any sleep in a while. And physically and mentally, I feel like shit. Thanks for reading this depressing essay and I'd appreciate some help.

324,"So I really don't know what to do here.

Here's some background:

My best friend is a 5'4"" guy and has a lot of great things going for him, including friends, family, grades, sports, money. He is not insecure about absolutely anything except for his height. He has always talked about how every single thing that is currently not great in his life stems directly from him being 5'4"". He says girls don't appreciate him and that he just has to try and find a shorter girl to even get any interest. At the same time he says he wouldn't have kids at all, because he doesn't want to do this to his kids -- and because he expects them to be as short as he is. He says he can't play his favorite sport, basketball, that he is obsessed with (he loves it so much). Even though he is 5'4"" and can grab the rim due to him being really athletic, he still gets depressed because he lacks 2-3 inches to dunk and it's his dream and his vertical is at its max of about 40-42 inches, and if he keeps training for his vertical his knees will have a lot of problems (according to his doctor). Being that short he still managed to secure a spot as the starting defender on the varsity soccer team. He is the fastest guy on the team and is trully good; however, over the past 3 years, every coach that sees him for the first time never gives him a chance. He always makes the second team, he always has to sit on the bench the first half of the season, no coach ever believes in him right away. Then, he gets to play 2-3 games and instantly moves up and becomes a starter as the coaches see that he can be the best on the field consistently, every game. The problem with this is that D1 school colleges won't see him more than once, and are very unlikely to give such a short guy any chance whatsoever. He is also sometimes made fun for being the shortest in the area and that REALLY gets to him, and he can't sleep for days after.

So recently he decided that he will use HGH injections in order to grow this year, before his growth plates close. Now, a doctor did prescribe him HGH, but his parents refused because of the numerous side effects of this. He, however, found a person to get the HGH from for $2,000 every 1-2 months (not too sure on the details but it's at least that much). No matter how long I talked to him about it, trying to talk him out of it, talking about all the negatives and the side effects of this, he just kept telling me it's easy for me to talk, as I am a 6'1"" guy. To summarizes his reasoning, he said that he is willing to give up 15-20 years of his life and die at 45 instead of 60 or 50 instead of 70 in order to live those 40 or 50 years happily after growing 3-5 inches. He said that he can handle all the psychological effects like paranoia and increased anger. He said that nose-bleeds and other side effects are really not tat big of a deal. 

Now, one week after he started injecting the steroid, he talked to me about wanting to knock people out on the soccer field, he talked to me about him not being able to run for more than 30 minutes without his nose bleeding, he has already fainted twice (both times after an intense soccer game where he went all out), he has had an episode of unbelievably stupid paranoia where he thought i was scheming something with some random person against him when ive never talked to that person before and neither has he. adding on to this, he is doing a few illegal things to get the money so that he can pay for the steroids continuously, which will, sooner or later, get him in huge trouble. As the costs are racking up, he is doing more and more to get money and he is throwing away more and more of his senior year, his personal interactions, his time as a teenager, as a normal person really. He also talked to me about his hair falling out, and a few more effects that I just can't recall at the moment. 

Neither I nor the 2 other friends that know about this can talk him out of this, as we are all over 6 foot and he just isn't going to listen. The only solution I see is to tell his parents and have them take his funds away (he is 17 so they still control that I think) so that he cannot obtain any more steroids. Problem with this only solution: he will probably despise me, so I will indeed lose my best friend for a while if not forever. His dad has some anger issues and a prolonged beating is pretty much inevitable in this case. I don't care about getting a rep of a snake or having everyone around me think they know what is going on and think bad of me for this, because that's what ppl do it's okay. I am also willing to have the guy hate me in return for him actually living longer and not dying in front of me in the future years because who the f knows what the results of this will be after 2, 3, 4 weeks of use. I just wanted to see if any of you think theres another solution to this. Any advice would be pretty helpful, sorry if this doesn't fit in this subreddit, I am just looking for some help.

325,"Ok so about four months ago me and my mom moved in with my brother after we were kicked out of our house. The bills have been expensive as hell (last months electricity bill was around $400) Were pretty broke, and every month my mom goes and does her own thing (ie: meth or gambling) so we have to live off of my brothers and his fiancee's money which goes really fast. This month my brother was $500 short on rent, and my mom was going to pay him, instead she went ""missing"" for 3 days, she texted us 3 times but wouldn't answer are phone calls, turns out she spent it all. So now were moving out. I want to know if I should into foster care again or if should could stay with my mom and her ex. 

Her ex is her drug dealer though and lives in this weird apartment/motel thing ment for veterans, I would be able to stay on the couch. I really don't want to go into foster care again because tbh it fucking sucks and it's hard hiding it from my friends, (I like to keep this part of my life a secret, and I've tried it before but it didn't work out ) but the other thing is I'm not sure how I would get to school, her ex lives in downtown Reno nv, and my school is really far, I would have to wake up at 5, take the city bus at 5:45 catch the next bus at 6:30 and take the school bus which is doable, but we most likely won't have bus fair money, which is $1.50 for an all day pass.

332,"Everything has been a late realization and my frustration haunts me.

I've been a straight A student ever since. My mom said that she saw this potential within me so she started pushing me to work hard to the point that I would receive physical punishments if I get exam marks lower than 5 mistakes. All my life I've been scared of getting my exam results, especially when I didn't exceed her expectations. Those years were terrible. I can still remember myself hiding behind my grandmother every time I tell mom about my scores.

I graduated as Salutatorian in primary school and was the batch's Valedictorian came high school. Recalling my childhood experiences, I realized that I took everything as a command. I had no choice and I didn't want to have a choice. I was passive and dependent. I studied just because I fear my mom, that because a lot of people expected something bigger from me. Studying was never fun for me. I have not sought for a purpose, I just went with the flow and to where life would lead me.

College happened. I made it to one of the best universities in the country. I moved in to a dorm nearer my school. Everything was new to me and I was all by myself. It's liberating, really. I thought that I'm finally free from my mom's hold, and maybe making it to a top school would suffice for everything that she would expect from me later on. 

I started to chill and to not care about my studies. I invested my time mostly on having fun and on my hobbies. My mind would roam around inside the room if I didn't like the class. This went on until my junior year. I didn't have failing marks but my grades became so-so. 

My former classmates still consider me just as how I was in primary and high school, smart and someone who would have a bright future. But no, ever since I entered uni, getting all surrounded by the creams of the crop added to my desire to ditch everything, to not be anything at all. And now it hit me. Knowing that it's already my last sem and the urge to persevere academically has just come right now. I realized that I still want to achieve. That my purpose really is to make my parents happy. I was wrong for thinking that playing around would bring permanent joy, that lying low would truly liberate me. I am selfish. Going through this also made me realize that my mom just wanted the best for me way back. She didn't mean to hurt me, and I know that she was sorry for all of that.

Now, it's too late, my grades won't make it to the latin honors' cut. I'm also scared as to how people who know me would react after knowing that I'm graduating with nothing. Everything frustrates me right now and I have no one to blame but myself. ",07Jan2019,1

341,"TLDR: A woman has claimed she is pregnant by me but has sent nothing that backs her word up. Any time I would ask for legit proof she would either send me a picture she pulled from the internet to act as if it’s her results or would blow up on me stating that I need to be patient and wait. Fed up with all the lies, I changed my number and stayed out of contact with her for about a month. Now she has emailed me threatening child support and has begun to call my home without me giving her my home number. 

So, I (26) stupidly had unprotected sex with a woman (31) I didn’t see myself with long-term a few times back in August-September 2018. All times before then we’ve used protection. She’s always stated that does not want another children and was on birth control just in case. She’s also stated that she has a cervical issue that prevents her from carrying a child full term.

Now a bit of a backstory, since I’ve met her it’s been a friends with benefits connection. I listened to her problems with family, men she was dealing with and her legal troubles. She disappeared for two months and stated that she was in jail for robbing a guy she met online. She’s also told me that when she was a dancer years ago she would rob a few men she met at the club she danced at, threatening to tell their wives, family, etc. (I know what you’re thinking, I’m stupid) So throughout our “friendship” she told me that she was changing for the better and I genuinely believed her. 

So fast forward to September of last year. She seemed to be going through a lot so I went over to just keep her company, no sex. Now after the last time we had unprotected sex in September she told me she might need to take a step back because she felt like “feelings” were growing. I told her we both agreed that we were just friends and it would remain that way. So a little over a month goes by after her asking when am I coming back over, spending the night (which I’ve never done). I finally go over around the start of November, we chat, catch up, and then went on to have sex unprotected again. She only wanted oral but we ended up going all the way. 

Afterwards, she wanted me to hang around still but I needed to get some sleep for work that night and I had already spent majority of the day and afternoon with her. She went in the other room and I get up and get dressed and start to make my way out to follow her and hang around for a few minutes before I leave. As I left her room she says “So just hit and run?”, meaning my only motive to hang out was for sex. As I was explaining my reason she said it was okay, to not worry about it and that she was only kidding. So I hung out for a few minutes, then head home and everything was fine. Later at work in the middle of the night she texts me asking what do I think of a relationship between us. I said maybe if we were closer in age(which has always been her reason for not considering a relationship) and were both ready for a relationship(my reason). She says fine, we’re together now. I replied no and she says we are. After a few back and forth texts repeating ourselves she says fine and goodnight.

Days pass of her texting me saying I’m just like every other guy and me apologizing for if I hurt her feelings at all and that I’m not ready. Then one morning she texts again repeating herself and I reply that I can’t bring anyone into my life like that at the moment. She says I’ve already brought her in because she’s pregnant. I immediately call her and ask questions but she stayed silent and hangs up after a while. I go back to texting her about her birth control and her pregnancy test. She says she had a false negative and that she doesn’t want any of my money for an abortion. I keep texting and calling but the only reply I would get is that she’ll handle it and stop worrying.

A day or two goes by and she sent me a positive pregnancy test. She says she should have stole the test and asks me to send her money to cover for it. I sent the money and ask to talk about it again. She said we can talk but she didn’t want to keep talking about it for too long because it’s nothing to worry about. A couple more days go by of expressing how I’m not ready for parenthood and her avoiding a detailed conversation on it all. She agrees to me coming over one day to talk but insisted that after that she didn’t want to hear anything about it from me. When we talked she wouldn’t answer my questions completely and ended up cutting the conversation short because she did not want to talk about it anymore. So after her smoking a bit of marijuana she insists on exchanging oral sex to help calm my nerves. I decline and she said she was disappointed in me for acting that way.

So more days go by with frustrating attempts at trying to have a full conversation with her about everything. One day she tells me she would go in for an ultrasound, this was at least 7-8 weeks since our last time in September. She complained about the $200-300 price for the procedure and that she had other things that she needed to pay such as rent. I panicked and sent her enough money to cover her rent as she only needed to pay half. The day goes by with me asking to see the results. The next morning she sent me an ultrasound of twins, this raised suspicion as the part that would show her name was cut off. So I did a reverse search and found the same picture in full. I call her out on it over the phone and she begins to cry and get on me about not trusting her. She said maybe I’ll believe her in a few months when she starts growing. I insist that it doesn’t have to come to that and there’s plenty of things she can do beforehand to fully back her word up. I finally tell my friends and they all insist that she’s lying about it all and is extorting me. 

She goes on to send me a document that seemed suspect as the information was typed in instead of printed, typed information ran on into others and there was no header of the offices information. So I did another google search and saw the same document on a document filler website allowing whoever uses it to type in whatever they please. I held off on calling her out on it. Thanksgiving day comes and she calls me with her friend who watches her son she backs up her story of taking her to the appointment, saying that she’ll look over the “twins” and congratulated me that I’m going to be a daddy. I tell them both my stance and her friend says that the doctor gave them two weeks to come up with the money to abort. I tried talking more but they rushed and hung up.

Later on I call and tell her the document she sent me is fake and that the doctor does not real. I looked up the doctor and the name given only matched a doctor on the other side of the states. She ends up sending me a photo of a paper from planned parenthood that is very badly damaged for it supposedly being a day old, has the date incorrect by months and year crossed out and written over. She goes on to say that she has the call recording, because she records all of her calls, of the doctor informing her of her pregnancy. Listening to it immediately raised a red flag because HIPAA laws were violated, the doctor brought up the abortion option first and the “doctor” spoke without any sort of professionalism (judgmental, I know, but it sounded that bad). You can also hear the outgoing call ring, she claimed and acted as if the doctor called her. The entire call recording sounds really rehearsed and it took her half and hour to send a three minute recording. The supposed doctor claimed to be the spouse of the doctor that was typed in the fake document and they were giving the information to her because their spouse was sick.

Fed up, I blocked her number and she then called as she blocked her number to tell me to unblock her to send me something. After I unblocked her she sent me a part of her insurance card showing her doctor and their office. Due to the holiday I had to wait to call the office and ask if there was a physician there that matched the name from the call recording. I also looked at their online directory and both stated there wasn’t a physician there that matched the name. The person on the call recording claimed to be with the office as well.

During one of our conversations she claimed that the only reason she sent me fake information was to ease my mind because of how anxious and scared I was. I did not let her know that I checked to see if the person from the call recording existed. So for the next week and a half I ran errands for her, buying her food and other things that raised my suspicion even further. Those things being chocolate wine and Advil pm’s. She’s also taken Xanax pills in front of me. Now, those three things I found out are all harmful to the fetus. This is after she made a comment of committing a self-induced abortion though. Any time I would bring up going with her to an appointment she would blow up and say she doesn’t need me taking her around. 

December comes and she says that shes going to go to a crisis center to see if she could receive any additional funding for an abortion. She stated that they would take her belongings, that I wouldn’t hear from her for a few hours because she wouldn’t have her phone and she was letting me know because she was outside and about to walk in. I called the center to verify the process of taking belongings and that bit turned out to be true. So I waited about an hour and called her phone acting as a pocket dial, it rang and went to voicemail. I called again a bit later and she answered asking what I wanted because she was talking to the nurse at the moment. I apologized and hung up. Curious, I called the center again to make sure no patient would have their phone at all while being seen. That was still true. I come to the conclusion that she’s lying again and just decide to let her dig herself a hole with lies. Hours go by and she starts blowing up my phone. This time it’s her friend claiming that the center found weed and Xanax in her system and alerted her parole officer. She asked for help with bail and to send the money to the alleged pregnant woman’s PayPal. I stated that I only could give $100, she said that she would still need $600 more to meet the $1,000 bail and said she’ll keep asking around and hung up. I took my time sending the money and her phone would call me again and again. A while after I finally sent it she would text me that the police was taking her away in wrists and ankle cuffs. Her friend called from her phone again and left a voicemail crying about them taking her away. I sent a text apologizing for not having enough and that was it. Interesting detail, during those calls there would be a pause and click sound as if they were calling on three-way and she muted her mic so that only her friend would be heard.

Later that same night she texts me saying it’s her. Confused on how one would make bail after violating parole I didn’t answer. I immediately went to take my information off of any online directory (white pages, spokeo, etc.). I ignored her without blocking her number for a few days. She left a voicemail saying she would come by my house (she doesn’t know my address) and texted me that she had an appointment if I wanted to come with her. I still refused to respond and she texted me to not let things get ugly. She also texted me that she had a cop friend look up my information and would come by the following weekend. Mistakingly, I texted her thinking I’m texting my friend what she’s said and immediately changed my number when I realized. She sent me notes on PayPal with a little money basically saying it seems like I want this to get ugly, she never wanted an abortion, and that she just wanted me to not neglect my child. She also said that she would have me served and come for me with child support. She did not begin to bring up child support until I told her that’s what I’m afraid of after she asked why I’m acting so scared and anxious through all of this. 

She’s spent so much time sending me fake information that idk what to believe. All of my friends say that she’s lying and I’ve been looking at her Instagram everyday for the past month. She doesn’t know that I know her instagram and I’m watching it from what I would call a “ghost” account, so it doesn’t trace back to me. I’ve shown her posts to friends and women I know who’ve been pregnant and they all say she isn’t, that she’s pulling a scam against me. She sent me an email stating that I did a cowardly move and that she’s still pregnant. She isn’t showing at all at what’s at least 14 weeks that she’s claiming. I know some women can start showing later so that’s what’s throwing me off. Now, she’s somehow gotten my house number and has left messages asking for me. She probably looked me up through one of those online directories that has information on anyone if you pay for it. She’s spoken to a family member and asked if I was home and when’s the last time they’ve seen me. I’ve emailed her to leave me and my family alone and that I do not believe she is pregnant at all because she’s sent me so much fraudulent information. I finally opened up to my family about it and told one of my trusting female coworkers. My family gave the idea of us calling her and requesting a pregnancy test and blood test and go off of her response. She responded to the email about leaving us alone saying that I chickened out and ran off and that she has the right to look for the man she got pregnant by. She said that welfare would find me anyway and that I’d embarrass myself by going to court about her fraudulences, that they’d make me take a paternity test. My coworker tells me that she’s lying and scared that I’d go to the authorities so she’s saying all of that to scare me from going to them. 

I know this was a long story and can be confusing but I’m not sure what to do at this point. Most recently a friend told me to request legit paperwork results that says she’s pregnant. I’m asking what I should do about all of this because I don’t know who else to turn to about all of this. Thank you if you took the time to read this crazy story. ",07Jan2019,1
344,"Prepare for a ridiculously cringey high school story, sorry in advance.

So I’m a 15 year old girl in an 8 month long relationship with another 15 year old girl. I absolutely love her and she means the world to me, and she feels the same way towards me. Call it infatuation or not real, whatever, that’s not what this post’s about. Last fall I had a one night fling with my friend before I met my current gf. That started and ended on the same day and we made out once. I never had any real feelings toward her, it was just a one-night thing. She has been in a relationship with a guy ever since. In October, when I had been dating my girlfriend for 5 months, I was at a party at hers at 3 am and it was decided in some dumb game of truth or dare that I had to engage in a three-way kiss with this friend and another friend. It was an absolutely idiotic thing to do needless to say, but kids do dumb shit. I didn’t want to do it for obvious reasons, but peer pressure’s a helluva drug and I eventually had to cave. I never even actually came in contact with anyone’s lips because three way kisses don’t really work, and I pretty much instantly forgot it even happened. Until tonight. I’m feeling so ridiculously guilty about it and beating myself up over it for betraying her trust. Since I’m a dumbass kid I have no idea what to do. I’ve never really hidden it from my gf, but I sure as hell haven’t told her about it because I’m sure she’d be upset. Do I tell her? Do I keep (sort of) hiding it?

TL;DR: I [15f] three-way kissed two friends due to a dare awhile ago and am feeling tremendously guilty about this because I have a girlfriend [15f].",07Jan2019,1

348,"I'm 23 and still live at home. Dropped out of college, working for my dad (kinda) and I'm just starting to feel like I'm trapped. It's not at all a bad situation, I  love my parents, and I know they love me too, so it's not like I'm trying to escape a shitty family life or anything like that. But I also kind of feel like maybe there holding me back a little by 'coddling' me and I don't want to resent them for that one day.

I'm in a situation where I feel like I need to grow up in order to move out, but I need to move out in order to grow up. Kind of a catch-22. I've spent 3 years trying to do the 'grow up' part first and prepare for moving out (ie make a resume, build up my portfolio, get a job lined up, etc.) But no matter what, I fall back into my teenage state of mind of laziness and procrastination and don't ever make any real progress on any of those things. 

I'm starting to feel like I should just move some place far away and figure everything else out once I'm there.

I obviously could also just move somewhere close by but I don't know it just sounds kinda nice to pack up and start my own life. I'm not trying to run away from anything, just kinda want to go somewhere far enough away that it forces me to figure everything out on my own. Plus almost all of my friends have moved away, and all my siblings left the area pretty recently too (which also kinda makes me feel bad leaving my parents.)

I know the common problem for people thinking about packing up and leaving without having a job lined up is money, but I actually saved up a bit over the last 3 years (well, by saved I mean I got lucky off bitcoin) so I have enough to live comfortably for at least a year or two depending on where I go. Plus since everyone left town I've spent most of my free time (like all of it) programming and have become pretty good at it, so I'm also in a unique spot where I know it won't be too difficult for me to find a decent job once I start looking.

So yeah, what do you think? 

Should I use the fresh start of the new year by trying to do the same thing I've been doing the last three years and build my portfolio up, make a quality resume, and line up a job somewhere.... or should I just say fuck it and move?",07Jan2019,1

359,"So I'm a freshman in college. And like most I went in a virgin. After the first couple weeks of rapid friend-making, I have a steady group of friends. Soon I develop a physical attraction for one of my friends, and it is reciprocated. I'd never slept with anyone before because I had never felt comfortable enough, but I soon realize I just want to get it over with. One night me and him and up in my room, and he insists it's a bad idea because we run in the same friend groups, yet he still follows. Despite all that occurs, I still didn't let him seal the deal. The next night, we end up in my room again, and after a little bit, I feel ready and we go all the way. He stays the night, takes me to lunch the next day and all is well. In the evening, he asks me what this meant for us. I answered vaguely wanting to know his take on things, and he said he didn't feel ready for a relationship. I agreed and thanked him for the experience he gave me and asked if things should just go back to the way they were, he said yes stating that he didn't want to split the friend group if things went awry between us. I expected that everything would be fine. And for the first few days it was. There were a few awkward moments between us and then suddenly he started avoiding me, which is blatantly obvious as we live in the same dorm. Things get complicated as for the next academic year he will be living with my close friends and I will likely be visiting, so I think we should make peace. I attempted to talk to him one day, and he acted like a d*ck, completely turning me away and stating he didnt want to converse with me. I realize that at this point I have put in as much effort as I should, and it was time to give up. A few weeks later, I bump into him late one night, when he was drunk, he pulls me aside to a room and he apologizes for being a d*ck. I bring up my concerns about the next year and say that I want us to be on good terms. He agrees and says we should be cordial, then he says that things would be easier if i got a boyfriend. This upsets me and I say he should get in a relationship if he so pleases but I'm not interested in anyone. He says it would be easier for me and would ease the tension between us. I end the conversation on the tone that we should remain friends. He greets me the next day, but then continues avoiding me in the following days. Winter break has come and passed and in this second semester I hope he has calmed down. I want to know whether I should reach out and try to make peace again or just leave it be... The friend group is divided and the tension is annoying. It's unnecessary drama I don't know how to resolve.

360,"Something I have been contemplating for a long time now. Should I quit my job? I'm a 26 year old software developer from the Netherlands. Have been doing the 'same' job for about 4 years now. When I quote 'same', it's actually quite interesting.

I started as an intern 4 years ago. After my internship, I started working there fulltime as a SmartTV developer. During those four years, many of my colleagues have left. We have also grown a lot and tripled in size, meaning my position has also changed a lot. I have worked my way up to Lead SmartTV developer and have now been asked to head up all of the delivery teams. Many changes over the past years.

What I have come to realise is that I am not ready for this yet. I want to learn a lot more about developing, but also about myself. Sadly it seems that this is the path they have chosen for me and it was already announced companywide that I would be filling this role. And I have tried to make it work but it just doesn't seem for me, at least, not yet.

This morning I discussed my position with a few people higher up. It sadly let to the opposite of what I hoped for. While I wanted to focus more on the development side of things, they pushed me more towards the new role, even requesting I do additional things. Completely opposite to what I want.

Now, I have been thinking about leaving for a long time, I just never had the courage to do so. I really like the customers I work with, and I really enjoy working with my colleagues. But this new role will definitely change that. I will not have contact with customers anymore, and also focus less on developing, which I really still want to do.

I liked this guy (also present tense tbh, but nvm)

He doesn't like me back

Pretty simple. Bog standard case of unrequited love. The issue is, I share a uni with the guy. I also have no idea of his schedule, or where he'll be at any given time, but thankfully, up until today I've managed to avoid running into him directly.

About an hour ago, I came out of the lecture theatre, walked down the set of stairs leading out of the building, turned left, and he was walking towards me about thirty feet away with his friend. I don't know if we actually made eye contact, but he probably at least clocked me. Anyway, I immediately swore (audibly, though I'm not sure if it would have been audible to him), turned tail and speed walked back up the other side of the stairs. There was, thankfully, a back way out of the building that I could use instead (and that I will use every day for the rest of the semester to avoid a repeat of the whole debacle), but I'm 90% sure he saw the whole thing.

My question is this: if you were in his shoes, what would you rather I do? Keep avoiding you, or man up and walk past you? Also, do I make eye contact/ smile? Probably not possible after today, but I just want to know what the protocol is.

He absolutely won't have given it a second thought, but I will obviously be thinking about this for some days now, and my main concern is what the protocol is when (I don't think it will be an if, unfortunately) I run into him again.

I know this is such an immature thing, but it is genuinely difficult for me. I've walked past my ex-bullies before and looked them in the eye. Hell, I've even looked my abusive father in the eye at court. But I just can't with this guy. I just can't.",07Jan2019,1

I've never asked ANYONE out. Do I man up and go with the plan? Should I prepare myself for a rejection and how to shrug it off?

I just can not, for the life of me, do the ""hey wanna go out with me"" thing, it HAS to be indirect, that's just how I am and I doubt it'll change soon. Asking someone out bluntly and directly is way out of my character and I don't like the idea of exposing myself like that without being 100% sure the other person likes me. I'm not sure if she likes me, on one hand, she writes long messages and a lot of them at once, talks even at night like 3AM ( It's easy to use ""I'm going to sleep"" as an excuse if you don't want to talk to the other person. ), sometimes messages first, ... On the OTHER hand, if it weren't for me she'd end the conversation just after the school related stuff, she sometimes abruptly ends the conversation with a one line response you can't really answer... Just the thought of asking her out and getting shut down devastates me, I won't be able to text her anymore and I'll destroy even what I've built up until now.

So 2019 is gonna be a big year, I’m going to turn eighteen, I’m going to graduate, and with that, I’m going to have to make the decision on what to do with my life. At the moment I’m working at Chick-fil-A, I make fair money, but it’s a 35-minute drive and fast food is not something I’d like to do for a regular job. I plan on quitting after I turn eighteen so I can find something that’s closer and may lead to a revelation of what I want to do. 

I’ve picked many things I’d like to do, but all of them just seemed like an “eh, I’ll say this now and see if I still like it later. It’s not a big deal anyways have a couple years to decide” type thing. I’ve said nutritional studies, political science, or going to a trade school for welding, all of which would have their ups and downs. Either way, I don’t feel fully comfortable with putting all of my efforts into any of those, but maybe that’s how it is for everyone. I’ve never been the smartest person, and school definitely isn’t something I excel in, I’m honestly average in all regards. 

I only have one immediate family member who has gotten their college degree, but they have yet to find a job which that degree qualifies them for. And the idea of four years of my life, plus upwards of a hundred thousand dollars in debt is very appealing. But, I don’t want to do all the traveling that comes with being a welder, my uncle was a welder for quite a few years and the stress it out on him and his family was hard to watch.

I know I’ve written a lot, and I’m not sure anyone can actually help, this may just be something I have to deal. But if someone is willing to give me advice on how to find what I want to do, what they are doing, or just try to get this whole “this is the only decision that matters” mindset out of my head, I’d really appreciate it.

381,"Hey guys, long lurker here. 

My story's very typical. I lived with my parents until last year. I had to move for college and now I live in a big city. It all went down since then. I started drinking more. Smoking more. A LOT more. I moved in July 2018 and since October, there hasn't been a night where I slept sober. I'm almost drunk or high every day/night. As I'm writing this post, a friend of mine just texted me asking if I wanted to try LSD. I said yes.

It doesn't impact that much (yet) my life. Besides the fact that I'm always running out of money (and that's only because I use it to buy drugs or alcohol), I don't do very bad in school but I know that I'm gonna fail if I don't wake up very soon. I'm not okay with what I'm doing but I can't really stop. I wouldn't say that I'm addicted, it just feels nice to be high all the time. I'm too ashamed to talk to my parents about it, and my friends don't really see any change in me.

I'm thinking about stopping every day but man that's hard when all your buddies are party buddies. And then again, I don't really wanna stop. I'm so relaxed here, not caring about anyone.

Early in May 2018 I overheard the COO telling the CEO ""now he is saying that he took something from shipping"".  The CEO responded ""that's it, hire someone to fuck up his car so he knows not to mess with us"".  (I thought wow, what type of Company is this and was wondering who were they talking about).  

Later in the day I went and talked to the COO and asked him if everything was OK?  He responded yes, everything is alright.  I also asked if there was any problems, questions or concerns.  He said, I think we are doing good. ( I left it at that and figured that it was not a member of my team who took something)

May 2018 - I saw a co-worker parked in a parking spot at the Sunoco gas station right before the parkway entrance in a black BMW as if he was waiting for someone there, when I pulled in to get gas he pulled off.  

The next day I heard the COO talking to the CEO and the COO said that he, meaning me gets gas at that gas station right before the parkway entrance where the BMW kid was waiting at and when I pulled in, the kid who drives the BMW left.  The CEO said just try again.  (At this point I suspected that I was being followed but did not know why)

About a week later in May - I saw the kid with the BMW pull up behind me when I took a parkway exit in my home town and stopped at a light but I floored it and lost the BMW kid in local traffic. 

The next day I heard the COO talking to the CEO and the COO said this time he hit traffic so the kid with the BMW was able to keep up.   (Now they confirmed which I town I live in)

May - The BMW kid and the COO come to my apartment and rang my bell (noon on a Saturday), I saw them out my front window, I heard the BMW kid say these look like 1 bedrooms too and the COO said lets get out of here before the cops come.  (I live in an apartment about 5 minutes from campus.  I was afraid to open the door so they left.)

Monday June 4th I came out of my apartment and noticed that my windshield was broken and that my front bumper was damaged as if someone tried to rip it off.

June 4th I heard the employee who drives a Ford Explorer talking to the COO and he just said ""it's done"".

June 4th later in the day - I heard the COO talking to the CEO and the COO said he used a glass cutter for his windshield and he tried to pull off his bumper but he did not want the alarm to go off so he did not rip it off.  The COO also said that he parked on a side street, wore a mask and then walked up.  (This is all I heard, but at this point I knew they hired an employee to vandalize my car because someone made up a lie most likely so they can be promoted to my position)

June 5th I was going out for lunch and I saw the kid who drives the Ford Explorer and another employee talking in the parking lot.  I overheard the kid with the Ford Explorer say to the other employee that he lives in the in a small apt in ""my town name"", the other employee responded ""maybe he is  trying to get him money up"".  (Now, the kid who vandalized my car was bragging to other employees about it)

In July I noticed that the kid with the Ford explorer is always bugging me about something not relevant to the job when I am trying to leave for the day, following me to the punch clock and talking to me when I am trying to leave.

Week of August 1st I went into the CEO's office and said that there is weird stuff going on.  

I said that the kid with the black BMW followed me home several times and I said that it seems that the kid who drives the For Explorer is following me when I punch out and leave the building as if he is purposely escorting.  I said that I do not believe I did anything to deserve this kind of treatment. The CEO said wait until the COO gets in and we will talk.

When COO arrived, the COO paged me to come in his office. The CEO was also present when I entered.

I sound recorded this meeting on my phone to try to protect myself.  I stated that I saw the BMW kid follow me home several times and that I video recorded a masked man break my windshield.  The COO said ""you are shitting me"".  I said that I think it is the kid with the BMW since I saw him follow me home several times.  The Italian CEO kept on asking me where the recording is and if I had it on my phone with me.  I remained awkwardly silent and did not answer specific questions.  The CEO just kept on saying that whatever is going on, it is in my head and is really not happening.  (I did not get anywhere with them at this point and went back to work.)

The next day the CEO called me in his office and said that he heard that I was getting married and offered me a 5% increase which I accepted.  He said that he feels bad about my windshield and that he will pay for the damage.  He also said that he contacted the CFO and informed her about this already so when that bill comes he will take care of it.

After I spoke to the CEO he went into COO's office but I hovered close by.  I heard the CEO say to the COO that if this goes to trial it's on you because all I said was hire someone.  He also asked the COO if I know about the bumper.  The COO said ""I do not think he knows"".  (I only mentioned the windshield damage to them at this point)

The next day I hear the COO state how does this guy (meaning me) knows about this shit and that I am probably talking to the cops about them.  

The following day I heard the COO say to the kid with the Ford Explorer ""did he really do it cause if he did not then we do not have a case"".  (At this point I knew that the kid with the ford explorer lied to the COO that I stole something)

I heard the kid with the Ford Explorer say ""from the shipping department"".    (Ugh! what the hell)

Friday the 10th I saw another employee on my break walking by and I told him that I think the kid with the Ford Explorer manipulated the kid with the BMW and the COO against me and that the previous COO did a way better job then what is going on now.  This employee immediately went to talk to the kid with the BMW, I assume to tell him about the conversation we just had. 

I followed him there to just walk in and see who was in there and walked out out.  A few minutes later I saw the kid with the BMW walk by so I tailed him as he went to the desk where the kid with the Ford Explorer sat and he said ""he knows about you"".  (He just confirmed that the the kid with the Ford Explorer was the one who vandalized my car)

That same day I heard the COO ask the kid with the Ford Explorer ""did he really do it?"".  The kid with the Ford Explorer responded ""he does not have it"".   (The COO was asking the kid with the Ford Explorer to see if I really stole something and the kid with the ford explorer said that I do not have the video of him committing the crime)

The same day, the kid with the Ford Explorer tried to confront me when I was leaving.  He took hard steps when walking by my desk towards me, I guess to see if I flinch? and when I was leaving he faced me and took a hard loud step towards me to try to scare me.  I just walked around him and walked out.  

Few days later the CEO came back from vacation.  I heard the CEO say to COO where is this law suite coming from and the COO replied that he is over there talking shit that the formed COO did a better job than me.  (This was completely true.  The new COO had no clue what he was doing and since bonuses were based on performance, the COO started to take credit for my ideas and projects.  I confronted the COO about this issue a while back and this was his revenge.  He told the kid with the Ford explorer to say that I stole something so this way I get wrongfully fired and the kid with the ford explorer gets my job.  It was a set up.  The COO did not want the CEO that it was coming from the COO because it might seem as if he is getting back at me for confronting him about taking credit for my work)

The next day I heard the CEO say that I talked to CFO and that I am cracking jokes.  I also heard the CEO say that another chairman said that I am still doing an excellent job.  

August 6th I heard the COO say we should get him for IRS fraud, he knew what he was doing.  (I took out a 401K withdrawal for a down payment but backed out due to an issue with the home. )

August 7th I heard the CEO say to the COO, I thought about your IRS idea and I will have my guy look into it.

August 7th later in the day I heard the CEO yell across the entire office that he meaning me has a $7000 tuition this semester which qualifies as a 401K hardship withdrawal, the COO replied oh is that what it is.  (At this point they were looking for dirt on me.)

August 9 I e-mailed a quote from a body shop to the CFO.  I stated that I heard that the CEO informed you about the damage caused to my car and here is the quote.  She responded and said that the CEO mentioned it.

August 9 I heard the CEO talking to the COO and he said did you see the quote from the body shop the bumper is included in the estimate so he probably knows more than he is telling us.

August 9th the CEO summoned me into his office and said to me Change that estimate into a bill so we can pay them directly or let me know when the work is done so we do not have to cut you a payroll check which you will get taxed on. 

When walking out of the CEO's office I heard and office employee talking to the kid with the Ford Explorer and she said how does this man know about you?  At this point it seems that the entire office knew what occurred.

It took a bout a week to get get my windshield replaced and my bumper fixed.  I got a loaner for the time being.

August 9th the COO came over to my desk and asked for my i-pad and said ""I have a demo tomorrow so I will need the iPad.

August 10 the COO called me at work and asked me ""what's the password"" I said what, he said the password to your new App login, I said the app or the i-pad he said the app.

August 10 I overheard the CEO speaking on the phone and he said ""the COO figured out his the password to his apple ID but he doesn't think the cc payment went threw"".  At this point they somehow figured my apple ID password and were trying to make purchases with it.

August 11 I received an e-mail notification that your account app store update order failed due to credit card failure please verify your order. Your apple id was used to purchase real steel champions from the app store on a computer that had not previously been associated with that apple id.  (What?)

August 16 the kid with the BMW came in to the office and pulled out a woman that sit close to me out of the office, they  went out the door still close enough for me to hear and he asked ""what is he talking about?""  The secretary replied ""oh nothing just some high school stuff"".  (At this point they were asking people what I was talking about and told them to report back.)

August 31 a green Acura MDX double parked in front of my residence at 2 am.  It was watching my apartment for five minutes and pulled off.  (I was super paranoid that night and kept on looking out the window.)

August 31 at 2:15 am green Acura MDX and black Chevy Impala with dark tinted windows came back and parked on my parking lot.  4 individuals came out of the MDX and impala and were talking about something.  I heard ""there is the car , go over there"".  One of the individuals replied I am not going over there with that light on and after 5 minutes they left.  I turned all the lights on since I was super paranoid.  (These are the cars and the people which I have seen around the company before)

Sep 4th i heard the COO saying to the CEO that ""employee name that works in receiving"" does not know what they did but the kid with the BMW drove by and saw no visible damage.  The COO said ""I got the kid with the BMW going there tonight to take a closer peek"", the CEO replied let me know how that goes.  (At this point I was parking my car around the corner where there is a camera and walking to work.)

Sep 5th i heard the COO saying to the CEO you send a goon squad to his house and i think he knows that.

Sep 5th i heard the COO say to CEO, the kid with the BMW went there and took a peek around the corner and he said that there is a camera there so we cant go there but we can throw rocks from around the corner.  (I installed a camera at my residence to try to catch them on video.)

Sep 4th, 5th, 6th I kept on getting bit on my legs sitting down at my desk, looked like bed bug bites.  I said to my co-worker that I think we got bugs with a delivery. ( I rolled my chair out the office and dumped it then found another one lying around.)

Sep 6th I heard the CEO talking to someone and he said ""he moved that chair to production and blamed it on a shipment"". (They planted bed bugs in my chair)

September 7th I was talking to my co-worker and I said that due to school work i stay up until 4 AM at times, a sec after the kid with the Ford Explorer overheard me since he is a few desks down, he went into the COO's office and said ""he said that he stays up until 4 in the morning"".  The COO replied ""so we will go there at 5 in the morning"".

09/14/18 - I heard the kid with the BMW say to the kid with the Ford Explorer ""is this guy going to get fired today?"" The kid with the Ford Explorer replied ""The COO did not tell me nothing"". (At this point I thought I was getting wrongfully terminated.)

09/14/18 the CEO asked me to follow him into the warehouse, when we got there I believe he was going to wrongfully terminate me but did not because I think he knew I was recording the conversation.  I kept on moving closer to him with my phone in my pocket recording while he kept on talking low and moving away from me.  He said that he wants me to operate on the same level that I used to.  (I really don't know what that meant since my level of contribution never changed, I just stopped talking to the COO because he was taking credit for my work)

09/14/18 I overheard the CEO talking on the phone and he said ""I think that the COO was right about him recording because he meaning me kept on trying to stay close to me when I was talking to him so we will see what happens, the COO also said that I heard us talking about the hired gun"".  (I heard them asking around if they knew any hired guns, I assume to shoot me)

Now on August 18th I heard the CEO say to the COO ""we have his social security number so try to get a loan out in his name so that way he has to pay for it"".  

August 20 I heard the COO say to the CEO ""if you wanna try something, you should do it today because he is off tomorrow"" meaning me since I have off tomorrow.  (I think they were going to try to wrongfully terminate me again.)

August 20 I was walking threw the office when the CEO put his hands out to stop me from walking by where the COO was writing a note to the kid with the Ford Explorer as if they did not want me to see what was being written.

I think they are planning to set me up for something.  They were planning to get me in trouble in order for me to leave.   
 I called the police station to find out what to do about this but they just said I can file a report which will not protect me in any way.  (I think they were going to turn a lie in reality and tell the police that I took something)

Next day I resigned by e-mail with a contact I had in another state and explained the issue.  Never heard back.

So, I worked for a Company that took credit for my work, when confronted, made up lies about me to try to wrongfully terminate me.  This so called business hired a goon squad twice, put bed bugs in my chair, tried to take out a loan in my name, installed a keylogger on my personal phone, tried to hire a gun and finally tried to frame me.

The beggining was normal and friendly and as the months went by she keeps giving me a weird vibe (like i can't be around her or talk to her like to other teachers.) I went to erase the blackboard a few times and called me a knight, gentleman and gave me a weird smile not a friendly one. Once she just touched me and told me i had something on my back but never showed me what i had, she didn't pinch me to grav whatever i had, she just felt me with her hand. Once she moved me in front of the class and i was tired and i just finished writing, i sat in my bench lying my head on my arm which was extended. There was a 1m gap between the blackboard and my extended arm and it's not like she didn't have space to move but she just moved intentionally near my hand and i just barely touched her butt. My original bench/position in my class is all the way in the back and sometimes she moves me in the front. When i'm in the front she always stands around me but when im in the back she is at her desk. When she stands next to me to explain stuff she gets too close to me with her face  and i just get mad and confused. I don't know if i'm paranoid or whatever but i can't be myself around her she creeps me out.

396,"Let me start out by saying I dislike my job very much. I cannot just leave, as I am six months pregnant and need the money. After I have the baby, I will look for employment elsewhere, but for now I’m trying to make the best of it, and I’m failing miserably.

I’ve been with this company for a few years now, and about a year and a half-two years ago, I got a new boss. Ever since he’s been here he’s made numerous racist and sexist comments. He’s made comments laughing about rape, sexual abuse, and sexual harassment which hit close to home for me. I’ve made it a point to say something to him in private, making sure not to point it out in front of all my other co workers. He apologized and came back in the office later saying “I guess I need to watch my mouth so I don’t offend certain people around here.” In a totally condescending voice, and that irritated me to the point where I set up an appointment with HR to file a complaint.

HR took over two months to get back to me after I’ve sent numerous emails and phone calls to try and get in touch with someone. I explained to HR about what was going on and they didn’t do a single thing about it. HR LOVES my boss for some reason and can never find anything wrong with his actions. 

What can I do to make my last three months here bearable? My anxiety has gotten terrible about being here at work. At first I thought it was the pregnancy making me sick, but it’s the anxiety. It’s not just the weird inappropriate workplace comments, but my boss is 100% sleeping with my co-worker, and the favoritism obviously and clearly shows, and it’s creating a hostile work environment. I don’t want to cause a huge stink if I’m leaving in 3 months, and I don’t want to receive a ton of backlash if I speak up again. But I’m truly sick of dealing with the bullshit, and I’m trying to not stress out too much during my pregnancy. I’m worried about too much stress and anxiety harming the baby.

At this point I’m trying to save my money the best I can so I can leave a few weeks early before the baby comes. I really don’t want to stay employed here longer than I have to.",07Jan2019,1

If she says that I did something that I didn't do, she won't take the truth for an answer and won't give in until I ""admit"" that I did whatever she said that I did. In her eyes, I'm lying about it if I trying to convince her of what really happened and the punishment is worse than if I just accept whatever she says. Along with this, when she's telling me off about anything, if I don't apologize enough and agree that I'm wrong and accept that she's right about everything, she tries to kick me out of the house. The threatening to kick me out of the house part didn't start happening until I was 16 or 17.

I took everything out, except I forgot the charger to my Switch by the side of my bed which faces the wall. Honest accident. My sister took it and I got mad that she took it. My mother told me that it was my fault because she told me to take anything of importance out of my bedroom, it didn't matter that I left it there on accident, and I had no right to be mad. Since I didn't have a fucking smile on my face she said that if I don't like it that I should just pack my shit and move out. For the rest of the night and today, she's played the silent treatment to me, but made comments to my father like ""a lot of changes are going to be made around here,"" meaning that because of me.   


I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he's annoyed with me because I've let this happen multiple times and just given in to her. I told him that I was going to wait the week and a half and just take all my stuff with me when I go back up to school, but he wants me to leave within the next couple days. I just feel like I'll be losing everything if I do this now, She'll eventually calm down enough to be tolerable to live with, but I'm just so full of anxiety with every movement I here her make. But if I go now, I'm cutting myself off from the entire family for good, I'll lose my phone plan, health, dental, and vision insurance, my job because I don't have a license, and everything. The only important document that I don't have is my birth certificate, but I can get a copy of that.

399,"Hello, everybody. Today, I bring you a strange issue that you might consider dumb and little, but it's seriously stressing me out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, the story goes as the title suggests, but I'll give you some more context. A few days ago, I posted on r/kik wanting a female text buddy, nothing more. Naturally, I turned down a few guys who thought I was some kind of living sex doll. (Also, someone made a comment on my post about me being a horrible person; this will come into play later.)

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last Friday, I wake up to \~70 messages in my Kik inbox, most with a flirty or, well, NSFW note to it. Mind you, that post was created around Christmas. So I do some digging with the horny guys, and it turns out, my Kik handle has been posted to a website called kikfriender in the ""sexting"" category with a fake location and profile picture. Yikes, what a great way to start a morning. Since then, I've asked the admins of kikfriender to take the profile down, but it resurfaced on kikfriender and another website similar to it. I have now messaged the admins of the other website and kikfriender again, asking to block the IP of the person uploading the profile. I didn't get a response yet. I don't have any hard clues on who might have done this, but my suspicions revolve around the guy that harassed me under my post and in my DMs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my question would be: If the admins of both websites refuse to block the IP for whatever reason (or if I'm being stupid thinking this will finally resolve the issue), can I do anything else? I don't want to make another Kik profile, as I use it for university a lot. Thanks in advance for the advice, and sorry for the long post. ",07Jan2019,1

404,"Hello all! Palmistry has been an interest of mine for years. It amazes me. It makes logical sense to me, I don't view palmistry as predictive whatsoever. Our palms represent our present and past. I will always be fascinated by its intricacies and will never give it up entirely, but I'm wondering if it is worth my time to become a proficient reader? I have a busy schedule as is and there are other things that might be more useful to spend valuable time on. 
In my daydreams, I get to read palms as a side gig, and it earns me a little money eventually and I get to genuinely help people! Which is my ultimate aim. Studying palmistry has helped me understand myself so much better and I would love to be able to help other people on their journeys. 
But in reality, I'm not sure I know how to make that happen. Even if I get very good at reading and learn everything, I'm not sure I will be able to find people who want this service. I live in a smaller city. Its hard to tell if this interest would ever be interesting to other people, or at all lucrative.  ",07Jan2019,1

About 2-3 months ago I met a girl in my university. We talked for a bit, met a couple of different times and I started to like her. I asked her out and she said yes, ofcourse (so obviously I was quite happy). Then we both agreed to meet next week.
Two days later, we both were at this party... another guy started dancing with her, but she was looking at me, shaking her head, because she didn't want to dance with him, but wanted to be nice. I did not make anything out of it.... until I had too much to drink. 
She disappears from my sight, so I just go to the guy she was dancing with. He says ""oh, you're looking for her? Don't bother, I already asked her out, she is not going with you"".
And so, I act like a child. Despite my friend's best efforts of trying to stop me, I find her and ask her ""what the hell is happening and why would she play me like that. Maybe she should choose one dude"" etc. 
Turns out, the guy was just fucking with me, but I was quite drunk and couldn't even realise that. She is obviously not impressed by my childish behaviour and calls the date off the next day, saying that she doesn't have time for it and also that I really acted like a child.

411,"I (35m), grew up with anxiety and generally a pessimistic view on life. I attribute that to being raised by young parents with mental health issue of their own, being bullied a lot, and growing up gay in a conservative town. Since then I’ve had a quite a bit of therapy and feel like I’ve come to terms with the past.

However, I now have a fantastic life that I’m very grateful for and struggle with negative thinking. I’m healthy, have a good relationship with my family. I have a great partner who is caring and respectful. I have a career I mostly enjoy, and am compensated very well for my work. I have the house, car and dog that I want. I have some great friends in my life. I volunteer for an organization. I get to travel often and so much more.  

My point is I have a good life and complain about the smallest things and always unhappy about something. I try not to verbalize most of it but I know it’s in my head and lately I find myself complaining to the people I’m closest to. I’m gripe about having to go to work, about needing to walk my dog, my food no being just right, how crowded a place I go to is, it’s really a bunch of petty pessimism.

I know how lucky I am and that I should be happy. I’m looking for advice on changing these negative thought patterns. I want to be a more optimistic person.

412,"Hi, throwaway account so if I don't get back to you or accidentally reply in my main, my bad

I'm 22M and ever since I left high school I've been in a slump. Year 12 was the start and I started feeling distant from everyone my age and wasn't included in a lot of things. This wasn't the worst as I've always felt like an outsider. This distance from people around me grew when I went into college for a year for a degree I never wanted. My mother put heavy pressure on me to go to post-secondary even though I didn't want to. I dropped out after getting into a lot of student debt, and have been working full time since then to be able to pay my rent and loans off. I find my work as a cook pretty fulfilling actually, but only because it brings me closer to other people. 

My point here is, I'm sick of feeling like an outsider in every friend circle I'm in, and want to start making meaningful connections with people. But I don't know how to meet new people. I don't like drinking, it makes me depressed and reveals all my insecurities. So bars aren't an option, and that's really the only way I can think of to meet people my age. How do you meet new people while working 40 hours? How did you get in and feel like an important part of your friend's life? Feels like if I died tomorrow I'd be forgotten by Friday.",07Jan2019,1

414," 

My bf and I have been together for a little over 2 years. He was always the sweetest guy ever with the biggest heart. He respects me and my family, cares about me, and is very generous. According to him, I was the first girl who came into his life that treated him nicely. His past relationships were all abusive and short lived. He did say ""I love you"" on the first date which raised a bit of a red flag, but I didn't think much of it until recently. A few weeks ago, I noticed I was falling out of love with him and could no longer picture a life with him. I also felt stuck knowing that his happiness depended on me. He'd always mention his life amounting to nothing without me and that he can't live without me. Before we met, he said he was miserable and his life was useless. Aside from that, he was my bestest friend I could talk about anything with. The physical attraction factor was minimal, but I stuck with him because he's a wonderful person and it didn't matter to me.

My family often told me I never deserved anyone but him since no guy would ever treat someone with my issues as well as he does. I believed them despite not feeling as much love for him as he did for me. Keep in mind, I tried to cut ties with him several months ago after I realized this, but he guilted me into staying.

Throughout the 2 years we've been together, he's given me lots of emotional support for my anxiety and phobias. He invested a lot of time and effort into keeping our relationship stable. He truly loved me and I appreciated everything he did for me.

After waiting it out and talking to him, I had hopes that my feelings for him would return and that I'd feel like being 100% committed to him for a lifetime, but this never happened so I decided to seriously bring up the idea of breaking up last week because I didn't want to continue lying to him and myself about my happiness in the relationship. I also didn't want to continue staying with him out of guilt and the possibility of bad karma happening afterwards.

This time around, he broke down and started bawling his eyes out. He mentioned jumping off the balcony once, having chest pain from what he thought was a heart attack and he also told me that I should kill him since his life is meaningless without me. I started crying with him and told him I'd get back together because I REALLY wanted him to be safe and happy. Not because I truly wanted to be with him.

Fast forward a week later and the topic of breaking up comes up again, because I still can't handle the idea of lying to him about my own happiness just so he can be happy. This time around he told me I shouldn't stay with him if it's just out of pity so we agreed to end it. A few hours after ending it, I get text messages from him asking me for my middle name since he's planning to write a will and add me to it. This immediately made me question his motives.. We never even lived together first of all... but to write a will all of a sudden made me worry about him wanting to take his own life. He didn't go to work on time today because of this. Otherwise, he's never been late to anything in his life. Last message I got from him was ""I need to work so I can pay for my will."" He refuses to answer my calls and he refuses to let me contact the police (since he wants to become one in the near future). He won't let me talk to his mom or his close friends either. He mentioned wanting to kill himself more if I do these things. Now I'm stuck here, constantly worrying about whether my bf will kill himself, losing sleep just thinking about it and having constant panic attacks. He told me that if I can't live without him, my love for him is nonexistent. His mom is old and which made him say that without me he will soon have no one. Any advice? I'm in desperate need of some.

Tldr: Bf of two years wants to write a will under my name (despite me never living under his roof) and is making me worried he'll commit suicide over a breakup. He's already quit his job and been messaging me constantly to ""stay with him if I care about him"". What should I do?",07Jan2019,1
415,"Without going into too many details - this is about a handicapped senior citizen in their 80s that is wheel chair bound at my work place. My work duties don't require me to tend to him too much, but since I am security of the property I'm always talking to everyone and taking reports.

Hes very lonely and my empathetic side caters and empathizes with lonely people. He has also been bullied at this property before for having radically different views compared to everyone there , so again I tend to try to look after those that are bullied. But him and I are very different and nearly opposites in the sense where - he's extremely conservative and predjudice.

Hes one of those Christians that thinks everyone that doesn't read the Bible and take up the Christian religion is going to hell. But even worse, he consistently talks shit about LGBT, African Americans, Escorts, Catholics, overweight people and even talks shit about the one other guy helping him (that also doesn't like him at this point).

It has gotten to the point where everyone in this particular property/community wants him gone and he has received an eviction notice for breaking several rules. But not even his own family wants to take him, so not sure how long the eviction will take. Myself and one other individual are the only ones that look out for him to a degree with everyone else pretty much wants him gone.

I look out for him because I feel sorry for a handicapped old man that is alone, but I can't stand his bigotry. And despite my patience, I feel I'm growing really tired of listening to his biggoted rants. I only spend a few minutes with him every other shift, but it still manages to bother me when he goes on his predjudice tangents. I disagree with almost everything he thinks but I say very little of what I really think with him.

But anyhow, how would you guys deal with this? I'm really tired of hearing his biggoted opinions, but I'm one of the only two people checking on him every now and then until he's evicted (which is likely to be maybe 2 more months at the most). As security of the property I consider myself a public servant and have to check on all the tenants to a degree, but I don't know how to address this particular one without being an asshole and telling him that I disagree with almost all his beliefs.

I’m 20 years old, and I never really had it too hard growing up. I’ve always been fortunate and grateful to have a loving immediate family, and I’ve never had to deal with many struggles that a lot of people in our society must go through. I know that I’m blessed to even be in the position I am today.

My issues are all personal, for the most part. I have some very intense internal struggles. I don’t believe I’m clinically depressed, but I do have long periods of depression every now and then. Never to the point of any suicidal thoughts, however. I’ve instilled a belief in myself a long time ago that suicide is simply never an option, no matter how difficult things may be.

I have an addiction to masturbation. I jerk off multiple times a day, sometimes to porn, sometimes to pictures. A lot of the time, I frequent places like Omegle or apps like Chatous to talk to people and get into role playing or sending pics videos. It’s something about communicating with real individuals that draws me to it. But I want to completely remove myself from those platforms for GOOD so that I don’t even have any temptations to use them. I’ve tried in the past, but I’ve been sucked in for like 5 years.

I don’t really have an “addiction” to weed, per se, but I likely smoke more than I should, and always at the wrong times (I.e. when I should be doing schoolwork, when I could be going to the gym, etc. etc.) Can somebody recommend a good system to try to help me not smoke multiple times a day, but rather a few times a week?

I’ve also noticed lately that I just spend too much damn time on my phone. Like 6 plus hours a day. I’m always on it for hours before I go to sleep, which makes it harder for me to fall and stay asleep.

I’ve been going to bed usually around 1 AM, and not waking up until 10:30, 11, sometimes even noon. I can’t get out of bed the moment I wake up. I’m not sure why. I just choose to lay their instead because I look at my clock and it often feels like it’s just “too early” for me to wake up.

I just waste a lot of time doing a whole lot of nothing, it seems. I also often feel like I lack free will, like I just don’t have control over my actions or my life. But then I tell myself that’s just my mind coming up with an excuse for all the stupid shit I do.

428,"I’m a mobile user, I apologize for the format.

I should first explain the way our home is set up.  It’s a one level ghetto little house with two units.  The first unit is at the front of the house, the second unit is level with the first and was built onto the back of the house.  The second unit’s door is in the backyard, in the centre of the house.  There’s a laundry room that connects to both units allowing movement back and forth from both units without having to go outside.  In order for someone to access the second unit they have to walk through the driveway that’s right in front of my living room and bedroom windows.  My dogs bark at the sight or sound of anything or anyone in the driveway.  I occupy the first unit, my best friend occupies the second.  

A year ago my friend was receiving weird phone calls.  We concluded that it was a mentally ill man who had some obsession with the previous owner (Stephanie) of my friend’s fairly new cell phone number.  He’d basically pretend my friend was named Stephanie and say sexual things.  We found out Stephanie was a real person and definitely the last owner of the cell number, her place of work left voicemails for her and addressed her by name.  We assume she changed her number because of this weirdo.

A few weeks after persistent phone calls from the weirdo dude began, we started hearing noises in the backyard at night.  There was one occasion where my friend was home alone, there was a knock at the door, but no one was seen.  The shed door and windows were found wide open at times.  Voices were often heard, but weren’t clear enough to understand.  Except once when I was in the second unit alone (it’s common for my friend and I to be in each other’s units alone, we watch each other’s dogs and stuff).  I heard a knock on the door followed by someone whispering my name.  My friend’s dogs heard it too as they ran to the door and barked.  No one was there when I opened the door.

It’s worth mentioning that sometime during all this my friend and I were followed by a black car while walking in our hood on two occasions.  Lots of hookers in the area, we figured it must be some John out looking.


Fast forward a few months.  My friend changes her number due to the weirdo constantly calling and referring to her as Stephanie.  My friend has a male roommate move in (I’ve had a male flavour of the week living with me in the first unit most months that I’ve lived here).  Things die down.

We had a wild summer, even if something creepy had happened we wouldn’t have noticed or were too drunk to remember.

December comes and my friend’s roommate moves out.  He leaves two motorcycles in the backyard chained up and arranges to store them there.  Within 2 weeks of the roommate moving out my friend is awoken by tapping at her bedroom window and her name being whispered.

My long term flavour of the week and I were away from home for several hours on December 22, 23, 25, 26, and 31st.  My friend was away for several hours on the 25th.  On the night of the 31st my friend observed the fence leading to the backyard and her unit was left open.  On January 3rd we noticed one of the motorcycles had been unchained and stolen.  Shitty season to steal a bike if you ask me, but okay.

January 4th my friend has a boy come over.  Dude didn’t leave until the morning of the 6th.  On the 5th her and the boy went to grab food and were gone for about half an hour.  Upon arriving home she sees her bedroom window is wide open.  Nothing missing, no one inside, just the window wide the frig open like we’re hearing the outdoors.

This brings us to today (the 6th); well yesterday now.  My long term flavour of the week has had almost a month off of work for the holidays but this morning was his first day back.  He left at 5am and won’t be back until the evening of the 7th.  This leaves my friend and I alone in the house.  I’ve felt weird all day.  I actually ran out of the bathroom with my pants down earlier because I heard a noise that sounded like someone trying to get in my front door.  

My friend and I lock up and go to my mandatory Sunday dinners with an organization that helps us both with applying to schools and me with learning to be a productive member of society, but that’s a whole other story.  On our way home we stop by a friend’s place.  We stay for an hour or so until his mom got home all mad and Latin.  

We get home, watch 90 Day Fiancé together in the second unit.  We got McDonald’s coupons in the mail and around 11pm decided we could pool our money together and get meals with the coupons.  I felt like McDonald’s would be so much better if I was stoned so I started smoking a joint.

Halfway through my joint there was a knock at the door.  I assumed it was the police and immediately threw the joint across the room.  Weed is legal here and there was no reason for the police to be here, I’m just absolutely terrified of the police and always think they’re coming to get me.

There’s no outside light in the backyard.  There’s a big window on the door though.  When the lights are on inside you can’t see outside, but if you were outside you’d be able to see the inside of the second unit’s main area clear as day.  My friend walked up to the door and asked, “Who is it?”, twice.  No response.  I run through the laundry room to my unit.  I look out the window and see no cars out front and no one on foot.

We return to the back door.  We open it a crack.  There’s a note outside on the ground a foot away from the door.  I grab a can of mace and cover my friend while she grabs the note.  It reads, “Call is you want to stay safe :) 7*********”.  We call the number a few times before getting through.  It went to voicemail at first and we learned it was a TextNow app number.  When the person answers they just breath heavily and whisper things we weren’t able to understand.  At this point both of my dogs are flipping out in the first unit and my friend’s dogs were flipping out in the second unit where we were.  The motion sensor lights in front of and on the side of the house are going on and off constantly.  Tons of noises were heard.

We’re scared at this point.  We call the police.  We watch out the front window of the first until as the police show up.  As soon as they arrived and just before they let their dog out, my friend gets a text.  It says, “Thanks for playing”.  The police search the house, except for one of the rooms in my unit.  They have their dog sniff around and do his thing.  They search the yard, the neighbors yards, and the school across the street.  Nothing.  The advise is that this is all very fucked.  They told us to call if anything happens, install cameras, and told us not to stay here alone.  Unfortunately we’re way too poor to afford cameras and we don’t have anywhere to go.  Thankfully they’ve been keeping an eye on our house and driving past when they can.

So about that advice.  What should we do to make our home safe that doesn’t cost a lot of money?  Is there a way to trace TextNow numbers?  What can we do to find out who left the note?

A few things to note.  The whispers have all been incredibly hard to understand and tell if it’s a boy or a girl.  The writing on the note looks familiar, it’s almost identical to my writing.  The area we live in is rough.  This person knows my friend’s number and address, even knows her unit is around back.  When we went outside with the police the fence was closed, the police confirmed they didn’t close it.  If they had opened the gate to walk in they would’ve had to close it on their way out.  The fence is supper ghetto and it takes a solid 2 minutes of swearing to get it closed.  Had they taken the time to close it we probably would’ve see the person from the window.  This to me tell me the person would’ve had to step over the fence, which is doable for someone tall.",07Jan2019,1
429,"I am not sure whether I am boundary setting or being selfish. I am the eldest of my siblings. My little brother (the only boy in the family) is the ""troubled"" sibling -- he has depression and anxiety for which he takes medication, has crashed cars, dropped out of school, etc. We are not very close, but he lives in the same city as I do. Last summer we had a huge fight in front of some of my friends that culminated in him threatening to harm himself and accusing me of being selfish, unsympathetic, etc. He then told me that I wasn't even his real sister anyway (we're half siblings). We sort of made up a few months later, but it was mostly for the sake of our mom who was super upset about us not talking to each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past August, he unexpectedly dropped his cat off at my house -- he said it would only be for two weeks max because his roommates were being shitty. ""OK."" I thought because I wanted to be helpful. Fastforward to six months later and the cat is still with me -- I had to bring her to the vet and pay for some emergency procedure (which he didn't fully pay me back for) and am just generally annoyed that I have a pet I didn't ask for (costs, the upkeep). 

&amp;#x200B;

On Christmas eve, I pick him up at some random place he's crashing at because his roommates kicked him out. He asks me to help him move out. No heads up. No opportunity for me to say no. So he has all his stuff in my car for a few days. The whole time we are at my mom's house, I just KNOW he's about to ask me if he can crash at my house. Lo and behold, he asks if he can stay with me for a night or two while he figures out his living situation (he promises he has a plan). It's Jan 7 and he's still at my house. He tells me he's having trouble finding a place. But I am exasperated! He's turned the whole front part of my house into a mess. Broke some of my furniture. He doesn't feed or clean up after his cat (who pees on the furniture when the box goes uncleaned). Last night I found a bunch of coke just casually on my living room's coffee table (I don't have a problem with casual drug use; but I am MAD as hell that he's spending irresponsibly when I'm the one footing all the bills and now have the extra expense of HIM and his cat. This was easily over $100 worth. I also feel disrespected that he leaves his things scattered everywhere). This morning he told me he lost his phone two days ago so he hasn't been able to look for apartments. When I called him out on the coke and how he hasn't been trying at ALL to clean up after himself/find stable housing, he called me ""rude."" RUDE?!? I am at my wit's end. I \*know\* he has a mental illness and I'm supposed to be there for him, but at what point am I being taken advantage of? I would be happy to help if I thought he was taking steps to work things out, but I feel that he thinks I'm going to be like our mom and turn a blind eye because he's my little brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, I have had my own battles with depression, but was lucky to access therapy through my work/school. Having him in the house puts me in a bad place mentally. He speaks at me in ways that are straight up triggering. I'm the eldest sibling and the ""good one,"" so I understand it's my duty to be there for him...but what is the limit? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of telling him that he and his cat need to be out by the 31st.

432,"Quick backstory: 

I work in real estate and my landlord is a coworker who I was never close with but we get along well enough. Our relationship was never really more than ""Hi how's your day going?"" and he became my landlord when my husband had to suddenly move into town for a job. I am on maternity leave. He did us some pretty big favours by giving us first pick (he didn't show the place to anyone else. Super low vacancy so in 3 days of it being vacant he had 10 applicants),given us reduced rent by $50 a month, and we did not have to sign a lease so we are monthly.

So here's the deal:

He forgot to inform us that the heat tape for the top of the building is tied to our unit. I discovered this after looking at our electrical bill and noticing that we were using astronomical amounts of energy (50-60kwh). We turned off all heat and everything else for a day to experiment and it only brought our usage down to 39 kwh. It was so cold in our place we could see our breath.

I asked him if anything extra was tied to our unit and it turns out it's the heat tape. He apologized for forgetting about it. We turned it off and our usage has dropped to 18-21 kwh which is reasonable winter usage. 

The weather here has been so mild there is no reason for the tape to be on and we would like to ask him if there is anything he can do to help us offset this big bill coming our way next month. Essentially we will be paying the high tier rate for 6 weeks due to how much the tape used already. How can I politely word it though? I totally understand if he cant do anything and we just have to eat the cost but i figure it doesn't hurt to ask, does it?

It was just a dumb joke at the time but while I was on their spotify page I noticed that they had a 70th anniversary album. It piqued my interest and I decided to listen to a few songs. At first I thought it was funny and laughed a bit but as I listened to it more I started to like it and by November I almost exclusively listened to 2 of their albums. I have no idea what they are saying as I don't speak Russian and my friends and family have no idea. I realized just how much I listened to them when I saw my page on spotify wrapped. Keep in mind this is only since October.

The more it becomes a reality rather than a simple dream I’ve carried with me all these years, the more I start to feel nervous and fearful thoughts creep into my conscious mind.


I start to question if I can do this — If I can leave my hometown, comfort zone, and everything I’ve ever known to chase a life I’ve always wanted to live.


How can I feel into the fear (because I know I can’t avoid it entirely), transform it into something positive, and not let it keep me confined to this state I have longed to separate myself from?

441,"My father is in a terrible abusive relationship (this is the 7th year). His girlfriend is totally nuts, she screams at the top of her lungs when she is angry and lashes out physically against my dad and her daughters (she has three, I’ve only known of her slapping the two eldest when thy disobey.

She has full force kicked my dad to the ground (she used to do kickboxing), scratched his face until it bleeds, punched him, thrown a fuse at his head from the top of the stairs, and more that I’m sure I’ve forgotten. 

My dad isn’t a small guy, and of course all of this insanity makes him angry. To my knowledge he’s never hit her back (he’s put her in a headlock when she’s screaming and punching), but I am afraid that one day he will lose his temper back and kill her. 

Three years ago they had a child together, his name is Jacob and I love him so much. I can already see that his environment is shaping him, as he has terrible anger issues and punches and screams when he is upset. 

*It’s important to note that the other children in the house aren’t doing well.

The 17 yr old: Skips school to get high, has lots of boyfriends and considers herself gangster.

The 15 yr old: Used to love school, but now hates it and is dating an 18 yr old guy who is in jail.

The 8 yr old: Completely introverted and under-socialized, is failing in school and is gaining weight because she only eats snacks and rarely has a proper dinner.*


I moved a year ago because I found out that my dad was doing cocaine with his girlfriend (again) and I couldn’t handle the mental strain of watching him destroy his life. 

I think he’s stopped the drugs, but whatever I do I can’t seem to get him out of his cycle of abuse with this woman and I feel totally powerless. 

The most recent event:
They had broken up so my dad was sitting in the car while I unloaded the trunk of her stuff. She came out swearing and screaming at me, then at my dad, then when she saw all the stuff I had taken out she screamed that it wasn’t all hers.

Me, just wanting to get the hell out of there, closed the trunk. She threw her arm under it to stop it and then cried out that I had broken her arm and she was going to report me to the police. 

I decided then was a good time to walk to my grandparents, but I was so scared that one of them would actually kill the other.

Three days later my dad is asking me to forgive her because he wants to get back together.


**I’m so scared for what my brother’s life is going to be like, and what kind of monster this situation is going to turn him into.

If I fought and won custody I know I could raise him properly and in a safe place, but the financial and mental strain of me and my boyfriend would be intense. 

Children’s Aid has been involved for years, but would a foster home really be better? I’ve heard so many horrible stories of abuse from those places.

448,"Hello everyone, I have hit a crossroads and could really use some advice. Allow me to explain.

I currently live in WV and have lived here my entire life. I graduated from my university and also got married 2 years ago, I have been working in the area since. I have never been comfortable living in the state, I have always wanted to live in or near a somewhat larger city than WV has to offer. During college, my then-girlfriend wholeheartedly agreed with me and we decided that we would stay somewhat close to home but live in a city like Raleigh, Cincinnati, Columbus, or Pittsburg, just to name a few. Unfortunately, after graduating I was not able to find a job outside of WV (poly sci major, looking at human resources or sales) so I accepted a position locally for the time being. My wife also accepted a position at her old high school where her parents currently work. 

Flash forward 2 years, my wife no longer wants to leave the state, she is comfortable being close to her family. In the meantime, I feel like I am languishing in my current job and I am honestly desperate to live in another area. I have decided on Cincinnati or Columbus as they are only about 2 and a half hours from our current location. I see in those places a better job market, the chance for a growing career, more activities in the area, better housing market, and generally just a better place to start a family. I don't want my wife to be miserable if I drag her to another state, but I honestly think I'll risk the same with myself if I choose to stay here.

I called Zoe out on this and she didn’t like that and we argued with each other which went to cursing each other out then i told her to cut it out and she tried to attack me I caught her fists defending myself and let go as she was pulled away.

That was why I got into trouble and but when I was called in my our course teacher they asked everyone to write a witness report and after she collected them all she told me what the reports said, they said It was all my fault they lied about what really happened and even my friend who I’ve know for a long time did too.  It was heartbreaking to hear that, it really messed me up inside I thought I could trust these guys but in the end I was betrayed but I got back up from all of that but ever since then I’ve had a hard time trusting people and being my normal positive self I told a good friend of mine about it, he said are “you sure she isn’t racist? I mean look at it all of the were white and you were the only black kid in the group im not saying she is but just think about it “ It definitely took along time for this wound to heal but I don’t know what to do I’ve had a ton of support from my family, close friends but I just can’t seem to breakout of this negative, distant, hostile mood I’m in.

458,"(I was asleep for the initial incident at the opposite end of the house, so my recount of the story is according to my roommate (Benji) who stays in a room downstairs next to the roommate in question (Karl). Names have been changed but alternate names are provided to make the story easier to understand.)

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday at around 3 in the morning, my downstairs roommate (Karl) started listening to music at high volume. My other roommate who lives downstairs (Benji) went over and knocked on Karl's door, asking him to turn down the music so he could sleep. The music was turned down and Benji went back to his room to go back to sleep. 

Not even five minutes later Karl comes bursting through Benji's door in a fit of rage, screaming about how Benji ""doesn't know who he is"", that he is going to ""get his men with guns on the East Coast to come over here and fuck his shit up"" and that he is going to steal and smash Benji's stuff. The yelling went on for a while, at which point Karl left Benji's room and then came back five minutes later to do it all over again. Eventually Karl ended up leaving Benji alone and they both went to sleep. The next morning Karl left for work and hasn't been back to the house since. 

I heard about this in the morning, when my boyfriend (Taylor) told me (Sienna) that ""Karl yelled at Benji last night for asking him to turn his music down"", which I thought was strange but didn't think much of it. What we didn't know (and found out later that morning) is exactly what Karl had told Benji and that he had actually threatened him with gun violence. After hearing that, all of us were shook. This kind of behavior is out of character for Karl, as we've always known him to be a very chill person with no sign of a temper like that. Taylor works with Karl (Benji used to work with both of them as well) and neither had seen this kind of behavior from him before. 

After talking it over with my other roommates (there's four of us excluding Karl: Taylor, me(Sienna), Benji and Sam) we decided it to be best to remove Karl from the household as none of us remained comfortable having him live there with us after those kinds of threats. On the advice of my mom, Benji filed a police report and a few hours later the police came to our house to discuss the situation. Even though gun violence was threatened, they told us we are still under obligation legally to give him ten days to find another place to stay and have to give him full access to the house until ten days is over. We officially sent notice to him yesterday that we are giving him ten days to gather his things and find a new place.

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend has been very hard on all of us, and until this situation is dealt with and Karl has left our house we all feel very uncomfortable being there. We're trying to keep at least one person at the house to keep watch in the event that Karl does come back and try to take any of our things with him or tries to cause damage to our things when he gets his stuff and leaves. None of us have had a good sleep in our house over the past couple of days. Personally, having been the victim of armed robbery a few years ago, I am reliving flashbacks of that incident (which was also around this time of year) and am trying to cope with irrational thoughts that he is going to come back to our house with guns and shoot us. Overall, this incident has left us all in a bad place and we are trying to cope with it but are at a loss of what to do next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on the situation is greatly appreciated: What should we do next and what are we within our rights to do? Trying to live with these thoughts for the next ten days seems unbearable and not knowing what Karl is capable of scares us even more. ",07Jan2019,1
459,"Well to start off I'm a 14 year old teen that loves gaming.I got a ps4 slim 2 years ago for Christmas which I am grateful for and can't imagine my life without it.So recently my ps4 stopped working. A disk was stuck but I managed to get it out by manually ejecting it It worked perfectly fine until this happened. So yesterday my aunt and I went to best buy to see what they could do about it, and they said that we should send it to sony to see what they could do about it since it's there product and I can't trade it in since it's ""broken"". They also said if it's a defect, sony can fix it for free but if the damage is my fault then I'll get charged for getting it fixed. Also I heard that the shipping takes a long time for the ps4 to get to sony and back which sucks. I've also thought about just taking it to an electronic repair shop and get it fixed there. Both sound like risky things to do to me and I don't even know where I'm suppose to send my ps4?? All the way to Japan, sony headquarters or another sony corporation here in California?? SO that's confusing and I really need some advice right now since these things are really expensive.

464,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I know how awful it will sound but here we go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I´m 35 years old, female, and still with my parents. I have studied and finished a Master studies and after my studies I moved home with my parents. The plan was to stay there until I find a job. Unfortuantely, my great degree was completely useless and I was unemployed for quiete some time. After a while, I got a job, but it just worked for six months and that was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I foolishly decided to study something with Business Administration on top since my last Masters degree was completely useless. So thats why I prolonged my plan on staying home longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job now but it is social works, so nothing which has to do with my degree in business administration. Work is badly paid and only for 20 hours a week with no prospects of increasing the working hours per week. I am applying all the time, but due to my age I suppose, I never get even an invitation to a job interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I´m very frustrated. My job only gets me about 1000 Euro a month after taxes. I live in a small town. Here are a lot of companies I keep applying to without any luck so far. I took a helping job in gastronomy but it is not very stable as they only call me when it gets really busy. 

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine gets a new place and he offered me his old place. It´s difficult to find a place to stay at by the way which might be a little affordable for my means. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I can decide to move out, but live with lots of expenses for rent, car, groceries and insurance which I just barely can pay and cant save anything, but I´d have a own place. Dont get me wrong, my parents are good to me and dont pressure me to move out but I just feel like a complete failure being a grown ass adult without an own place. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side I can stay and save the money as I havent had much savings anyway throughout my life because I wasted so much time on studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do... ",07Jan2019,1
465,"I'm currently a hairdresser. I love most aspects of my job but it's not making the money like I had hoped it would. Also customers are a bit hard to handle sometimes. I've tried sucking it up and getting tougher, but I've been in customer service jobs since I was 14 and if I can't take it now I probably never will. And relying on others for my income is very stressful.

After applying to multiple receptionist type jobs, I haven't had any luck, and I decided it's probably best to go finish my computer science degree (I'm 30% done). I still have all my credits earned in 2014.

My question is, am I being stupid? Am I wasting money? My fiance has not been super supportive. I think he thinks I will be wasting money. The main reason I need a better income is because I have goals, I want to buy a house (our kids are 8 and 10 and we have always been in apartments that have issues) and I'm worried about retirement - most hair companies don't provide a 401k or decent benefits. He is having a hard time taking steps to help accomplish these goals. I love him to pieces and I'm sick of being a nag so I figure I'll just do it by myself. 

In his defense I have jumped around quite a bit on what I want to do for work but I never was worried about these things before. Now that I'm in my 30's the future is starting to worry me. 

Also I'm going to take my placement test tomorrow as well, should I do anything in particular to prepare? It's been a while! 

TL;DR: Is it a bad idea to go to school for a better career being 30 years old? Is it a waste of money? And general advice on getting ready to go back to school/placement testing (especially math).

472,"So there's this guy I work with who is honestly one of the stupidest, if not the stupidest, person I've ever known. Yet at the same time he can be one of the nicest people I know and it's good to have friends I guess.

Just some examples of his recent stupidity:

* asking me to find a place to buy a fake police badge so he bang a hooker and get out of paying (I highly doubt any hooker is going to believe his claim once he opens his mouth anyway)

* a visiting friend of his asked him if he had any extra license plates since the friend collected them from the various states he's visited. Of course he doesn't, so what does he do? Go to a rental car parking lot to steal one for his friend. And then ask me on Monday whether the TSA would check it and if he would get caught.

* he fell for one of those Android malware ads and installed some random app because a website told him to

* he fell for one of those ""horny singles near you"" ads

* he bought a birthday cake for a girl who he had a crush on but really didn't know personally and made it awkward

* he received a court summons demanding for a lawsuit demanding him pay back some credit card debt and showed me the order to ask if it was legitimate. Well I asked him if he's ever had that credit card and if he owed any money on it... he didn't know.

* he ran some ""massage"" business in the past and advertised on Backpage using his real phone number. And now he's freaking out his future dates find out about it... who the fuck uses their actual phone number to put sex ads

Yet he's a nice person most of the time. He volunteers and helps new immigrants while also going out of his way to help others. Like if I need help, I know I can rely on him because he's a good person. It's just I end up having to help cover for him and his utterly stupid things.

I guess if we boil this down to ""is it worth keeping him as a friend"" the answer is ""no"" because he doesn't have anything to offer me and can't help me reach my goals. Yet, I don't think that's the right metric to be used when determining if someone should be a friend or not - that just feels non-genuine and makes it seem like all of my friends have to have some use to me. Ditching someone because they're stupid seems harsh too, especially when they're a nice person otherwise.

But within the past 3 months or so, I've noticed I've gotten really jealous of her and some of the drawn porn he looks at and makes (he's an artist like me). I've just felt so insecure because I am a bit on the chubbier side (190lbs and 5'9"") and this cosplayer is ridiculously sexy. The biggest thing i'm struggling with is the face that she has boobs close to double Ds whereas I'm a B cup bordering on a C cup if I'm lucky. I know he thinks she's sexy and she's not the only sexy cosplayer he follows. Not to mention the fact that all the porn he looks at is usually women with huge boobs.

483,"TL;DR at the bottom, folks.

My first day freshman year of college I met my roommate Kendall.  We were VERY different people from the start—she was an outgoing party girl from New Jersey obsessed with going to the gym, tanning and Ed Hardy, I’m from New England, fairly reserved and was a theater nerd at the time. For whatever reason, we became inseparable and developed this sort of eclectic friend group. At the end of the year she ended up transferring to a school that had the major she wanted but we remained good friends. As school went on, I drifted away from that original friend group we formed (as often happens at school) and became closer with other people. After graduating, she moved Pennsylvania; I ended up in northern Virginia.

It’s been nearly 9 years since we were freshman. A lot of my relationships from that time are relegated to occasional texts and well wishes or catching up over social media. This is fine. We all have our own different lives now and accept that.

Except Kendall. After she graduated, she would try and organize “reunions” a couple times/year with our old freshman friend group. Mind you, we’re all living in different cities across the U.S. so it takes a lot of coordinating. It’s also kind of uncomfortable given that most of the group didn’t spend time together towards the end of college and we would rather use our weekends to do something different. Even when the group text is basically silent to her reunion propositions, she has been persistent.

Once or twice we’ve been able to have one-on-one meet-ups.  Those are fine but also illustrate just how different we are as adults in our mid to late-20s. We don’t really like to do the same things anymore or have the same interests so it feels kind of forced. I’m not saying that we can’t be friends because of that—I have plenty of friends with very different interests. The issue is how much she wants to “meet up” and spend time with me even when living over 8 hours from each other. I live far from my parents, my brother, my future in-laws and because of that, me and my fiancé are extremely judicious with our travel time and expenses.  Beyond that, this just feels to me like a friendship that sort of run its course…

Kendall is a really kind person and I appreciate how much she valued that time and our friendship but I don’t know that I have the capacity to maintain this relationship in the way she would like (or in a way that I would like for that matter). My current solution has just been telling her I’m always busy with work/weddings/my own wedding but she continues to request these reunions or get-togethers. I don’t want to ghost her exactly but this doesn’t seem like it’s sustainable.

My question is, how do I start to “drift” from this person without being an asshole? Am I being unreasonable to want to spend more time on other relationships that are important to me?

TL;DR: old college friend has been hanging on to our friendship even though we’ve grown apart. I feel like I’m ready to move on but she is not.",07Jan2019,1
484,"Backstory summary: Unexpected family death, suicide attempt close to each other. Lost memory of a lot of past events afterwards.

Lets call the other version of me Briar. He was a drastically different person. He had quit nicotine, happy, worked out regularly, grateful and always smiling. He was content with change, loved reading, and had different interests and motivations than now.

Nothing major has changed since then, aside from I'm using nicotine again (ecigs this time) and not working out. But I feel like a completely different person with completely different perspective. It feels like a 360 that started when I begun smoking again. My interests are back from before Briar, I'm disinterested in anything Briar was into. My perspectives are different from Briar, I argue different from Briar, my temper is different from Briar. It's as if I completely surpressed Briar when I started smoking again. As if I chose to push him down.

So pretty much every friend I ever had got sick of me telling them no when they asked to hang out, and figured I just didn't wanna hang out with them. So over time, I stopped making friends completely. I figured there was something wrong with me and developed a massive inferiority complex over it. This led to me getting severe social anxiety to the point where I could hardly talk to anyone. I almost jumped off a balcony when I was in 5th grade on vacation in Florida. I had one foot over, and saw my life flash before my eyes. Immediately, I realized my whole life I was lonely, and if only I found love, I would become whole again, and experience true happiness. I had a reason to live again. My mom later told me she saw straddling the balcony... But figured I was just sleepwalking, so didn't say anything. 

Flash forward to high school. I got a car when I was 16, and that's when everything changed. Suddenly, I didn't have to ask my parents if I could hang out, and I was making friends. I was hanging out with my friends every day, but still, felt I needed to experience love to find happiness. And then I met her. She was so beautiful, and funny, and smart and strong. I fell head over heels in love with her. I had found true happiness and have never felt the same ever since. After 2 years together, she joined the army. I was set on having a long term relationship until she got out. But then I found out she cheated on me while she was away. But I still loved her, I didn't care. And we got through it... But then when she came back from the army, she ghosted me. I was devastated, but I tracked her down and demanded answers. And then she told me she had Lupus, and would probably only live another 15 years. I didn't care, I loved her and wanted to spend as much time with her as I could... I came to find out much later that there's no way they would have let her stay in the military, and telling patients with an unpredictable terminal illness how long they have to live is a big no no for doctors. She lied. It was so difficult coming to terms with the idea that the love of my life was not only dying slowly. You can't find closure when a person you love is slowly dying. The grief was never ending. It gave me PTSD and I haven't been the same ever since. I was suicidal. I thought about killing myself on an hourly basis. from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep I was completely miserable. 

I'm married now, and have a baby. It's been 10 years since I seen my ex. I love my wife, but it bothers me that she's fat and not very attractive. When I first met  her, it was just for hookup sex, and that was the intention. But we fell in love with each other's personalities. I didn't want a fat gf, but she had already lost 100 lbs before we met and was set on getting fit. I figured in a few years, she would become fit and beautiful. After about a year, she had gained 30lbs... But then she started working out daily and eating shakes as meals. She lost 40 lbs in 6 months, and then she got pregnant. I didn't want a kid, but she gave me the choice, and I decided to have him because I imagined what it would be like if my parents aborted me. She's been working out regularly lately and losing weight and her body is changing. She's becoming more and more beautiful every month. 

I would never cheat on my wife. Never. But after I saw my ex, I keep fantasizing about talking to her and getting back together with her even though she's married too. I honestly don't care that she's a pornstar. If I could make a shitload of money having sex with beautiful women on camera I would probably do it too. And I think it's unfair to be hypocritical about that sort of thing.

 I just feel so heartbroken by the fact that I can't be with her and it makes no sense to me. She gave me PTSD by making me think she was dying and left me feeling like an empty shell of a human being. Why do I still feel love for her? ",07Jan2019,1

I’m a 15 year old in Oregon and due to severe anxiety/depression &amp; attention issues, I’ve decided to drop out of school after this year.

Online school hasn’t worked for me and I’ve even tried credit recovery classes &amp; on campus class 3 hrs a day, 4 days a week. My mom told me this morning that she thinks I’m going to be working a dead end job for the next 60 years, which immediately killed any hope I had of being successful.

my situation is the following 

I had a little accident with my bike in 2017 where I cause damage worth about 5k € when I slipped on ice an rammed into a expensive car 

The problem is insurance only played 2500 and my parents helped me with 1000 

I slowly payed that of with 50 a month but after 5 months the guy who owned the car said he needed all of the money now and I am in debt now (about 1000€ left)

My problem is I only get 518€ in my job training 
I need about 490 for all the stuff I have to pay for like rent cat food and all that stuff

495,"Hi, I’m Ryan (17y/o) and I quite frankly have no idea how to handle this situation, and neither does my dad.
Context: My gma (87y/o), fell the other night and broke a few ribs, and also hit her head on a fireplace, giving her concussive symptoms. She was already hard enough to care for prior to the accident, and is now indefinitely harder to care for. My gpa (84y/o) has either dimensia or Alzheimer’s (undiagnosed) but the symptoms from which he suffers are painful visible. Because of this he has frequent fits, or even temper tantrums, during which he yells at my gma and storms out of the house. The mental problems that plague my gpa further prevent him or my gma from being put into a “folkies home” and from having a maid or caretaker that would be hired. My extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) are of no help in any way and frankly appear to not care. My dad can’t quite spare time or afford to spare time as he is having financial problems, and health problems as well. Life appears to be falling apart lol. My dad and myself are left to run across town 4-5 times a day to do various things for my gma. My gma can’t even use the most simplistic phone due to her increased “brain fog” and inability to comprehend anything (mainly due to her accident), leaving her unable to contact anybody if my gpa storms out. School is starting up soon and that’s going to through an XL wrench into all of this, because I’ve been running errands that my dad no longer has time to do as a result of my gma’s need for care, and I will no longer be able to do those tasks. Quite frankly, and it pains me to think this, but I doubt she’ll live through the month. I just don’t see how it would be possible. Between her and my gpa, they make it impossible to help them in any way, shape, or form, and I’m out of options. It is very evident that my dad doesn’t even know what to do, regardless of him trying to act as he does. Any help/advice is immensely appreciated.",07Jan2019,1

Depression got worst and through it I decided that maybe I should go study again something else


I am currently in school again for comp eng

But throughout this school semester the art burnout I had post graduation left and I've been working on stuff and enjoying it. Enjoying it to the point where I currently want to work in the industry again.

Either that or spend 7 years studying something else that I am interested in.

So I am about to start the 2nd semester and I thought to myself: ""I'll take less classes and work on projects for my reel and apply to jobs. If I get a job I'll take it""

But then I suddenly started over thinking all this. ""Oh here we go again, back to the cycle of starting something and not finishing it"" like I always do. I never finish anything and cant make up my mind. I am 23 HOW DO I STOP THIS I FEEL SO LOST.

What if I take the job and 3 months in I want out and want to go back to school to then regret it again and panic.

499,"I work at a place with multiple stations and formerly I was working for the minimum wage in one area, but now I am mostoy bartending and I'm working for the tipped wage on the nights I do. On Sunday nights, however, my boss has me working two jobs, one as bartender and one at the front counter.

Last night I tried to offer him a concern about this staffing issue. Not only did he freak out on me and say that he was going to take away my bar shifts, but he also said, ""I thought we had better staff, but I guess not,"" and that I ""went way too low"" and that I was ""greedy"" for mentioning that I should be paid the minimum to ask for the minimum wage because I'm doing two jobs.

This asshole is literally paying me $8 an hour to do what two people should be doing for a combined $19 an hour, yet I am the bad help. All of this doesn't even factor in the fact that we are stretched too thin and my service quality dips because I can't be serving drinks and up at the counter simultaneously, which obviously means customers aren't going to tip me very well because they have to wait for me to serve them a lot of the time.

We need four people on Sunday, but we're only going to be having three. Having 75% of the necessary help has a big effect on service quality, makes the business look dumb, and makes the employees feel incompetent, but when I said this to him he said that I wasn't trying hard enough. 

He was so mad, so in an effort to calm down the situation I apologized for my complaint. I wish I wouldn't have done that because now it looks like I'm admitting that I was wrong.

502,"So the past few years my mental state has gotten worse and worse up to the point of attempting suicide twice about a year ago. Soon after, I met a girl and we started dating, she was everything I had ever wanted in a girlfriend. 

About 3 months ago she broke up with me because her feelings for me had disappeared. At first I was okay with this but now, a few months later, I'm realizing how much she meant to me and how much I needed her in my day to day life. I needed her to be there because everyone else I had close to me left me after the suicide attempts.

So now, more alone than I've ever been, I've kept going in the same direction as when she was with me, that meaning getting a job. (Not the easiest task since I dropped out of highschool a year ago) After some time I found a job as a phone salesman, working for some of the nicest and best people I've ever met. I recently got home from the first day and while it went relatively well, I can't stand the thought of going back there because the work itself was really stressful and uncomfortable. Normally I would have powered through this with support from those I love, but I have nobody left for that so I don't think I can do it. It all just feels pointless because I can feel myself falling back to the place I was at mentally last year. And I don't want to quit the job and dissapoint the super nice people at work who set everything up for me.

Ok so, long story short, I just found out one of my male friends is trans and is also into guys. I am one of the few who knows this truth. We've been talking for a few days and I've never experienced this before but I am trying to be supportive of him, have asked some questions because I obviously had some. 

My question right now is, is it appropriate to ask if he's ever spoken to a doctor or psychiatrist about any of this? 

It's coming from a place of concern and worry and of me trying to help. He has felt this way for a very long time, and I always see very alarming stats about transsexuals and suicide and it worries me. His mental state is not and has not been in the best shape while I've known him. Depression, anxiety, no motivation, can't/won't hold a job, just to name a few. Which makes more sense as to why that possibly is now. So I'm wondering if talking to a pro would be beneficial for him or am I being offensive?

There is a big TL;DR at the bottom, but I also made ones for the long sections. I know it’s a wall of text, so I hope that helps those of you who only want to skim!

&amp;#x200B;

**Question/Advice Topic at hand**: I am currently in my second year of grad school and have decided I want to give thank-you cards to some of the professors who have helped me so far. I feel as if thank-you cards are very good for telling people how much they mean to you in a very personalized way. While grad school can easily be described as miserable, many of my professors have made the experience wonderful, and I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity. For most of the professors, it is fairly easy to tell them how they have helped me and that I appreciate them. However, there is one particular professor who I am really struggling with.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is the backstory**:

At the end of each year, we get performance reviews from the department. The department chair talks with the professors who you have taken classes from, and then the chair writes a feedback letter. These are supposed to help students identify problems they may not have picked up on. My feedback came last May and was devastating. It was entirely criticism with condescending points of attempted praise. The main arguments of the review were:

1. The department felt that I was procrastinating my work.
2. The department felt that I was burning bridges with my peers.
3. The department felt that I was performing well below-average \[compared to my peers**\***\].
4. The department felt that I was bringing too many personal feelings into, and/or derailing, classroom discussions.
5. The department wanted to congratulate me for my enthusiasm in my field.

Now, I have always been a top-performing student. This criticism hit me like a ton of bricks. For much of the criticism, I had solid evidence to the contrary. I was *definitely* not procrastinating, as we had to work in groups, and I was often helping others complete their tasks within our group. The burning bridges comment was referencing a discussion where one professor misunderstood what I was saying. I wasn’t having difficulties with my peers, it was the opposite. **\***In my first-year classes, many of which are considered the hardest courses in the program, I was getting A’s and B’s. Later, I found out that *comparatively* speaking, I was performing below my peers in my same program. However, if the programs in the department were all being considered (rather than just my program), I would have been on top of the class. So, compared to others in my program, I was on bottom. But our program is small and consists of few students to compare. I was being compared to 2 other students in my cohort. I also was infuriated by the comment about derailing discussions because in all of my classes, I was being quiet and taking notes. I would only ever raise my hand once or twice a week, and when I did it was to ask or answer a question. And the final point about my enthusiasm felt so condescending and as if I was some idiot savant who miraculously made it to grad school. All of it felt as if none of my effort was ever seen, even though I had put my all into school. I spent the entire summer trying to find jobs that I wouldn’t hate and contemplating dropping out.

***Backstory TL;DR***: I received a performance review that I felt attacked my character, leading me to almost drop out of grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is the aftermath**:

Now, all of this backstory makes it sound as if I am completely ignoring the criticism and just *deny, deny, deny*. However, it is now January, and if it was not for that criticism, I am not sure I would still be in school.

After being so incredibly depressed and lost, I decided to go to therapy. It was school-offered, so I could afford the visits, and I grew to love both my therapist and psychiatrist. I had always struggled with insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Literally as far back as I could remember, I had always been this way. I began both therapy (to develop coping skills to succeed in grad school, and to treat my mental disorders before I spiraled any more) and a host of different anti-depressants/anti-anxiety/sleep meds. Finally, there was a combination that didn’t cause me any side effects (**literally**; I am so lucky) and that helped me (at low doses, *even better*!). I was getting a lot out of therapy, but I still wasn’t improving academically. I was having panic attacks in class, and I couldn’t bring myself to do my actual schoolwork. I went from seeing my mentor weekly to seeing him once over the fall semester. I also had developed a severe disdain for this professor, even though I logically knew that they were not trying to hurt me, they were trying to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the semester I found out many things about myself:

I have a dissociative disorder. I found this out by discussing fights both with my SO and with my doctors. There were enough things that made it *quite* obvious that I literally cannot remember anything if I am negatively emotionally-charged. During fights, I constantly forget what I’m even fighting about or what the last point was. Similarly, if an example in class hits too close to home, I dissociate as well. 

I have again been formally diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia, on top of having dissociative spells. New to these diagnoses (that became clear during therapy) are the additions of: PTSD causing the aforementioned disorders (we were able to figure out time of onset as well as the reason for onset), and (the important one) ADHD. Looking through my medical history and all of my school records, as well as doing formal testing, it became painfully obvious that I have ADHD. The PTSD was a more difficult diagnosis because it wasn’t until I was trying to remember a lot of traumas that we found out about the dissociation (again, through collaborating with my SO). The dissociation is how I deal with negative affect. Add PTSD to ADHD (at least for me), and you get someone who can’t focus, and can’t remember that they can’t focus. With the correct dosage of meds, I can now focus *and* remember. It’s as if I have a clear head for the first time in my life.

Through these diagnoses, and talking with my friends and my SO, it became very obvious where my image problems had come from. While the first 3 could be explained logically as mere perception issues (they were all easily disproven, so were instead tied to the professor's *personal* idea of me), the 4th point on my list (that I was derailing discussions and bringing in personal stuff) was glaring me in the face. I had my answers.

***Aftermath TL;DR***: Almost dropped out of school, decided to get therapy first. Was able to figure out what was happening, and the professor I once hated and dreaded, I now love and they clearly notice how much work I am doing!

&amp;#x200B;

**Today, and the advice topic at hand**:

Luckily, I had spent the semester working on myself, and when I talked to the head of the department, they said I was doing exponentially better. They even gave me a bunch of specific compliments! I literally turned around this person's perception of me by working my ass off! So much payout for all of that pain and mental exploration!

**So, back to my title**: The clear head I have recently been gifted means that I have been sending thank-you cards to so many people who have helped me over the past 10 years of adulthood. I realized how removed I have been my entire life; how distant from all of the people who love me I’ve become. I want and *need* to thank this professor. I want them to know that they have literally changed my life. Since these diagnoses, I have been clear minded and more productive. I have been getting SO MUCH positive feedback from everyone in the department – including this professor. Literally everything is amazing for me again. The sky’s the limit! This professor needs to know how much their feedback helped. If it had been even slightly more kind, I might not have gone to fix myself up. They knew exactly the kind of kick in the butt that I needed, and they literally improved my entire existence. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Full TL;DR***: A professor/head of the department gave me a terrible end of the year review, and I almost dropped out of grad school. Now, thanks a lot to her, my life is a million times better and I would like to thank her for it.

Please Reddit, help me thank this professor for changing my life!",07Jan2019,1
519,"My fiancée and I are getting married in about 19 days. This whole month has basically been dedicated to planning and she let her retail job know at the end of December that she needed to cut down to about 2-3 shifts per week this month.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week was the beginning of the problem. She was scheduled for three days in one department when the schedule came out. The Saturday before, she was taken off the schedule and didn't think anything of it since it's after the holidays and hours are low. Monday comes and the General Manager calls asking 1) why my fiancée didn't call her when the gm took her off the schedule and 2) if she could come in. My fiancée agreed if she could get off an hour earlier two of the days due to having dress fittings already scheduled.

&amp;#x200B;

That all worked out fine, but then we get to this week. Ever since the schedule came out at least a week ago, she has been off this whole week and was planning to help me get our house together and other wedding planning (decor, timelines, etc). Today, the GM asks her if she can work today. My fiancée said no due to obvious reasons. The GM asks when my fiancée could come in to meet with her. My fiancée told her Wednesday.

She responded telling my fiancée that she would be added to the schedule for Tuesday through Saturday, 6am to 2pm. When my fiancée mentioned having major plans Saturday and the GM agreed to let my fiancée off at 12. My fiancée then requested getting off at 12 the other days as well, the ones that weren't originally scheduled as off, to be able to get our future house ready, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

The GM said ""That will not work we can talk when you come in""

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the wedding day getting so close, she can't keep calling my fiancée in at such short notice, but my fiancée doesn't want to be mean about it, just direct to get something solved. What should my fiancée do/say to her tomorrow?",07Jan2019,1
520,"(WARNING ⚠️ LONG STORY)

I’m 21F, I have 1 full brother, 1 half sister and 2 half brothers all together 5 of us and I am the youngest. 

From what I know from the eldest one of my half brothers telling me was, my dad would give my mom the rent money for the house and instead of paying the rent she would spend it on other things and when the mail would come my mom would hide it until one day we got evicted from our home where we all lived. 

Then from what I can remember my dad saying was my mom said to him “ you take your kids and I’ll take mine” my father took me and my brother to my dads brothers house to stay and from what my eldest half brother said was they went to my moms brothers house. 

I was three years old at the time and my brother was four maybe five years old, so now living with my dads brother we just carried on like nothing happened. Of course it was traumatising at the time not seeing my mom and not understanding why and it didn’t make it better that my dad never spoke about it. 

According to my eldest brother when they went to my moms brothers they stayed there for a while. Until my mom left her eldest son with her brother and took my sister with her and they both lived together. 
The other half brother stayed at his dads once we got evicted from the house. 
So now it’s just my mom and sister living together. 


So fast forward into the future I saw my sister in the street I said hey to her and she just ignored me, I was about 11 at the time. 
Fast forwarding to when I was 18 I found my sisters Facebook and started speaking to her I remember crying while messaging back and forth with her on fb. 
It was like a brief what what are you doing now? where do you live? And then it got to me asking about my mom I asked my sister if I could speak to mom and every time I asked she would say she at work or busy. Then one day after school I messaged her and I noticed that she blocked me. 
BTW- My mom could have contacted us anytime she wanted to my dad never stoped her ever. 


Keeping in mind my father never spoke about my mom and I felt so awkward asking I never had any women advice growing up I was kinda like a Tom boy living with just my dad and brother. 
But anyway fast forward until last year I got sceptical and wanted to do some research see if I could find where my mom is or try find picture on fb pages or just something. 
And then I somehow found my moms sister on facebook I never knew she had a sister either but still I got her number and I called her. 
When she picked up she was so surprised she started talking about my mom and how because my mom smoked a lot of cigarettes she had a operation recently and is very sick, she said I should go and visit my mom because she needs the support I then asked for my moms number so she gave it to me! 

First of all wtf she was never there for me ever and now my auntie expects me to see my mother for support!! Is she crazy!! But my heart is good because I was considering too but I was kinda scared. 

Right so I call the number on private and she picks up the phone and I said sternly 
“hello” 
she said “hello who’s this”
I then said “it’s sophie your daughter!” 
She then said “who gave you my number”
I replied “yours sister” 
I said “ nicole (my half sister) said that she wouldn’t give me your number because you said there is too much water under the bridge” 
She then said “ I never said that she lying I’m going to call her now I’ll call you back” 
I didn’t say bye I just hung up and she couldn’t call me back because I called on private! 

After that conversation I was kinda blown away that after everything that that’s all she can say. It sickens me. 
Anyway so I met up with my eldest brother for the first time since we left the house and it was so weird because he’s like 40 something now and to think he use to change my diapers it was just weird lol. But anyway I told him what happened and he said first of all wow you really got her number everyone has been 
Trying to get in contact with her the only person who knows where she lives and has her number is her Nicole (our sister) 
So anyway according to my brother the reason my mom told my dad to take me and my brother and go after we got evicted was because she was cheating on him!!! UGHHHHH I swear when I Hurd him say that my body just filled with anger I wanted to hurt her for hurting my dad. My brother also said my mom is a compulsive liar I don’t doubt him because she lied when I asked her one question. 


So over all I don’t know what to do I think I have a hole within me that always might have me wondering. Should I just forget about it all? 
Should I call her back and ask to meet to hear her side?! 
Should I just move on with my life? 
She’s a liar, I don’t know the full story, do I need to know?

I was sexually assaulted 3 years ago, and was put on antipsychotics for it because it was the only thing that kept me from crying all the time. 

I have since developed horrible ED and can’t even get morning wood and my penis hasn’t been hard enough to penetrate or even “flex” it if that makes sense.

I have taken 1 pill past the maximum dosage of viagra and that didn’t help; it’s so remarkably frustrating. I’m in a relationship and we have talked about it and she says she’s okay with it, but I feel like I am keeping her from having a wholesome relationship because of my penis probs.

She is just a complete and utter drain and high noses everyone. Everyone is having a good time eating and my step mom puts Ham in this bowl. 

Everyone except me is eating and when I come up to grab a plate I grab the last few pieces with my hands. The resulting shockwaves is that this lady becomes disgusted by this and decides to not watch the game with everyone.

525,"After almost ten years of marriage and two children, I find myself deep in a working, but unfulfilling marriage. I'm currently seeing a therapist, and taking medication for depression and anxiety (even though I don't really struggle with those problems much. But that's another story). I'm reading self-help and life-improvement books and practicing techniques to better understand myself, my place in the world and how I interact with others. 

During this journey of discovery, I have come to the conclusion that my wife is controlling. She is a very busy person. She has to always be doing something. This is so extreme, that she takes on low-priority problems (like other children's birthday parties) and makes them high level tasks so that at 9pm on a Sunday she is still running around frantically talking about how busy her day [off] was. 

I, on the other hand, am pretty chill. Borderline lazy. So, to combat this, I have made myself extensive to-do lists and complete tasks that she and I both put on the list. In 2018 I went back to school and completed a bachelor's degree with a 3.8 GPA while working full time. So, yeah, I may not have painted the bedroom, but I'm not a slouch. 

Here's the point: I feel like she expects me to be running around crazy like she does. And if I'm not, it's because I'm not being productive ENOUGH. It's not enough that I have a productive day, I'm not running around like mad, so every week or two she brings up all the things I haven't done. I feel that in this way, she tries to control me. 

I have a physical list of things to do. I have encouraged her to add things that are important to her to my list and I have promised her that they will get rapid attention. And I've proven myself to be reliable in this respect. Still, she attempts to hold me responsible for not doing things are are not on this list. This is a boundary I have had to draw, and stick to my guns firmly, but kindly. 

Today, I got reprimanded for not asking for a certain day off work so she could attend a meeting. I request my work schedules months in advance and must ask for days off 6 weeks ahead of time. I'm perfectly willing to do this. I tell her this. She says ""Anything on my calendar that says ""meeting"" is mandatory."" She expects me to monitor her calendar and ask for days off that have the word ""meeting"" in them. (Some days in the past, have been optional meetings that she blew off. They had meeting in the name. I'm not going to argue this point, but you get it.)

How do I balance being a kind, supportive husband who is interested in the success and stability of my household, but not be walked on and expect to follow my wife around like a puppy? How do I stick to my guns and still get laid? 

She won't go to counseling with me, before you ask. 

I'm looking for behavioral suggestions, books to read, etc.  ANYTHING that the Reddits can provide will be deeply appreciated.

526,"So I used to play this MOBA for 2-3 hours every day and it was fun, but it also distracted me from doing stuff that were actually important in my life (for a high school student).

Now I decided to unwind as I have finished everything that I was obligated to finish. Since I need to start studying for my exams this friday I thought it would be nice to unwind with some fun activities and the one at the top of my list is playing this game.

I'm not afraid that I'll become addicted again, but its more of like a ""principle"" (like I've been ""sober"" for a long time and I shouldn't ruin that). Is it that big a deal if I play this game for a day or two OR should I just find some other activity (probably a different game)?",07Jan2019,1

529,"I work at a large full service hotel in a busy destination city. We recently got a new director about 5 months ago. Our old director was superb - would always come in early before the start of her “shift” to get her emails out of the way so she could give her full attention to her staff and help out both front of the house and back. It was never just an 8hr day for her. So when she left expectations were high for her replacement.

Her replacement is a first time director (32M) who has a great personality and is a real people person. However, he never comes in on time, stays cooped up in his office for most of the day, and barely helps with the daily tasks that the old director would.

532,"Any advice or general thoughts on this situation is welcome. Thanks.


So, over the years Ive (M) had feelings for one of my closest female friends. She was never interested in me as more than friends. Lets call her Abigail. Abigail and i met in high school (12 years ago). We got close pretty quickly bc she was dating one of my best male friends. Anyway years go by and we finally start fooling around. Great, seems like she has reconsidered. We did that for a few weeks but it never felt right. We didnt click at all. There was just nothing.


During this time I start talking to anither girl. Let’s call her Natalie. Natalie went to the same high school i did but started the year after i left. I always knew of her and followed her on the social medias and such. She always seemed really cool and absolutely gorgeous. Way out of my league. Natalie and I talked for a few days and then she asks me out. We make plans for a couple of days later.


Before I go any further its important to state Natalie has had only fuck awful relationships over the years and has multiple mental/psychological diagnoses, but so do I and I’m kind of into that anyway.


So I go out with Natalie. We had planned to meet at a bar a couple of my friends worked and for dinner and games. She shows up in a state that can only be acheived with a lot of benzos and alcohol. But, i really liked this girl. The conversations we had before that night were special. I’m austic and really struggle getting close to and being comfortable around people. But she was different. I was working at a hotel at the time so I go use my employee discount to get a room so she could sleep and sober up a bit. So we ordered pizza and fell asleep. We woke up a couple of hours later and she was sober. We talk for a while and end up having sex.


But what about Abigail?


The next few weeks were pretty weird. I was talking to Natalie because she was amazing and still hanging out with Abigail because I had wanted her for so long, despite knowing there was nothing there. I had to pick one. It felt wrong talking to both. And i end up choosing Abigail. So I tell Natalie about the Abigail situation, was completely honest with her about it.


A few days later Abigail decides she’s done with me. So thats great, obviously I made the wrong decision. Time to heal from that.


A couple of months pass and I grow enough balls to ask Natalie out again. She was excited and said yes. Great. So we go out again. We started spending most of everyday together. It was amazing. I felt acceptance and comfort like I never had before. I felt a lot of things i never had before. Everything just seemed so right. Eventually I asked her to be my girlfriend and of course, she said yes. Fantastic, because I am so crazy about her.


But she has this ex, right? They were together for a couple of years but things he was emotionally abusive and cheated on her. Lets call him Earl.


A few weeks go by, then she tries to kill herself. It destroyed me. I finally find someone who was exactly what i wanted and now she could be gone forever. She lived but ended up in the psychiatric wing of the local hospital. Wasnt her first time there, she had told me she had been before our first date, and my mother had been a few times so I thought nothing of it. I was scared for her, and I was scared of losing her. But she gets out after the minimum amount of time required after a suicide attempt. And things went back to normal.

Meanwhile Abigail contacts me for the first time in months wanting to get sushi. But I said ""no, i'm with natalie and thats not right bc i was chose you over her"". She said thats cool and understands.

Another few weeks go by and she ends up back in the psych unit. In there she meets this guy. Let’s call him Bart. Bart was a truly messed up individual but for some reason Natalie leaves me for him. I contact Abigail because I really needed a friend and she was always a good one. Wasnt remotely interested in being more than friends and made that clear. After talking a couple of days she gosts me for no reason and I havent heard feom her since. Another couple of weeks pass and I’m miserable, she goes to the beach with Bart, and end I up being put in the psych unit myself for a few days. 

While i was in there i had a funny feeling Natalie had gone to the beach to kill herself bc thats where she wanted to do it. So immediately upon leaving the hospital I drive 8 hours to the beach. Her family was down there too, but Natalie and the family werent staying in the same hotel. The morning after i got there her mom and I go looking for her. We spend hours trying to find the hotel they were at. She eventually texts her mom where she is and apparently she had tried to kill herself. But she is ok.


Natalie decides to come home from the beach with me. She stays with me for a few days and ends up back with Bart. So I think “ok, i have to accept this” and left her alone.


About a month later she calls me and tells me about a lot of really fucked up shit had been going on with Bart and they were done. And that she was sorry. I’m not one to hold a grudge, she didnt when I picked Abigail. So we start talking again. Then she starts hanging out with her ex, Earl. So im like ok cool, i know youre going through a lot and trying to break some addictions, so do what you need to do.


Eventually we start hanging out again as friends. Earl was mostly back out of the picture. We talked about being together and what not but she always says she’s not ready for another relationship. Ok, cool, I’ll just try to not be bothered by it bc I just wanted her in my life. After hanging everyday for about a week and a half she starts pulling away and ends up with Earl again. She didnt tell me about it, but I knew. And when she did finally tell me, I tried to kill myself and ended up back in the psych unit. She was no longer suicidal, but I was.


During my stay there I accepted that she just wouldnt be in my life anymore, and I would ultimately be ok even if it hurt then. Plus I got on some meds that work pretty well for me. So when I got out I was super happy, ready to get my life together, etc. I turn my phone back on to read texts i had missed, reddit, just the internet in general. I had a text from Natalie, she wanted to hang out again. I didnt reply for a few days but eventually did agree to it.


We were together everyday, more thqn we were when we were actually a couple. Then we started having sex. We slept in the same bed every night, her house or mine. But it was just sex, not a relationship bc she isnt ready for that, andnI was fine with it being just sex. Then I started going to all of her family gatherings and her mine. Thanksgiving, christmas, birthdays, etc. Then she starts telling me how much she loves me, all the time. So I ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said no bc she isnt ready. But I couldnt be just friends. Its not how I feel. So i suggest we just go our separate ways, but after a lengthy conversation about it it was clear neither of us actually wanted that.


At some point she started talking to this guy in the military. Lets call him Steve. I knew, she didnt tell me, but i knew. Over this past weekend he is on leave and spends it at her house. Ok, what the fuck? I get upset, naturally, bc seriously. It was a pretty awkward situation. I went to her house while she was gone to return things she had left in my car and house, and wouldnt you know it they pull up as I was leaving. That felt phenomenal. We argue over text a bit that night, the next day (yesterday) she asks me to come over so we could talk about it. And I did.


We talked about Steve and us. She tells me she loves me, that im the best person shes ever met, the only person she is truly comfortable with, that I’m her favorite person, and that she does have feelings for me but she isnt ready to be in a relationship. So she is going to keep talking to Steve because thats as much of a relationship as she can handle, a long distance unofficial relationship. She wants us to keep being friends, but I just cant. I dont feel friendship, I feel more, and I know she does, too.

536,"This might be a long one but here we go:

 I grew up in Florida but I spent the last 6 years in Indiana with my girlfriend because after high-school I didn't know what to do and my dad has a buisness up there. The idea was to ""learn the buisness"" but I was being paid 10$ /hr and after 2 years of just working and not learning a whole lot  I found a slightly higher job doing tech support. I did this for about 2 years but was working hours opposite my girlfriend and it really put a strain on our relationship, also working help desk can get old pretty quick so I left and started bartending. 
During this period the local electric company started a program at the local technical school for lineman and power plant operators. They were training people to come in and work for them as a lot of their force was retiring. My dad said he'd pay for it and suggested I go. I did and got an associates degree in ""power plant technogy"" which I'm pretty sure isn't a degree anywhere else. 
Then right around the time I finished school my now fiance was talking about moving back to Florida because she missed her family. I said ok and that's what we did. A little after we moved I found a job at a waste to energy plant as an operator. Not ideal in the power plant world but I took it as it was the only thing available. I did about two weeks of training with them and then went on shift. 
I got up at 5 am and got home at 7:30pm after working a 1w hour shift. The pay was decent and it came with benefits but I was miserable there from day 1. And I had to be there for 12 hours a day for 5+ days in a row. I found out pretty quickly this was probably not the line of work for me. I was constantly sleep deprived and last night I had a mental breakdown at home and kinda lost it while my fiance tried to keep me sane. I still went to work the next day, still sleep deprived, and had another breakdown at work. I couldn't make it through the day and basically seized up. I talked to a supervisor and he told me that it's not the kind of work for everyone and nobodywould blame me if I quit and I shouldn't sacrafice mental health for money. 
So I did. I came home and cried some more because I feel like depressed garbage. I've never quit a job like that before ever but I couldnt function with the lack of sleep and I didn't fit in with any of my coworkers. I was the outlier not really being ""blue collar"" or ""redneck"". 
And now here I am typing this. I don't know what to do with my life. I know you don't have to have everything figured out at 25 but I feel like I'm at rock bottom right now. I wasted so much time training in a school setting for a job to find out I hate it and it makes me miserable, but now what od I do? I don't have formal training in anything else. I can't afford the time or money to go to college. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I'll probably try to go back to bartending for the time being but that can't be my endgame. 

I want to work somewhere I enjoy that still gives me time for family. I don't need to be rich but I need to be able to pay rent and bills and live comfortably. It feels like rock bottom and I'm so sucked into my own moping I don't k ow where to go from here.  


TLDR: Went to school, got job, hated job, had mental breakdown and quit job and now I'm sad confused and lost. 
Also typing this all out kind of helped me get my thoughts straight but I'll still post it. Maybe someone can help me out of this mental pit.

So, I recently started dating this girl. Things are going really well, but it turns out I am sort of the cause of friction between her and her best friend. After our last date the two got in a pretty big fight. I'm not going to go into why. The friend called her a slut for being with me and said she didn't want to be friends anymore. 

I'm trying to be supportive in all this, but I feel like I'm falling short. I want this girl to be happy. I also don't want her to lose her best friend. What I can I say to show her I'm there for her?",07Jan2019,1

542,"First time posting on this sub.

So I’m friends with these 3 girls. We talk almost every day.

Back story, one of them went through a divorce and I was the first one she went to talk about it. I connected her to my therapist that helped her a TON.
Another friend has had a number of “bad moments”. (depression, a panic attack, family issues, etc.) I’ve always offered to babysit her kids, be a listening ear, come over and help, and again, gave her my therapists info.

Well about a month ago I posted a “deep” post on Instagram, which I usually don’t do. I shared that I have battled depression since I was in high school, that it had gotten bad recently, but that I’m working through it. I had people I haven’t heard from in a while reach out. I had texts and messages offering help or sharing similar experiences. None of those three friends reached out. Not one text, not a call, nothing.

I’m just feeling hurt and secondary, like I’m an afterthought with them. I’m really stuck on this, so what do I do?

Option A) ignore it and move on.
Option B) go👏🏼 off 👏🏼 on 👏🏼 them 👏🏼
Option C) politely address them and express that it hurt my feelings
Option D) drop them as friends


To sum up: three friends I talk to daily didn’t reach out when I posted about my depression, despite the fact that I’ve helped them out with their issues. I’m stuck and don’t know how to move forward.",07Jan2019,1

By the way I did NOT come up with all of that by myself; it mostly came from Jordan Peterson's deep and thoughtful insights into the nature of being, mostly being detailed in his best-selling book ""12 Rules for Life"". I have his brilliant insight to thank for this epiphany that I've gotten.

548,"Hi, my brother ( referred to as A ), hasn’t been the same. He’s been acting odd the last couple years but now it’s gotten out of hand. When he was younger he was always outgoing, and trying to be out as much as possible with friends and out in public. As soon as he hit high school pretty much he’s been starting to recluse himself from his friends. This is around the time my dad left for a few months for Florida, my brother hates my dad and was very much relieved he was in florida for work for so long. Around the house we tended to see less of his friends, and more of A, which was fine, we got along perfectly well, hung out everyday and would joke and hangout together pretty much whenever we were both home at the time. Obviously as brothers do, we fought from time to time but nothing ever serious. When he was 15, he only hung out with a few new friends who we’re the known troublemakers around our very small town. He then started to sneak out and lie to my parents very often, something I would mostly cover for him, being his older brother an all. A few months of this and It then started getting worse, at that point my mom was worrying and getting nervous, so I start to pass any info I knew about A, to my Mom. He then is forced to stop hanging out with his new friends, so he further reclused himself.  A few months of him _only_ hanging out at the house, my dad comes back home. At that point, A completely retreats to the upper portion of the house ( My parents bedroom is on the ground floor, the upstairs contains a full bathroom and 3 bedrooms) He would only come downstairs for meals and to watch TV with my mom occasionally. Months of this happening and he no longer spends any time with my Mom, as he desperately attempts to avoid my dad. So, about a year of him mainly being upstairs, either in the spare bedroom (turned rec room) or in his room, we’d mainly hangout in the rec room when we’re both home. He then reconnects with his reconnects with his friend Jordan, and he spends pretty much all his weekend’s at his house, which I come to learn pretty much instantly is he’s dropping acid. Pretty much after that he stopped being out-goingly friendly, and really was obsessed with LSD. He would watch TV shows about it and youtube clips endlessly about it. His interests start to shift to being completely obsessed with anything rap/trap related. All he does is watch youtube clips about rappers and random stuff, and vape, and begs me to for a dab here and there. Now, he’s 17, turning 18 in March and he has completely changed. He is violent, angry, delusional and seemingly crazy. A few months ago, he’s started going on about how he’s a demon and there’s a path for everyone or some shit like that, and that he’s moving out to become a rapper, saying he has rap lyrics he’s been working on for months. He later abandons that idea and says he’s going to be a comedian ( something I’ve been mentioning privately to him for a number of years, I mention that because it comes up later ) and saying he’s been writing jokes forever, which is nonsense. After a month of that he stops vying for his 15 minutes, and continues to ramble about hating my father and wanting a car. He has been talking about shadows and tripping all the time, which is impossible since he doesn’t have money. He called my Aunt Sandra, calling her a cunt and ripping into her for absolutely no reason, and screaming in his room, all while she’s on the call, saying he’s freaking out and tripping and shit. At this point he runs out of his rooms, and while it’s unclear what happened, it seems like he threw my smallest dog LuLu down the stairs, where she suffered brain trauma, at this point my parents snap and admit him into treatment. He’s there for 2 days, and the DR’s say he has anxiety and depression, which is obviously a crock of shit. They give him medicine, which he lied about taking, and has been progressively getting worse. He’s taken to now ripping pictures off the wall and throwing them at my mom when he’s upset, and punching holes in walls. He’s attacked me on more than one occasion, he steals Juul pods and dabs (THC concentrate, I use to to treat my IBS symptoms, [without a prescription, I feel like I should add] and money on occasion, which he then gives to me and asks me to buy him shit ) His behavior is incredibly bizarre, sleeping at all hours off the day, never leaving certain rooms, he fears cameras and thinks people are always talking about him and that people are always recording him. He reminds me a lot of the main character of the New Black Mirror episode: Bandersnatch. He makes it seem like he’s way smarter than us, all while failing high school. He actually became truant today and has to appear for court. He thinks my Aunt Sandra who lives in California bought his friends from middle school a car and Apple laptops, while she clearly didn’t since she is broke and doesn’t know them, and he also accused his friend Jordan of fucking her! He also accused Jordan’s friend Mitch of sleeping with A’s “crush since 5th grade” apparently. Does anyone have any advice? Me and my dad agree he needs to be in a hospital somewhere while my mom is holding out, believing it is an attitude thing, while me and my dad think it’s some kind of mental disorder. I believe something happened when he would go to Jordan’s house and do LSD. Thanks for the read, any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",07Jan2019,1
549,"I apologize ahead of time for the long post. It’s a bit of a vent but I do include a request for advice at the end.

My mother has been smoking since she was in college and smoked during her pregnancy with me (she didn’t know she was pregnant until about 6 months in). She smoked for about 20-25 years and most of my childhood. About 7 or 8 years ago, my dad, sister, and I encouraged her to quit. Part of it was because of her health (she has a lot of medical issues) and part of it was because she made my dad drive to another state to get large cartons of cigarettes for her because that state doesn’t charge sales tax and each carton cost I think $46+. My mother also doesn’t work, so these costs had to be covered by my dad’s wallet. 

After my mother used nicotine patches to quit the first time, she would take drags from family members’ and friends’ cigarettes but did not have her own. We were very upset and told her that we didn’t approve, but we couldn’t do anything because she wasn’t smoking whole cigarettes. Flash forward to about a year or two ago, and my aunt (my mother’s sister) starts spending a lot of time at our house. She smokes heavily and doesn’t care if my mother smokes. I keep telling her to stop allowing my mother to smoke with her to which she responds by threatening me and saying my mother’s a grown woman and can do what she wants. Her enabling got my mother back into the habit. She started stealing my aunt’s cigarettes, then started buying her own and hiding them so I, my dad, and sister wouldn’t find them. She doesn’t realize that cigarettes smell *awful* and that we could tell she started the habit again. She wreaked of smoke and so did the entire house. 

Once we found the hiding spots, my sister and I would steal her lighters/matches and throw out and/or break the cigarettes. We did it to let her know that we’re very aware of her smoking habit and that we weren’t going to tolerate it. If it was only affecting her life, then so be it. She wants to ingest cancerous chemicals? Fine. But it was affecting others too. She was using my dad’s money to pay for them, and making the entire house smell like cigarettes. On top of that, I have a rabbit who’s cage sits next to where she keeps her ashtray and the cage is the first thing exposed to the fresh cigarette residue after she’s done smoking. For those who don’t know, rabbits have very sensitive respiratory systems similar to children and people with asthma. So I’m worried that my rabbit is at risk too but my mother has shrugged this concern off as well. 

We eventually got her to start using the nicotine patches again with moderate success until recently. At a family new year’s eve party, my aunt went out to smoke and my mother was not-so-subtly asking to join. I told my aunt not to let her to which my aunt pointed at me and responded aggressively  “you shut the fuck up and mind your own damn business.” Admittedly, I almost lost my cool and fought her right there, but I didn’t feel like getting kicked out. So I left. Now my mother has somehow acquired another cigarette which I found and threw out. She took it out of the garbage can in front of me and pocketed it. 

I’m at my whit’s end. How do I even go about this? She has made it obvious she doesn’t care about me, my dad, my sister, or my rabbit in regards to her smoking habit. Breaking the cigarettes and throwing them out doesn’t work because she buys more and my dad is a pushover regarding her spending (she has her own debit card linked to his bank account). My aunt has threatened me whenever I try to stop my mother. Telling her she literally wreaks of tobacco is like talking to a wall because she denies she smells. The only thing I’ve considered that I haven’t tried yet is getting in contact with her therapist and telling them about her addiction. Maybe a professional can get through to her. The thing is that she possibly has an undiagnosed cluster B personality disorder and it’s *extremely* difficult trying to tell her she’s wrong or trying to get her to see things from someone else’s perspective.

 I understand that everyone is entitled to do what they want, but I think it’s unfair to disregard other people’s feelings if it’s affecting them as well. If she lived alone and used her own money to smoke all day, then I wouldn’t be able to argue. But she uses my dad’s money to fund a habit that’s ruining her already poor health which he then has to pay out of pocket to afford her health care. 

So if you’ve stuck with me thus far, should I try to contact her therapist? Is that even allowed? Is there anything else I can try to get her to see what effect this is having on everyone?


TL;DR  Sick mother is using dad’s money to fund smoking habit and denying she has a bad habit in the first place. Asking if I should contact her therapist to talk with her about addiction.

554,"I'm not sure where to go at this point in my life.  I'm 25, living with my folks at the moment, and I want to be able to move out and support myself.  I have a HS degree, and my experience working consists of a few years of retail stores, and a few years of doing level 1 IT work (remote support/troubleshooting).  I convinced myself and others I was going to try and stick with IT and move up in that realm, as I do not have a degree and IT seems like one of those fields you can succeed with the right experience/etc.  I realized that this might not be the case, as I went to an interview for an IT place that would have been the perfect next step, but it just kind of dawned on me that this is not what I want to do for 40 hours a week.  40 hours a week is a lot of time, and of course you don't have to love your job, but the past year I had been working fulltime and showing up to a place I reallyu don't care about just gets under my skin after a while and I hit an extreme wave of depression, even if it is a safe way to make income.

I'm kind of torn between chasing a safe job and doing what it is I want to do.  What would put a smile on my face would be a career involved in anything music production/audio engineering, something in that realm.

I literally have no idea what to do, I've been googling ""audio engineering/production schools"" on google but I don't even know what I'm doing.

So I have female coworker. I'm 22 and she's 23. We work at a gym and I came in to work out today on my day off. When I was done working out we drove together when she was on her break to a nearby restaurant and we spent anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour together by the time she went back to work. When we were at the restaurant we had a short conversation which went like this.

HER: When are you leaving the country? 

ME: Most likely in August or September, although it might not be until January.

HER:Good because I want to hang out before you leave. We both never go to the beach so I was thinking we could maybe go to the beach together in June since it's likely that I'll be off my IOP by then and I won't be as slammed as I am right now so I'll be able to do something. Especially since we both never go to the beach.

ME: Yeah I only went to the beach once last year.

HER:I know that's what I mean we've talked about this like 3 times.

ME:Yeah let me know because if you want to do anything I'm totally down for it.

HER:Ok.

Then we drove back to work afterwards and when we got back. We said bye and hugged so we had another short conversation which went like this.

ME:Let me know if you want to do anything.

HER: Alright I'm going to be slammed with school since I'm starting school in the spring, but come in on your days off and we can get lunch more often and catch up.

*We then hug and she says goodbye.

So my question is why would she suggest hanging out before I leave and then refuse when I turn the tables and I'm suggest her to hit me up more? Yet offer to keep getting lunch with me after saying she wants to hang out with the summer. I see a few different possibilities listed below but I want other peoples feedback as well.

She's not interested but she enjoys the attention so she strings me along to keep me around.

564,"First reddit post - sorry it's so long!

I have been living with a woman from Brazil for over a year. We were friends for a couple months before moving in together, but we didn't know each other that well. She led me to believe she was relatively stable, had financial support from her family and could afford to pay her share of rent/utilities. I knew she struggled with anxiety/depression and smoked a lot of weed, but so do a lot of people I know (including myself at some points in my life). 

It turns out she is deep in debt and struggling with severe mental health issues (depression, anxiety, panic attacks, problematic substance use, anger, mood swings). I have been doing my best to provide emotional (and sometimes financial) support. She has recently started cutting her wrists with a needle; she assures me she has no intention or plan to kill herself, but has confided that she does think about how death could be an escape from her problems. 

We live in an expensive apartment, but my roommate's student visa limits the number of hours she can work, and her wages are low. I have covered her rent a few times now. She insists she will eventually pay me back - I know she wants to be financially independent and hates borrowing money. I don't want or expect her to pay me back what I have already given, but this pattern is troubling because I don't see how she can support herself or begin repaying her debts, living where we live. I have offered to cover expenses for her cat (who feels like my cat too) but she insists she will pay for everything. I have tentatively suggested we (she) should perhaps look for a cheaper place to live, but she would not hear of it. I feel gross because I keep noticing (and resenting) how she behaves and spends money irresponsibly, since I'm in a position where I feel responsible for her. Although we get along well, I feel like I can't bring up my concerns because she aggressively denies there is any problem. 

I have been really sick for the past 3 months and my doctor says I'll likely take several more months to recover. I have taken a leave of absence from grad school and put my life on hold indefinitely. My doctor says I need to rest and relax so I can get better. My roommate insists on being my ""nurse"" and treating me like ""family,"" but an ugly part of me feels like this is a manipulation tactic to make me feel like I owe her something (she keeps joking that I owe her ""3 billion dollars"" etc.). I genuinely like her and she does some thoughtful things for me; but she is very loud/dramatic/intense/negative, which I find really stressful. I don't know how to tell her that all I want is a clean, peaceful place to live. Our house is constantly full of weed smoke and I can hear her screaming on the phone even when we're not in the same room. I clean up after her a lot, including the messes she leaves when she eats my groceries without asking or replacing them. 

Her family has cut her off financially now and she has been fired from two jobs in the year we've lived together. She has fallen out with her closest friends here and hasn't had any luck with dating. It seems like I am her whole mental/emotional/financial support system now, and I'm finding that extremely overwhelming. I feel like a shitty person because I resent being put in this situation and part of me just wants to move out. We haven't signed the paperwork to renew our lease yet, but we will have to soon. 

She has now started pressuring me to sponsor her as a common-law partner so she can get Canadian PR status. I care about her and I can see how scary, overwhelming and lonely her situation is. I want to help, but I'm really uncomfortable with the idea of being financially and legally responsible for her for 3 years. I feel trapped because I don't want to live with her anymore but I'm terrified she might kill herself or be deported to a country that is really dangerous right now. I feel really responsible for her and I don't know what to do. 

Do I have a responsibility to support my roommate, given it seems like I'm the only support she has? If so, should I agree to sponsor her as a common-law spouse even though my instinct is to say no? Halp!",07Jan2019,1
565,"My girlfriend and I live with an elderly man, Gandalf. Gandalf is a vietnam veteran and retired from years as a service technician for electric companies. He spends all his time at home. 
I am a 23 year old with a disability. My girlfriend works and I spend much of my time at home, a cycle I am desperate to get out of. I apply for jobs constantly now that I am doing better, and have yet to find one that will stick long term. He doesnt like this and calls me things like ""parasite"".
     He butts in to our conversations alot through the wall, and we constantly hear him muttering. We walk in on him jerking off at his computer by the front door at least 6 times a week. We never have said anything about it before today. The whole reason we moved into this apartment in the first place was to save him from losing his apartment, aa he was actually a pretty good friend before this all came about.
  Today I was telling my girlfriend she had to go to traffic court and he butted into our conversation. I just snapped, and started yelling at him about it, and he called me a parasite, and I called him a dirty old man, and he came back with the usual ""what are you talking about"" and usually I fuck off at that point, but today I shot back "" maybe you should stop cumming on the kitchen floor"" and he followed me to my room asking me what I was talking about and I told him that I'm pretty sure my girlfriend didn't want to walk in on him jerking off 30 times week.
     At this point we're both livid, and I started yelling at him about my disability and my depression stemming from my sexual assaults as a young adult. He shoots back some bullshit about his youth 100 years ago and at that point i tell him straight up we could just leaveon the 16th and leave him to his sad old man stuff. In the process of me shouting at him like a banshee some spittle flies out of my mouth and he starts screaming about how that's assault and I want to really assault him but I leave. I told him I'm not going to pay rent until he cleans up the black mild on the ceiling of the bathroom and eventually we leave to take my girlfriend to work.
   I know I handled this badly. I just don't know where to go from here and i want to fix the situation. It doesn't take away from the fact that he's spent a year and a half crossing boundaries and generally being a dick, and I've honestly had it.

571,"Hello everybody. I am a 19 year old guy who is studying Business administration in an university and the university I am studying is one of the best universities in my country. I determined this department in highschool because the results I got from career test said It's the most appropriate field for me and I would like to be a business man too. But the thing is, I am usually getting bored in the lessons after I started to university and I have no motivation to study at all, also most of my friends are in a stage of ''improving yourself for your career''. They're going finance congress or learning additional languages etc. . I am doing nothing at all because I am a shy person and feeling like doing these kind of activities are troublesome. I'm thinking about myself that why I choose a department that needs good social skills and communication because that I'm asocial a little bit.


Here is my questions : 

1-How can I start to enjoy my department and give effort while studying it ?

2-Can a person with social anxiety and feeling shy(I think these are different things.) become a good manager ?

3- Should I start to ''improve myself'' ? If I should, can you tell me which things I should learn as a future manager ?

4- I've read that in workfield, the university you graduated and the education you've seen is the not only decisive factor. They're also looking for how you improve yourself and what kind of activites you did during your university life. Is that true nowadays ?

573,"Using second account becuase friends know first im only 95% certain I'll have to. Sorry if it's long, I have kept this in me since Feb last year.

So backround, my parents divorced when I was 13 years old during summer. I am 14 now, turning 15 on the 15th in less then a week. I am currently in my first year of high school, grade 9. The move will be around summer vacation so I'll be in grade 10 by then. 

Since my parents divorced, my mom has had the house and she's been the only source of income. We live in a 5 person house, as 2 people. She cannot afford the house anymore. She is about to be laid off in the next 2 months. I am certain she will lose her job by next year, as the next in line as well as the company likely going down under. We realistically cant live in this place anymore. All houses within my district are 1mil+. Plus, there are no jobs here. Assuming I stay my mom will have to take 65km+ commutes daily.

I feel like I am going to be alone. I am introvert for my whole life. My friends are a group of people I knew from my last school (K1-8th gr)
Other then that, I have not really talked to much people and consider them my friend, Probably 10 or something on top of my old ones.

I just feel like I will be by myself for a long time. I have been an only child for 15yrs almost, so at home it doesn't bother me. But at school I,just need someone. I feel like the end no realistic way for me to have any friends unless I completely 180 everything about me. Not to mention, I don't consider myself poor. However, I consider my self below average in terms of household income. None of my friends know if my home situation. This makes me insecure a lot at school. I have been wearing the same clothes since 7th grade (washing ofc). I have 1 pair of shoes, some now scuffed Nikes that I only have because of my parents insurance. Meanwhile, I have atleast 3 people with iPhone X's. Most people I know have a 7 or higher. This just shows the income gap between me and others.

Frim all this, I feel like I don't belong anywhere. Im lost right now. My 2018 was absolute garbage and by everything else it look a like it's going to be 2 in a row. I already tried to die once but I didn't know how because I live in a safe first world country.  If someone honestly asks dms to name people who I thought genuinely cared about me, I would struggle.

Also, I realise this post is probably poorly structured but I can't quite organise my thoughts in a way that everything makes sense to an outsider. This being said, thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in college (19M) and sometimes feel like I have no meaningful/real relationships. I consider myself a shy person and while I am an introvert, I enjoy being in company. The thing is that after I left high school and all of my friends left to different cities or countries, I realised I have no real social skills (i guess I was kind of taken in by an extrovert back then) and find it really hard to make friends. I was ok at first but over time I've grown more and more worried. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the people I talk to are online friends, familly or customers from work. I wanted to take action so I joined a local tabletop games club. Things there are great while I'm actually there, but once again, I find it hard to make relationships meaningful (I wouldn't say I'm straight up socially awkward but I do feel like I just can't break that first barrier). Recently I've noticed more and more of these online friends are getting into relationships and has also made me realise I've never had a girlfriend either. Also most people in the club that joined at a similar time seem to have bonded a lot more (don't get me wrong these people are great and very welcoming)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the kind of guy to just go out clubbing for the sake of it, I don't like getting drunk for fun (but I do drink) nor I take any drugs. I am also not the type of guy that takes initiative in the very few social networks I use.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't complain about my online friends (I really apreciate them in fact) but I cannot pretend its the same thing. I've might have mentioned my worries to a few trusted ones but I don't want to burden them with how I feel. The reason I'm posting this now is because as I'm writing this, I'm realising that while everyone's life moves on naturally, mine seems to be kind of frozen, being wasted away. I know it sounds weird, but when I'm alone like this and see all of it, its somewhat scary. Its not the first time I feel like this and I try to tell myself that surely things will change if I just let them develop, but they dont seem to just yet.

579,"My wife and I have been friends with our next door neighbours since pretty much the day we moved into our house almost ten years ago. We were both new home owners planning to start families, given the proximity, friendship was a natural fit. We've spent a fair amount of time together over the years, sometimes just us and them, sometimes with a larger group, we've even gone on holiday together. We exchange Christmas presents every year and invite each other to birthday parties and other big events.

Our neighbours can be lovely and generous people. However, they have a very busy social calendar, sometimes planning more than they clearly should. In the early years of our friendship they ""ghosted"" us at least once and cancelled dinner plans with no notice because they were still with other friends on the other side of town. They have also made some completely unsolicited commitments to us and then not followed through.

Things had been better, although we don't spend as much time with them as we once did. We had been planning to spend New Year's together since at least autumn, it was their suggestion and they reconfirmed with us before Christmas. Then they cancelled our New Year's plans with only a day's notice. Actually, they got invited to something else for New Year's, so they asked if we were okay with them going instead of spending New Year's Eve with us. I found that very unfair, what are we supposed to say? 'No, you have to spend New Year's with us even though you clearly want to do something else.'

As someone who always tries my best to meet my commitments, I feel incredibly disrespected. I also now realize that as long as we remain friends with them this kind of thing will continue to happen. From speaking with mutual friends, I know they have done this to other people. My wife is less outraged than I am, more willing to just forget it and move on. I am generally someone who does not hold grudges, but I cannot let this go.

I've thought about telling them how I feel, but I am worried it will just lead to excuses and then conflict. My inclination is to just distance ourselves from them. We'll still see them at parties and invite them to larger functions when we invite other neighbours, but never make specific plans with just them again, because I don't think I'll be able to hold my tongue the next time.

581,"Yes, I know, massive first world problem. 

So I did really well in my undergrad, and I knew I’d have to do postgrad in something in order to really establish a career (I majored in philosophy and ancient history so, not exactly super marketable skills). 

My whole life people always said I’d be a great lawyer. I’m a strong reader, strong writer, good at forming arguments and deconstructing them, and I’ve always been very good at humanities based subjects. Justice has always interested me, and I’ve always wanted to help people. So I applied for law school and got offered a scholarship.  

At first I was really enjoying it, or at least, I felt motivated. I’m now two thirds of the way through the degree, and I’m dreading finishing. The people are pretty insufferable (obviously there are good eggs but there are a lot of not so good ones), the best paid work involves working for firms and clients that I simply don’t care for. Lawyers often have pretty bad hours, which I’d be ok with if I actually gave a shit. But it’s starting to dawn on me that most legal work is really tedious, involves sitting on my ass way too frequently, kissing other people’s asses way too much, and doesn’t provide a whole lot of ‘I really helped a person who needed me’ satisfaction, more ‘I fucked over a union for this multinational corporation’ satisfaction. 

I suppose maybe I should have known that prior to entering into the degree, but I was younger and you really don’t get a great look into what you’re about to become from the outside looking in. 

A part of me has always been interested in being a doctor. I had never thought about it prior to doing this career personality test in highschool for careers week, and I tested incredibly highly for aptitude for medicine. I thought about going through the application process after my undergrad, but I was anxious. I’ve never had much interest in math, and although I was good at science (particularly biology), I was so strong in humanities that I hyper focused on them from school age. I would probably have to get a tutor help me to do the admission exam, then maybe some bridging courses to get my science up to speed. I really have no barometer for understanding how terrible or good I may be at medicine (where as I suspected I’d be good at law). 

I’m a people person, I’ve always been good at reassuring people, communicating clearly. I’m a decision maker, and a problem solver. I want a job where I can be doing things with my body and on my feet for much of the time if I’d like (I’d say I’m a bit adhd and struggle to sit down for long periods). I think some of these skills lend themselves to medicine to some extent. 

Then there’s the expense. I’m from a lower socioeconomic background than most at my University. I was raised by a single mother, who has said pretty strongly that she needs me to get an actual ‘job’ rather than studying and working intermittently. I think she would be really upset and stressed if I deferred law and pursued medicine. Not to mention medicine is a four year degree, intense, I have never had to work and do that level of study before. I doubt I’d be able to compete for a scholarship for medicine, the only other pathway that could allow economic support for me is applying to have my degree and my expenses paid for by the army (with the provisio that I give them five years of my time after as repayment, as a medical officer, which apparently does limit your ability to specialise). My mother keeps saying that I could always go back and do medicine when I’m older, for fun, but I’m worried that my soul will be destroyed long before then. 

I know I probably sound spoilt. I guess I’m worried that I’ve made a terrible choice and I’m going to be miserable as a lawyer, and I’ll regret it for the rest of my life. I recently had to go to the emergency room and seeing that team work, seeing how they made so many people more comfortable and cared for so many people over the course of a few hours, was inspiring. I go to legal networking events and honestly want to die. 

Any advice would be appreciated, especially from those who have done either path. ",07Jan2019,1
582,"Sorry if this sounds like I'm complaining or looking for attention, I genuinely don't know what to do. 

Contains explicit language. I'm female and he's male.

My ex-boyfriend is going through a lot at the moment and I feel the need to help him, he's suicidal and I'm worried about him. He's a dick though and I don't want him in my life. He's scary, he talks about having homicidal thoughts and wanting to murder people. He has serious anger issues, and in an intense way. I have anger issues, but I'm not violent. He's genuinely scary and I'm afraid of him. He's said horrible things to me. He's told me I need to see a doctor because I ""act like I'm on my period constantly"". He accused me of cheating on him with my best (female) friend because we're close. He always insults me, makes me feel like shit all the time. I broke up with him a few months back and we ended on good terms but then he started picking fights constantly. I could go on for paragraphs but that gives you a pretty good picture. 

So understandably I want him out of my life. I'm not stupid, I know I deserve better. I feel selfish though, leaving him friendless in this point in life where so much is going on for him. I want to help him because nobody else will. I still care about him so much, and I can't just leave him to deal with this alone. He needs someone to vent to. 90% of the time he's a decent person, and he's autistic so I feel like maybe he doesn't mean it. But then other times I can tell that that isn't an excuse. I have autistic family members and friends and they aren't assholes. It's him. I still can't help but feel that way though. 

I want to get as far away from him as I can, I'm tired of him walking all over me. I'm stronger than that. I'm a decent person though and I can't just leave him to struggle because he's been a dick to me before. Does anyone have some helpful advice or opinions? ",07Jan2019,1
583,"I know my idea might seem excessive, but I have competition in trying to move up in my store to shift supervisor. I’ve been employed for two years and last month I had a bit of a problem with mental health and got some shifts covered to deal with it.

My manager took this as me saying I wasn’t interested and moved on to my coworker. Well, I am a good worker. All of my coworkers will agree and I’ve wanted to be a shift for a long time, the only thing stopping me now is the red tape from my manager about my mental health. I told him I’m ready a few weeks ago, and it’s been a silent thing now. I need this job to survive. I don’t get enough hours or make enough as a barista. I don’t want to just be a shift, I want to eventually become a manager, myself.

We're friends too which sucks because I'm going to be around him and I will still probably want him. I know that this is such an extreme response to one person saying no, but that's the thing. It's not just one person. The first time I ever asked a girl out was a year ago, we went on one date but then she didn't feel the same way. The next girl liked me but then found out I was bi and didn't like that. The next one said yes but stood me up. And this was the first time I ever had a crush on a guy, so it may be hitting harder, but he's really cool and I thought he liked me. I'm also very bad at interpreting signs. There are times where I swear someone is flirting with me so I ask them out or tell them that I have feelings for them and they say they don't feel the same way. I don't know if I'm being lead on or if I'm just completely socially stupid. And every time these things happen, I go through the same thought cycle for anywhere from a few days to a month. ""I'm so undesirable. I'm going to die alone. I should just cut to the chase and kill myself."" I know this sounds like I'm just an angsty teen, but these emotions feel very real. And no, I'm not just horny. Sure I like sex, but I honestly do like these people and want a relationship. It seems like relationships come so easily and naturally to everyone else my age, and I just don't have the secret to forming natural romantic relationships. Everyone tells me that this was true for them too in high school, but then in college things kind of turn around. I'm hoping that that's true, but if it's not, then what? That's all I got to look forward to it feels like. I don't know if I could take that let down if I can't take one person saying no easily.  


Part of this is just to get these things out of my head, but also for advice. How do I not take these things so personally? Part of me knows that these are just four people and there are a million different reasons as to why these didn't go the way I would have liked. But the stronger part of me can't help but feel extremely existential and horrible about myself. I think some of this is inevitable, but how do I minimize this?

I don’t want to be rude and not cash it but then I don’t want to cash it in case of “what if she needs that $50 down the road” “what if I cash it and her account goes in the minus bc she didn’t account for me not cashing it yet”

590,"First of all, I'm happy with my body and weight. I'm almost 90 lbs and I'm 4'11"". I'm usually toned up in summers because I jog and do exercise in the spring.

However.... I wasn't always 90 lbs. I was usually 104 lbs and my heaviest weight was 108 lbs for a short time. I had stubborn belly fat. It was a little bump. I didn't like my waist. A year after my college graduation, I started to jog and I was at 99-101 lbs at that time. I wanted to get rid of my stubborn belly fat.

Do you know what was surprising me? I lost a pound a week even if I didn't change my diet. Well, I cannot give up on ice cream. I fell in love with my abs and waist!! I thought my size didn't change until I put on my clothes. They felt loosen lol. My bust shrunk from C cups to B cups though since most of my fats were stored in my waist and bust. For first time, I have nice curves because my waist shrunk and no fat caused ""double curves.""

Last year I didn't jog so much and I did exercise. I'm afraid of jogging because it was fast weight loss so I don't want to be underweight lol... I think of joining the gym to concentrate on toning up my body since the weather is still cold and I want to be look nice for my cruise vacation this spring.

Any tip? I just want to tone up my body and I don't want to be underweight lol. I went to the gym once and I visited a couple gyms. Honestly, those gym people intimidated me because they look arrogant and judgemental so I feel like I can't blend in. I don't want them to laugh at me if I don't know how to use equipment at gym or how to do exercise right. That's why I want to ask for tips before I go to the gym. Sorry, I have social anxiety... Advice will be appreciated. Thank you!",07Jan2019,1
591,"This is an ongoing problem that isn’t urgently affecting me or the people around me. I see this guy less than once a month. But I just thought about it now and I want to get some advice before I forget again. 

So I’m 18/f. I’m part of a group of friends who range in age from 15-20. We’re part of a very close-knit community; our families all know each other. 

My mom has a friend whose oldest kid is a 19-year-old boy. Let’s call him Jake. My friends and I all know and hate Jake. We only see him occasionally, at some events throughout the year, but when we do see him, we have to let him hang out with us. We’re not allowed to tell him to fuck off because “he can’t be that bad; his mom is such a nice lady” according to my mom. 

Jake likely has some kind of mild intellectual disability, but it doesn’t excuse his behavior, in my eyes. 

In October, we were hanging out and he was getting very touchy with some people. He grabbed my 15-year-old male friend’s crotch “to be funny”, which made my friend extremely uncomfortable. But it gets so much worse, because about an hour later he began to take interest in my other friend’s 12-year-old sister, whom we’ll call Marie. 

Marie is 12, but she appears to be more like 10. She’s petite and skinny, very childlike in appearance, which makes this story all the scarier. 

Jake, my friends and I, and a few people’s little siblings were hanging out outside. It was cold out, and Jake was like “Let’s keep each other warm” and hugged Marie (whom he doesn’t know very well) from behind. She looked visibly uncomfortable but was too shy/polite to say anything. He tried flirting with her a few times while my friends and I tried to figure out how to put a stop to it. 

We played “keep Jake away from Marie” the rest of the night, purposefully situating ourselves such that Marie never had to sit or stand anywhere near Jake. But then Jake found another girl - this time, a very shy, meek 14-year-old - to flirt with. Not much better. 

In the car on the way home, I told my mom that Jake seemed to be taking interest in girls who are way too young for him. I was hoping she’d have some advice for how to appropriately handle the situation. She shrugged it off and said, “It’s okay. It’s probably not as big of a deal as it seemed like at the time, and any of y’all could take him down if it were really necessary” (Jake is kind of scrawny).

We’ve seen him multiple times since October, and we’ve avoided him as much as possible. He did say a few odd things, but nothing as blatant as before. That said, I am worried that he might do the creepy stuff again in the future. 

I’d be glad to fight Jake if he ever creeps on a friend’s little sibling again, but I don’t want it to have to come down to using violence. That’s a last resort. We can’t call the police since he technically hasn’t done anything illegal. I want one of two things to happen. Either (a) I want to effectively get Jake to stop creeping out little girls, or (b) I want to be able to purposefully exclude him from my friend group without my mom getting upset with me. 

Is there anything I can do or say to make either of these things happen?",07Jan2019,1

594,"This I my first time posting here, so if anything is done wrong please let me know.

Basically, I am in school 10th grade and became best friends with someone who I will call Becky for this. So me and Becky became closer friends and we ended up having many lessons together, as well as form. They joined later on in school, and when they first joined we didn’t speak much, but we started to become better friends.

That part doesn’t matter too much, all you need to know is we were very close friends, through out the two and a half years we’d been close I liked her the whole time, yet I didn’t tell her. The only reason was it would of been rather unusual to me, for her to like me back as we are the same gender and she spoke a lot about guys. 

I never mentioned it to anyone until one day my friend  (I will call her Molly) came over to me as I asked her if I could speak to her. Molly knew Becky and we were all apart of the same friendship group, this meant that it was easier to speak to her, so I told her that I liked Becky and not to tell her as I don’t really want her finding out. In third lesson, I was asked by Becky what was wrong as I had been acting off and I denied everything and said I was fine. To get to the point, she ended up finding out whilst she was sat opposite me last lesson, which as you may think didn’t put me in a great position.

She messaged me when we got back and we spoke a lot and had conversations every night, it led to us then dating later on, which only lasted for a little. I ended the relationship as I felt that was what she wanted, so I said I think we should end it and all she said was okay idm. 

Now it’s 2019, since then they have spoke about certain guys they like to me, and told me that they don’t like me that way anymore. We are still close friends, and I would hate to end the friendship as we are such good friends, and it hurts when we aren’t speaking or aren’t friends (as I have tried that before as it was suggested). 

I’m not too sure what to do in this situation, it hurts being their friend at times, and then when we aren’t friends it hurts too. Any advice?",07Jan2019,1

Online rankings can only tell me so much, unfortunately, and I’d love to hear everyone’s personal opinions. My degree is in a pretty flexible field, so long as I’m within an urban area.  

Requirements: 

1) Little to no cold weather (a couple weeks a year is fine...I just can’t do 2-3 months of below freezing slush/snow) 
2) Less than an hour from an international airport
3) Good public transportation (bus only is okay, but a light rail/train system would be ideal)

602,"I’m 25 and still at college. I have no high school or college degree. I’m still living with my parents. 

My story is a bit long and I am typing on phone excuse the grammar. 

When I was 18, I dropped out of hs with a month away from hs graduation. Ignoring school and family then run away from home. Throwing everything away just to spend more time with my then boyfriend. Never ended up getting the degree. 

I ended up going to community college after my hs drop out. The first two years of cc was horrible. I didn’t know what to do or understand the idea of college. The first two years I ended up just signing up for classes and never show up because I didn’t know you have to drop the class. I ended up failing most of those classes. Gpa was close to 1. 

Later I broke up with my previous hs boyfriend. Met another guy, then got into a really physical and emotional abuse relationship. This boyfriend advice me to start over at another cc because of my horrible grade. So when I transfer it wouldn’t be too bad. I listen and start all over again at another college. 

When I started college I had nursing major in mind. I pick nursing not because I enjoy the major but my parent’s friends telling me nursing is a good major that provide sustaining job opportunities. I ended up being a med tech for a short while and hated it.

After a year at my new college, I decided nursing is not for me. It didn’t help that my new abusive boyfriend would tell me that nursing is a low-life job and I shouldn’t do it. 

I decided I wanted to switch major. I know I always love art ever since I was little, but didn’t really want to go into art major. I decided to go into architecture design, where I can have an art related major. 

At this time I start to take classes from uni in order to finish the prerequisite for transfer. At first two quarters I was doing great at school and life was balanced for once. The all went straight down when my then boyfriend become more and more abusive. We would get it fight every two days. The fight become more and more violence. I would get push into walls or closet. I often got beaten and when I try to leave he put out kitchen knife threaten to kill both of us. I would get so scare and call the police but never file any charges. 

That was a dark time for me. No need to say my study was horrible because of that. I have zeros in my grade with classes I didn’t go because of the abuse. My grade went from 3.6 to 1.8 as is for now. 

The abuse lasted a while but eventually I broke up with this abusive boyfriend. My grade have so much holes in it, i was in a pretty depressive state. 

Then I took year a break from college/uni. 

Then I ended up dating my fiancé, who care and love for me since high school.  He was always there for me and supportive of me.

I still want to transfer to architecture degree but it  is hard now with my horrible grade. I don’t think I would give in but I’m still going to try.  

I have passion in architecture design but I often think that I’m not good enough as all the other students. I’m lower then average on my designing skill and will never be as good as the other students. 

I’m also thinking about applying for a private school for Bachelor of fine art degree for game art and animation but at the game school I would have to start all over again from freshmen year. That’s going to take another four years and I’m not sure if that is worth it. The teaching methods and teachers at the game school is great and the school as long as you work hard. They have a unlimited time resubmit policy. The con is that is it really expensive and I would have to take up loan for that if I do end up getting accepted. 

What should I do..? ",07Jan2019,1
603,"I'm an eighteen year old female. If I do have this disorder, I most likely inherited it from my mother. I've ended countless of friendships because I've gotten easily offended and let my insecurities get the best of me. I cry for absolutely no reason. I don't drink or do drugs, but not by choice. I think if I ever experimented with drugs, I'd find myself easily addicted. I feel no hope for my future. I am currently unemployed and don't have my driver's license, which is embarrassing for me to admit. I'm currently attending community college, but I'm worried that I'm making a big mistake. I have overwhelmingly low self-esteem. I feel that I look like a very masculine woman. I can't help but compare myself to other women all the time. I also can't help but dread over what could have been potential boyfriends and I get super jealous when I think of their girlfriends or exes. I'm so insecure that I highly edit all of my selfies by using filters and editing apps. I hate my giant nose, I hate my acne, I hate my hair, I don't like the shape of my body. I am not indepenedent and I rarely make an effort to be. I'm really bad at articulating myself, so please bare with me if you can. I haven't been getting any sleep whatsoever. On rare occasions, I do try to be more independent, but then I always worry that I'll fail. I haven't been getting any sleep. I'm not suicidal. A part of me worries that I'm just being a big baby. I feel impulsive. I can never seem to keep my damn mouth shut. I always want attention. I try not to get angry over things such as someone not responding to my messages. There are days where I'm overwhelmed with optimism. What makes things even worse is that I somehow managed to get a boyfriend through a dating app (my first ever boyfriend), but I'm still miserable. Is this because I live in Pennsylvania and he's in Arizona? I opened up to him about thinking that I might have BPD, but I regret it because I don't want him to think I'm weak or crazy. He has been so sweet and supportive. Whenever I used dating apps, I used them with the sole purpose of boosting my self-esteem. I never meant for most of my interactions to get far, I just wanted to bathe in men's adoration. Can someone explain what is going on? Is there anyone willing to talk to me? I could use a friend right now considering that I don't have any. I am currently feeling nothing. ",07Jan2019,1
604,"Xpost from r/relationships. I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance for formatting issues. I'm just seeking any advice, anecdotes, anything really. 

I am dealing with insane amounts of stress and anxiety over my situation, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've considered seeing a doctor for anxiety medication, for anyone who has dealt with anxiety issues, is it worth it to do so? Sometimes I even worry that all this stress I have will affect my relationship with my husband, and honestly that scares me because I have a hard time containing all of this and I don't want to damage our relationship by being unable to cope, constantly unloading my anxiety on him, or taking things out on him. When I go to get my kids for my weekend time, I am full of fear and anxiety of what he might do or say this time, and I'm having GI issues as a result.

I gave up custody of my kids about 6 months ago. After almost a year of 50/50 split and a slew of issues with my ex, he approached me and told me he wanted full custody for various reasons. The anxiety part comes from many events of the past year, so I guess to give a better idea of that, I need to go into further detail. I split with my ex after a long time being together. He was unemployed collecting disability the entire time, and I motivated him to finish college and get a degree, which has allowed him to have a job now. I had tried to break things off several times, but somehow he always manipulated his way back and convinced me it was I who had the problems and should be grateful someone loved me as much as he did, given all of my issues.

Anyway, after splitting up with him, I found a new place to live and moved out. That was my first mistake, one major misstep in the loss of custody, as I should have made him leave and immediately hired an attorney. But what's done is done.. it's still deeply upsetting when I think about how stupid I've been.. how easily manipulated.. but I try not to think about it or I spiral into depression. 3 months later I met a man who I married a year later, and during this time my ex was still trying to reconcile and I just didn't know how to tell him that it wasn't happening and it was over, I was free. So it was a shock to him when he found out I was seeing someone. He bombarded me after I was leaving an appointment one day. Called me a whore, among other things, told me I cheated on him, and told me he was serving me papers for a legal custody agreement. At that time we decided 50/50 was best, and I wholeheartedly agreed and signed; I love my kids, they're amazing and I love being a mom.

Different arguments and issues arose over the next 6 months, and while my new relationship was blossoming into something wonderful, my ex had hired a private investigator unbeknownst to me, and revealed it during a conversation in which he told me he wanted full custody. I'll admit here, and freely, that I did not do anything during the time I was being spied on, and I have never put my kids into harms way. My son during this time pulled some dumb kid stuff involving photographing himself with my new stepson, which my ex knew about. So with that, in combination with the threats of whatever he thought he had with the PI, I was afraid of what would happen and I signed.

The nightmare after splitting with him just keeps getting worse and worse.. I made poor financial decisions when moving out, the rent was too high for what I could afford, my credit card debt kept rising, and now I am barely able to make payments each month, with very little left for food and gas. My weekends with my kids is spent eating cheap meals and going to free places like the park for fun. When we initially signed the paperwork, he also convinced me to sign under the pretense that I wouldn't be paying child support so that I could catch up on my growing debt, which he was aware of. And, the legal agreement does state that we opted not to do child support. Now, he is saying I need to pay him child support monthly. I DO feel a financial obligation to my kids, and as such I've been providing clothes, diapers, toys, etc monthly, as we initially agreed we would split the costs of everything. Now he's saying I should come up with a ""figure"" for what I think is fair, and honestly, I figure it's only a matter of time before I get served again.

I know my situation could be much much worse, but honestly this is the highest amount of stress and anxiety I have ever had in my life, and it is pressing me in directions I've never been in. I've had suicidal thoughts... I'd never go through with it, I love life and everything about it, but sometimes the anxiety of not knowing what the next day might be like, and the thought of not having to deal with this anymore sounds too good to be true. And I know that all stories have 2 sides to tell, but this is my story and how I've lived through it to this point surprises me how little I've learned about being so easily manipulated. I am constantly disrespected by the ex, he treats me like I'm not even the mother of my own kids. My daughter had an illness recently and I didn't even find out she had been to the emergency room until the next day. I've communicated in every possible way I can think of, but nothing seems to work or get through. I'm just at a point now of total hopelessness, I have no idea what to do and any advice would be appreciated.

Tldr: I'm having major issues with my ex, he's done everything he can to ruin my life and every day the nightmare gets worse. Any advice?",07Jan2019,1

606,"So yesterday I was trying to get into my parking garage which is a one lane entrance and exit. It can cause quite the jam sometimes.  I was trying enter the garage when another car came up to the gate. Now most people in our community will back up to allow the person entering room to get in because I live in LA and waiting to back up into the street can take a long time. 

Instead this person drives forward and blocks the entrance and refuses to move. I try to wave and gesture to say “hey I don’t have anywhere I can go, can you back up?” But he does nothing. Then when I see that he isn’t going to move, I have no choice but to wait until traffic moves so I can back up. This process takes about another 5 min. LA traffic can really suck.  But while I am waiting he is slowly nudging forward. LITERALLY FORCING MY CAR OUT INTO TRAFFIC. I wave over and over at him to stop. Which he does when he is about a foot from my car and I’m a foot into road. 

Once I am able to pull out, I see that his window is down. So is mine. When he drives by I say to him “next time just back up.” I pull into the lot and grab a box I was picking up from the train station that day. I walk inside the door to my building, call the elevator and get on. Before the door can close I hear the outside crash out and open someone say “WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!” I can’t even open my mouth to form a word before he runs into the elevator and corners me. He get an inch from my face and starts to yell “WHAT DID TOU SAY TO ME?! HUH?! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY TO ME?!” To which I say “I said next time back up.”

He response went like this “NAH FUCK YOU. YOU BACK UP BITCH. YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING IN THE STREETS SAY IT TO MY FACE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?! THIS IS MY FUCKING PARKING LOT.” All while gestures wildly and randomly ball up his fists in my face. 

He thens bangs his fist threw the box I picked up, breaking it open. The thing thing really got to me was that a suit my late grandfather got me was in that box which now has stains on it. LA is also really dirty. 

Now I am a big guy, but I have never been in a fight before and I have quite a high flight reflex when it comes to situations like this. 

I told my landlord what happened and she didn’t really seem to care. And I didn’t call the police because he didn’t put his hands on me. 

But now I’m afraid of my own parking garage because I might run into this guy again. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

608,"  My mom is a lunch lady at the local high school, she loves the job, she has been there for many years. The kitchen serves about 300 kids daily. They went on winter break the second week of December, on the last day of school she had a student tell her that all of the snack bags had holes in them. She didn't think much of it. The student decided to buy a poptart, only to come back a few minutes later and claim it had little bites taken out of it. Weird, she let him exchange it.

  They went back to school today and when the lunch ladies opened the kitchen, they quickly realized they had a mouse infestation. My mom described mouse droppings *everywhere*. In the snack bins, in the oven, on the counters, in the potato chip bin, in the sinks, in cupboards. The mice had built nests in both cash register drawers, they assume that's where they were living. Any food or snack that was exposed had been chewed into. 

  The manager of the kitchen told my mom that it's her job to clean up the mess while she preps lunch. My mom is not the type to ""stand up to the man"" so she did as told. When she asked how she's supposed to clean it, the manager instructed her to use warm water and a towel and to throw away the food that had been tampered with. This manager is known for doing things that don't seem very kosher. The big boss sees no wrong with the manager though. In essence, my mom feels that she can't go to the big boss with concerns about the manager because of previous issues. 

  I'm disgusted to hear about this. First off, I feel that there should be some sort of protocol for a trained company to come clear the kitchen before they can serve food. Second, my mom was exposed to the nastiness that mice can carry by being told to clean it up. Third, the students were served food that I believe is considered contaminated. My family has never dealt with mice but I know they can carry diseases and viruses. 

  My question is, is there anything I can do? My mom is scared to death to lose her job. I dont know if there is an anonymous option to report something like this? Who would I even report it to? We're in northeast Ohio if it matters. 

TL;DR- my mom is a lunch lady in a kitchen that has mice. She thinks she'll lose her job is she goes above her boss's head. Is there anything I can do?",07Jan2019,1

613,"I have known this girl since I was about 12 started being together freshman year of high school, I liked her back then nothing than serious the end of that year I moved out the country. Fast forward to college she moves to the country I’m in for college. We started texting again said we would meet for break since she was in a different state . The texting and the phone calls lead me to have feelings for her again and I told how I felt she told me we was too far apart and it might not work never the less she never said no and we both kept entertaining the idea , the day prior we was gonna meet she told me she has been seeing someone and she has been messing with him, I was heart broken to say the least of her lying to me since I knew her since we was children and never saw it coming. She told me it was mistake and so on so I decided to meet her the next day, so we decided to meet but now it was a whole new story she told she was gonna date this Guy and that we should not speak and decides to never talk to me again. I have never felt betrayed in life I would have done anything for this person but the fact they would cut you off so fast but a person you just met a couple month back had me traumatized. To add to it the guy she was dating was talking to her best friend since elementary school so she cut her best fried of as well. Years go by we decide to meet again I was still hurt but I acted like I wasn’t and sadly I was still in love with her. This time we decided to date and again knowing what type of toxic person I was still in love with her. she was drunk one night and told me she never cared that much for me just loves Manipulating me cause she know I will do anything for her and that I’m really in love with her. we fought shortly after that.. later found out she got pregnant and she said he was getting rid of the baby and cut me off just like that AGAIN  .. I don’t want to make the same mistake again when she comes back after some years which I know she will, and I don’t have the heart to cut her off cause i truly love her what should I do, she is very toxic and I know that she fucked her since child best friend boyfriend and kept it from her and that girl is also broken for life now ...she won’t  do an inch of what I would for her . Thank you for reading and help would be appreciated ",07Jan2019,1

615,"Hey guys, so I'm gonna need a little bit of help on talking to this person. A bit of backstory: recently we did some little activity related with this book that we're reading in English class, and from that one of my classmates, a pretty nice guy happened to mention that he holds a lot of grudges. The thing is, that reminded me back to a few years ago when I said something extremely mean to him, which I feel terrible about now that it triggered the memory. The thing is, he doesn't seem like a vengeful person but I think it's very likely that he detests me, and holds a grudge against me. How would I talk to him and confirm it, while also apologizing for my actions? Is there a rough direction of different things to head in, or some key points to say? I'm not going to talk much about what I did, and I feel terrible for what I said. I don't think talking to him is much of an issue because I have talked to him many times before, but I want to say everything correctly and such. It's fine if he won't forgive me, but would it actually be good to at least acknowledge the grudge? Personally, I'm slightly leaning towards doing so, since I think it's better to know openly there is something between us rather than keep it hidden.

Thanks!",07Jan2019,1
616,"Had 4 consultations with a Clinical Psychologist and Career Adviser and, at the end of the 4th, her notes on my behavior, temperament, interests and life philosophy showed that I could be successful in either Law Enforcement or Medical field.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm highly interested in the mysteriousness of solving cases and locking up criminals. But I don't like to be on patrol confronting them head first.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I adore the science of the Medical field and the ability to heal people. Additionally,  I love the fact that Health Practitioners have a skill that can never be substituted (like how most of the jobs are being substituted by machines or computers). 

&amp;#x200B;

How could I combine these two remarkable fields of study? I was thinking of something along the lines of a **Forensic Medical Examiner**.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very curious to read your opinions.   


Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Clinical Psychologist claims that my personality traits matches that of a Law Enforcement Officer and/or Medical Practicioner. Am fascinated by both. How can I take advantage of both fields of study?",07Jan2019,1

618,"The situation is a little more complex than just wanting to get hold of my ex, so I will provide a little background on the situation. 

To be 100% clear I'm absolutely not trying to get back with or hook up with her.

So we where best friends long before we even started a relationship, but unfortunately the relationship turned toxic and the decision was made to end it. After several months we started to hang out again and start to rekindle our friendship, a few months after that she began dating this new guy who was extremely uncomfortable with me being around which I understood, so we put some space between each other and didn't speak of some time. The next time I spoke to her was to clear up something ongoing from when we where toghter. We caught up a bit and she told me she was pregnant, I was surprised but genuinely happy for her. Anyway since then we've had not contact which was about 9 months ago.

A few of days ago I hear that her new baby daddy had beaten the shit out of her and that she had left with his unborn child, now while I no longer have romantic feelings for her, I do miss my friend and therfore am worried about her, so I decided to do a little investigation and found that she had lost her house, her children and is currently living in a refuge, I'm naturally worried about her and therefore want to get in contact, make she and the baby are ok (as far as you can with under the circumstances) but more importantly safe. 

I realise I could ask the people who gave me this information whether everything is ok, but like most people even when everything has gone to shit she'll tell them it's fine. I also realise you may think that if she wanted contact she would get hold of me, there's a whole different story behind why she wouldn't, none the less even if she wanted to she won't. Her family are also emotionally unsupportive to put it in the nicest possible way.

Right now ive got the back story out of the way here are my concerns, Im potentially going to open up old wounds and/or feelings, which has got to be the last thing she needs right now and even though I have nothing but the best intentions I feel as though I'm being selfish as I can't help but feel it's more for me than it is for her.

I've spent the last five days mulling it over and have pretty much decided not to reach out even though I want to. In the back of my mind I can't help but feel maybe there's something I could do the support her.

619,"Throwaway account because the people I'm talking about know my reddit account.

I've been suffering from SA for a while now, but only started telling the people closest to me since about August of last year. My closest friends were surprised at first and lowkey offended that I didn't tell them up until then, but they somewhat understood why I waited super long to do so.

Over the course of the next few months one of my friends (I'll call him friend A) and I's relationship started getting strained without my knowledge, and he started to ghost/avoid me. When I started to suspect this, I asked my other friend that I trust (friend B) if friend A has been avoiding me. Friend B told me that friend A told him a couple days prior that he doesn't like me at the moment and sees me as annoying. If this was just someone I knew for a couple months I probably would've just moved on, but since I have been friends with friend A for about four years now, I wanted to confront him about it. Friend A told me there's nothing to work out and just lied to me that there isn't an issue he has with me. Knowing that I was being lied to(friend B would not lie about this because he knows how horrible it would me), I just rebuttled everything that I was told that friend A said about me and why I do what I do.

We all have a discord we go on together, but after I rebuttled almost everything to friend A, he started using a different discord and invited all of the regulars to it except myself. Sometimes the regulars go into that discord to play games or hangout with each other there because friend A is in there, including friend B. At first friend B wouldn't really participate in it because he agreed with me that it only just reinforces friend A's thought and shows that friend B is accepting his thought process about it. Friend B tried a lot to work it out from the outside because through all of this he is pretty much the middle-man even though he doesn't want to be the middle-man. Nowadays it's pretty much a weekly occurrence that everyone is going to that discord while I'm just left alone in the once-only discord that was used. Because of this, I've had multiple anxiety attacks where I would be convinced that friend B is avoiding me to, everyone is there talking shit about me, etc etc. It fucking sucks. Even though it isn't quite the same, I sometimes message friend B if I could join in on their game session because usually playing games distracts me from my anxiety. More often than not, I'm told no because friend A doesn't want to play with me.

I've been told about multiple situations where friend A has shit-talked me behind my back, but whenever he is asked for a specific reason as to why he doesn't like me anymore and sees me as annoying, friend A just says ""I don't know, it's like a switch flipped in my head or something."" When he's told possible solutions that don't 100% benefit him, he refuses to even listen. He's been told to just mute me so I could at least still interact with my current friends, but he won't budge. Every now and then, I message friend B about what the fuck is going on, and friend B isn't the best at keeping conversations between people, but knowing this, I still message him asking if there's any way to work it out. He usually says now, but the last time I did this, friend A messaged me on steam telling me that this isn't an essay (I had been typing a long message) and ""frick you"" as a way to bait me into saying something so he actually has a reason to convince people to not like me as well. I just ignored it. The last time I asked to be invited to play games or whatever, I was told no by friend B, and shortly after friend A messaged me a cryptic message that just said ""it's not true."" Confused, I asked what he meant, and he said ""don't worry about it."" The next day, I messaged friend B about what he meant by this, and friend B said ""he thought I was going to tell you that he didn't want to play with you.""

It should be expected, but friend A only joins my discord after only friend B joins it and if I'm there, sometimes he just won't come in but sometimes will. Going over all my options about this situation, and trying multiple things, I recently have just been going with the route of ignoring it and focusing on the relationships I currently have and giving friend A his space by not messaging him, asking to work it out, etc. A day doesn't pass without me thinking about what I see as the ""nuclear option"" here. If I ban/remove friend A from my discord as an eye for an eye sorta deal where he gets treated the same as me, it could show to him how exactly it feels to be in the position I am, but I don't want anyone to feel like that, including my now ex-friend. If I also go with the nuclear option, people would also spend more time in the other discord, and I would spend less time with those close to me.

I'm not completely innocent here though. It is partly my fault why this relationship is strained, because friend A made some decisions that I didn't really approve of regarding his education, and friend A didn't like that I wasn't approving of it, even though I would still support him either way. He saw me as a know-it-all, and described ways he sees me in this regard, but he does the exact same things he called me out on being a know-it-all, so I don't really know what he's talking about here.

Pretty much, if I cut friend A off, I have to damn near start over and will be interacting with my current friends less, which is shitty for me. If I don't do it, and just keep ignoring it while holding on the the possibility that this will all work out in the end, because I just want things to return to how they were like a year ago. I've accepted that my relationship with friend A is never going to be the same, but I still want to interact with friend B and other mutual friends I have with friend A without having to worry every single night as to whether or not which discord they will be going into.

What the hell do I do guys? I really am at a huge crossroads here.",07Jan2019,1
