1,"Hey guys, I’m posting about this because I feel pretty confused. For a little backstory, basically two years ago I met this girl and we continued talking for a year. We were both 16 at the time, today we are both 18. After a year of talking I developed feelings for her and when I confessed my feelings to her we tried it for a couple weeks. But ultimately she still was dealing with her own personal issues before she could be in love with someone else, she needed to work on herself and she basically didn’t have feelings for me. She was still broken from a past relationship. I believe I was also too needy and childish for her to love me back then, so it makes sense to me now. Basically I was left broken just like she was before, it was my first real heartbreak and it’s been over a year and I’m still not fully over it, but I’m way better now. I cut off all contact and blocked her on Instagram. I told her it was something I had to do in order to heal and I couldn’t just be friends. She was very guilty for hurting me but she understood. I’ve pretty much moved on since then, it’s been over a year and a half, but I’m still not fully over her and I still find her to be the only girl I’ve ever fell that hard for, no one else has compared.

Well last week, after almost a year of no contact, she sent me something along the lines of this:


“Hey, i’m sorry for bothering you 
I just wanted to check up on you and ask how you’re doing, even though you may hate me or don’t want to talk to me or something. Anyways, i really hope you’re doing great and everything is good and life is treating you good, And i hope you’re happy❤
I wish you all the best, Andd...umm.. I miss you
Anyways, I’m sorry again for bothering you...
Goodbye”


I woke up to this message and I was kind of shocked to hear from her after a year of not talking. I replied telling her that I don’t hate her and that everything is fine with my life. She probably thinks I hate her because I cut off all contact, but it was just necessary for me to move on. She replied with:

“I just hate the idea that you may hate me or that i’m the one that hurt you or something, i reallyy hate it”

I told her she shouldn’t feel guilty about making a decision that she thought was best for her, whether it hurt me or not. Then she replied with

“No I’m not texting you because I feel guilty about it, honestly I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a while but I’ve been hesitating. And yeah about that decision I don’t know about that, I thought it was for the best but idk...”


Wtf is that supposed to mean? We continued talking about our lives for a bit after that and then I stopped replying.  But I’m really confused because it sounded like she regrets what happened between us and might want me back, but it also might be that she just misses me. I am just afraid that if she likes me now, that I will end up being hurt again, I’m afraid of feeling that pain again. But deep down I’ve always wanted to end up with her in the future. I feel that maybe, as time goes on we might reconnect with each other and it might end up working out between us in the future, because we both care a lot for each other. we both had a special connection and we both miss each other, it was just not possible to be together at the time. But at the same time I have zero expectations and don’t expect anything to happen, and I’d be totally okay with it not happening, because then it’s just not meant to be. 


A week after she sent me this message, I talked to her myself. We talked for a while and it was great, we made each other laugh and it was a good conversation. I kept my boundaries and I wasn’t needy or “friendly” as I was before. Although I’m not sure where she stands. A couple days after she texted me again and we talked again. The conversation was really playful and fun, the chemistry was there and maybe stronger than before. There was a lot of teasing/flirting and you could sense the chemistry from her also. So the advice I’m asking is, how can I talk to her now with a clean slate and attract her? She obviously wouldn’t have messaged me if she didn’t have some form of feelings for me, or if she hadn’t been thinking about me. How should I approach this? I don’t want to directly tell her I like her again because I’m afraid she will say no, but I want to build that attraction over time, in the hopes that eventually we will build attraction and end up together. How do I talk to her in a way where she doesn’t see me as just a friend, considering it’s been a whole year? Or should I just avoid contact completely? Currently we are not in the same country so I can’t see her in person, but I will be back there in a couple of months for Christmas, I’m currently studying abroad and all we have is our phones. She is also starting college this fall. The odds just seem slim given the circumstances but I think love is always worth it if it’s there. Thank you for reading this and for any advice I may receive! It’s all love &lt;3

3,"I’m in my early twenties. I’m a female and I own a house, have a good job in IT making around 50K in a low cost of living area, and I have an elementary aged child from when I was younger. I’ve been dating the same person who lives with me in my house for almost a year, and before him I’ve dated others for a few years at a time mostly. 

Anyways, I am in love with the person I’m with. I know for sure that I am. However, I just hate how dating is in this young generation. I feel like it’s impossible to trust men. I struggle with insecurities about my body and men in this generation pretty much all have an ongoing porn addiction and it’s not frowned upon to go to hooters/strip clubs and places like that. It’s whatever, I don’t really care except that it amplifies my insecurities. My current boyfriend quit all of that when we started dating not at my request but because he knew it made me insecure and he struggles with insecurity too so he knew what it was like. We decided early in the relationship things like that were considered cheating and neither of us were to do it (I’m bisexual which heightens his insecurity). I’ve caught him once a few months ago and even though it might not bother most too much, it just kind of brought me back down to reality. I feel like id be so much happier long term if I just remained single and didn’t have to worry about what someone else was doing. I’m sure it would be really rough at first to split but I just can’t see myself doing this long term with a single person. I’m very career oriented and I feel like I could go far with my career and retire early. I’m preparing now to invest in real estate as well which is why I bought my current residence (it’s in a prime rental area). I already have a child and I don’t have any desire to have another. I used to want to do the mom of a bunch of kids/wife thing but I’ve been cheated on and lied to in too many relationships and I’ve learned to find gratification in my career and hobbies instead. 

Anyways, I told my boyfriend last night I need some space. He doesn’t have anywhere to go so I told him he can stay until he finds a better paying job but I just don’t want to be touched/looked at by him anymore. He keeps apologizing for messing things up because I gave him a warning when we first started dating that I’m very fragile and he was an exception to my rising no dating rules for myself. After him I think I’ll be truly happy not dating. He was a last attempt. He’s really broken saying he feels horrible and would take everything back he’s done to me. Now I’m in a pickle trying to decide what I should do. We’re in love but relationships don’t seem worth my time. This is a conclusion I’ve come to over the years.",03Aug2019,2
4,"My teacher is very sweet natured and kind but she is making remarks about me being attractive and touching me (not in anywhere abusive yet) and it is making me uncomfortable.

She has not done anything yet that is illegal but I am going to be alone with her on Monday and I am a bit fretful about how she might act.

 I am male and a lot of people might think I should be flattered but I want to date people my own age not my 30 year old teacher.

She is a very attractive woman (as I’m supermodel looks) and I don’t know why she is focused on me. I have long had depression and it has made me quite vulnerable so that might be it.

5,"I am currently a rising senior in high school that plans on going to college as the next logical step. My parents hired a college counselor for me a few months ago mainly to help me with the Common Application essay. I don't find my conversations with this counselor to be particularly meaningful or helpful, but I don't mind talking with him. In a recent meeting, my counselor asked me if I could recall any impactful moment in my life where I experienced pain or sorrow. I told him that I couldn't. However, I have been depressed for the past few years of high school and typically lack the motivation to venture outside of my comfort zone. I tend to stay at home where I can keep to myself. I'm not sure how to approach my college counselor with my depression and whether or not I should even bring this up to my counselor. Any advice is appreciated.",03Aug2019,1
6,"Here's my problem. I have entered a phase of my life where I'm meeting new people and I really want to catch up with friendships that can last, my impediment with It may be the fact that I can meet new people, and end up with potential friends, even end up having their number, though when It comes to go and talk to them via text, I get disinterested on that and usually end up ghosting them after. I usually begin texting, everything cool, the conversation's flowing, I try to ask them questions and keep the conversation flowing, though after that I just end up bored of that chat and I close WS shortly after.

7,"For months now I’ve been experiencing numbness on the left side of my face. It starts near the temple and ear and seems to radiate behind the eye and on my cheek and jaw. This has increased and become worse over time with more symptoms popping up - my jaw feels tight and tense and eating became difficult. Lately I’ve noticed this affecting my speech as well. My tongue and mouth also feel tight/tense and sometimes forming words is difficult. 

I’ve had major anxiety over this and even had a panic attack the other night when the symptoms started up. My brother had a stroke a couple years ago and he is young like me (28 F). I worry about this often. My doctor gave me anxiety medication and said she doesn’t believe it is anything serious but it’s hard for me to live with the symptoms without feeling anxious. 

Any advice appreciated, from a very nervous me 😩",03Aug2019,1

While I'm glad mental health is becoming less of a taboo, I'd hate to see people romanticizing it. I'm not diagnosed with depression but I definitely struggled with self worth and suicidal thoughts for the past 10 years and those 10 years were excruciating, especially as a growing teen.

And also, what is the normal? I've always had a sneaking suspicion that everyone's probably felt down, worthless, shamed and/or suicidal at some point but I can't help but feel frustrated when I can't just be at peace with myself for most part because it's really not everyday so maybe I'm just making stuff up for attention, maybe I've spent too much time on the internet and really need to put my head back in the clouds.",03Aug2019,4

17,"So all my life I have experienced this.  I feel the same emotions as most people, or people that I consider as normal.  However what causes me to feel these emotions, sadness, happiness, anger, etc... Are drastically different than what causes other people to feel those things. Things that I find funny, others don't.  Things that make others sad, I'm not sad.  Things that make me sad, others don't find sad.  Etc...

Obviously this makes it really hard for me to connect with others and relate, and for others to connect with me and relate.

As result, in my head I always run two templates in social situations. What I feel, and what I assume others will feel (based off experience and observation and studying)

Other than that issue, I'm pretty sure I'm a fully functional and have no other major issues.

21,"Due to some unfortunate circumstances of my life after college, I still live with my parents at 24. I’m finally back on my feet and would like to move out soon. I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but I’m not able to decide when for a few different reasons.

First, I’m still generally lost in life and I’m trying to find the right direction for myself. I’d like to quit my job and take some risks to help me explore, which include traveling and basically things that will cause me to be unstable for a little while. I have a somewhat good amount in savings, but that would definitely make a dent.

The other reason why I’m reluctant to move out is because of the complicated relationship that I have with my parents is finally becoming more normal. There was a lot of frustration and disagreements, but I feel like they fully view me as an adult now. The time home was necessary for us to come to a common understanding of each other, and  I think they respect me more. However, there are still some things that I keep from them (like I’m queer and they’re more conservative). I’m wondering if moving out will make me fearless to reveal those things. 

Anyway, my question is this: when should I move out? They said I can stay however long I want because they like having me here, so the decision is solely up to me.",03Aug2019,1

She didn't mention if it was for religious reasons or if it was discomfort that she thought i would hit on her or be creepy. She told me she was putting in a room change request. 

The request was denied and now idk what's going to happen. Like I was kind of offended that she was uncomfortable with my sexuality, but i was also kind of hoping she would get reassigned because i'd rather not have to deal with that for the whole year.

24,"Not a unique situation, I'm sure. My mom and my dad have ""joint-custody,"" but I turned 18 recently so it's no longer a legally binding agreement. I'm at my Dad's house around 40% of the time, with him, his girlfriend, her two daughters, and my little sister. The other 60% of the time, I'm at my Mom's house with my little sister. I believe my dad's girlfriend is very emotionally abusive to most of the people around her, even though she treats me and my sister reasonably well. Recently in am argument, she struck one of her daughters, called her a slut, and threatened to drag her down the stairs by her hair because she lied about returning library books. I want to limit exposure to this woman as much as possible. One of the problems is that she often tries to convince me that I need to respect her more. I think most of my slights against her are imagined, but she's definitely right that I don't respect her and it's possible that I'm making the situation worse. I want to just stop going to his house, or at least reduce the time I spend there, but this idea makes him sad, especially since I'm going away to college in a year. If I did this I think my little sister would be fine, but the aforementioned daughter would continue to be emotionally abused. Not that I do much to help her anyway, because I'm usually too much of a coward to actually confront her mother. Now I'm sitting in my car in my dad's neighborhood. I've told him I'm going to my mom's and we can talk tomorrow, but he insists I come back tonight. I don't know what to do, either now or in the long term. I don't want my dad to be sad, but he'll have to get used to my absence at some point anyway, and I can't live my entire life in service to him.

I have an uncle who is kind of distant, but very nice to me. He works in a very big company. He is starting a marketing project , where they will modernize the website, and open social media for this company (it's a big company, but its very outdated with new technologies). They hired a Marketing Consultant who will set up a team. 

I am a Junior Front End Developer. I work with other stuff, but I wanted to make this my primary work. I started to learn for myself some months ago, but never got a true internship or entry level job. I love working with technology,marketing, coding, design, everything about this project. 

My uncle offered to give my curriculum to this marketing consultant, so the guy could maybe give me an interview so I could work for him. The thing is, I dropped out of college to try to make a living, worked many dead-end jobs, and I basically have nothing to show besides some code and websites that are really simple. I was wondering if maybe, I could ask for an assistant position, or even an internship. I could help managing Social Media and help the design team, or a Front End assistant position. I made a design for the website myself, and I could truly help to complete the website with them. 

My question is, what do I say? Im supposed to send my uncle( a cellphone message, he doesn't want email) my curriculum and some explanation of my work and what I want, and he will show to the guy(my uncle has no idea what this stuff is). I don't know what to write, because I never had to do this before. I need to impress the guy, but he must know I'm entry level, because I can't accept a position where I can't really do the work. Should I ask for the guy's number? 

If it helps, I have junior experience in HTML,CSS and some Javascript, but I was also interested in the managing of their social medias , which would be a more comfortable job before I can truly work alone with coding.

35,"Hey guys. Hoping someone who’s been thru this or a nurse can help! Today I started feeling some strange numbness in my legs when I would stand and walk. I’ve never really experienced this before. Haven’t had any injuries or surgeries that could be causing this. My hands also cramp up when I’m grabbing things sometimes and I have to physically move my fingers back to a relaxed position to make the pain stop. This symptom has been happening for about 6 months. 
Maybe I just need some more vitamins??? My health insurance just got cut off so I can’t exactly just go to the doctor without it costing me an arm and a leg to get tests done for something that could turn out to be nothing, and my doctor had this issue with believing me when I would talk about my symptoms and just brushed every single thing off as nothing. I work a physical job and use my body every day for lifting, pulling, grabbing, up and down on ladders, constantly squatting and walking. My health is important to me! If it does seem like something bad, and the leg numbness continues, I will go to the doctor. But if someone says I should go to the dr right now, maybe that will change my mind. My right leg is numb as I’m writing this sitting down. It’s almost as if it’s the nerves, and not from lack of blood flow, because I am not getting the “falling asleep” sensation, pretty much just straight numbness with a slight tingle that is different from pins and needles feeling. And it radiates down my whole leg. It happens mostly when I stand up from sitting. It’s been alternating between the left calf area and the entire right leg. Maybe it’s connected to my sciatica? Idk. Advice to help the leg numbness and hand cramping is more than welcome. :) my biggest fear is a blood clot traveling to my heart or brain so I’m doing my best not to freak myself out. Not working to well tho. Haha.",03Aug2019,9

Its not just that either, she is very open and kinda brazen about it, she full on set her profile picture at one point to cropped bloodplay and it gets to the point where I can talk to her about say, idk a anime and she'll turn it into how she wants to be stabbed in the stomach or something which really set off red flags for me. I jump out of convos so much with her cause she brings it up so much.

it got to the point where I got actually super fuckin anxious about her going out in real life and trying something like this cause of how much she talked about it. I tried talking to her about it once and I said I had a lot of red flags about her going off recently she didnt really acknowledge it at all and a second time when she got all depressed than got mad at me for it even tho I was calm and tried to be rational. She said that this thing is only a thing between her and her gf and when I pointed out how much she talks to me about it she flipped on me. I explained to her why Im so scared and have so many negative accusations with that type of shit and now shes just kinda not talking to me.

What I honestly need advice with is if I should stay friends with her or not, I feel like its my anxiety getting the best of me but sometimes when she talks about I honestly get scared that she will go off and try this on someone and part of says run but at the same time shes my best friend and ik she more than likely would never do anything like that, idk what to do and im really conflicted.

39,"I understand the title sounds rude, and to be honest I feel like a total dick about it, but if you'd hear me out and lend some advice I'd really appreciate it.

About three months ago I started talking to a girl and met her a couple of times, got along well and slept with her. Since then we have spoken on and off, we get along pretty well and she has mentioned that she has romantic feelings for me. Perhaps foolishly after a few beers I have reciprocated this statement a couple of times. We've only seen each other 6 times in total but I feel like I'm in too deep that it won't be easy to break things off.

For context, over the course of the last year I have lost a significant amount of weight (292lbs to 214lbs and still going), and in turn I have gone from being a total non-consideration for women to somebody who now garners a fairly average amount of female attention. This also means that despite being 24 years old I have relatively little experience with women. When I met this girl I'd had no luck with women for about 4 years, so obviously went in pretty full on. 

In the meantime I have seen a couple of other girls who I am more attracted to both physically and on a personality level. Neither of these have gone anywhere serious, but as horrible as it sounds I can't help but feel that I can do better than the girl mentioned initially. 

I don't consider myself to have cheated on her as we have never actually approached the subject of a proper relationship, and for all I know she may well have also been speaking to and seeing other guys during this period, but obviously I don't know that. Maybe I'm just thinking wishfully to make myself feel better and actually I'm being an absolute dick about it. 

We've made plans to see each other on Sunday and she's made it quite clear that she wants to spend a lot of time with me (just moved into a new place, feeling lonely, etc). I keep going along with it all because I don't want to upset her, but ultimately I feel like I'm cuffing myself to a relationship that isn't what I want.

Honestly my head is just in a bit of a spin and I need some straight words to help me deal with this in a fair and rational way, hopefully while upsetting her as little as possible, as that's the last thing I want to do. Also if I'm acting like an arsehole please let me know. Thanks in advance.",03Aug2019,1
40,"Hey everyone. I’m genuinely interested for some advice on this matter. I’m 24M if that makes a difference. 

My folks are going up to our trailer this Sunday which is around 3 hours away.  I’ve been working on a thesis since the beginning of May. It’s due Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. I’d be gone two weeks. 

My folks guilted me for taking a trip in July with some friends. We were gone for a week. My father mentioned “You could have come up with us, but you went with your friends.”

I feel as if I don’t go I’ll be guilted again. 

They keep telling me I can get work done there but my routines would be thrown off. This is a major thing. ~60 pages (Masters project). 

The main draw there would be the beach and the sun, and a change of scenery.  

However, I do have my parents there for 2 weeks. In general we get along but they have been super over bearing lately. 

I’d stay home for a few reasons.


The place is to myself. Peace and quiet in a different way. No car but I have friends around and most things are local. 

I have two projects I want to start working on. One related to music, one related to podcasting. I feel that with no one home, I can go all in and get process work started.  There are no limits and I can go late into the night if needed. 

I know doing more work after doing work sounds counter productive but I’ve been waiting to have the time to do creative work. I’m pretty sure I can go up in August at some point toward the end of the month anyways. 

I’m an educator so summer ends the first week of September. I’m occasional and in school myself so work is manageable and I can create vacation time later on. 

If you were in my shoes...what would you do and why ??

Thanks Reddit !!",03Aug2019,1

43,"I don't get along with almost all the members of my family. I never met my dad or his side of the family but when it comes to my mom's family I don't get along with almost anybody.

The only people I get along are **my grandfather,** who passed away a long time ago but he was the sweetest and most down to Earth man I've met in my life. A truly feminist or egalitarist even when feminism or egalitarism weren't mainstream and he didn't even know their definition or existence. And **my grandmom** who is a very sweet, lovely and polite lady who cared and still cares for me like if she was my mom.

The rest of my family? I feel they dislike me, and I think I dislike them too.

* **My biological parents,** the people who used to beat me, lock me up and psychologycally torture me? I don't talk to them, and the rest of my family shuns me for being ""a rebellious bad daughter"" and not having a relationship with them as an adult.
* **My uncle-grandpa,** a dictatorial man who thinks he can tell every younger person how to breathe, and who is pissed t me because my 20 years old ass doesn't obey his orders. I don't even live in his house, he lives in his sister's house because he never got an actual job and I economically help her more than he does.
* **My uncle,** a creep that sexually harasses me while the rest of the family tries to make up excuses for him or turn a blind eye, but he hates me because I always call his shit out instead of silently taking it. He's the one that tries to shun me the most and he constantly tries to fuck up my relationship with my grandmom (his aunt).
* **My distant relatives,** pretty conservative people that dislike me because I dress and live how I want no matter what their religion say.
* **My aunt,** the weirdest one because she always seemed to be the most reasonable person of all but she's actually the craziest? She knows our home country is a hellhole and she paid our flights to come to my grandmom's country, which I'm grateful for but it also happens to be a misogynistic country where working 12 hours a day, seven days a week and sexual harassment are very normalized. And she's pissed at me because, instead of being ""grateful enough"" and ""marrying a local man for the cityzenship"" as she wants me to, I decided to work my ass off and save up some money to move to the neighboor country, where I can become legal without marriage, women are treated we should and people only work 9 hours a day, 5 days a week as it should be? Bitch what the fuck?

I know that even if I'm not perfect and I can make mistakes, I'm right in everything I said but it still feels bad to see them talk, make jokes and enjoy themselves while they shun me for not being like they want me to be. I crave to have a family but I also know that the only reason they like my grandmom is because she's a pleaser who hides her personality, her actual opinions and acts like if she always agreed with them for their acceptance. It's very fucked up but **it still makes me feel like shit to hear from my bedroom when they talk about me in a bad way, to not share moments with them, when they kill the conversation when I come from my bedroom or when they avoid me. It makes me feel unwanted.** 

**How do you deal with this feeling?** I'm moving out in 10 months when I'll finally have enough money to do it but it still is a long time to keep doing this, I don't want to go to therapy because it's expensive and I'm afraid my therapist will agree with my family. Thank you!",03Aug2019,1

I gave my friends a lot of hugs and that helped, but still I feel like I miss someting. Every day I can see myself getting sadder and sadder.

The interviewer reassured me, saying that it'd be fine and I would most likely be trained at the end of this week.


I ended up not receiving a call by the end of the week about training so I called them.

77,"24M, married, unemployed, moved to a new country, and completely  unmotivated. I'm very close to finishing my second degree, I have a job  interview next week, I just bought a car, we have some money saved, a  nice apartment, a cute cat, access to pretty much all of the things I  could have ever wanted. On paper, my life is everything I wanted and  then some. I have just about every single thing that I would have said I  wanted at 24 years old (minus a few things). And yet, I feel nothing  and I have no motivation to care about anything and it's ruining my  relationship and making everything feel like a waste. Granted, these  last two years have been incredibly difficult for me and filled with a  lot of things that really broke me down. I also currently have no  friends and the job search hasn't been the greatest. My focus is  non-existent, I have no interests, no hobbies, no goals, no dreams, no  passion, no spark, no love. It's like I am just a shell and I'm watching  someone else go through the motions of life. It's a scary feeling and I  have been stuck in it for quite a while. It feels like my life is over,  as if I were much older than I actually am. I have been to therapy, I  have tried to force myself to do things I used to love, I have immersed  myself in my academic field but I just never feel anything. It's like I  have no control over my thoughts. I'm floating but I want to have my  toes on the ground again. I want to feel like a human, I want to love my  wife, I want to have goals and dreams for my future, I want my time to  be worthwhile, I want to smile, feel excitement, feel joy. I want to get  rid of this dark cloud over my life but I have no idea how to do it or  where to start. I used to be able to get a lot of help from my dad but  since I moved it's not as easy plus he's so similar to me that a lot of  times it doesn't truly help me. I'm hoping for any kind of advice but  please I would like real advice and not the cliche one-liners. I'm  wasting years of my life away and I don't know where to start.",03Aug2019,1

I’m at the beach with her rn and she got in the shower. I never touched her phone as i was sitting on the floor and her phone was on the bed. She came back in the room and I went and got in the shower. I get out the shower and hear her telling her parents that I tried to get into her phone. Then i hear her go back in the room. I get out and go in the room and she asks me why I tried to get in her phone because she put in her password once and it was disabled for 15 minutes. 

I said idk and she is like well you were the only one in here so it was you. I click my phone and it’s disabled for a minute. i ask about it and she goes well i locked yours cause you locked mine. I told her I didn’t lock it again. She ignores me and then turns on her blow dryer.

Now i’m scared to talk to her parents bc they’re very quietly judgy.

I’ve been thinking of it a lot lately—a few months ago I was feeling extremely anxious during an event and they greeted me with a really kind hug that helped me come back down to earth. It probably meant very little to them but I think of it a lot and kind of want to properly thank them for being the one person to show me kindness during something that was really scrutinizing and stressful for me.

She’s graduated and living somewhere else now, so to message her out of the blue would be my only excuse to make clear something I’ve sort of been burying deep down. But I don’t want to seem like I’m trying to get something from her or something, it feels hard to look like I don’t have an ulterior motive, maybe it’s my own difficulty to feel entitled to open up.

I now have the opportunity to come back to that school as well as find the money for it.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

98,"Hello all.  Hoping someone can offer advice or st least listen to me vent.  I’ll keep the story as short as possible.  

I’m married to a wonderful guy and we have an 8 year old daughter.  We both work outside the home, but I’m the breadwinner of the household. As he is in a mostly freelance business.  We’re both fine with this... it is what it is and typical for our professions.  Not super relevant, but provides a bit of perspective to our story. 

Recently, my father- in-law has fallen ill.  He has had heart issues for a while and is now in advanced heart failure.  He has recently had a LVAD surgery to extend his life as much as possible. ( for those of you not familiar, an LVAD is basically a pump typically given to those awaiting a heart transplant.  My FIL isn’t a candidate for a transplant, so this is the best they can do.)

My MIL also has some heart issues...she had a heart attack last fall but has since bern given a clean bill of health.  She also no longer drives.  (She can, just isn’t comfortable with it.). My in-laws are still married and live close to us.  My bro and sis in law live out of state, so most of the help my in laws need around the house falls on my husband. 

My FIL has been in the hospital for 3 weeks after his LVAD surgery.  Since MIL doesn’t drive, my husband also drives her back and forth from the hospital.  Between work, family and the new responsibility of being his parents’ caretaker, my husband is absolutely exhausted.  

It’s also important to mention that my husband has a great relationship with his father.  It pains both of us to see him having these health issues.  The MIL is a slightly different story.  She’s difficult, co-dependent and passive aggressive.  It was manageable at one point, but gotten increasingly difficult as she’s gotten older.  She also refuses to leave/sell their house and move into an assisted living facility or to even downsize to a smaller place.  Staying in their house is the only option in her mind.

Just today, my in-laws approached my husband with a plan for once my FIL gets released from the hospital...they will pay him to be their caretaker.  Which is fine in and of itself, but he would have to cut his projects/hours to do so.  The money they proposed isn’t bad...comparable to his freelance jobs, actually.  But the money isn’t the issue.  Im concerned with the emotional toll it would take on my husband.  He’s not professionally qualified to be a caretaker for a sick person., so Its not in my in- laws best interest either. Im also concerned that boundaries won’t be respected by his mother.  

As you can tell, I am very against this idea.  Mostly because of the reasons listed above, but for other reasons. 
 
I have voiced my concerns to my husband.  He understands but he thinks there might not be an option.  Am I a jerk for thinking this is a bad idea?  Has anyone else been in this situation and has advice on how to move forward?  I realize I might just need to let this play out and there’s not a lot I can do, but any advice is greatly appreciated!",03Aug2019,3
99,"Ok this will probably be long so bear with me. 

I'm hoping someone comes through with some miracle advice to save me here. I live in a slum of an apartment in a small town in illinois. Im not super familiar with the area. The woman i rent from, when i moved here, seemed like a great choice. She had a handful of places around town. Her buildings all seemed nice on the outside. She presented herself very professionally and seemed to be well known. Jump to four months in, we've had five meth addicts living in my building at the same time, one break in (by more meth addicts looking for a stash after the tenant in that apartment went to prison), fights spilling out into the parking lot, a woman, after fighting with her methed up boyfriend, hiding in a car right next to mine while another woman tried to break her way into the car to fight the woman inside and so much more. In one night were at our building twice in less than four hours. The first time, i called them because a fight had spilled out and was very near my car again. When the cops arrived, the people fighting were looked over, one woman was moved into an ambulance and checked out, then she, the other people fighting, AND the cops stood out in the parking lot joking and laughing like old buddies. They brought the woman out of the ambulance and went on their way. Only to come back 3 hours or so, later. That time i didnt call, but still nothing was done to fix the situation. One of the girls (im guessing she's a strawberry based on how she behaves) has a habit of hanging around single or apparently single men in the building trying to trade sex for rides, money, and anything else she thinks she needs. Last night she set her sights on me. Stopped me before i could even get to my door. Until her boyfriend/dealer came outside and saw her. Ive never knowingly met a victim of domestic abuse before but if i had to guess she is one. The way she slinked away and almost ran away from him gave me a majorly bad feeling. And tbe boyfriend/dealer gave me this look that makes me feel like he may try to hurt me. Im no stranger to physical confrontation but hes much larger than me. Add to that the drugs and the fact that he might be armed, and it has me a little more than worried. 

My landlord, on the other hand seems to not care at all that these things are happening, responding to any and all complaints with vague, blanket texts to tenents and no action being taken. I would break my lease if i could afford to, believe me. Trouble is i dont make much money. Im barely able to pay for food day to day. Im not in a position to come up with the money it would take to legally break my lease. I could cut and run, but shes taken every former tenent ive heard about since moving in to court and won. I know hindsight is 20/20 but i never should have signed this lease. 

So i guess, long story short, im afraid to go home for fear of violence or property damage, im constantly stressed about being robbed, and apparently i cant turn to my landlord or the police.",03Aug2019,2

104,"My internet package with my ISP is 200mbps download speed and at one time that's what we were getting and we mostly liked our ISP unlike a large segment of the US population. But in May we began to experience a lot of problems with intermittency and slow speeds. It would drop randomly and, when it was working, it was never faster than 10mbps. I also live in an area with a monopoly. So what follows is a timeline of events to the best of my knowledge, notes, and memory.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mid-May:** 

\-Technician requested. He gets access to the backyard of our apartment building (backyard belongs to another tenant) does he thing, comes inside, moves our modem despite being asked not to, charges us $80 for the trip out there. Internet seems to be working. I contest the $80 charge, Customer service reviews the technicians notes, and removes the charge. All is well in the world.

**Mid-June:** 

\-Internet is intermittent and slow. Request another technician to come out. They get access to the backyard again and they say now that the only way we can get reliable service is if an MDU (Multi-Dwelling Unit) box is installed at our apartment building (we live in a small building, but sure, makes sense, sounds great). Technician says that he will put in the request on his end, but we need to contact our landlord or building manager so that my landlord can make the arrangements with the ISP for the installation.  Huh, interesting.

\-So after he is gone I contact the ISP customer support to get more details about this MDU box so that I don't have to go to my landlord with ""Hey, call these people and figure this out."" I'm told by customer service that the folks who handle the outside lines will contact my landlord to make the arrangements and that I don't have to do that. 

""Do they have her information to do that?"" I ask incredulously. 

""Yes,"" they respond unequivocally. 

I accept the lie they have told me. I am then told that they will make contact with her within a few days and usually respond to tickets within 24-48 hours and that someone will call me with an update.

\-I email my landlord, telling her about our issue and tell her our ISP may be reaching out to her in a few days. She is concerned and asks if our internet has always been like this, and I let her know that it has only been like that for the past month or so.

**Mid-June, A few days later:**

\-I call customer service back having not heard back from them. The individual I speak with was familiar with this MDU box and immediately escalated the call to Next Level Support. An individual there gave me more details about the MDU installation process. I tell him what I have been told about their team contacting my landlord and asked if it was true that their outside line people had the means to contact her to make the arrangements to contact her. 

""I'm gonna be honest: I have no idea and that's a very good question."" My man, I appreciate that.

""Let me be sure you have that information then."" And I provide it to him to be included in the notes on the account.

He creates a ticket, ensures all the information is there, and then sends it to the appropriate departments to make the arrangements to install the MDU. He then tells me again I should hear something from them in 24-48 hours.

Mid-June, A few more days later:

\-I haven't heard anything from my ISP. So I call them back. Customer support. 

""24 to 48 hours is unrealistic. It's really going to be 7 to 10 business days. Call back then if you haven't heard anything."" 

What Gods have I transgressed against and what was my crime to warrant this Sisyphian punishment? 

""I need to speak to Billing,"" I say. And I am transferred.

In billing, I discussed the possibility of discounted or refunded service. I am advised that if the issue is ongoing then it would be best to wait until the issue is resolved in order for compensation to accurately reflect the entirety of time without service. She pointed out that the issue began in May and that the records were there for Billing to clearly see. And this does really make sense to me. If this goes on for a few months, I don't want to call in every month asking for a refund. I want to call in one time and say ""You see the notes, it's been this long, but now it's fixed, you said to wait, that's $XX, what're you going to do?""

**July:**

\-I honestly do not remember all the times I called throughout July. The reason being, all the calls were mostly the same. Sometimes, a Customer service agent would go through the noble and tedious effort of troubleshooting over the phone which I would dutifully and masochistically follow their directions to the inevitable conclusion there's nothing they can do. Every time I called I was told ""You'll hear something by this day,"" so I would wait until the end of that day and call when I hadn't heard from them. And I still haven't heard from them. But, sadly, our saga continues.

**Late July:**  
\-I begin to wonder what options are available to me at this point and when pondering how that process may play out I realize I have no notes to reflect what I have done up to this point and that relying on memory can be tricky at best. So I make information retrieval an item on the agenda when it comes time to call again.

\-Taking notes, I call again Customer service. It was a Friday morning. I give a complete rundown of everything that has not happened to date and this guy seems genuinely baffled; floored that this has been going on for so long. He looks at note after note where essentially nothing was done and seems genuinely disappointed. 

I, myself, used to work in internet tech support for another ISP in a different area. It sucked. The company I worked for was particularly concerned about metrics. The number of times a customer called, the number of times a customer service rep scheduled a technician, the amount of time on a phone call, use of the troubleshooting ""tree,"" and the amount of revenue a rep generated by upselling customers on service. Imagine calling in for, say, slow speeds and instead of the person you're speaking with helping you resolve that problem, they sell you a faster internet package that you will be unable to receive. I didn't last long in the job. It wasn't a great job, but I wanted to help. I would schedule technicians, I would try to identify problems accurately, I would spend 30 minutes on the phone with a person just trying, because I knew the person usually sitting in the cubicle next to me wouldn't and sometimes I was successful. And then I'd get chewed out by my supervisor for not following the tree, not offering wire protection, not ending the call in 11 minutes. 

He complained out about how he hates it when he sees stuff leave his department and just go nowhere. So he wanted to take ownership of this problem. He also flatly told me he couldn't give me a copy of all the notations made on my account. Those were internal documents and couldn't be shared publicly. Even if it regarded me. Since, you know, I'm the public.

""Look, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I'm going to send another email to poke this along. And I know how that sounds, but I will personally give you a call back on Monday to let you know what they say.""

I was touched and grateful and looking forward to seeing progress.

**July 30th, The day after he was supposed to call:**

\-With a broken heart and much disappointment, I call Customer service. This rep patiently heard my tale and oohed and ahed at all the right moments. She wondered why I called in so often and regularly and I told her that every time I called it was because they had determined when I would do it by giving me a timeline. Every time they said two days or ten days, I put it on my calendar to call. She had a supervisor sit in on the call with her who never said anything and the two of them went through all of the notes on the account looking for something that might have been missed while she had me restart my modem and router in a likely effort to keep me distracted from my misery and heartache due to the previous rep's broken promise. And then came an A-ha! moment for her when she found a note written by one of the technicians to come out: ""NO BACKYARD ACCESS."" Surely, she thought, this was it. Now, admittedly, it was my partner who was home on both occasions a technician came out to the apartment, but she told me the tech got access to the backyard on both visits. The rep begins to schedule the technician when she seems someone says not to. And then she tells me a technician will call me in 24-48 to schedule coming out. 

I think neither of us believe it.

**August 1st:**

\-No technician called. I call again. This experience is almost the same as the time when I called in late July without the reminiscence on my own experience in technical support. But he said he would call back by the end of his shift. He didn't call.

**TODAY:**

\-I asked to be escalated right away to next level support and they were unavailable. But a floor supervisor was. She sent another email, explained the entire process of how things would proceed using lots of technical jargon I had heard from other customer service people and technicians and my own experience. I thanked her for explaining all of that and then asked if she could see when the last time any progress had been made like she described. It was weeks ago, when it had been forwarded to another department. 

""Has any progress been made since?""

""No, it doesn't look like it and that is odd.""

""And you feel that I should just wait and see what happens?""

""Yes, because they'll check the readings for..."" and she repeats the process again. 

She tells me that she will call me back on Monday with an update and that I should call back on Tuesday when I don't hear from her. Seriously. I don't think she intended for it to sound like she wasn't going to call, but it did sound like she wasn't going to bother with this.  


So now I ask for advice. What options are available to me to deal with an ISP that is doing nothing. I have called their competitors, but they don't service area or my building. I can't do satellite internet for our building. I've considered filing a formal complaint with the FCC, but that costs $225 and doesn't seem to matter. Any thoughts?

tl;dr - My ISP has been giving me the runaround for almost three months, my service is garbage, I can't switch, and I don't know what I can do to see progress.",03Aug2019,1
105,"This is kind of difficult to explain but I'll try. Basically, I always have some kind of thought in my head at any given time. Wether it be narrating whatever I see, something about a show, work stuff, and just random tangents I don't remember 20 seconds later.

It never stops. Ever. I've never truly sat in silence before because I'm always thinking. I feel I should clarify a few things.

I'm confident I don't have ADD/ADHD or any other attention disorders. I'm perfectly capable of focusing on something. I have no signs or symptoms of any attention deficit disorders. If I'm focusing on a task, my thoughts will rarely wander off of it, and even if they do I can snap back just fine.

My thoughts aren't disturbing or violent in any way. Sure, a bit strange from time to time but nothing I've ever been concerned about. They're also entirely my own thoughts. I've never felt like someone else was talking in my head or anything like that.

I've tried meditation, focusing on nothing as hard as I can, and even getting as high was marijuana as possible hoping that would help somehow.

I'm desperate. I just want my head to be totally clear and not think for a minute. It's exhausting and I can't take it. I want *real* silence for once. Any help or advice is appreciated.",03Aug2019,2

108,"Hey Reddit! 
Before I ask for any sort of advice, I'll explain my ""situation"" and tell you a bit about myself. 
This may be a long post and I'm not so good at this so please bare with me.

I just turned 28 on the 21st of July and have been staring at the ceiling and thinking...alot.

I feel way behind in life and don't know what I'm doing wrong!
Relatives use to speak highly of me and expect great things from me but in the last decade my family has been very distant from each other and my life has been what feels like nothing but epic fails.

I am VERY empathetic, tend to look at life from a glass half full perspective and I'm commonly told how well I was raised. Though recently it feels more like a drawback as it often gets me into situations where I'm taken advantage of and as a result I've become pretty antisocial and tend to save my empathy for those I care about. I do not like this though because now I tend to intimidate people at times or give off the wrong impression. Im also insecure about if people like or respect me. Normally I wouldn't care about what people think but recently in the back of my head I wonder why I'm not as likable or respected as some of my peers in life.

I currently have a job at a fancy fast food restaurant, it's not my dream job but I like it there. Unfortunately the pay is very inconsistent and ranges from $600 a check to a measly $98 bi-weekly. My hours vary based on how busy the week may be and they pick the most reliable employee first. (I'll get back to this subject later). It's hard to a decent paying job so I can't really afford much and it's hard to save up.
Because of ""what I believe"" is a lack of options I currently stay with my mom.
She doesn't actually sleep here but she pays the rent and I try to pitch in the best I can.

I believe I suffer from depression and PTSD but I hate attaching myself to those labels because it makes me feel as though Im making excuses for my shortcomings. There were times I wish I could reset my life and start anew but I value my life and family and understand as well as seen others overcome worse. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal I just hate how my life is progressing. It doesn't help that I have reason to believe that I also have type 2 diabetes. I suffer all the symptoms, the most recent is numbness but it's only in one toe. I also found out a couple days ago my grandfather died from it which really had me shaken up.

When life throws me a curveball instead of swinging I drop that bat, shutdown and shroud myself in darkness, ignoring everything remotely stressful...which brings me back to my job. Today I overslept again and got several calls from work asking were I was. It didn't help that they knew about my diabetes scare and asked if I was ok, which made me feel even worse for oversleeping. I don't know why I oversleep so much or why I didn't call them back and I feel like I'm shutting down again so I'm going to man up and explain that I overslept to them but I don't feel like I even deserve the job anymore. 
 
I have no car and it's hard to save up but I'm trying.
I'm a highschool dropout but I got my GED.
I'm buried in college debt and have nothing to show for it.
My mom has recently been struggling with the rent and rasing my 2 younger brothers who have special needs so I gave her what money I had saved in hopes of it helping. 

I feel like I'm dying a slow and mentally draining death where I watch all my loved ones perish just as slowly.
I'm lost and don't know what to do...

111,"Hey guys. So I need a little advice on how to deal with this situation. 

We’ve met at work (serving in a restaurant) and we quickly drew to each other as friends exclusively. We had our similarities but too many differences for me to even consider a little more than a friendship. We often went out after work to talk. We could vent our frustrations over work. We could talk endlessly about a long lost lover we still feel for. About mistakes we made in the past. 

Anyways, I felt like we could help each other get through this life. I didn’t want a relationship because she was my coworker, she wasn’t exactly my type and I wasn’t exactly her type. And I thought things were actually better that way with a little distance.

I left the job after I had a fight with the badly functioning (abusive) manager at the time. And went into a period of low mood and depression.

5 months later the manager got fired by the owner, and she asked me to come back on behalf of him. 

This is were things turned different. We got a bit more responsibilities but there were still a few (2) who stood higher on the picking order. When 
they left and nobody returned it left a vacuum and we both had to keep the front of the restaurant running.

The first few weeks were still a lot of fun. We communicated a lot and everything was going just fine. This was also were I gave in to falling in love against knowing better that she still was dating others and wasn’t exactly interested. 

I think this also deluded our working relationship. Communication went wrong, and I slowly grew frustration towards the seemingly unrequited feelings. I closed up towards her because I didn’t want to talk to her about my feelings because I’ve got a general fear for rejection when I really like someone. 

Shit starts to slowly hit the fan, she starts feeling more important and stops communicating with me. We used to make the personnel planning together. But now she started doing it alone. Planning lots of free days during the busy weekends so she could go on dates (which turned into a relationship now) leaving me with incomplete staff and a broken heart and making me feel used by her. 

I’ve been trying to stay but I turned sour and people start to notice I’m performing less at work. 

I never really wanted things to work out this way. It was better when all there was was a friendship. I don’t necessarily want to leave either because because I’m going in therapy at the end of the month, and the owner has always been very understanding of my issues and promised me there’d be a place for me after I’ve been working on myself. For obvious reasons I can’t make her leave either. It’s not her fault. And neither am I entitled to those decisions at the work place. 

But there’s also a part of me that really wants to forget about her, because seeing her just leaves me feeling blue. 

TLDR; 
Fell in love with a coworker after being friends. 
Now I feel blue every time I see her. But the job also offers me so much I can’t really leave. And I can’t make her leave either. Everyone loses here and I don’t know what to make of it.",03Aug2019,1

After her father passing a year ago and verbal and physical abuse at her grandparents my entire family mutually agreed for her to move In with us. She has a high tendency to be uncertain and insecure which is normal, to an extent. She thinks that I’m going behind her back and trying to find hookups, which is not the case.  She goes to the extremes going through my phone while I’m asleep, my other electronics connected to my texts/ information while I’m not home and she is to try and find stuff to argue about. We’ve been fighting for two days now because I feel I can’t be open and honest about friendships that I have online.

I've been sad for about a couple weeks now. Summer is coming to a close, and I naively tried to spend it with someone who left my life not too long ago.

I feel as if my life is going nowhere. I'm about to begin my senior year of high school coming this 15th of August. My grades are fine, and I take lots of advanced classes, but I realized that I haven't done anything special outside of that. Someone I held dear to my heart seemed to be a lot better than me in every way. We definitely grew up in different circumstances; him belonging to an already rich family and I grew up relatively poor. I don't have people in my life to guide me, or to tell me what's best for me. I just really want some help.

I’m an 18 y/o incoming freshman to college. I move into school at the end of this month (August) and I’m very low-income. So, in order to help with some expenses, my dad asked me to start work at a local fast food place to cover some expenses. The actual amount I needed to help with is $400. I’ve been working at the place for a week and pay-day is a few days from now. My check should be just about $400. I also get a grant for personal expenses at $1000 from my school and I get a $500 personal expenses scholarship from another source, putting me at $1900 approx. I hate my job. I wanna spend my last few weeks home with my friends and family. I have certainly enough money to, I think, help out and also afford things like toiletries, to-go food, and misc. stuff for school (as I have literally no issues w books or anything bc I’m going on a full-ride). I feel sorta bad quitting my job since I’ve been there for so short, but I’m pretty certain.

119,"Been feeling an on and off melancholy. Not exactly sad, not happy. Just tired. But there’s nothing im tired off. I worry that I’m boring. I saw my friends today.  The only two I really see but I know I’m not the closest to them even though I know they love me dearly. I don’t feel like myself around anyone but my partner. I think that’s sad. But it’s been that way for the past couple of people I’ve dated. I feel I’m always losing myself. I can’t seem to keep friend s longer than a couple years. Since childhood it’s been that way. No friends from my hometown. And a the couple from college that I now feel distant to. I attribute the distance thinking too hard about it. What would cat do? How would cat react? I’d liked to think I’m thoughtful. Not in the good way like I’m kind or sweet but as if my brain is constantly thinking about what I will do next while doing it. Even when I’m mad or sad, I imagine what I should feel like and make myself react how I think I would. its restricting me from having fun. It’s getting tiring. I don’t know how to be myself. And this me feels dull. Humorless. My friends use to think I was funny. I think I am but I don’t know how to let myself be me. Feel in the moment. Reply freely. You know just live. 

I’m thinking about seeing a therapist. When I was younger I had diagnosed depression and an eating disorder and whatever else I can’t remember. I got treated for a couple months but nothing ever happened after that. I just found goals that made life worth it. And when it’s completed just find something else. It keeps me distracted but keeps me in a cycle. Sometimes I just want to rip my heart from my body so I’m not attached anymore. Sometimes I get frightened that I died a long time ago and this is my limbo or a dream or something. I’m not sure if I’m depressed because it seems that most people are nowadays anyway. So why does it matter if I am or am not. 

I want to try to talk about it but I feel like I’m faking it or making myself feel this way by thinking myself into doing it. I wish I could explain that feeling better. I just wish I could be happy",03Aug2019,3

135,"The last three months have been nothing short of a stress laden nightmare. This may be half a rant but I’ll take any input that could possibly helpful

My daughter is due in two weeks. It’s my first, fiancées second. There’s enough stress around becoming a parent right?  Nah, life had other plans for us. Throwing us every financial headache we could possibly imagine. 

Few months back, fiancée got notice that her food stamps were shut off. She goes to the state, gets the information needed to fix the issue, goes about getting the documentation needed. Couple weeks go by, hasn’t heard back. Calls them, they say “oh no, you also need this documentation as well. And you have a week to send it in otherwise you have start anew”. So she gets that information and sends it in two days later. 

Another week goes by, we’re at the gas station, and her bank card gets declined. She checks her balance, zero balance. Calls the bank, there’s a levy on her account. They cleared the checking AND the savings. So there goes rent for the coming month. The levy was put in place over three years ago, by a creditor that she has previously disputed. They only just now “activated” the levy. She tries explaining to the creditor that this has been previously disputed on a credit report and that it is not her bill. Guess what’s back on her credit report that same day! That bill. 

Five days later, she starts getting calls from an out of state number, about money owed on college books from four years ago. She disputes that, they refuse to give her any documentation but assured her that it’s her bill to pay. That’s over $1000 on top of whatever remains on the levy that they haven’t already taken. 

Remember the food stamps?  They still haven’t come in. It’s been almost six weeks now. We received a notice on the 17th stating they’ve denied her and she needs to refill in the office. So she takes a trip to the office. Woman in the office tells her she didn’t send in the documentation in time, and that she was denied on the first of July. It was the 8th when she was told she still had a week to send in the documentation. 

This same week, BOTH of our vehicles begin having mechanical issues. We currently have the one good bank account (mine) and it’s being used for ALL the bills across the board. And we do not have the extra income at the moment to be fixing our cars. But if we don’t fix them, we aren’t going to work, which means that’s less money in our pockets. So there’s that ongoing headache. 

My fiancée has been taking college classes while working. She was receiving a dispersement. We’ve been waiting on it for her time off when the baby comes in a couple weeks. July 28th she gets an email that she won’t be receiving her dispersement this semester. So now, we will have essentially my two and a half weeks of paid vacation to cover a month or more of bills, which that math doesn’t fly. 

But then there’s a light!  My boss calls me the other night, offers me a promotion to sales. Says we can talk about it tomorrow. Great!  Go in, go into the office, start talking. It’s not a promotion. He just wants me to go to sales, at my current rate, without even the title change, because “that’s where the money is but I can’t do anything for your right now”. No. I’m not taking on a bigger headache, that botches my schedule, to be not only underpaid by almost $6 an hour, but also get screwed out of the title change which means I wouldn’t make commissions or bonuses. So that’s not an option. He says”if you’re not taking it, you can stay where you are and you’ll never go anywhere. You’ve peaked at 28. Your life gets no better than this” and walks away. 

THEN TODAY LIFE DROVE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN!!!  Fiancée comes home, grabs the mail, opens it, and finds out that since X documentation was “incorrect” for foods stamps, they have also cancelled her insurance as well as her daughters. Our daughter is due in two weeks, and she now has no insurance. And I evidently can’t add her on mine because we’re not married.

136," 25/M. Electrical Engineer. Early in my career.

A lot of details (TLDR at the bottom) but I have been looking for a new job because the one that I'm currently in is toxic and the dread of going to work makes it super difficult to wake up every morning.

Current job:  
Pros:  
\+++ I travel a lot which is nice since it breaks the monotony of office life. I prefer to travel less but it's easier to charge time when I'm on travel.  
\+++ I have a flexible schedule. I take every other friday off which is nice and the new job offer I have won't allow me to do this.  
\+++ On top of the flexible schedule, I can go to work whenever I really want which is nice. I don't have a set schedule to adhere to.  
\++ Financially, I'm a bit better here but it's more inconsistent due to the amount of overtime I charge and the job/travel I am working. I also get travel per diem which is a little but it does add up.

Cons:  
\- I'm forced to go on travel a lot. I want to get my masters degree but its hard when I'm on the road all the time.  
\-- Traveling really bites into my social life. I lost several weekends going on travel when I really want to stay home. I'm more of a homebody but traveling does has it perks.  
\--- I detest my job life and working on my current project. I detest working for my tech lead and every day, I just hate going to work because me bites into me all the time. I try to actively avoid him but he also sits right behind me and micros me.  
\--- I don't really care much for the project and what I do to be honest. It's not something I'm interested in making my career. I know most people don't care much for their jobs but I want to be one of those engineers that are a least motivated to keep on working.  
\--- The dread of mondays leak into my Sundays now. I wake up thinking about how I have to go to work on Monday and how I can avoid my tech lead. I just hate going to work.  
\--- It's gotten to the point that I get irritated by my phone and just hoping that it isn't my tech lead calling me. It's giving me the sense of anxiety and dread just having my phone near me. It's like being in a bad relationship and you absolutely hating the other persons guts. (For the record, I don't hate him, I hate working with him)

New Job:  
Pros:  
\+++ I will work on another project which sounds really interesting and is much more important than my current job. I think I can develop a lot more as an engineer going into this job.  
\+++ I get another environment which doesn't seem particularly bad in terms of people but I'm just speculating  
\+ Guaranteed 10 hours overtime per pay period which equates to something around 33% increase in my yearly take home.  
Cons:  
\--- 50 hour work weeks , shift schedule. I don't care much for my sleep schedule but the lack of freedom to take off every other Friday and to go into work whenever I want is making this position really hard to want.  
\--- On top of that. Shift Schedule sounds terrible since I also wouldn't be in a position to get my masters degree.  
\--- On top of that, I'm basically on call and I may be working on weekends as well. It's a mandatory 50 hour week which sounds absolutely draining.  
\-- It's a lateral movement. I don't get a raise. I don't get much more for rotating over to that position. Just added responsibility.  
\--- I think I make less than I currently would at my current job since I don't travel at all.

When people talk about work, they tell you the fun, interesting, exciting aspects of their job. My genuine answer would be that I complain about the work environment, the job that I do, the amount of traveling I have to take, and most importantly how much I detest working for my tech lead. I think it's time for a new job which is why I'm looking but the current position I'm looking at doesn't sound really any much better. What should I do?

tldr; I really don't like working for my tech lead and I'm looking for a new position/new project to work on but it's a long process. I got an offer for shift work at another part of the company but it sounds pretty bad and the only positive seems like it's just a better opportunity to be a better engineer which I value a lot.  
What should I do? I absolutely detest working for my tech lead and I hate going to work and I have gotten to the point in which I get irritated by my phone, hoping who ever is calling/texting isn't my tech lead/supervisor. Every day, the dread of going to the office over takes me and is only alleviated if I go on travel which I don't want to travel as much since it bites into my social life",03Aug2019,1
137,"I’ve been living in my own apartment for 1.5 yrs. it’s near a university so it’s mostly students. I used to have an expensive Bose sound system &amp; my upstairs neighbor would come banging on my door asking me to turn it down. I switched the sound system for a small speaker that doesn’t have the bass (what he complained about) out of pure respect. Gave him my phone # in case it was too loud. Well after making the switch he would text me on a Friday evening between 7-9 to turn my music down when it wasn’t even loud (I’d ask my other neighbors if they could hear it and no one ever said yes). 

Fast forward to now. If I want to watch tv, he starts pounding on the floor. I want to listen to music in the shower? Starts pounding. If I want to vacuum at 5 pm on a Friday, starts pounding. Now I actually blocked his # a few months back because he was taking advantage and going overboard texting me. He’s my age, I’ve seen him on campus but I don’t think he ever leaves his apartment now that it’s summer. I’m gone almost every weekend and stay busy during the week but when I’m home all day I don’t think he leaves. I don’t think he’s going to school ATM or working...or have any friends. He’s just this passive aggressive hermit. I’ve tried being nice but it’s gotten to the point if my cat meows a few times in a row he starts pounding and making noises like what the fuck does he expect? Complete silence? Dude needs a fan to block out any background noise. i pay too much $$$ a month to be living so timid. I’ve talked to him nicely several times over the past 18 months but at this point, (leaving cards on his door for the holidays-and I’ve never gotten a response) I’m about to bitch slap him!

140,"My son is getting way too out of control. He's 16 years old. He plays a lot of video games, listens to a lot of weird “rock” music and one day I even caught him looking at porn. It's tough because we are a very conservative family, and we are all practicing Catholics. 

I've tried to educate my son into me and my wife's ways. We have limited the amount of video games he plays up to an hour a day, two hours on weekends. He's not allowed to play any M-Rated games, and failure to comply with these rules will result in the Xbox being taken away for a month, as well as his privileges of seeing his friends. He's also required to attend ""movie time"". Every Friday night at 9:00, the whole family, including him, are to gather in the living room for a movie together. Violent movies are also a no-no in our house, and so all our movies are family friendly movies that we can all watch together. TV shows work the same way and we use the V-Chip in our house to prevent our kids watching shows with vulgar content. 

We also do not allow our kids to have smartphones (my wife and I have iPhones because we need them for work) but we let them have basic flip phones so they can call and text us and we do not allow them to call or message anyone outside of the family. Randomly once a week we require our children to hand over their cellphones to us so we can check them and make sure they aren’t doing anything inappropriate. 

My son is to be home by 8:30 everyday and he is not allowed to move out and date until he is 25. 

Every night, we order our kids into my wife and I's room and we all kneel down on the bed in a row and pray. I am a firm believer of God and I thank him for helping my family maintain a good life and may he deserve the utmost respect. 

I'm telling you all this because I want to show that I do make an effort to help my son maintain a healthy life. What else can I do for my son to teach him in the ways of the light and put him on the right path?",03Aug2019,0
141,"This post may feel all over the place but I don’t know where to start and I just feel so angry, resentful &amp; am just getting to the point where I just cannot be bothered associating with my mother. 

My mother works as a receptionist for a small medical office and does nothing about complain about her job and everything else in life. Examples would be: one of the doctors asked her to redo a referral letter as they made last minute changes, or the other receptionist called in sick and my mother reckons she is faking it, or that she had to work half an hour later two days in a row. 

We catch up for dinner and ALL she does is complain about these little things that I find absolutely ridiculously insignificant. I work in finance co-managing a $3b portfolio, if those things above were my biggest worry my life would be wonderful. I am also a mum to 2 kids and my husband also has a demanding job. And I guess that is why I find it so annoying - I cannot understand why she gets so worked up over these little things when there are much bigger problems in life.

I come from a troubled childhood where my father was an abusive alcoholic and my mother played the battered housewife card. When I was about 25 she finally left him. He is no longer in the picture and this whole situation is another sore point for me. To this day she plays the victim and talks about what a tough time it was married to him - ummm hello what about your kids that grew up in that environment????? I feel like I was robbed a father, and I still feel damaged from growing up with an abusive alcoholic, yet all she is concerned about is her wellbeing. I am mad that she let us grow up in that house, she didn’t protect us and now we all have our own struggles as adults. 

I do love my mother and she loves my kids, but I am just finding it so painful spending time with her. I have thought about speaking to her about it, but I just honestly don’t think it would be effective and she will take it the wrong way.",03Aug2019,0
142,"About 18 years ago my parents left the US and moved back 'home' to a very rural part of Mexico. At the time, I was an only child who had lived trapped at home because my parents worked at night and slept during the day. To me the freedom of Mexico was beautiful, I finally was close to my family.
Years down the line after my status as a non citizen in Mexico took me out of University, I returned to the States by myself. For a year, I said.
During that year I found a job and a relationship. I decided to stay, against my parents wishes. I lived by myself for about a year and a half, working minimum wage jobs until I my boyfriend and I moved in together. Few years later, my boyfriend cheats on me and I fall into a horrible depression. Despite the fact that we were in debt and I was now alone, I managed to keep my job, pay my debt, learn a few new skills and finally start school.
After partially recovering from the last relationship, I met someone else (too soon, I know). It was a long distance relationship for a while, until a year down the line it became more serious. He asked me to move in with him, to a new city. He would help me go to school, he would provide for me. I loved him, I said yes.
Not even a year down the line, I find out he's been cheating, I can't stay, but now that means I have nothing. I haven't had a job for over half a year, I don't have a house anymore, I have no money. 
My parents urge me to come home and stay with them for a bit, 'until I recover' they say. Having nothing left and needing the comfort of my family I agreed.
Now I've been in Mexico for a month. My depression is finally wearing off, I can now go out and actually want to talk to people, but also I've seen my mistakes. I keep thinking of going back and getting my life together, I'm ready to start.
My parents sat down and talked with me yesterday. They said that I've been in the US for too long and done nothing. (No school, minimum wage jobs, no house) They say they love me, and they hate to see me suffer, they can't bear me going through another heartbreak. They say I need to be close to my family, I need to be close to the people that love me. They say I can have a future in Mexico. I love my family, more than anything in the world and I am so thankful for everything they have done for me, but I'm afraid of staying here. I don't want to just dissolve into this village, where the women stay at home while the men go out to work. Where my most important job would be feeding my husband and my children. I would love a family, but not like this. The thing is that a small part of me thinks they're right, if I stay, I could have the family I've wanted while staying close to mine, even if my life would just dissolve into nothing. 
Another part of me thinks I'm not too old to give school another chance, to take this moment of clarity and just run with it, give it my best shot, even if it means being alone and sad for a while. And if I do decide to go, how do I tell my loving parents and little sister that I'm going back to where I suffer? how can I get them to understand that it's better for me?

Anyways, I’m 20 &amp; have been in a relationship for almost 5 years. It’s absolutely toxic and nothing good has come out of it besides the two of us getting through college. I live in a very expensive part of my state and make absolutely no money at my job as a waitress.

147,So last year this girl was throwing accusations at my friend which we will call friend A and it escalated quickly and I was caught in between all the drama as the messenger essentially. It’s a really long story but in short she had falsely accused friend A of sexual assault and just generally negative things backed by 0 evidence and even eventually admitted to lying. This drama although it has died down quite a bit is still ongoing after she still won’t leave friend A alone. Anyways I had this other friend which we will call friend B. When this girl came out with all of these accusations instead of being loyal and sticking by friend A’s side friend B had decided to side with this girl. I have been ignoring him this whole year as a result of what I considered to be selfishness and disloyalty. We’ve really drifted apart and it’s safe to say that our friendship will never be as rock solid as it once was and he seems like a complete stranger to me now.

Before I start lemme just say, I love driving. It’s pretty much my stress reliever/ depression medicine/ anxiety reliever/ etc. when I’m feeling down and I hop in a car it’s like I turn from 😭 to 😀😃😄😁🎉  within 5 minutes of getting in a car. So not picking one or the other is NOT an option. 

Ok, normally military wouldn’t pay to have my car shipped but since I can’t drive it here they’ll pay 100% to have my car in a boat and get it here. I hate the car I have but don’t get me wrong, I love that gay ass looking car :) if everything had to be taken away from me and I was only allowed to have one thing it would be that car. It looks gay af but it’s pretty new, it’s clean, it has ac, and it has a radio. (2015 Ford Fiesta) 

Option two, I love cars but most of all I’m an adrenaline junky, I love cars and going fast that being said, I can’t go fast. But logic says, if I love speed and I love cars what’s the next step? Motorcycles. I’ve wanted one since I was 16.5 p much.

153,"New girl started at my job about two weeks ago. From the get go you can tell she's pretty direct and lacks a filter but she's not mean. She's actually quite fun and we get along good and just kinda connected. So once she's out on the floor we talk more and she tells me how she knows the head supervisor from a previous company and talks about him as if they knew eachother decently well, like co-workers who've worked together for awhile. Knew the company he used to work for and everything. Well I'm talking to the boss, and say so you knew ""new girl"" before she worked here? He said no... Why? I told him what she told me and he said he's never met her a day in his life. I also asked him about her having cancer. She told me she had cervical cancer and was on pill form chemo to basically clear what was left up. Then a few days later she says she had a appointment and it spread to her lungs so she would have to start actual chemo/radiation. So back to him, he says she told him the same and he was going to bring it up to HR, along with her saying she knows him. HR pulls her in and says she would need to get some type of form signed by her doctor (doesn't mention anything about knowing boss) and new girl loses it. She's crying and saying her doctor won't sign because he doesn't want her working. Yet there are no obvious signs of illness so that just seemed weird to me. I could understand if she was in the depth of radiation but she is perfectly able. Well now the treatment has changed yet again and she said she's having surgery to ""remove the cells"", but if it was that easy wouldn't a person have opted for that to begin with? I'd rather have surgery than radiation I think. So this made me think damn, maybe she is just like a pathological liar and basically lies to gain importance and sympathy from others. 

My issue is, I don't know what to believe. The way she talks about the boss really makes you think she does know him. He never sits in on interviews but did on hers.. she calls him by his full first name instead of the short which is what everyone else calls him. Why would she choose the head boss out of all people for this type of lie when that could easily get you fired. I wonder if they had a thing and hes trying to hush it? Now that HR is involved I don't want to call her on it and cause more drama than what is already unfolding but I'm dying to know. So I guess I just want opinions and advice on if you would steer clear of her, and for me that would just include no social media contact or anything, just strictly work. Even if she is bat shit I just sympathize for her because it's so strange the depths she's reaching to if this is all bs.",03Aug2019,1

So it all started a few days ago. Sunny posted an Instagram about modeling for US Census. I was a little jealous, but I knew it wasn't her fault. (BTW we are both in middle school) The day after I texted her asking if she wanted to go to the movies. Fast-forward 3 hours and she just gets back to me. This wouldn't bother me so much if it wasn't for what happened next. 

She goes, ""Sorry I didn't get back to you. Model Life!"" I am a bit confused, hoping this is satire, but then she says. ""I can't handle my busy schedule."" So I asked her what gig she has next. Sunny says she doesn't have any jobs yet but she knows she is going to get one. This made me a bit mad but I didn't want to judge too harshly.

I have another friend, (We will call her Billie). Billie is struggling a bit so she decided to leave Instagram for a bit. I don't have a phone number yet. So I wanted to send her a letter. The only problem, I've lost her address. So I decide to ask Sunny for Billie's address for the letter. She responds by saying. ""Ew, don't send her a letter. Just e-mail her."" 

Billie had an e-mail address, but she hasn't used it since school yet out, and she still hasn't responded to any e-mails I've sent her. 

I felt kind of bad, and she decided to respond with ""Look, she isn't going to care about the letter. Nobody cares about letters."" I don't know if I should leave this alone for a little bit or tell Sunny I was hurt.

159,"My entire life other women have hated me and my ""friends"" always seem to turn on me. Now my family is imploding and I'm wondering if maybe I'm the one to blame for it. 

Every place I've ever worked, the women would spread rumors about me and treat me like crap. On two separate occasions, on two separate jobs, women have created lies to try and get me fired. The first instance it was successful, she said I stole something when I didn't and she got me fired. She was always nasty to me ever since I was hired, though. She was the assistant manager and would always micro manage me. Once she told me to go clean an aisle and then wrote me up for leaving the register unattended. 

At my other job, there was a mixture of toxicity. Some of the women would pretend to be my friend while talking about me behind my back while others were just blatantly rude to me. One of the 2 faced ones ended up lying and saying that I left the dog unattended on the table (worked in a grooming salon) to schedule appointments when that never happened. She always left her dogs unattended in the tub which was a huge violation but I never tattled, just kept an eye on her dogs. Another woman who worked there ended up cheating on her bf and leaving him for another man. He worked with us too and I felt bad for him so I invited him to go to a concert with me and my then, now ex, boyfriend. He declined and said thanks. Next day at work his ex starts screaming at me saying to back off and that I'm a slut for going after him when I have a bf, etc. The entire salon starts attacking me about this. I ended up getting fired from that job too for too many write ups. It wasn't just the women starting rumors, though either. Just after I got fired from that job I was raped by my ex after I broke up with him. I told my ""best friend"" (who also worked at the grooming salon but I had been friends with her since I was 8) this and she got with my ex and told our coworkers I was a liar even though she read the texts where he literally says ""sorry I raped you but I don't regret it"". I even have a FB message of her saying that she's fine with him being a rapist because ""that's who he is"". Yeah. Anyway, she told everyone about it at the salon and they all threatened to beat me up, key my car, steal my pets, etc, while the guys were lying and saying I had slept with them either the day of or the day after so obviously I was lying when in reality I didn't sleep with them at all. 

Fast forward 4 years later I'm in college and I don't get along with any of the girls there either. I'm in a female dominated career so most students were women. Made no meaningful relationships and was used for rides but allowed that because I was lonely. 

I divorced my husband and all of our friends stopped talking to me and still remain friends with him. They were ""my"" friends to begin with so that really stung. 

About a year after we divorce, I tried to press charges against my rapist but the witness I had lied and said he didn't know anything about it and it was very close to the 5 year cut off so they didn't take my case. I drank a lot that night at a friend's house and woke up to his friend molesting me. I told my 4 friends that were there about it, two of them said they told him to do it as a way to get back at me for ""destroying the friend group"" by divorcing my husband and that if he was that abusive I shouldn't have married him in the first place. The other two said they would stop talking to the molester but they didn't at first. Another year goes by and I finally cannot stand that these two still talk to the guy who encouraged his friend to sexually assault me and they chose to keep talking to him and stop talking to me. 

I stopped talking with my aunt because she's very toxic. She's selfish and screams like a toddler whenever she doesn't get her way. She also was telling people that my dad liked little boys because he dates skinny women?? Makes no sense. She was calling me crying a lot about my uncle because he took money from her via a credit card she let him use. They agreed on 1500 but he used almost 7k. It's shit that that happened for sure and I initially stood by her side but she would call me crying and screaming every single day. Finally I suggested therapy and said I saw a counselor and that it helped me a lot and may help her too. Then she went off about how only losers and scumbags go to therapy and how dare I suggest that she's either of those things. That really hurt my feelings and so after that I blocked her phone number. My Gramma and even my dad said I was an asshole for doing that at first but now my dad agrees with me about her but my Gramma still thinks I'm an asshole. 

I saw my uncle and his kids for the 4th of July and my Gramma said I was a horrible person and a piece of shit, etc, for seeing him because of what he did to my aunt but has since apologized. 

Most recently, my mom wanted me to take her to the vet because her cat was sick so I said yes. She cancelled because she got pneumonia and I wished her well. The next day she asked me if I could take her to return cans and bottles and I told her I just got my car cleaned and that I didn't want to get my back seat sticky and smelly and that I had to do laundry and work on my resume and she unloaded on me saying how awful I am. She said she can never rely on me and that she's done with my shitty personality and she doesn't know how I ended up like this, etc. and blocked my number and my fb. 

I know that my ""best friend"" and my rapist are horrible but I'm 27 and my entire life I have had trouble like this. I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm abrasive or rude and I don't realize it? My bf says women don't like me because I'm tall, skinny, and get attention from guys but I think he's a bit biased. Idk",03Aug2019,2

I don’t think she remembers. I don’t think she even realized what was happening. I do know that neither of our parents ever talked to us about sex and I was molested when I was 4-5 years old. So I try to make myself feel better by telling myself that I didn’t know what I was doing, I immediately stopped, I never did it again, and even now decades later I feel horrible for it. I think that me being molested had something to do with it, but unlike many kids who go on to do it to others, I knew it was wrong and I stopped as soon as I realized what I was doing. 

I really just needed a place to get this out. This shit really haunts me sometimes. And I wonder if she remembers or realized what was happening. It was so long ago that I barely remember what happened. So I doubt she did. I don’t remember making her feel weird or anything. I’m pretty sure I just hopped off and we went off to do whatever little kids do. I don’t think she even realized what I was doing because it lasted literally maybe 3 seconds.

But I still feel like a monster sometimes. I don’t think I really even realized what I was doing for until many years later. I didn’t really start masterbating until I was maybe 12 or 13 or so. 

So idk. Do you all think that makes me a horrible person? Sometimes I go to these really dark places because of it. But I can’t bring it up to her because she probably doesn’t remember and what would be the use of telling her something she doesn’t remember.",03Aug2019,1
161,"Title basically but more details here.

I consider my self esteem to be extremely low, I genuinely don’t like myself both looks and personality wise. I get that dating usually entails a sort of self confidence which I don’t have, however I’d like be open to dating so here I am.

To be more specific, personality/achievement wise I consider myself somewhat of a loser, granted most/all of these things are “easily” fixable however there’s almost a feedback loop of “I’m  a loser, I feel like shit, why even try to change it” 

•I don’t have my drivers license at 19, whenever I’m back in town from college I rely on my parents/friends to get to places, my homework has horrible/nonexistent public transportation 

•I haven’t had my first job. I meant to get is this summer but laziness, procrastination, as well as multiple week+ trips dissuaded me from attempting.

•Although this is a different story during the academic year, I spent at least 6-7 hours a day playing video games this summer. Most of my friends I communicate with and “hang out with”’via video games. I don’t hang out in person with them in person much depending on which friend(s) we’re talking about. 

•About that academic year, my first year of college I hung out with literally zero people. I talked to and laughed etc with people during recitation for one of my classes but that’s about it, I haven’t made a single(what most people consider) a friend at college. Part of this is purposeful for not wanting to make new friends and forget about my current ones back home(I’m out of state for college roughly a 10 hour drive from my hometown). Another source of reasoning was that having irl friends at college would distract me from my studies. A part of me regrets that choice for obvious reasons, but not knowing how to socialize in person as well ass fearing everyone will hate me in general makes even attempting it I did

•I don’t have any particular skills. I’m okay at math and I do a lot of it for my major but it’s nothing notable. I got a guitar from my dad four years ago and have barely touched it. A part of me wants to play because it sounds fun, however attempting to self teach is something I’ve been unable to do(that self teaching distaste applies to most things and I would like to fix that but that seems odd topic). I’m horrible at every sport I’ve ever played, 

•I get there’s a large population of similar interests, and it’s probably becoming less and less off the mainstream these days, but my interests include video games , anime, etc. This makes me worried to introduce myself to anyone new(not even just college people) in fear of being rejected for being “weird” or abnormal

•Finally, I am not a fan of my physical appearance. Due to a birth defect in which my body didn’t produce growth hormone, and the subsequent treatment, as a man I stand at about 5’6. I am aware the idea that women care just that much about height is extremely exaggerated(at least is hope) but that idea of not being masculine due to my height still irritates me. I am rather on the thin side, but I do have a healthy amount of stomach chub, which although I understand is normal , I hate. I feel like if a partner doesn’t see abs or at least a flat stomach they will be disgusted(again I’m aware this is wrong, but I can’t help but feel like this for some reason). Finally my face, my nose got hit with a blunt object when I was young, as well as a surgery a few years ago, it’s not horrible objectively, but it curves downward very sharp halfway down which is very noticeable from the side. This is probably my least favorite part of my physics appearance. My facial hair while consistent where it grows, hasn’t migrated to connect with what is trying to be a mustache so I feel it’s horrible, and fear it may never fill in.  I had an underbite naturally, and had braces for 7 years to fix it. I dislike my smile, my upper lip just disappears and just leaves nothing there but my teeth(which I’m still indifferent about but on the negative side about). 

•Last point, I have had two girlfriends. One of which I met at a conference thingy in LA and was in a long distance relationship with for about 8 months with one irl visit. The second started out irl for a few months but became long distance when I left for college, and lasted almost 11 months. I would like to note that neither of them were unsupportive or toxic in a way that would cause my dislike for my body, they were clear that during our relationships they found me attractive. 

So yeah that’s everything I could think of, any advice about how I should deconstruct these issues and tackle them would be greatly appreciated",03Aug2019,3

Is it too late to go back psychology psy d degrees take minimum 7-10 years to complete and I’ll be 40.

I’m nervous because I’m going to be moving to Colorado in the next year to attend college and am uprooting everything I’ve known at an attempt to try and better myself. 

I have met many friends where I am now and had even gotten married at a point to my wife [23F] who recently we have found we are way better as friends so we’re mutually splitting up and remaining in each others lives.

My wife and I are both going to move with each other as we are honestly closer as friends as we ever have been as a couple and her and I are supporting each other financially as well to find ourselves in better situations but where I feel she has a lot of opportunity I feel it may be too late for me. 

I know I’m not super old but I’ve only worked in retail/customer service management positions and I feel as if that’s all I’ll ever do if I can’t secure something better I also feel that my friends and family have held me back from a lot of opportunity in life and it’s hard to push myself back to a good spot with thinking positively.

180,"Hey reddit, I don't know if this kind of relationship is just unfamiliar to me so it's weird to me because of that, or if this is actually strange behavior so I want the opinion of you guys. 
   
  My boyfriend and his mom have had a rocky relationship most of his life. He bounced around between living with his parents and his grandparents a lot, and she either dropped off and acted like she didn't give a shit about him or would randomly take him on a trip to somewhere like, disney, only to drop him back off at his grandma's after and say she isn't ready for him to live with her and his dad.  Their relationship stabilized when he was 17 and from then it's just been okay. They weren't close but they weren't distant and weird, he had been living with them for the past few years, all is good. 
  
So cut to me moving in with him in his house in January of this year, immediately after that point it turned into phone calls at least 5 times a day. If she couldn't get a hold of him shed call me, so that she can talk to him. Or she would call the parent of whatever friend he was hanging with to see if he was there. She would constantly call if we went out somewhere to see where he was. And even said one time she measured his tire and could tell he hadn't went anywhere that day because it hadn't moved?? (Still don't know if that was a weird joke or not)  
  He asked her about it recently, why out of nowhere she suddenly this super ""involved"" mom, and she said it's because her first daughter (who she had before my boyfriend was born) died when she was a toddler and she's getting weird about my boyfriend not living at home anymore. And at first we were like okay that makes sense. But the more we thought about its like, his whole life, even when he was a kid she acted like she wanted nothing to do with him and he didn't even live with her until he was 14 so why would suddenly this obsessive need to always know where he is and what he's doing kick in when he's 20 and moved out to a house literally on the same street as his parents house.

188,"TLDT at bottom

I have a very strong group of friends, with whom I've been friends with for ages. August of last year, I started dating this girl and almost one year later we are still going strong. Unfortunately, specially this summer, I have had a hard time balancing time spent with my friends, and time spent with my girlfriend. Normally, I would hang out with my girlfriend, and when I hang out with my friends, she can hang out with her friends, the issue is she doesn't really have any friends. About two years ago she was in a similar position I was, with a very strong group of friends with whom she had been friends with for years, however, something happened, my now girlfriends fuck up big time, and some bonds were broken which will never heal. Most importantly, she, and her then best friends got into a huge fight, and it ended in her best friends turning my girlfriends other friends against her. As time has passed, things have improved, but the group still mainly listens to my GFs ex best friend, and they frequently exclude her out of plans, my girlfriend pretty much only sits with them at lunch and ocassionally talks to them at parties. All this causes her to feel very alone especially in school. As a work around, I've been sitting one day with my friends, and the next with my girlfriend, and it is seeming to work out fine. However when it comes to spending time outside of school, it is more complex. For example: After my girlfriends arrives from a trip, we of course hang out, I get invited the next day to spend three days in one of my friends farm house which is like an hour drive away from the city. Since my girlfriend had just arrived and we had been missing each other, I decided to stay the first day, and drive to the farm house the second day and return the third day. The first day went fine, my friends understood. The second day, my girlfriend asked me to stay, she was feeling down, and I wasn't super hyped about the trip (I had a feeling they had invited me just so I could drive them around once they were drunk) so I stayed and had fun with my girlfriend. However, once I was driving her home I got a call from one of my friends, when I answered, it was pretty much all of them, drunk, telling me that I should have gone, that it was amazing, they apparently were going to a club later, and then I heard a very familiar female voice, it was my GFs ex best friend. The only sober friend on the call told me that they had decided to call up my GFs ex best friend, and all her friends since they were nearby and ended up hanging out. I talk to them for a while and tell them I'll go tomorrow and hang out and they seem fine with that and I hang up. Unfortunately my girlfriend ended up getting very sad about this and began crying. When I arrived at her house, we stayed in the car for a while, with me trying to console her. She kept going on about how no one liked her, and that I would be better off without her, and that she never gets invited to anything. So I am probably going to hang out with my girlfriend again tomorrow and my friends will get mad at me again. Its not like I don't like to hang out with my GF, I do, but I also want to hang out with my friends. If you got through this thanks, I would appreciate any advice. And don't be afraid to ask for any clarifications regarding this, I am not a good writer at all and my thoughts can get jumbled up. 

TLDR: My girlfriend has no real friends and I have a hard time balancing time spent with her and with my own friends.

15 year old male. And over the past few years my mental state has been pretty bad. And it was probably because of my parents.
Examples of this would be, my dad punching a wall and leaving a small hole because I got a D in school. 
All of the times I went to bed crying.
My mom made fun of my appearance a lot. When I had long hair, my mom told me I looked like a hobo and a girl. Also whenever I don't brush my teeth for one day, my mom tells me I have rotten teeth and that I'm goong to get cavities because I missed one day.

My mom is a racist even to her own son and keeps calling me black boy (I'm mixed) and other what I presume to be racial slurs. 

My mom and dad hate each other, and literally won't talk to each other and make me have them send messages. My mom would also constantly hit my dad, (this was when I was like 11 they barely interact anymore.)

I have social anxiety, and a fear of speaking, probably from being yelled at if I ever raised my voice at my parents.

My mom is racist against any other race that isn't hers, (she is Filipino) and has used multiple racial slurs against white, spanish and black people all the time.

My dad never tried to stop my mom whenever she yells at me, he always yelled at me to be quiet.

When I was 13 my mom sent me to bed crying. 

There have been at least 3 times in the past wgere my dad yelled at me for ""being stupid"" or getting bad grades.
We were driving home from school and he was trying to turn on the road and I told him ""just go"" and he started yelling at me the whole ride back about how stupid I am and asking me if I wanted to die if he wasn't careful and we'd get in an accident.

There were times where my moms yelling made


Theyve always given me stuff that I wanted, and cooked and cleaned like any other parents but is this necessarily a situation that's so bad I need to get out? 

Also do I have some sort of trauma because everytime I even think about those times I want to cry.

201,"This is long so bare with me. 
Backstory: my sister is a piece of shit. Lying, sneaky, fake. She’s screwed multiple people over and only cares about herself, a complete narcissist. 
Anyways. She moved in with my aunt, rent free, after she had a nervous breakdown. My aunt asked to borrow $2000 from her (my sister has a ton of money in savings from when our parents died) so she could pay for security deposit/first and last month’s rent to move into a new house because she lost hers due to foreclosure, and my sister was going to be moving with her, still rent free. My sister said she could only do half. I felt bad and said I could pitch in the other half as long as my aunt wrote me something saying she would pay it back with each paycheck, which she agreed to. My aunt gave my sister my half so my sister could write a check for the full amount for the landlord and I went with her to the landlord’s office to hand it in. 
Fast forward to this past Monday, the check bounces. My aunt is in an uproar because now she’s not getting the house and flips out on my sister. My sister plays victim and gets upset that my aunt is flipping out and moves out of her house. 
We don’t know if my sister intentionally bounced the check (very believable after what she’s done in the past), if she spent it all in between handing it in and when it was cashed, or what. But, my aunt gave her my $1000 cash to put in her account to write a check. So my sister has my $1000 and now it’s not being used because it’s not going towards the house. 
My sister is refusing to give me the money, saying that she lent my aunt $500 a few weeks ago so she’s keeping $500 to pay herself back basically and said to ask my aunt for the rest. That had nothing to do with me, though, and my aunt gave her my cash for the new house, and my sister DID live rent free in her house. 
Who owes me this money? Does my aunt still owe me since I was the one who lent her in the first place or should my sister give me back my $1000 right now since it’s not being used for what it was intended for in the first place and she has it? 
I know I’m in the wrong for trusting her but now that it’s over and done with, what should I do? I doubt small claims will do anything since I don’t really have documentation that she took it from me",03Aug2019,1

203,"I never post on Reddit or any kind of forum, I’m just stuck and don’t know how or who to reach out to. I’ve always been a fragile and deep person which would often bite me in the ass because I become so disappointed in myself and others. I used to have so many friends and would party all the time, but my ongoing discontent got in the way. Because of my insecurities I would make decisions that weren’t good for me. I would be pressured into having sex or doing drugs. I’ll admit, I like most drugs. Just not bad sex. Because of these things though, other girls see me as a threat. Ill admit (even though idgaf about it) that I have a good body and act very confident, so girls were never supportive or friendly to me. Which made me feel even more isolated. I come from a small town where there’s only 100 kids per grade in our high school. Rumors spread very fast and it’s toxic. I never felt popular, only that my friends were. When I separated myself from them, I lost my sense of sociality and questioned who I was. I pushed all my friends away, convinced they weren’t good enough, hoping they would try to be in my life and prove me wrong. I know it’s selfish. I’m such a loyal person to my friends and family and feel as if none of it has ever been reciprocated. None of my friends were ever consistent, for example we all threw a surprise birthday party for my friend. I bought her presents and posted on my socials about how much I cared about her. That shit makes me feel good, I was proud to have her as my friend. I didn’t care what anybody thought. Now fast forward to my birthday. Not a post, not a present, nothing. I was alone with my mom because none of my friends even wanted to do anything. It made me so bitter and sad. How could she not care after everything I had done for her? Bought her food when she was being forced to move by her mom, helped her move out of her fucking house. I never understood it. And now my actual best friend ditched me when I opened up about my depression. Went off to party and pop molly and get fingered every weekend. I blocked them and removed them, because they broke my fucking heart. I didn’t know what else to do.That’s only the simple version. there is so much more, just not enough room to type it out. I have always felt alone. At parties, when I’m with other people. I don’t wanna say I felt like I was always on another level, but I was. I notice everything and feel the weight of the world. I wish I wasn’t so sensitive. There are so many passions I have, for instance writing, singing, playing video games, and traveling. My deep depression and unsure nature have made me lose all my motivation. I even lashed out at the friend who left me to party and sent pictures of her half naked, on drugs making out with a bunch of girls to her dad.  I was so angry and broken that she left me after all these years. And now that I did that it eats at me. I know it was wrong. I’ve never done shit like that before either. All I can think about is how all my friends are having an awesome summer and partying with everyone and doing these awesome things. Without me. And it’s my fault.  I am an only child with a single mom, so my friends were like my sisters. I wish I could stop focusing on other people’s live and focus on my own. Without the people I laughed with, did all kinds of drugs with, cried with, traveled with, shared philosophies with, I’m alone. I pushed them away and now I’m stuck wondering if I did the right thing. Wondering if it is better to have bad friends that excite you, or to be completely alone.",03Aug2019,1

So I started a job today and I had training and I’m supposed to be training tomorrow as well. It’s a server position so there’s a lot of walking around plus I live 2.7 miles away and walk because I don’t have cash for the bus. As I was walking home my feet started to get sore as expected because I’ve been walking around without taking a break for so long. When I got home, I decided to lie on my bed for a couple of hours to see if it would go away and it didn’t. The pain in both my feet got worse and it hurts to stand and walk on it. Seeing as that I haven’t been able to get cash for the bus, I really don’t think I can make it to work and get the job done properly.

210,"I'm a high schooler and my friend joined the yearbook committee. This year she's assigned to write two articles, but for whatever reason she doesn't want to write them.

The deadline for handing in the draft is approaching, and a couple of days ago she panicked and sent me a text asking if I could help her write one of the articles, while she wrote the second one. I told a mutual friend of ours who immediately jumped to the rescue and together me and this mutual friend finished one whole article, with me doing the research and her doing the writing. This mutual friend also compiled a long list of data for the second article and sent it to my friend on the yearbook committee---all done on her phone, while on vacation.

I told my friend on the yearbook committee about our progress and thought she'd be satisfied. Instead she said something like, ""Oh, good. Now finish the second one for me.""

I wanted to say no, but instead I asked, ""Weren't you going to do it?""

She said, ""Nah, I gave up.""

I was frankly quite pissed at that and didn't give a direct answer, just sending a couple of emojis.

This morning she sent me a string of texts saying the deadline is today and begged me to write the article for her. She said she didn't have any time since she had a class to go to.

Honestly, the class is just a few hours. If she wanted to, she could give up binging soap operas for a while to write it up, before or after the class. Besides, why sign up to join the yearbook committee if you don't want to do any of the work?

At least that's what I think. Maybe I'm just angry; I don't know. I want to tell her, ""Isn't that your job?"" but that just sounds mean, so I haven't actually told her anything. I'm not sure if she senses my annoyance through my texts, because she believes I'm one of those people who don't get mad at all. Of course I get mad. I just don't tell her.

I don't want to do her job for her, but at the same time I can't quite say no directly. What should I do?

212,"I'm in my 20s and work part time at a locally owned, 5 employee store that sells batteries. We have a lot of diagnostic equipment that is relatively simple to use. I've been here coming close to a year now, but was only really trained to use the register and some of the equipment, everything else I had to learn on my own or use what I already knew.


A man comes into the store and after helping him at the register I agree to test his golf cart batteries for him. All I know about electric golf carts is that they take 6 6v or 8v batteries. And they're all wired up together, and it's about $1000+ worth of batteries. So I ask the customer if it runs at 8 Volts. He says yeah. I grab the tester and one end of the tester is clamped to the negative terminal, then we take the other clamp and touch the positive terminal at the other end of the battery harness, and I hear a loud pop, Sparks fly from the tester, and it starts smoking and smells like electrical burn.


Turns out, the 6 8v batteries are wired in series and added up to 48V, which destroyed my tester in less than a second. The guy ends up buying two batteries and leaves.


The tester doesn't work anymore. Tried it on a little motorcycle battery off the shelf and all it does is short it out and start to burn. Not a big deal I thought, it's probably a $300 deal or so. Nope, that battery tester is about $700-800. We have other testers in the store but one is finicky and the other is stationary. I broke the one everyone uses.


Boss is out for the weekend and I don't know when or what to tell him. I also have hours this coming weekend I needed and requested off but it's a little awkward to pair that in conversation right next to me braking expensive equipment. I feel so ashamed, and I feel stupid for not knowing better. I feel clumsy. it's embarrassing to have the sudden realization like that that I don't know what I'm doing. I'm pretty good at solving problems and working on mechanical stuff but I just walked right into that one. I should've known better.

214,"First ... I know I screwed up BIG TIME, so on one hand I kinda feel like I got what I deserved, but on the other hand I think there's a  path where I can make things  WORSE and probably a very thin narrow path that with some skill I might be able to salvage something.   
A) Friend got involved with Bitcoin arbitrage ... takes cash, buys Bitcoin  ... then sells it on international market to buyers for more than what he paid .... He was investing a lot of money for his Mom and Dad, so when I ran into a financial crunch, he offered to help. I wired $25,000 from a business account, expecting to return it with interest a few weeks later. Since then (June 5th) all I got was one ""interest"" payment of 6% (late) when the original deal was 2 payments per month. He said he'd return the money July 6th. 

B) Meanwhile, same friend was going on a trip and asked me to manage an event to promote a new product on super short notice. We've worked together before and regularly talk about our respective businesses. Normally I'd hire or bring in my own team (and that was the original agreement), but in this case ""things were moving fast"" and he hired a bunch of randoms off UpWork and then handed everything over to me 18 days later. Said he trusted me 100% and paid me up front. He also said he didn't want to be involved -- ""just run it"". A lot was completely screwed up. Of course it was a complete mess, and to make matters worse, one of the key players was 38 weeks pregnant and she went into labor right when a bunch of stuff was supposed to happen with sponsorships and promotional outreach. So people didn't have what they needed, several had never done email marketing or social media before, and there were a lot of obstacles with people not being able to login to the tools they needed, etc. My friend was completely off the grid  ... working on 2 or 3 other businesses, not available for meetings or anything. Then 4th of July holiday came around. So by July 11th things were not where they needed to be and my friend was pretty pissed off and blamed me for everything. By July 16th he fired me for gross negligence, saying I completely betrayed his trust. 

I realize ""facts"" don't matter when someone is angry, and in the last call he was talking like a complete crazy person. We've been really close friends for over 5 years ... gone through MANY rough times together. When I heard him talk this way I was thinking, ""He's just upset &amp; looking for someone to blame ... he feels backed into a corner .... I'm the only one he can lash out at like this ....  he'll realize this doesn't make sense when he looks thru Basecamp &amp; Telegram .... he's a reasonable and logical guy .... he's going on lack of sleep"" So I didn't react, just tried to stay calm. But now it's 3 weeks later and his last message to me was ""I thought we were gonna build something; turns out something was being built but I wasn’t involved or invited, just footed the bill."" I told him if he didn't feel like he got the value he expected, I didn't want his money. I haven't said ANYTHING about the $25,000 but I'm sort of getting the feeling like he's going to keep it as payback (or punishment) for all the money he lost, despite the fact my role was a small part of that. 

Suing him is not really an option since he technically doesn't own anything and all his assets are wrapped into layers and layers of  corporate shell entities that can't be tied back to him. Everything he does is encrypted end to end and he's completely anonymous -- no permanent address, moves from city to city, etc. Even if I did win a judgement, I'd never be able to collect, and I feel my best scenario is trying to restore the friendship. But the way he's talking I think he's already made up his mind. I've been biting my tongue and keeping quiet. Is that a mistake? Would it be better if I laid out my defense? I just think messaging over Telegram is not the best way to handle this ... am I wrong about that? Most of our relationship has been over Telegram .... 

So which of the following options is my best bet? 

A) WAIT and HOLD. Let things die down ... let time pass ... wait a few months (?) and then see if he's had a chance to look thru the project notes, maybe realize I actually did a lot of good work, or at least wake up from whatever bizarre trance he's in and realize I'm not the villain he's making me out to be? I'm also thinking if I wait he might make a lot more money on Bitcoin trading, and the sting of this venture might not be as bad. Or does waiting just make things worse and LESS likely we'll be able to discuss this like rational adults? 

B) Read the writing on the wall, accept facts and come to grips that both the friendship and my $25K are gone forever.",03Aug2019,1

We were each other’s first serious relationship, but we’re still great friends and I’m glad we’re ending on a good note where we can still be in each other’s lives, even if it’s not romantically. 

My question is, where do we go from here? He’s leaving in about a week to move in to his dorm. Do we just stop saying I love you the minute he sets out on the road? That feels wrong, but what else is there to do? Would it be weird of me to keep all of the handwritten notes he’s given me? A lot of things are just habitual between us. The casual touches. The forehead kisses. Leaning into each other. It feels like such an abrupt end. 

I met him freshman year and we were close friends up until the summer before junior year when we started dating. He’s been in my life for four years and I don’t know how to be without him. He seems to be handling things better than I am, but he’s always been the more level-headed one.

At first I liked Nancy, she seemed nice and bubbly but things quickly took a turn when she started oversharing about her life. She talks about her life and gossips A LOT, and most of the stories she shares are completely unprompted. Like I said she shares quite a few crazy things but here's just a few that bothered me: She crowbarred her ex's car multiple times because of an argument, she set her ex husbands stuff on fire (again because of an argument), her and her most recent partner cheated with one another on his (then girlfriend) for months and now regularly stop by her work to rub their relationship in her face (his \[now ex\] works at a food place), she bought multiple animals which she couldn't keep (she said ""they just didn't work out) and plans on buying more , the list could go on and on. The worst part about these stories is that when she tells them she is smiling and thinks they're funny/ is proud of them. I usually don't say anything and just keep my head down and busy myself with doing my work. However, because of this I often don't contribute much to conversations anymore which makes me feel like I'm not building strong bonds with the other girls and that I come off as ""standoffish"". One of the other girls (lets call her Alisha) will smile/nod or laugh and reaffirm what Nancy is saying. This confuses me because I know Alisha form the past and she doesn't seem like the kind of person to condone Nancy's kind of behavior. The last girl (we'll call her Grace) usually doesn't say much when Nancy tells her stories but Nancy has been giving her rides too and from work so I'm sure they're building a friendship. I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do. I feel like Nancy knows that I'm not super fond of the stories she tells and is going to talk negatively about me to the other girls. Alisha and Grace are really nice but also pretty shy/go with the flow so I could see them going along with whatever Nancy says so they don't ruffle any feathers.

Well I’m the process of showing me his phone he showed me a list of women he fucked and their names so he could remember them. He then confided that he had a secret document where he kept nudes that exes had sent him along with nudes I had sent him. Additionally, I found out he still had a dating app on his phone (not the one we met on) and he said he didn’t use that app anymore...

I wasn’t as lively as I normally was because I didn’t know his friends that well. He got pissed at me after for not being as happy as I usually am and asked why I even went. I told him so he wouldn’t be worried about me going home and not taking to him because he is leaving town for two weeks the next day. He also makes comments about women’s bodies every time we watch tv. 

He basically told me that he saved the nudes as trophies to look at when he felt down in the dumps when dating and it was like his art memorabilia he kept. I told him that my ex (the only other person I sent nudes to) asked me if it was ok when he wanted to save a picture of me naked and I told him that I felt that was most appropriate instead of just saving them without consent. He told me those nudes were gifts women gave him and he wanted to keep it as a reminder of his past. 
He then told me the dating app was still there because he forgot about it. 

He was upset at me for it because he showed me his phone to resolve an argument which caused me to be freaked out and caused another argument

He was also mad I wasn’t as chipper as he would like when we went out for dinner with his friends who I had only met once before. I was quiet because I didn’t know them, was tired from Job interviews and our argument, and because they kept talking about high school memories.

Growing up I never had any friends. I was always the weird kid, the outcast, the odd one out. You get the point.

In my eyes, this all pints to the fact that she is interested in me, but I of course have my doubts, our conversations aren’t really that flirty, we’ve gotten to know each other a little bit, but mostly it’s just both of us making jokes and making the other laugh, we’ve never really complimented on each others appearance or personality, except one time I called her funny, and another time she said my hair wasn’t that bad after I had just gotten a haircut, so this lack of flirting, and these overall conventional conversations lead me to believe that maybe she just wants to be friends? I am not too sure and I just asked her to hangout, she hasn’t responded yet but I guess that will tell me if she’s into me or not.

My memories of him are hazy at best and all tinged with the smell of beer on his breath, and the knowledge that it meant impending violence if not to me, then to my mom, who he regularly beat into unconsciousness in front of my siblings and me.

My first experience with alcohol was at 16 when my then 14 year old sister drank half a bottle of vodka without telling me. Naively, I didn't know what had happened. I am visually impaired and missed the visual cues; all I knew was that my sister was acting very strangely and not in a good way. She passed out and I called my mother who sent her then boyfriend (an EMT) over to check on her. I sat beside my sister with my hand on her wrist to make sure she was still alive, thinking she'd taken some kind of pill or other drug. I only found out later it was alcohol.

It feels like many of the bad things in my life have occurred due to or at least after someone has been drinking. I no longer know how to be comfortable when someone acts differently. Even in a joking manner, if someone seems off (like they might be affected by a substance), I panic. I feel weak.

&amp;#x200B;

The thought of men in particular drinking, even if they are the people I love and trust most in the world, is a paralyzing thought and an even more frightening reality when it happens. They do not hurt me. They do not hurt anyone or become angry. They are only different, and I can't handle the different. I have anxiety attacks. I can't eat. I can barely pull myself out of the panic in order to function. I feel like a pathetic human being. And then it's over, it was all fine, and eventually starts all over again. My chest tightens at the sound of a bottle of wine being opened from the other room. The smell of alcohol on someone's breath almost physically hurts me. 

I can drink alcohol and don't care. I only care when other's are drinking around me or in my knowledge. I feel trapped by my terror that I have only recently started to understand.

I have a therapist, and I fully intend on speaking to him about this. I want to know if there's anyone else like me, because I can't dig anything up online. What would you suggest to help? How do I get over this? How do I conquer my fear? Experience, even good, healthy experience, doesn't seem to even scratch the terror. The ""what ifs"" are still strong. How do I combat this? I cannot and will not ask the people in my life, such as romantic partners, not to drink because of my fear. I don't think that's okay. I don't know what to do, and I feel like something is wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: suffered a lot of childhood trauma and negative experiences due to other's consuming alcohol. I now can drink it myself but am terrified and prone to panic attacks when anyone I care about is drinking, even if I know about it from afar. Will talk to therapist but want other's input if there's any to be had.",03Aug2019,1

232,"I'm not sure this is the right sub for this, so if anybody can point me somewhere more appropriate, I'll post there instead.

Throwaway due to the personal nature of the post.

My biological dad and I have been estranged for 12 years. I'm 27. He and my mom fought for custody over me when I was a baby, and she won, with him getting the *""every other weekend""* visitation treatment.

As I grew up visiting him, things were good, but steadily got worse as I got older. He got meaner and very psychologically/mentally abusive - I don't mind going into detail, but they're irrelevant for this story. When I was nearly 15, I essentially told him he made me feel like shit and didn't want to visit him anymore. My mom happily backed me up on this and he wasn't financially capable of taking her to court again to fight the decision.

The only time I have seen him since then was at my high school graduation a few years later. Other than that, our only communication has been a few sparse phone calls where he basically asks when I'm gonna stop ""being a pussy"" and go be part of his family again, to which I say probably never. Last time I talked to him was 4+ years ago.


Shortly before I stopped visiting, my dad and his (now ex) girlfriend had a baby girl. She was about 9 months old when I stopped visiting so has no memories of me. They had another baby boy about 18 months later. So I have a half-brother and sister than I've essentially never met. My dad has spent their life filling their heads with lies about their amazing, mysterious older brother who will randomly show up one day and be a happy part of the family.

Now for the complicated part. My half-sister (who's ~13 now) contacted my mom on Facebook, trying to get in contact with me (I don't have Facebook). My dad is going through the same cycle of psychological and mental abuse with them as he did with me, only it sounds a lot worse. Their mom is not in a position where she can help them out like my mom did with me, and it sounds like they have equal shared custody this time around. My sister tells my mom that CPS won't take her complaints seriously. She desperately wants to get into contact with me, because *""I'm her brother""*. I think she needs help with the whole situation and doesn't know who to turn to.

I'm reluctant to get involved because I'm sure my dad would have an awful reaction upon learning of my involvement. I don't know what to have my mom tell my 13 year old sister. I don't know what I would tell her myself. Any advice about what options I have here or what others would do would be appreciated.",03Aug2019,0

Now, L told E that he fingered and made out with C on the couch infront of LL. E told C and C told Me. I called up D to see what was up (me and D are really good buddies).

I talked to LL today and she told me she was there and saw the whole thing, nothing happened. I trust C but I also trust D. I don’t know who to believe or if anybody even knows how much I know.

234,"Hi I’m 17/m and I’m starting my senior year of High school soon. My dad works at a local college and there is a program they offer to employees that allows their children to attend over 300 schools tuition free. I am very grateful for this opportunity however I don’t know what I want to do with my life. 

I have hobbies and things I’m interested in but nothing really sticks out. I know I don’t want to stay in my hometown and I want to experience life a little bit. I don’t want the white picket fence and a puppy, I want to make the most of my life while I can. 

I am extremely anxious over this and I can’t figure out what I want to do. I want to go out and make something of myself but I don’t know how. I don’t want to work the 9-to-5 job and become a slave for the rest of my life. Everyone asks me the same question: what do you like? The truth is I have no idea what I like, I don’t know what I’m passionate about. Most nights I stay up really late thinking about this. I’m afraid of what’s going to happen. I’m afraid of picking something I don’t like and hating my life. I know that nobody really knows what they want to do at 17 but I am especially lost. 

My life goals are pretty simple. I want to become successful in whatever field I choose. I’d like to own my own home with some property and have a wife or girlfriend. I’d like to have a job or I’m not looking at the clock all day waiting to go home. I’d like to live in an area where I can experience all the seasons aswell. 

I’m deathly afraid of never experiencing that, I know nothing in life is owed to you. Hell I’m so afraid of not experiencing this I’m already talking to a financial advisor about investing my money early. I just feel really really lost like my compass is spinning. I know some people have it way worse but this fear is eating me alive. I’m so tweaked out sometimes I stay up late at night thinking about how I’m gonna fit a new water tank in my future home or how I’m going to pay for a new car. I know these are a rational fears but they won’t seem to leave. 

Anyone has any advice at all I appreciate it.",03Aug2019,1
236,"My 15th birthday is in 4 days. All I want to do is hangout with my new/first boyfriend. We had been talking for 2 months and been hanging out a lot. He’s known the family for about 2 years and my parents love him. Just yesterday we decided to start dating. Of course I told my parents and they were very happy for me. When we were friends he was aloud to come over and watch movies with me when my parents weren’t home. But when I asked if he could come over to watch movies with me (in the living room) for my birthday, they said they weren’t comfortable with him being over while they weren’t home.  Today I saw them setting up 3 cameras in the living room. I can already see myself being miserable on my birthday.

237,"I just got my student bill for my college and turns out, they charge differential tuition for people with over 60 credit hours (I got my associates at a community college). I was planning on getting my degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, but it's an extra $72 per credit hour with several classes that are $95 extra a credit hour. Total it has added up to be $1500 more expensive a semester, not including books, than their base tuition which I had planned financially for. 

That being said I have 2 options; drop out, or change my major. I have all the prerequisites to major in Economics (the differential tuition is only $55 per credit hour and the major requirements are much more flexible) but I couldn't double major or minor in anything useful like Stats, Math,Computer science, or anything business related as the differential tuition for all of those are $95 per credit hour. At this point I could double major or minor in Legal Studies or Political science very comfortably credit wise and the additional tuition charges wouldn't break the bank. 

Ultimately I want to work in a business/office setting. I had originally wanted to work in HR and eventually get my PhD in occupational therapy or I/O psychology. However, I have worked in a company that does credit analysis and I am very interested in that as well. I wouldn't mind working in something law adjacent but dont want to be a lawyer. I want to go to grad school but I'm not in a rush.

 I am only taking out federal loans so I will only have 15k to pay off, which means to live comfortably in my area I need to make around $45k annually once I've graduated. I also work as an ""office person"" doing customer service/paperwork/ office admin stuff at a dealership so I will have a couple of years of experience at an entry level office position when I graduate.

She consented to giving him a blowjob in the club bathroom, however, he then proceeded to force her to have vaginal sex with her. She said no multiple times and made it very clear that she **did not** want to participate. She was also heavily drunk, to the point she was passing out during the incident. 

She messaged me once she had gone home and made it clear how genuinely upset she was, telling me all of this. She blames herself for it happening but has also convinced herself that it wasn't rape because she had told him that she ""didn't want"" and ""stop"" rather than flat-out saying ""no"". She's saying she overreacted and that it's not rape because she didn't properly say no, despite the fact she clearly hadn't verbally consented to vaginal sex, as well as being blackout drunk. 

So Reddit, I need advice on what to do. I've never dealt with a situation like this, and I have no idea what to say or how to act and I really just want to help her but it's so difficult when she's so in denial that it was rape. I've tried advising her to go to the doctors at the very least to get tested, but she won't even do that.

I’ve been working there for 2 months now and I have more insight of how it is to work there. I work at the cinema’s

Because of all the drama at the beginning regarding the two girls I still feel that my colleague has a negative view of me. I can tell by the look of their eyes when they are talking to me or when we just take a quick glimpse. 

So right now all I care about is to do my job but I can’t survive for long if I’m not socializing with them. 

I don’t know if I have already written this but after you have let everyone in to the cinema room and after you have refilled the popcorn you are free to do whatever you want for 30 minutes or 1 hour. Some colleagues are socializing and some choose to do something else like cleaning. 

I’m the guy who is cleaning just for the sake of having something to do and by that way I won’t be needing to talk to them so I’m not engaging.

And we do act very close, like, relationship type close. Sometimes when we stupidly bicker, she’d say in a soft tone ‘love you’ and I’d say it back. And I’ve liked her for 3 of the 4 years

Once, we were in a relationship, but it was because my friend told her I liked her, and she, not wanting to ruin our friendship, dated me for a bit until, she told me how she really felt. Now, there is a close friend in the middle of this, and one I’m not so close too. We’ll call them L and M.

250,"I suppose I should provide a little background about my brother first. He's 16 and extremely socially awkward. He's the type of kid that finds something to obsess about and lets it rule his life. For a while, it was Doctor Who and Legend of Zelda. Now it's Marvel stuff and DnD. He was bullied relentlessly in middle school. He was also expelled (in series of complicated and unfortunate events) and is now home schooled. He doesn't have a lot of friends, and doesn't do much outside of the house. He plays DnD online and watches a LOT of TV. Sometimes he plays Minecraft or Stardew Valley. 

I've been away from my family for a few years while living abroad. I recently moved back, so I'm living in the living room of my parents' two room apartment while I job hunt. I'm still super jet-lagged, so I can't sleep. My brother's about 20 ft. away in his room with the door open and currently video or voice chatting with some girls. I know it's none of my business to eavesdrop, but it's kind of hard not to.

At first, I thought he was playing DnD because he does that every now and then apparently. But the conversation quickly turned to ""how many sexual partners have you had,"" rating everyone's hotness, etc. My brother was very obviously flirting with some of these girls, even bragged about how close he got to ""banging his last girlfriend."" He keeps telling one girl how much he loves her despite her having a boyfriend. And he even told one of the girls (IDK if it's the same one) that he wished he could ""telekinetically remove her shirt.""

I suppose this is normal. Teens talk about this stuff. I don't know how much of it is him ""trying to be cool"" or him being serious. But I'm legit worried about him becoming a creeper. I don't care if he has sex, but I want him to be safe about it, AND I want him to respect women. I'm his sister, but I'm not his parent. I really want to talk to him (or ask my parents to talk to him), but I also don't want him to feel....like his privacy has been extremely violated. But today he also bragged about ""following around hot high school girls at Target"" and congratulated a larger man on ""snagging a tiny girlfriend"" in front of the girl. I'm not sure who to ask about this sort of thing, so I thought I would ask the people of reddit for advice. Here are some things I've thought about myself: 

1. Talk to my brother myself. Try to give him ""the talk"" to the best of my ability even though I feel really not prepared. I consider myself asexual, and I have no experience with this sort of thing. I could still give him some advice about being safe and respecting girls. I suppose this is complicated by the fact that we don't have a good relationship. 
2. Tell my parents. I feel like this is the right thing to do because I think it's something they should know about... They should be the ones to give him ""the talk."" But I do have pretty ""traditional, Christian"" parents. I think they would FLIP OUT. And probably ground him, and that just wouldn't go well. But maybe it'd be best? I honestly don't know. I want him to have the freedom to be himself, but if it's sexting or looking at porn... I don't want him to develop habits that could come back to bite him in the butt later on.
3. Tell my brother what I know and ask him to talk to my parents. He very obviously knows that I've heard what's going on. He walked into the hallway and saw me still awake. I don't think he'd do it, but if I could convince him to confront my parents about this stuff instead, the fallout might not be as massive. 
4. Ignore it. I don't want to... But I suppose it's always an option. He obviously didn't intend for our parents to hear his little 2AM conversation (even though I'm not sure how they haven't heard him...he's quite loud at this point).  

  
Sorry for the short novel. I'm not sure if I'm completely coherent, but here's a tl;dr - Socially awkward 16 year old brother has a suggestive video/voice chat with some gal pals; he's very clearly interested in intimacy, and as his sister, I'm worried about him respecting women and having safe sex. How should I approach the situation? Should I approach it at all? Should I involve my parents?",03Aug2019,1

So essentially, I've had this obsession for a while now, I think a few years. It comes and goes, among other obsessions/desires that are definitely not considered normal or healthy. I might forget about it for a week or month but if I ever hear or read any trigger words, things that relate to the obsession and make me think of it, then it instantly comes rushing back full force. The thing is, this doesn't scare me at all, I genuinely want to be abducted and raped/beaten/tortured and held captive for some months or years before finally being killed or escaping/being found. Even though I have this desire and I find myself actively trying to make it a reality, I know that in the end if it ever does happen, it will destroy me mentally. This isn't something anyone should ever have to go through, the emotional torment from being in a situation like this, it would be awful. Yet I still find myself being actively drawn to it and the more I think about it the more impossible it becomes to fight the obsession. I have no idea why I have these thoughts, I never want to go against them, because somehow my mind is so bent on experiencing this. I know it's unhealthy, I know I would regret it, I know it's not something anyone should ever have to experience, yet I'm still drawn to it. Ideally I would love any advice on how to make this a reality, but I figure that would be against the rules, so any type of advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated.

Last September, he told me that “People want to live a good long happy life, but, there can’t be a cure for my condition.” And after a few months later, he told me he was diagnosed with liver cancer, again. After school on some days I would see him lying on the couch, suffering from chemotherapy. When he’s not, he’s working hard to earn as money as he can to make sure his family has a good life from delivering food, fixing cars, and other things relating to technology. My father doesn’t like spending any money on himself, he only has a few shirts, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 sets of pajamas, and 2 pairs of shoes. I always insist on paying myself, but he always declines and says to save the money. What pains me is that my mother is always complaining about how selfish but she doesn’t understand that the money he makes will be useless to him in the near future. My father has admitted that he’s thought of ending it all because “what’s the point of suffering like this?” but he told me that, I cannot live easily if I don’t fight. Whenever I think about anything related to cancer, I just start crying, and I can’t control it. I know it’s useless crying over this and I can’t even go to my dad for comfort because i don’t want him to see how much pain I am in and I just want him to be happy. I don’t want him to worry about me, I want him to think happy thoughts. I don’t know how to control my thoughts and my emotions, because it’s useless crying like this. It’s all useless. I don’t want anyone to see how broken I am. Can someone please give me advice on how to stop thinking about this everyday.",03Aug2019,96
262,"So I’m a p soft spoken person and I do talk to people here and there but I’m not particularly close to anyone with the exception of my partner. I want to socialize more and do “friend” type stuff with people. I missed out on a lot of that during most of my childhood and adolescence and I kind of want to change it now. I just don’t really know where to look or where to hangout to meet people. I also don’t want to get close to the current people I’m talking to because I’m finding out more conflicting things about them and I just want to branch out.

263,"sorry for the bad formatting and/or grammar. this is my second post on reddit and i’m kind of rushing it because i’m scared.

!lowercase intended!



so recently i made a new friend about a few months ago, and i’d consider her a best friend. but, my other best friend isn’t as accepting of this new girl in my life.

at first she was just jealous, making comments on how i’m going to “leave her” and “only care about” my new friend, but now it’s been getting quite scary. 

her texts are getting more and more intense, telling me about how my new friend is just going to “take me away from her” and that she’s “in my way of having you to myself.” 

today, i recieved a special chain of messages that made me hop onto reddit and write this as i’m still getting them.

“i wish she would just *insert specific death*”

“she shouldn’t be here, I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS TO HAVE YOU”

“please answer me :) 💞💞💞”

it keeps getting worse, and as i’m typing this right now she keeps spamming me with these terrifying messages, yelling at me to “WAKE UP”.

i’m really scared for the safety of myself, and my new friend. what should I do?

i’ll post the screenshots if asked for since i haven’t had the time to block out her name, but i really need some help right now before she does something bad.",03Aug2019,3

I know, and I understand that the main cause was mainly because of my wrongdoings.  I suppose, I took her for granted, and I truly regret it. She was my first love and my last, and I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship either. I already miss her and honestly I’m not sure what to do anymore. Loving is difficult and i’m not sure if i’ll be able to love ever again. I genuinely don’t want anyone else but her and I can’t stress this enough. It hurt when she said “I don’t feel anything towards the relationship anymore and I don’t want to keep trying at something I don’t feel anything to anymore.” There’s not much I really can do about it, and I know I shouldn’t dwell on it but it just hurts, and it’s like i’m suffocating and I’m honestly lost to where what I should do.

269,"This is part question/part rant. I'll try to be as informative as I can here, because on one hand while I feel like there's some emotional manipulation going on, I'm also concerned that maybe I'm just being a dick, so I'd like your guy's input on this. 

I got out of a bad family situation and needed a place to stay, and one of my friends stood up right away to offer me one. Her and I were friends at the time, nothing going on at all, and we both understood each other's circumstances, so as far as I knew the original plan was to roommate together and I'd split my time between work and school. She was 100% on board with this. That was about two months ago. 

Since then, her and I have had endless talks about things like ""affection"" and ""physical touch"". She had mentioned stuff like this right before I moved in and we explicitly agreed not to get involved, and I didn't think it was going to be a problem, but since the very first day I came here she's been actively pursuing it and gets incredibly upset/depressed with me whenever I turn her down. I'm currently paying half of rent for my room, which is totally fine, and take care of most of the household chores. She's a single mom with two kids (a 7y/o and a 1y/o), so it's absolutely a handful for her and I like to contribute. We agreed that the whole arrangement is beneficial for both of us, but she's not happy that ""I'm not physically touching her all the time"" (her actual words here). It's anything from not sleeping in bed with her or cuddling her, to not having sex or holding her hand out in public. When she goes somewhere be it to see family or to go grocery shopping, if I don't go, she'll tell me how lonely I make her feel and that I'm cold and heartless. She's also aware I'm on the autism spectrum, and frequently calls me out on it saying things like ""I try so hard and it never matters, you just don't understand anything"" and ""I shouldn't have to explain anything to you"" whenever she gets upset. We aren't dating, and there are no feelings between the two of us, we both agreed on this, but it feels like there was a hidden motive to having me come here and I'm not sure what to think or do about it. Whenever we talk, it typically results in what I should be doing better, like talking to her more or changing how I respond to her emotional outbreaks. As of right this moment she's in the kitchen crying and I have no idea why, we had two different discussions today about why I'm not touching her for the millionth time, but it doesn't seem to be good enough. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or not. 



Before I moved in, I was aware of a few things that could've pointed to something like this happening. Her self-confidence is non-existent and is extremely morbid about anything, and she makes self depreciating jokes ALL the time, it's exhausting to listen to and if I don't dispute what she says she'll get upset about it. There's a number of behavioral problems that I won't get into for the sake of privacy, but I will share that she's pretty verbally abusive to her kids, something she also brings up coupled with ""you're not comforting me so fuck me I guess"". Her whole family thinks she's batshit insane, but her family is also full of assholes so I'm not sure if that's worth weighing in. 

I've been told before that I can be emotionally unexpressive, and have a hard time socializing with others. I can't trust my gut here because of that, and I've made bad judgements in the past, but I don't know what to think here. Am I being a huge dick here? Am I just too uncaring and leading her on? She reminds me all the time how I remind her of all these different guys she was with and it sucks a lot, but is she right about some of it? If I'm being unfair here, I'd really like to know.",03Aug2019,1
270,"Hey everyone,

I work for my country's branch of a huge multinational German company. I'm an intern, but only because I'm still studying and need time for university (they've offered me to work full time as a trainee).

Long story short - We recently had a meeting about our division strategies for 2020. We had something like a game, where we were split into categories of products and voted with fake money, we were ""investors"" and ""entrepreneurs"". We had small prices for each winner of a category, and a big prize for the one whose idea got the biggest financing.

I took a different approach to presenting. Made a video that made people laugh their asses out and had some serious ideas. People were stoked. They got up from their seats clapping, and most of them congratulated me for my work. This video was 2 days and 2 sleepless nights in the making.

Fast forward to when the fake money were being counted and the results being announced. Everyone was almost sure I was going to win. Well... nope... It was another colleague whose ideas was just as bland as a few others. Nothing special, not to mention she was reading from a list the whole time and her whole presentation was a disaster.
Some colleagues were indignant at what is happening. They've told that I've should've been the winner, and that there might be a ""mistake"". The boss didn't want a second voting.

Thanks if you've survived this far.
I want to quit, I'm disgusted at what happend and in a such a showy way. I don't have enough experience yet, and may not be able to find a decent job, but I don't want to work for these kind of people.

TLDR - Had a competition at work. My presentation amazed everyone. Almost all people cheered me and complimented me. A lady that had unrealistic and boring ideas, and her presentation was a disaster -  won. Votes were manipulated in an obvious way. Should I quit? I may not find another job, because of the lack of experience, but also don't want to work for this kind of a boss.",03Aug2019,1

She loves to watch vloggers on YouTube and I'm not sure if that has affected her self esteem in any way. I say this because she regularly compares her life to YouTubers and it made me wonder if she had started to compare how she looks as well. She tends to shy away from learning new skills too because she's unconfident and doesn't want to try (despite us encouraging her).

She also has said relationships are overrated... but is now ready to date again. So idk if we're actually 'going out' or not.

I also just changed my work schedule and we've scheduled the drinks for the same day and time I could be having mind blowing sex.

291,"I know the title of this post sounds like the most despicable thing imaginable but hear me out on this one. About a year ago, a care centre for young special needs patients was introduced in my neighbourhood, literally next door to me where several special needs patients arrive at 9am and leave at 3pm in which they are looked after by staff and are allowed to play outside. However, the problem is that the downside is for the neighbourhood is that from 9 to 3 there is constant screaming and shouting, like really bad that you can hear it from about 150 yards. Anytime I am in my house if there is screaming I can hear it for most of the day, my parents are retired and I’m on summer break so we are home most of the time. It is almost impossible to sit outside in the garden because you have to deal with the obscene noise that occurs in the day, sometimes if I’ve had a late night and still asleep, the screaming is almost a human alarm clock and without fail wakes me up. Trust me this isn’t just my family being picky, if anyone has dealt with this for a year then you might even consider moving house. This situation has become increasingly worse over the past few weeks as this centre has now become a 24 hour facility in which the patients sometimes will stay at the centre overnight which means the noise can go on into the evening and early morning. Everyone of my neighbours also have the same problem in which they can’t stand the noise and I’d say it probably effects about 100 people in the area. The problem is that this place is approved by the council and I have made several complaints to the council on top of several complaints made my my neighbours, however the council have done nothing about it, if anything it has gotten worse with the centre becoming 24 hours. The only thing the council has suggested is people who have made complaints go to mediation with the owners but this has served no purpose whatsoever. This problem also contributes to things like house value with houses in the area dropping in price because of the noise. It is even more frustrating as it has been such a beautiful summer but sitting in the garden and relaxing has been impossible which I think is wrong and shouldn’t happen. I’m not blaming the patients or the staff that work there, it’s just the negligence of the council and the owners to put a place like this in a quiet residential area in which the noise has a massive impact on the community.

293,"About 3 years ago, I befriended a woman who was new to town, lets call her Kelly. We met on OKCupid but it was immediately clear there was no romantic connection. All the same, we had similar interests and struck up a friendship.  We eventually found a house together. This would be my single greatest regret of my life. 

She became psychologically abusive, turned my friend and bandmate against me, and stitch needles into my girlfriend's clothes and my bed. I became so angry that I made a Facebook post calling her out on an act of violence. However, my friend and his girlfriend took her side, calling me a liar, claiming I was abusive, and turning the whole thing against me. I was devastated, and three months later I am still hurting deeply for the fallout of this turn of events, and having a lot of trouble processing it. 

I don't feel like myself anymore. I never knew I could hate someone so much. I never knew I could be so generous to someone, to give and give, and for them to just take everything they can away from me. I am going to therapy, I am on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, but I am still deeply depressed. How do I move on when I feel like my whole world has been turned upside down?

The whole story is a long one. But I feel like telling my story is an important part of processing it. 

Kelly has a sad and dark history of abuse from her childhood that very messed up. Without going into too much detail, it is some of the worst, most violent sexual abuse I have ever heard of. I felt pity for Kelly, and though there were many red flags along the way, I ignored them, completely underestimating just how mentally ill she is.

I met Kelly on OKCupid about three years ago. It was immediately clear there was no romantic connection. Nonetheless we had similar interests like music and comedy, so we struck up a friendship and made plans to play in a band together. She was new to town, so I introduced her to my friends, including my bandmates. We eventually found a place to live with another friend, and this is when things began to go downhill.

A few weeks in to living with Kelly, I began to notice forks in the garbage disposal every time I turned it on. People make mistakes, so I tried not to make a big deal about it but I mentioned it to Kelly. Her reaction was disturbing. She became very angry and started yelling. I tried to keep my cool, but she began making threats. At first she yelled ""What are you going to do, hit me?"" I was in no way being physically intimidating, but I apparently triggered some abuse from her past. I eventually said that I don't want to live with her anymore, and she told me to move out. I told her to move out. She responding by threatening to tell our landlord that I hit her to get me kicked out. My jaw dropped. I became upset, and our housemate came to tell us to calm down. Things deescalated, but for weeks I did not talk to Kelly, and fell into a depression. I did not feel comfortable around Kelly anymore. I wanted to, and should have, moved. But as we were on a yearlong lease together, we eventually tried to patch things up, or so I thought. But it's likely that this was the start of Kelly instigating my friends against me. She seemed worried that I was going to tell people what happened. Fortunately for her, the few people I told barely seemed to care. When you are a man and the victim of psychological abuse of a woman, few voices are sympathetic to you.

Around this time, I also started dating my current girlfriend. She is amazing and has been incredibly supportive throughout this whole ordeal - as she is one of the only other people who lived with her and really knows what happened. When our other housemate moved out and my girlfriend moved in, Kelly became more distant and colder towards us. It seemed to make her jealous that we were happy together, and she would sometimes try to instigate drama in childish ways - trying to make me jealous if she saw my gf talking to another guy. Her behavior became erratic - she ran around the house, scurrying from room to room. We would frequently hear her tapping a small gong or bell in her room, sometimes dozens of times in a minute, sometimes hundreds over the course of hours. We would hear strange moaning and owl-like noises sometimes. 

January. Something terrible happens at the end of this month. it is a story in itself, and a very troubling one. I will come back to this later.

Fast forward a couple months. I go to the local radio station to do my radio show. My gf texts me to tell me she's going to take a nap in my bed. Later, i get a text - a sewing needle was in my bed and went deep into her foot. It was strange and upsetting, but we figured it must have been some strange accident - maybe I had put one in my pocket and it fell onto the bed? Anyway, we didn't think much of it, until we found two more needles in our clothes.

I went to work, and after parking my car I stuck my hand into my coat pocket. I was immediately pricked by a sewing needle. Again I didn't think much of it, but looking back it was clear that it was purposefully threaded into my jacket pocket. When I mentioned it to my girlfriend, she said that she had experienced the same thing - a needle threaded into her raincoat pocket. It should have been obvious what happened, but I began searching for alternate explainations - ""Maybe some sewing needles got into the washing machine?"" It was such a foolish denial. It was clear to my gf what happened, and I feel like such a fool for not acknowledging it now.

Enter my friend and bandmate J. I had been friends with J for years before meeting Kelly, but J and I had something of a strained friendship because of his past with my gf. They had briefly dated two years prior. Now it was obviously never a serious relationship, but J was hung up on her nonetheless, and had unresolved feelings for her a full year after dating another woman. I had to make a choice - between being senstitive to J's, frankly innappropriate, feelings, or pursuing someone I had a real connection with. I have no regrets about choosing her, because she is the person I love and trust more than anyone in the world. My friendship with J did become somewhat strained, and Kelly became close to J and his girlfriend, who also took issue with us dating. T

Sometime before Kelly moved out, she began instigating J and his gf against me. They seemed very eager to believe everything that Kelly told them and take her side, and eventually, I got a text from J saying that he was done with me and the band, that I am an asshole, and that I talked shit about him. I became angry, and reacted poorly. I sent him angry texts in response. I told him he was being manipulated by Kelly, but he had already chosen his side. When I told my gf about what happened, she finally confessed that it must have been Kelly to put the needles in our clothes. I felt like such a fool for being in denial. it was truly the only way that the needles would have got there. Three needles, threaded into our coat pockets and my bedsheet? That was no accident. That was a mentally ill person trying to harm her housemates.

I became very angry and did something I regret immensely. I posted on Facebook that my ex roomate had been putting needles in our clothes and instigating people against me, without naming her. At first people were concerned, but soon after, J and his girlfriend began attacking me on facebook, calling me a liar and abusive. J denounced me and our band and told people not to book us. People really jumped on that bandwagon, and after that, people seemed to not believe me. People stopped talking to me. Unfriended me, blocked me on facebook. I was devastated. Betrayed, humiliated, violated. I feel into the deepest depression of my life. I said some things out of anger that I now regret. J had hurt me bad, and I felt that I needed to hurt him back. it just made things worse.

While in my deepest, darkest depression, I had a realization about something that happened earlier that year, and now I strongly suspect Kelly of doing something much worse than putting needles in our clothes.

Rewind to when Kelly and I moved in together. Kelly had mentioned wanting a cat. When a coworker at my job had kittens, I mentioned it to her and she decided to get the cat. I went with her to pick up the lil guy, and I was in love.

Lets call him Taco. Taco and I bonded strongly, as I would often pick up him and snuggle with him when he was a kitten. He would often come into my room and jump up on my bed to snuggle. He was a very affectionate and loving little guy. Kelly struggled with him, however. She has a hard time showing affection to Taco, and would kind of treat him like a toy or an object - holding him upside down, dressing him up, but rarely petting or snuggling him. he grew to prefer my company and would be found in my room more and more often. Kelly seemed to grow noticeably jealous.

On top of this, she was growing jealous that J and I were playing in another band. J and I had been backing Kelly in a band off and on, but we were taking time away from that to play a one-off show with another female singer. She became very angry about this. After practicing two days in a row at our house, she became extreme angry. Tears in her eyes, she yelled at me that we couldnt practice anymore. We moved practice to another house, but Kelly was still angry and jealous that we were backing another singer/songstress.  The next day something terrible happened.

My gf and I went to town for lunch. When we came back, I found Taco on the ground, flailing and struggling. He was trying to eat dirt and plants, probably in an effort to vomit. We grabbed him and rushed him to the vet around the corner, but we were too late. Taco died in my arms on the way to the vet and they were unable to revive him. 

I was bawling. I called Ava to ask what she wanted to do. When I told her what happened, her reaction shocked me. She was completely serious, with no emotion in her voice. She just asked me what happened, but it was like she already knew what happened. When I asked her if she wanted to see the body or bring him home, she immediately said no. ""What am i going to do with a dead cat?"" She also quickly rejected an autopsy. I truly wish I had paid for one myself. Taco's death was consistent with rat poison, and Kelly's reaction to her pets death was not normal.

We came home, and Kelly was back, sitting on the front porch. She twirled her hair in her finger and just asked ""What happened?"" a second time. She was still not upset, just serious. When I went into more detail, all she said was ""That's so weird. I had a feeling today was a weird day.""

I cried with my gf for much of the evening. Kelly did not cry once. I couldn't eat for 24 hours. Kelly cooked dinner within a couple hours of Taco's death. I felt like something was off. I had thought to myself, in my grief, that Kelly killed him - but told myself that I was being irrational, that she just doesn't know how to process grief normally because of her traumatic past.

She was barely affected by Taco's death, but she made a point to say things to me like ""I cried about Taco today."" Even then, I knew she never cried about Taco. But it took her putting needles in our clothes for me to realize that she is mentally ill enough to do something like kill Nacho just to hurt me.

I struggle with this every day. I have no evidence, no way to prove that Kelly did it. But everything about her reaction to Taco's death is suspicious. She was also home when we went to lunch - gone when we came back - and back against after we came back from the vet. The timing, the reaction, the cause of death, and Kelly's troubling mental state, her anger at us playing with another band...everything is suspicious. He was a completely healthy cat and not even 2 yet. Kelly killed him just to hurt me, just to get back at me. I gave her so much, and she took so much away from me.

I never knew I could have so much hate for one person. It makes me physically ill to think about Kelly. And I have a lot of anger at myself for not reacting better, for not recognizing her for who she was sooner, for letting this terrible, poisonous person into my life. It pushes me to the point of suicidal thoughts, though I know that I would never go through with that.

Help me Reddit. What do I do? I've alienated my friends and feel shunned by the musicians in town, who J is very popular among. I feel disgusted about Kelly receiving sympathy from my friends after she wronged me so deeply. I don't know how to move forward, I feel broken hearted. I'm afraid to go out because I know some people view me as this abusive monster. When I do go out, I feel extreme anxiety, and i already have lots of social anxiety anyway.

I just want to live my life and move forward. But I can't help this strong feeling of wanting people to know the truth.",03Aug2019,2

My birthday came around, we made plans for the beach but it was supposed to rain so I assumed we cancelled. That day I went on a walk and couldn’t find my phone so I left without it. Got two unassuming texts so I called her, told her about my walk. A few hours later I get a text saying 
“i'm doing this new thing with properly expressing my emotions ... i was really stoked about tonight. i was excited to set up the surprise for you, see your face when you open your gifts and watch you cry from reading my card... just watch you feel happiness and joy. i put a lot of thought and effort into this time, given i had to make up for lacked times. i ordered us some take out, a bottle of wine. i even got some rose peddles, led lights, and balloons. wanted to mimic the dream date aesthetic ... today around 6 i was supposed to pick you up .. you weren't responding to my texts or calls and i was in full panic. i was so worried you were hurt. i tried finding sarah on instagram/facebook to message her to see if you were alive. couldn't find realyna because i forgot how to spell her name. i cried and cried because i couldn't get in touch with you because i was sure something had happened to you because i know you wouldn't just blow me off like that. i literally felt so sick to my stomach from 5 - 10pm because i didn't know what happened to you. i waited around for a text/call and nothing. i feel very sad and upset. i almost wish that something had happened because i can't even deal with the fact of you just blowing me off because you went on a walk and couldn't find your phone ..”

I have major memory problems, I feel like I cant remember anything. I cant remember the plot of books I read after just a few months, I cant remember the name of characters in a TV series I watched recently and I also struggle to keep knowledge that I look up even if its bound with my personal interest to the topic, I just forget it after a short duration.  


All of that makes me feel very stupid sometimes, I am planning to go to college but I really question if that is a good idea with the current state of my memory.

In the last couple of years I had a very bad sleep rythm with only a few hours of sleep every day. I know that our brain needs sleep to clean up the toxins. My question is, if you dont sleep much for a very long time and these toxins start to build up arround the glial cells of the brain, is that damage reversible or permanent?

300,"So well my friend is suicidal 
They have been like this for few months , it's getting to edge now.

Later the dmed me something the first thing they said they failed.
I didn't understand what, I asked they didn't tell.
Later I saw the tweet and one more reply to a tweet about related to suicide ( I don't remember much) but well they said they regret  attempting
I was pretending I didn't get what they said in dms until I saw they failed attempt
I wrote a good message and it
They said thank you.
Well from that time they're suicidal everyday
They sometimes tweet  I want to die
The other people online tell her don't but well she then tweeted the other day I want to end it all don't tell me bs don't and tell me a way to die.
Some fucking person replied Google it ( context that person is suicidal too probably) well they said the pills are expensive and well the replied said well you have to live then
I have a heartbreak everytime I see that
I tell them how much the mean to me and stuff

Please suggest me something good.
Suicide hotlines my friend won't contact
Child protection nope

They're a teenager if ya wanna know and well the financial condition isn't good.
As much as I know them they don't eat much at times and well I don't force them to shove food in their mouth I just say eat when you want to ( they probably have some disorder coz the think eating is a task)
Their life is not much good at the moment
They have started getting panic attacks recently

304,"This whole story that leads up to me asking for advice is about over the course of about 6 months so please bare with me.

So at the time of this story I was a broke 17 year old male who wanted to make a quick buck. So one day I was bored on the internet and saw a video on YouTube about some e-thot making tons of money from a foot pic she took. So I decided how hard could it be so I made an account on reddit and used it for posting foot pictures pretending to be an attractive girl, and used this account to try and market and sell personal pictures to men who were interested in buying them. Keep in mind I am just a 17 year old dude at this time. But I must have amassed a bigger fan base then I realized. I made a little bit of money but quickly got bored of posting after about a week. 

Now, fast forward about 6 months and I’m now 18 years old and Minecraft is now popular again, and I have started to play it again as it was an incredibly fun game that I grew up playing. But I play Minecraft on Xbox and I decided I wanted to join a realm this time versus a single player world. So I google “free Minecraft realms to join” and it takes me to a small reddit post with about 40 upvotes of a guy saying he was starting a realm and was looking for people to join. So I messaged him and told him I wanted to join. But he told me I needed to have discord so I could join a discord server with everyone in the realm. So I downloaded discord and joined the realm and played for about a week and everything was fine. Then out of the blue, the owner of the realm, the one I had messaged on reddit sends me a huge discord message about how he’s a big fan and has spent hours and liters of c*m looking at my pictures and that he couldn’t believe I had joined his Minecraft realm. And it hit me like a slap in the face that I had responded to his reddit post with my foot fetish account I had made and I don’t know if I should tell him that I’m just an 18 year old dude or just keep going along with it?",03Aug2019,2

307,"Hey All, I took a Software Development job out of University which offered a salary that was substantially below market for the field. It's been 1 year and I was recently offered a raise, which seemed to match my salary expectations after a year of work. I had a brief conversation with my manager when I was offered the raise and heard nothing but good things about my performance in the past year, I was asked whether it matched my salary expectations and I said it did, But here's the catch: The figure I was offered was an FTE salary, which means that I will actually earn substantially less bi-weekly than the figure I was presented with. The raise I was offered ends up being only a 3% increase in my bi-weekly salary. 

After reviewing everything, I'm making a lot less than I'd like to in an in-demand profession (Software Development). When I was hired I didn't have the bargaining power to expect a higher salary, since this was my firs job in the field, but after a year of work I feel I've demonstrated that I add value to the company and that I am good at my job. I was wondering if I should go back and re-negotiate my salary? Or should I stay and in the meantime look for another job (one which is more in line with my current salary expectations)?

Btw I should mention that we're both in our late teens. I say ""date"" in quotation because I'm not even sure if the same online dating rules apply to people as young as us. I verified that it'll just be us, but it still feels weird to just assume it's a date. 

We haven't met before, but I'm pretty out going so conversation won't really be an issue. Dancing with a girl I've ever met before might be a little weird though lol. 

A first date at a club is really weird, but I feel like it's also a good opportunity to just have fun, strangers or not.

.i have a big problem that needs a solution.


I have been mocked, judged and made fun of my entire life for everything:

For my friends i was the stupid and rich one, for everyone i was the ugly one, and for my family i was always the different-in-a-bad-way one. 
My sister always made sure to let me know that my birth ruined her life, my classmates always made sure to let me know that i was ugly and treated me as such.
.

This resulted in me isolating myself, developing severe self hatred and a voice in my head that just wont stop and wont go away, me losing all social skills and me hating the world and being asocial.

Meaning, if she wants to go eat, although my friend had already eaten, she needs to say yes and follow her. Friend B is a bit different. She have this group who will get mad if she's having fun or try a food at a new place without them. So I always refer myself as a mistress to friend B since I can't tell anyone I'm going out and have fun with her.

Another thing that makes me sad is I don't have a friend with the same interests. I have tried to make my friend listen to my favorite song or watching anime, but somehow they are not interested and so yeah, maybe we don't have the same taste. Friend A never have interest in K-pop, but now a stan for bts after her friends influence her. And friend B have always love K-pop and now every single one of my friends will either sing K-pop or talk abt what Jimin or V is doing today and even buy a merch from bts thingy together! I remember if I were to ask them to play with me or going somewhere, they always say they don't have money. I always feel left out because of this because they even talk about K-pop even if I'm there.

What makes me want to whine here today was because of friend B. Last night she persuade me to come with her to hike with their classmate. None of her classmates like her but it's kinda a homeroom activity so she needs to come. And she asked me since I like outdoor activity and all her other friends rejected her. I said no at first since I'm tired and I really wanna wake up late the next day but finally give after she said no one will walk with her etc etc. So today we hike, it's okay, but my body feels sore from the lack of rest and exercise so we plan to go for a massage this evening. I was kinda prepare for her to text me the time, but then the text I got was we will go tomorrow because her clique wanna hang out with her this evening.
...but we already planned to go for a Massage...

Idk, but I always feels like I'm being left out. I'm crying right now because looking back, I don't really have a friend who I can call ""close"". 

Maybe my definition of friend is wrong? Maybe I need to be forceful and have them listen to what I like or watch what I want? I never really force anyone to do what I like because I'm afraid they'll end up hating me. But I always have to learn what they like so I can have something incommon to talk about.

318,"My mom has weird tastes when buying products.

For example, she buys the top of the line iPhone when our 2 year contract ends, one for herself and one for me.

But when it comes to other things, I cannot really understand her.

She thinks a $250 networking setup is very expensive, and thinks a $200 chair is expensive.

She does not care about quality when buying cables. If the cable is pretty, she buys it, no matter how it's shitty.

She preferred expensive things in the old days, but these days she cheaps out on important things like networking and chairs. I still cannot find a good product for her when she gives me a budget.

Is this normal?",03Aug2019,0
319,"I work in this small department as an intern and I’ve been given many opportunities for growth and a lot of praise in the beginning of my internship. 

Once I was given more responsibility my colleagues became cold and at first I thought it was just because of higher expectations but it came to the point that I can’t enjoy my weekend at all because even on Friday I am worried about how bad it will be on Monday. 

I have one manager who is quite old fashioned and he believes that you should never talk back and always just do, which is fine, I learned to be quiet and just say okay. But there is this other manager who has told others repeatedly that he wants my responsibilities. He once screamed at me behind closed doors but I told my boss about it and he told me it’s happened before to the previous person in my position and to let him know if it ever happens again. Since then the manager has been much more careful always testing me by asking me things by email and always copying my direct manager(the old fashioned one), trying to find ways to trip me up. I’ll ask him about things and he’ll tell me and then when I bring those things up again he pretends we never had that conversation( it’s my fault I don’t email him too to have proof). He even has the nerve to sometimes ask if I’m okay with him... I once told him I don’t appreciate the way he talks to me and he told me that I have been given responsibility because they believe I can succeed and this is the learning curve and he’s just trying to teach me....

I only have a couple of months left of my internship but when I first got here I loved the job, now I am miserable thinking what new fresh hell awaits me everyday. This jealous manager has made my life hell and I can’t bring anything up to my new boss because he says that the jealous manager is just sensitive and that I take things personally, which baffles my mind. My question is how do I avoid these kinds of situation next time around? I am starting to feel that the only ones who succeed in professional life are the cut-throat bullies who don’t care who they step on to move forward.

327,"TL:DR: Avoided female interaction aside from the quickest small talk growing up and now that I’m 23 I can’t communicate with them without becoming an anxious mess. 

I basically told myself in 10th grade after getting rejected by a girl through messenger (lol) that I would never go out of my way to try and date a girl ever again. I didn’t realize how bad that would fuck me up in the future but now I realize that I actually have a fear of getting intimate with women or even having conversations where it could possibly lead into them liking me as a friend. The whole idea of having females friends is foreign to me as if I am 13 years old.

It’s starting to mess with my life quite a bit because when a woman chimes in on a conversation I’m having and I want to continue the conversation with her, my brain just fries and I get way too anxious to even converse like I usually do. 

For example, a female coworker pulled me to the side and asked if everything was OK because I seemed a little upset today I explained to her that I  having a little bit of issues at home but I appreciate her reaching out. She wanted to know more and as soon as she said that and gave me these genuinely concerned and comforting eyes I literally started sweating and it got to the point where I was slowly backing away from her as she got closer to my face and then I just found something else to do to avoid the situation.

I have had a few ideas recently but I almost feel as though I’m being creepy. Would it be better for me to speak with younger girls like 18/19 that also don’t have as much experience? I feel as though this isn’t weird or creepy because I’m not an older guy with bad intentions I’m just very inexperienced.

But even that paragraph reads creepy as fuck. Jesus, help me.

This happens all the time and I can’t get past this. I really need some help.

I want to experience not a relationship but at least 50% of the human population that I’m missing out on. I know nothing about women and my viewpoint on them is a little negative because of social media and shit.

Can someone please lend me some words of advice please. I don’t want to be like this at 25/30",03Aug2019,1

My brother’s opinion is that he would feel as though he would be contradicting, and betraying his devotion to his religion if he was aware that there was pornography inside of where he lives. In a way, I can understand this and I do not want to betray my brother’s trust.

However, my opposing opinion is that if I keep it inside my room and never let it spread anywhere else in the living space, then it is not inside where he lives, and he would not be responsible for it. On a similar note, I would never view it when we are both in the living space, to ensure that he is able to comfortably live.

James (made up name) - 14M

I’m a been friends with James since I started primary school 9 years ago. Ever since then, he’s been my best friend and no one’s even come close to rivalling him for that position.

When we finished Year 6, I realised that during the six  years of primary that we did, he was my only real friend throughout all of it. I also realised that this was the case throughout year 7.

However, his parents divorced and he moved back to his home country (Australia), but we still stayed best friends. In December of 2018, I went to visit him for 9 days just before Christmas. They were the best 9 days of my life.

At the beginning of July, I moved back to England (we both used to live in the Middle East), so now I’m even further away from him. I recently asked if he was going to come over in December, like I did last year, but he replied with: “Nah, sorry. It’s too far. Maybe later in life.” This broke my heart, he was my best and only friend and he’s not even bothered to make the effort to come and visit.

Currently, I am out of the country. Ocean away. I come back home in mid august, so very soon. My best friend, K, is having a very rough time. 

I'll try to paraphrase background information. K and I have been friends for over 3 years, we have also been roommates for that long as well. K has severe depression and has made a few attempts, all ending up with them in the hospital/ward or having a breakdown. I have no problem taking care of them, this is no burden to me. My only wish is that they could get the help they need. They do not have medical insurance, neither does their parents I think. 

K had to move back home due to financial reasons. K has always had financial issues. So they had to move home to get back on their feet. They didnt like their hometown but it had to make due for now. Their parents are sort of supportive, but they can be very selfish. Currently, from what K has told me, their parents are fighting constantly. The mother is drinking herself to hell every night and the dad is just pretty much done with it. The mother is being pretty toxic at times to K and the dad is trying to be supportive at times. Theres more but it's just a mess. 

My boyfriend, D, is also good friends with K. So he has been their rock while I've been gone. K and I call and talk of course, but it's impossible for me to be physically there at the moment. 

K recently came out of the ward about 2 months ago from an attempt. I took them to the hospital and they got admitted. D and I visited them pretty much everyday. There were times either of us could not visit due to our jobs and the hospitals very specific visiting times. Parents also visited and were supportive. I felt safer that K would go home and have a decent support system.

Last night, K was texting me how things were just awful. We talked and K naturally ended the conversation. I woke up the next morning with texts both from K and D. K asking to call and D telling me that shit went down. 

K wasnt answering my calls. D explained that K got very drunk and went out walking at night by themself. D was on the phone with them and made sure they got home safely. K was telling him that they wanted to die and saw no point anymore. K eventually texted me and told me the same thing D told me but with more detail. They told me that they wouldn't do anything tonight (morning for me), but they would show our text convo to their mom. If their mom didnt really show any concern, that was it. 

K and mom never really had a great relationship if that's anything. Relationship with dad is okay at best. 

But K has never gone this far as threatening if that makes sense? I'm worried they're actually going to hurt themselves and I'm afraid I can barely do anything as I'm over 5000 miles away. D has offered to drive down to where they are to help them. K has denied this. 

I just need advice if there is anything I can do while I am very far away.

350,"Here's the situation.

Gf was on birth control for a fair while, we still used condoms on top of that so we were extra safe. Last month she was off the birth control because (from what I can gather) she forgot her birth control and opted to wait until next period to come by before she used it again. We have had sex a couple of times during this period (with condoms) and I have checked each one for leaks / tears, of which there were none. 

However, her period is late by a week and a half. She does have some added work loads contributing to her stress levels, as well as the stress of the thought of being pregnant. 

I am trying so hard to keep it together and believe the delay is just the stress of work, as well as the stuffed up hormone cycle as a result of the birth control not being maintained. To be fair though this scares the hell outta me. We cannot have a child right now.

I guess the advice regards what is the likelyhood she is pregnant compared to her just having a late period because of stress / missing her birth control.

So I keep a private journal, and while I was out of the house my parents read the journal. Inside I wrote my deepest darkest secrets and it revealed to them everything in my life. They knew it was private, and I asked why they read it and they said they should be allowed to. They’re an open book. 

But they Interrogated me and just nonstop called me a bad person, selfish, ignorant and disgusting. They found out about my lifestyle and kept telling me I’m a bass person. In the middle of conversation I had a anxiety attack and ran out and my girlfriend met up with me she drove 40 minutes to see me. I talked with her and gained some recurrence and went back. 

Same conversation, they gave me a ultimatum that either i completely change my ways and come back to God’s path, or leave the house. I said I will leave. Then my dad said you can only take the things you’ve bought with your own money so I can’t keep my phone. He called me a horrible person and that i should never come back and talk to them. I dont have a car, and I’m really lost. They gave me a few days max. 

I need a car to get to my job, and my parents still provide for most of my tuition. Im a second year student, and my first year was covered with Fin aid but now my father makes a lot so i don’t get any and will have to pay full 6K.  

I can crash at friends’ places for a while, but I need to figure out how to get my tuition situation fixed and what kind of a car i could get, and how to get a cheap phone plan. I have a 750 credit score, so I’m considering financing a used car. I can crash at some friends for a little while but will eventually need to figure out cheap housing options.",03Aug2019,2

I know that she has been actively seeking a partner because she is open and gullible about her feelings towards a boy we know. She has never said she has aspergers but I can only guess she is on the spectrum from the time I have spent with her.  I am her only friend and I feel like she deserves the world and needs someone to be there for her through and through.

Now, in uni, I know a nerdy coursemate who is often lonely. He has also made comments about wanting to kill himself and has said things like ""I feel like jumping from this floor""

The last thing I want is be the initiator of a destructive relationship and I would die of guilt if anything happens to my friend.

I want to study a field through which I can improve to very very high positions and as much as I think how can I reach that level in my life it seems computer science won't help me. The highest position I can get in CS is becoming an IT manager or software Manager of a company but I would to love to work in government sectors as economics is a broad field and I think I can get my goals through economics rather than in computer science. Embassies, UN, government sectors, banks,... there main employees are law, economics, and political science students.
Do you think working in technology field will lead me to such places and help me get my dreams or switching it to economics will?

357,"Hey. I took my doggo Marley to a dog park today for the 1st time. He's 3, had plenty of interaction with other dogs at daycare and out on walks with friends and their dogs. He's an excited dog and loves being off the lead. So I get a suggestion from my friend to meet them at a dog park and we meet up. As soon as I'm signed in, I let him off so he can explore. Within a minute of being off the lead, a dog goes for him. I actually caught it on video. He must have ripped his belly skin on the side, and he has an open flap/wound. Marley cries runs to me and the people that volunteer to run the park offer to take me to the emergency vets (I'm crying) and I go. They are super helpful, my friend is with me too, and Marley gets staples and is sorted within an hour.

In the video you can see the owner of the other dog go ""woah woah woah woah"" as Marley is about to pass his dog and his dog then barks/bites him. Marley is running past so as soon as it happens that's when he yelps/cries and runs back to me. It's as if the owner knew it was gona happen.

Anyway, I've emailed the owners of the dog park (I had to register my details before 1st attendance) with the video and asked them ""if anything can be done"" hinting that they ban the guy or something. But I honestly don't know what to do/say now.

364,"
Hey, guys. I've had various symptoms of a movement disorder for years, but I only just now decided to figure out which, and I'm settling with Cervical/Drug-Induced. I've been on medication for various Mental diagnoses for a while, and looking back, it all began with Remeron(Mirtazepine) and Sinoquan(Doxepin), along with various high doses of regularly-scheduled Benzos, which I just saw could cause it.

My biggest attack, when I KNEW something was wrong, followed two oral doses of Haldol(Haloperidol), without any anticholinergic to prevent side effects. They were 6 hours apart, and I only took them for my GAD, as the Psych was trying to see if I could live without controlled Anxiety meds. Psychiatrists would rather let you suffer and get worse, live a life not worth living, and never have any hope, as that is their income.

Anyway, what happened was I was resting during the break between groups in the Psych unit, when my head jerked straight back, my eyes kept rolling further and further upward, and no relaxation/flexing helped. I could get my head to let up for like 3 seconds, when it would start right back. I couldn't stand, as my body was basically trying to backflip while standing and not jumping. I felt like my neck would snap if something wasn't done QUICKLY. It took me 30min to get the RN to take me seriously, and another 20 for the Resident Psych to come to the unit. After he got there, they immediately asked, ""Does it hurt?"", to which I cried, ""YES, OMG, YES! PLEASE, HELP! MAKE IT STOP!"" They broke heating packs under my neck, the doc ordered a shot of Cogentin(Benzatropine?), 2mg(Big-boy dose) IV Lorazepam, 10mg Percocet[325mg Acetaminophen/10mg Oxycodone(I just took one 3 hours prior)], then an IV of Ultram(forgot dose Tramadol) 1 hour prior, so I was pretty doped up already.), and within 1min I was already knocked out from the cocktail+exhaustion+relief. Then I woke up, took my normal dose of 1mg Klonopin(Clonazepam), 10mg Ambien(Zolpidem), and another Percocet 10.

As good as I felt in the end, I will NEVER forget the panic, sense of impending doom/danger, and fear that I felt in those 60mins of involuntary movements.

Since then, I've been stuck with this completely different set of movements, which only happen after a sudden movement(Standing, turning in bed.), and consist of my head constantly turning further and further to the left, pursing my lips, difficulty keeping eyelids open, and my right arm bending toward my check deeper and deeper, which persist and advance for ~5-15sec, then suddenly it all relaxes. I have trouble staying standing, as all other muscle movements are also impossible, even when receiving help from my brother or somebody to try and go the opposite direction. I also have random tongue movements, biting my tongue and lips to bleeding(Related or Anxiety-invoked? Idk.), Akathesia (Terrible.Like RLS throughout your body. Worst bodily sensation, just  sort of severe pain.) and random other tics. That is Tardive Dyskinesia, though it isn't constant, only random and infrequent, so I don't count it as being full-blown TD, yet, and I wait the Remeron, Benzos, and Doxepin, but now the bitch Nurse Practitioner has me on fucking XYPREXA(Olanzapine), though I don't take it as RXed, only during panic attacks and when I can't sleep. Catch is, I don't even have a condition where it is required! It's for treatment-resistant MDD + Antisocial(Or Borderline. I've been diagnosed with both by different docs.) Personality Disorder and GAD.

Hopefully it all doesn't get much worse and eases up with time. I will stick to self-medication, since Medicaid Doctors don't RX stuff that works if you have ever had any issues with substance use, even though it was all self-medication for anxiety and Depression to begin with.

Does anybody have any tips, suggestions or advice for me? Is this really Dystonia with TD-like features, is it full-blown TD, or is it another movement disorder?",03Aug2019,1

370,"DISCLAIMER:  
The following post is asking for advice on sensitive topics. If you suffer from PTSD or traumatic experiences you may want to pass this one up. I am not joking, this is not an easy post to write and it requires a lot of context and content. So there will be a lot of writing and I am not going to sarcastically joke around at all. Thank you for reading in advance and I appreciate any and all help.   


So let's start at the beginning. There are 4 of us on our overnight shift for my call center job. Of them, I am the only white person. This staff was and is like family to me. However, it wasn't always like this. When I first moved I was in trouble for nodding off at work. This is a serious offense and normally ends up in termination. However, I was told (and this is important) that due to my tenure and the fact there were no takers for this shift that they wanted me to work on this and was given a chance....several in fact.   


I wasn't a perfect employee either but have made a significant improvement. In fact, I was able to score multiple accolades from a recent client. But that's only partially important.   


Fast forward to a few days ago. My coworker (who is a POC), was fired on one offense for something incredibly minor to my understanding. No chances, no coaching, just gone.   


As you can understand, and I as well, there was some... comparisons being made. That focused on me and them. I didn't ask for any of this sort of drama. My management made all the decisions. I even was asking why I had a job if they were fired. But of course, that doesn't matter. I can already hear the rumblings and I think my job is about to scapegoat me as a racist. Which is pretty much a permanent black mark on your future employment in these days. More importantly, but this just isn't fair to them.  


Long story short, I don't know what to do. I don't want to quit (bills, food, and necessities are well needed) but I don't think I need to hold myself responsible for decisions I didn't make nor did I condone nor did I have a part in. I feel like I am benefitting from shit that I shouldn't and my job is actively trying to turn coworkers against me as some tool to hold over my head. I don't have a backup plan, they are pretty much my best references to prove my work experience. I can't lose respect from either side. But I don't want to be some sacrificial lamb for their obvious racist actions. Like this isn't an accusation, this IS racism. I should have been fired if they were going to be fired, that's like the definition of equality or they should have worked with this person. It really pisses me off because I normally avoid any contact with anyone, like staring at the floor constantly as to just avoid offending anyone. It wasn't until overnight that I learned some form of comradery.   


I feel like absolute trash, literal trash. But this isn't about me, this is about how I deal with this and still not be the villain and have people understand who the real villains are. I don't seriously know what to do and I can't do anything until they actually attempt a move. But this just, this is just too unreal, I go so far out of my way to literally avoid pissing anyone off and someone does it for me. I didn't ask for this, I didn't want this, I want to earn my keep not be given it.   


I am not looking for legal advice. I am not looking to get lectured on how I am the POS. I am looking for actual help to navigate drama I have literally never been exposed too. I am a fucking hermit that plays video games all day and eat. Then I go to work and do my job. I could give a fudge all about most people unless they are treated unfairly, especially at my expense.",03Aug2019,1

372,"So, two days ago (Thursday) I had one of my two almost three year olds bite another kid so hard he was bleeding and bruised. this was a playground incident so I had to bring both kids inside. I sat down the biter and cleaned and bandaged the kid that was bit. I asked my coworker if I could leave the biter with her because we were coming in in a few anyway and I wanted to separate the two as they had been fighting all morning and the biter had been beating on the other kid pretty bad. Lets call the biter Peter and the victim Connor. So hours later my coworker that I left Peter with (biter) is sitting with me and I said let me check Connors arm again to see how bad it looks. Then she goes oh I have to check Peters arm too, I asked why and she replied that she bit him so he would know what it feels like and she wanted to make sure she didn't leave a mark. Now, I was in complete disbelief and shock. I mean I was pissed, literally just wtf type of shit is that. So, my first thought is Peter TALKS!!!!! Hs is going to tell his mother, and I know this information so if his mother freaks out this coworker is totally ratting me out for the fact I knew. I texted my boss instantly as she was already gone for the day and she told me to call her when my shift is over. Basically his mom picked up he told her infant of us and she flat out didn't believe him, she actually laughed. this woman thinks she got away with it. So, my shifts over I call my boss. She is furious. Like screaming and cussing. My anxiety was eating me all night. I mean I was so stressed I didn't sleep at all that night. Friday I come in and my boss says not one thing to my coworker or I until 1 pm! Like I was sitting there frreaking out all day because I knew what was happening and my coworker didn't know they knew. They played back the cameras called her up there at 1pm and she was up there for over an hour. Then they call me in, they fucking told her I was the one that told , they then proceeded with it wasn't a hard bite he didn't even cry, they understood the principle of what she was doing even though it was inappropriate. They also emphasize how they heard her say to me ""I bit Peter"". Then in front of her they asked me if I was comfortable working with her and asked how I feel about her. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL CAN YOU BE. I was super upset, I was holding back tears because I really thought this was handled so poorly. sos he got a 90 day probation. I basically told my boss expect me to start looking for a new job because this is ridiculous. she begged me not to quit because I am a great worker and the parents love me. This is not this woman first offense I have corrected her treatment with the kids many times but this was just beyond me. Of course there's a bunch of other shit but I don't want this to be too long. Just wondering how everyone else feels about this ? Unjust ? Not properly handled? or am I overreacting? I truly feel like no child care provider/teacher should be able to fucking bite their kids that's absolutely ridiculous.",03Aug2019,4
373,"I don’t know where to post this, sorry. 

So early this morning my brother’s car was broken into while he was out, and they stole the car insurance and the garage door opener. This same thing happened to my neighbor a few years ago; car insurance and garage door opener was stolen, my mother watched a car pull up to their house, open the garage door, park the car in the garage, close the garage behind the car, and then the 2 kids home at the time ran out the front door a minute later. I have already “locked” the garage door openers (there is a button that disables the remote) and every entrance to the house, but who says a person who breaks into a car won’t break into a house just because the garage door won’t open. My siblings are home and I have to leave for work within the hour, leaving 3 kids (highschool and younger) home for a while.

The work revolves around research, writing and publishing and I think it fits me well due to my qualifications and interests.

385,"So today I'm going to do some cleaning. Im changing a lot of things around after realizing last night that there's a lot that I don't like about who I am right now. Im not stunned by it to the point I can't take action to change it so...Im going to change it. 

Anyways. One of the main things Im cleaning is a closet and I dreamt about the closet being cleaned. I completely emptied the closet and  took down an old hanging rack. Once I took down the rack and could see the back of the closet for what feels like the first time, I realized there was a room Id never known about (the room doesnt exist in real life). 

I went into and it was very spacious, a little dusty and the only things that were in the room was a desk, a window and two pianos (one keyboard, one acoustic piano). 

When I walked over to the piano and I saw my reflection in a small mirror that was ontop if the brown aged a acoustic, I wasn't happy with what I saw. My face was oily, lines, I look tired, etc. Nevertheless I ignored it, looked away and I began to play. I hadn't played in years and though I hadn't, with occasional mistakes, I played beautifully. An old woman came and sat beside me and began to help me improve and teach me more on-top of what I had already known. 

It was then that I noticed that I became a small boy again. about 7-10. I'd come to learn more everyday after school and the teacher taught me of happiness, joy and perspective in addition to new piano skills. 

I was so overwhelmed with the impact she was making on me and then realized that one day this old woman will pass away and I won't have her joy and lessons around anymore. I leaned over on her arm and began to cry so hard. 

She asked me: ""Why are you crying?"" 

""Because I know someday you'll die and I don't want you to go."" 

She spoke on it and somehow sounded so at peace with the concept. 

The dream changed...

Though the dream changed and I was a young(er) man now, maybe 18/19. Id still come back to that room to play the piano beautifully. The woman was gone now but I hadn't forgotten all that she taught me. The sun crept in through the windows and hit the imperfect wooden floors, birds chirped outside, the music of the piano carried through the atmosphere as if in perfect unison and tune with the peace all around me. Life was peaceful and I was peaceful. Then I woke up.

We had become close (or at least I thought we had) later on in the year and it started with her telling me all about this girl she liked and at some point she got her heart broken and to this day (I’d say 4 months later?) she still says things like “this song reminds me of her” bla bla. Anyways I’d tell her about my problems too, and my problems were starting to involve my other friends (lack of support, feeling excluded, etc.). The thing is, I rly thought she didn’t mind, because we had a whole conversation about how we appreciated having each other for support. But yesterday, I learned from another friend (the first one) that she had mentioned she was tired of hearing about my problems. At this point I felt both stupid and betrayed. I felt betrayed because apparently she had said this a while ago, yet she’s been talking time like absolutely nothing is wrong, telling me how she misses me and wants to see me and stuff. She’s know to have a fake personality, and I feel stupid for actually giving her a chance and believing it.

Another friend and I brought her up and this whole thing came on the subject. He said that if I want to talk about my problems I should go see a psychologist. I was surprised by his answer because I thought that friends were for lending support. 

So is he right? Are friends not supposed to listen to your problems? I’m just confused because I feel like I would do exactly that for my friends, even those three I’ve talked about even though they hurt me, and let’s say I got tired of hearing about a specific problem I’d at least lend support or try to politely tell them that it’s taking a toll on me, not pretend that everything is fine.

Tl:dr: I’ve been going to a friend for support but I learned for another friend that she’s actually tired of hearing about my problems. I’m very surprised because we’ve had multiple conversations abt being there for each other and I even apologize for bothering her sometimes and she acts like everything’s okay. Two other friends agree (I’d like to specify I’ve recently had beef with all three and learned this after) that I should go to a psychologist, but I already do that and I talk about whole different issues with her.",03Aug2019,3

396,"I wasn't sure where to post this. This is a long story and I never
really thought I'd want to be back here again, but it never hurts to
ask. At 18, I started at a highly acclaimed school with the intention
to go down the CS/Comp Engineering path. It was a bit of a shock to me
in that I actually had to study for classes and be on top of my own
shit. Looking back, I also realized I struggle(d) with anxiety and
depression. After years and years of being off and on academic
probation, not making the required GPA for engineering, I settled for
CS. That too posed it's struggles, but I continued taking course work,
generally doing OK with most CS classes, but occasionally not doing
well in math or electives that I was either too stubborn to drop or
too anxious to attend if the class required public speaking or class
participation. After 7 years of on/off school, I eventually just went
full time at my part time job and never really went back to school. I
was relieved by the lack of stress in my life, no deadlines, homework,
studying. I also never really told anyone I quit. Everyone assumed I
graduated and that's that. Anyway, I'm now at a crossroads in my life
where I am starting to wonder if I kinda NEED to go back, for me. Not
for a better job, but for closure. And by ""go back"" I don't mean the
same school. Maybe something online, if possible. And here is the crux
of my long ass post: how much of roughly 3/4 of a CS curriculum would
transfer to any type of online university? Am I out of luck and I may
as well just start a new curriculum in basket weaving? Do credits even
transfer in that type of situation?

Unfortunately, I ended up realizing that they were toxic to my mental health and self esteem so I decided to stop talking to them.

For example, while I see my acquaintances on snapchat going out to the bars and having fun, I'm at home. Therefore, I decided to take a stand and try to turn my life around. Recently, I reached out to a couple acquaintances and asked to hang out, I had lunch with one the other day and another we got ice cream with her other friends yesterday evening. I'm going to ask a bit more come Monday if they would like to hang out and I'm thinking of getting together some acquaintances that know each other to go out to the bar.

I’m going into my freshman year of high school, and have been doing band for as long as I can remember. Marching band, jazz band, concert band, private lessons, etc. This summer I tried acting for the first time in my whole life and absolutely loved it. It was at a camp in the town next to mine, and I made a bunch of really good friends in said town, as well as already having some before the camp.

Anyways, my town is not known for acting. It has a really good music program. However, things are taking a turn for the worse and there are budget cuts negatively affecting the program. I’ve been going to school in this town for basically my whole life.

The town I went to camp in is known for having an INCREDIBLE acting program, with a worse band program. I really like the people there and the school system is great.

My parents are giving me the option to move to this town, and go through all of high school there. As a person I'm naturally indecisive, but with this I’m also super torn because I’d be leaving my friends in my current town, but also I’ve become really good friends with kids in the other town. I’d also be leaving behind jazz band and marching band, two big parts of my childhood to try out acting, something I’ve only done once.

I have 5-6ish days to decide and while I really want to say “Screw it” and move I keep stopping myself. I’d really appreciate some advice swaying me one way or another.

TL;DR I have the option to try something nearly completely new to me, which if I say yes, will have me move to a new town and a new school. I would leave behind friends and band, something I’ve done my entire childhood, but I have really good friends in this new town.

399,"I accepted a job offer at a tiny office (the owner and one other office person) for a position about two months ago. The owner said they were looking to expand but needed an additional person to allow the existing office person to focus on marketing. The job offer specified hours that covered keeping the business open over the lunch hour and approximated 15 hours over three days; the owner said “I need to make sure I can afford you so it may not be exactly fifteen hours a week”. The last paycheck I received had 35 hours while previous weeks had closer to 25; every week the owner would either ask me to come in late or leave early at least once. I had already started putting in applications elsewhere but the owner also made a few comments here and there about how they didn’t technically have the business to pay for me yet. I was under the impression they knew it would take more than a couple of weeks to gain momentum with advertising and didn’t think much of it... until I got the check with the extra day on it. The owner had the other office person (not my manager) text me asking me to come in late on Monday. When I asked the owner to call me, they waited until 15 minutes past close to call and it was again not the owner. I was told the owner was too busy to call but that I should come in late and talk to the owner then. I feel it’s obvious the owner plans to fire me considering the extra day on my paycheck; paying me to come in just so they can send me home.

404,"Hi! 

This is my story about one of my girlfriends. We've known each other for 4-5 years now and been friend since last year. The main catalyst was our gr9 teacher who arrange our seats next to each other and being the only person we know in our gr10 class. We laughed a lot, we share secrets, we flirt as well as all the up-all-night calls, we even commited to an anime show together.

However I managed to screw up our friendship a little while ago, I've also thought it was my fault. But the thing is, she never told me why she was mad. Funny how soon afterwards she'll invite our friend group to hang out even though it's going to be awkward for me, not for her. I once told her that if we split up, she'd get custody of the whole group and I guess that was her way to revenge and make me uncomfortable. We soon made things up afterwards but the experience while hanging out with the group was hell to me, I was a total outsider because she wouldn't talk to me, everyone focus on her, and everytime I tried to start off a topic, she'll shut it down. I admit I am a horrible friend, I forgot to wish her happy birthday (I rarely done that before, not even with my closest girl and we're totally cool about that), she told me she wanted a surprise so I tried my best, however it was a total failure but I hoped she'd appreciate it but she didn't, calling my gift ""a waste of money"" and compare me to her other girl, I replied her late (which I didn't think it was a big deal because I'd be cool with that), but she cussed the hell out of me (calling me stupid which I take that word seriously) and when I sincerely apologized, she told me I was no longer important to her. After that I tried my best to reply her instantly, never let she ended the chat first, my heart dropped when she texted me because I was scared of talking to her.

All that was a while ago, we back to our honeymoon phase and slowly regenerate our friendship, I was hopeful about that until a few days ago, she stopped texting me, replying my message coldly, and today when I get a chance to see her on the game we're playing together and she asked me ""Did you know I hated you?"" I was all confused so I asked, she only replied ""well now you know it then"". We had a great night call the night before things turned out, I have no idea why she gotten mad again. 

The thing is, I feel unfair. She never treated other friends like that. Our friend group aren't really into group chat (we're more into group call actually) and we're all slow replier or even seener, but she never cussed the hell out of them like she did with me. When I planned her surprise, I did that with my other friend and we invested equals part of money as well as our love for her, but she only told me I wasted my money and compared me, not our other friend. She only gave hell to me, never to all the other friends. She once told me she liked the idea of manipulating adn I should've seen it as a red flag. The thing is if I give her up, I'd give up the whole group, which would kill me if I had to because I love them too much. 

I still have faith in our friendship and I believe this is just a phase, I just need advice on how I should talk her out of this. Thank you all for reading through all my vent.",03Aug2019,1

407,"Hi! First, I think I am just overthinking but I just have to ask. This will be a bit long and I appreciate your patience in advance.

So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years now. It’s a very smooth relationship and all is going well. I think it’s important to say that this is a LDR.

So the problem is, I think this is just probably due to my attachment and trust issues with people. Lol. I am not happy nor proud of them. Anyway, my boyfriend has an ex girlfriend who died 7 years ago. They grew up together. Practically, they are best friends. Played together and did things together while growing up.

It’s just that I am not really into gaming and I am thinking that maybe he is just introducing gaming to me because he wants us to have a bond through it but well, the girl was a gamer. That’s why they were very close.

Also, there will be times wherein I would mention something or would do something and it would remind her of him. He’d tell me that she used to say this too or that.

I don’t know. I don’t think it’s right to compete with a dead person but I cannot help what I feel. 

I have this feeling that maybe he is trying to “recreate” his ex in me, if that is even the appropriate word to use. I might be wrong though.

Especially that there are occurences in his life right now that is brought by that event. 

Do you think it is okay for me to ask him regarding this? Also, I am not the confrontational type. I don’t know how to openly communicate my feelings regarding this. 

And again, I am sometimes dismissing this, thinking it is very petty and I might just be overreacting but I cannot sleep at night sometimes thinking about this.

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you. 😭😭❤️",03Aug2019,1

lately i’ve been having a lot of things in my head, but there’s something that is making my will to stay at home forever worse: one my friends is in love with me and i don’t know how to deal with it. ok, this has happened before, but with other types of people: friends who were more mature and their feelings were just “attraction”, you know? but this friend of mine feels something so honest and so pure that i don’t know how to pull him away without hurting him. also, i don’t wanna give him hopes, because i don’t feel the same way about him and that’s something that won’t change, since he’s like a younger brother for me. also, i’m still discovering my sexuality and stuff so i’m not open for relationships with anyone. i believe that if things are meant to happen, they happen. and i don’t feel anything for him so it’s not meant to, and it would be ruining our friendship for such a dumb thing and it may also ruin the environment in the rock band we have with our friends.

sometimes he bothers me but i’m too shy to tell him and too afraid to hurt him. he hugs me, holds my hand and stuff and even if i run away he does it again and i feel really bad because i don’t like people touching me, at all. i feel really uncomfortable and just want to run away. also, he keeps sending texts even when i’m busy and he’s pretty insistent without even noticing. he has really low self-esteem and that’s one more reason to be afraid of handling this.

422,"So, I am working on this project, which requires us to film a video. Lo and behold, I got 3 of the most useless and inefficient classmates (I shall call them A, B , and C) in my team. I basically have to carry. So, we have heavy shoot equipments from school and we are responsible for those equipment for 3 days. Basically, we have to bring them home and bring them back at scheduled timings.

So, when we collected the equipment, I carried the camera (which was the bulkiest and heaviest one) home. A took home the 2nd heaviest one which was the tripod and B took home the other camera, which was significantly smaller than what I carried home. C only took home the microphone which was about the size of a small box, because she had a party to go to after. And, we decided that we would take turns to carry the heavy equipment. So, I and A will bring the heavy equipment home and to shoot, and B and C will bring the heavy equipment from the shoot, back home and back to school.

So, that was decided and after shoot, C had to carry the heavy camera home and back to school on Monday (scheduled return date). And guess what she texted the group. She had the NERVE and AUDACITY to text the following: ""R you willing to split my cab fare cuz i live far away and i have presentation on monday at 8am sharp."" This girl is always late and in fact she was late to our shoot. Now, all of a sudden, she is concerned about being late? And how much time will carrying a camera take? And the crazy thing is A and C agreed to split the cab fare. So, I texted back ""If you leave your house earlier you should be fine"". She literally has to leave her house 15 minutes earlier, and she could not have to pay for her cab fare.

Then she fired back at me with ""A and B agreed to split. Why r u the only one that doesnt agree? If so, u should have taken it home since you live way nearer to school and u don't have a presentation Monday morning at 8AM"" Yes I do live a little closer, and no I do not have a presentation Monday morning, but thats not the point because we already decided on the first day, that you would bring the heavy equipment after shoot?

428,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is also extremely long, I would appreciate it if you read all of it. I'll try make it as concise as possible. I know this is fucked up. I just want help on what to do in this situation. 

A few years ago I began working and I instantly became good friends with two brothers who I will name John and Grayson. I was equally close to them both, and it was platonic since I had a boyfriend at the time. We broke up a few months later and I was getting closer to John, and we eventually started a ""thing"", I don't know what to call it,  we never labelled it and we weren't exclusive - people just knew we were ""seeing"" each other. We had talked about it and he never pressured me to label it and we both agreed to just not care about a label. Because of our new relationship, Grayson became quite distant to which I confronted him one day and he confessed he had fallen in love with me. I was shocked at this, and genuinely had no idea, I guess I was oblivious, but I really didn't know about his feelings for me. He explained why he was being distant. We went out for lunch the next day and talked it out and agreed to not let it get between us.

Over the next few months, I was still seeing John and still good friends with Grayson. I realised I was gaining feelings for Grayson but I didn't think it was that serious so I didn't distance myself, or tell anyone. One night I was out late with Grayson after seeing a movie and we were in his car, just talking and enjoying each others company, and... we kissed. He made the first move, but I'm still at fault because I didn't stop it. It was only until I realised what was happening that I stopped and made him drive me home. I didn't tell John and I didn't speak to Grayson for at least a week. We met up later that week to talk about it, and to decide what to do - to tell John, to keep it a secret, to never speak of it again, if we had to stop being friends etc. I honestly don't remember what we decided, but it doesn't matter, because we ended up making out again. It led to.. more. It happened in his car, not far from my house (at night), after it happened I got out and ran home. I didn't speak to him or John for days, until I finally broke it off with John. I didn't tell him what happened, which I know wasn't fair. I told him that I lost feelings for him and fell for Grayson. He told me he loved me.  


Stupidly, Grayson and I became friends with benefits for a few months until we decided it was way too awkward and was putting too much of a strain on our friendship, and obviously his relationship with his brother. I decided to cut all contact with him, besides seeing him at work. I also saw John at work frequently, and at meet ups etc., as we shared the same friend group outside of work. I stopped going to them because I knew how unfair it was for him to see me almost weekly. He hated me because he assumed the worst, and rightfully so. One night, he drunk texted me asking if I cheated on him and I denied it. He forgave me (although he didn't know about the cheating, he forgave me for falling for his brother? I guess, I don't quite remember) and we became friends again. Grayson and I never became friends again, and we only talked to each other at work, if it was necessary. However, this time we both agreed not to mention the cheating to anyone. So I never did.   


Things were fine for a while, and I had gotten a new boyfriend. Through this, I was still good friends with John however we did argue quite a lot about petty things, we are both stubborn and just overall had a lot of communication issues. I'd always be the one to apologise even if it wasn't my fault and I'd always try to get him to communicate what ever issues he had with me, I encouraged it so I could work on it. However, whenever I would point out something he'd always reply ""why are you friends with me then"", and not in a sad, self-pity kind of way. Anyways, my boyfriend and I broke up and a few months later, John and I became friends with benefits, we knew it was a stupid idea but we made it clear that no feelings were to be involved and it was strictly physical, which lasted a few months. We stopped being physical because we realised it was slowly taking over the friendship and we didn't want that. 

One day I went to his house to hang out and we were in his bed watching a movie (he was sitting against the headboard and me in between his legs), he was massaging me and cuddling me and to be honest I didn't think anything of it because cuddling wasn't a foreign thing to us. It wasn't until I felt his hard on that I felt a bit weird, but I didn't mention anything. He started kissing my neck and feeling me up and that's when I told him to stop. But I'm not a confrontational person, so I had a bit of laughter in my voice because I was pretty confused as to why he was doing that. He didn't stop, so I moved to lay down to which he followed and was kind of hovering over me, kissing my neck and trying to lift up my shirt. This time I asked what he was doing, but there was still no seriousness in my voice because I didn't really know what was happening and thought he was just joking around. It wasn't until he was fully on top of me and grinding into me that I knew what he was trying to do. I tried pushing him off, and I was telling him to stop but, again it wasn't fierce and demanding, I didn't yell at him to stop, I didn't do anything except NOT reciprocate, he was trying to kiss me and I wouldn't kiss back, he kept trying to pull up my shirt and take off my bra and I was trying to swat his hands away, but he is a lot stronger than I am and used that advantage against me. At this point, I was scared. I didn't know who this person was anymore, he wasn't listening to me - regardless of if I was being ""serious"" or not, I was still telling him to stop and my body language indicated that I was definitely not into it. He kept saying ""come on, no one is home"", ""don't you miss this"", ""you're making this hard to enjoy"". I finally gave in, because I knew he wouldn't stop and I thought the only way he would stop was to comply and do what he wanted. 

I felt disgusting after. He got off me and just... fell asleep. I took this opportunity to just get out as fast as I could. I drove home and later messaged him that night telling him how I felt and that I didn't enjoy anything that happened and that I tried my best to stop it. In all honesty, I froze. I still look back now and realise that I didn't push as hard as I could've and I didn't fight him as hard as I could've and I hate myself for it. After telling him, he blocked me on everything and didn't speak to me for weeks, until one day at work he asked me if we could talk and I said no. He unblocked me and messaged me later that day essentially demanding that we need to talk and that he will be over in 30 mins. I said no again and I ended up blocking him so I could process everything and decide if I should talk to him. We ended up meeting up to talk and he barely spoke. I poured out my heart and was crying and telling him that he destroyed me. By doing what he did and then just blocking me when I told him I didn't enjoy/like what happened. I later found out it was because he was ashamed and felt like a monster, and after a few weeks of talking it out over text (I didn't want to see him in person), I forgave him. The deciding factor in forgiving him was because I cheated on him all those years ago, and I felt like it was the karma that I deserved. I still hadn't told him.   


I told my closest friend, who is in the friend group we share, about what happened and that's all. People noticed that John and I weren't talking to each other at group meetings but neither of us would say anything about what happened, however some people knew that we did have a pretty on an off friendship due to our amount of arguing. We slowly became friends again, however we still argued frequently, this time about the sexual assault and his failure to understand that I didn't trust him and didn't want to get too close to him yet. He would constantly question it and kept saying that if I didn't trust him why am I friend's with him. I would always tell him that I wasn't 100% ready to just go back to normal but that I was trying and needed time. I assumed he would respect my request, but instead always got mad and impatient. It slowly drove me crazy, but I kept telling myself that I owed it to him to just endure it. I genuinely did like being friends with him because when it was good, it was good. We had so many interests in common and would never have a boring conversation. He is one of the only people who know a lot of my personal issues and one of the few that I trusted with almost everything.

A few weeks ago, he confronted me and asked if I cheated on him with Grayson. I denied it, like I always did. *I forgot to mention that John knew that we were friends with benefits and that we slept together after our ""fling"".* Anyways, he told me he had screenshots and I couldn't tell if he was bluffing or not but I knew I had been caught by the look on my face. He wasn't mad, just disappointed and upset because our whole friendship was ""based on a lie"", to which I said it wasn't but he replied with ""we wouldn't be friends if I knew back then what I know now"".  That hurt a lot, but I knew I deserved it and I knew he was probably right. He kept asking me variations of ""why"" and to this day, I still have no idea why I never just owned up to it, or why I did it in the first place. I couldn't answer his questions because I just don't know. I still feel so guilty and stupid. He's blocked me on everything and we haven't spoken since we last talked a couple weeks ago where he said he was going to stop asking me questions about it. I let it happen, because I just know there is no way to make up for it or to do anything to fix this. I did apologise multiple times and told him I was genuinely regretful and wished I could take it all back, but it was definitely not enough.

I do still care about him, but to be honest I don't think I want to be friends with him again, not that he would agree to being friends or even forgive me anyways. I do want to somehow make it up to him, or at least fix the tension we have. I want to do something. But to be honest, I don't know what to do right now.  In the back of my head I feel like this is some sort of relief. There's no more arguing, I'm not being driven insane by him, I feel like I can breathe a bit - I know our whole relationship was toxic. The friend I told the sexual assault about kept telling me to cut him off, and I'd always say I couldn't and when she'd ask why, I always made up excuses such as my attachment issues - which isn't exactly a lie. I haven't told anyone about the cheating and the only people who know are Grayson and John, I feel Grayson may have told some people and that's where the screenshots came from but I still don't know if he was bluffing because I didn't ask about it. This whole situation is eating me alive and is actually really bad my mental health as I keep having waves of depression and constant anxiety attacks (not trying to make this a pity party).

I know that I'm a bad person and I truly want to be better. I want this to go away, I don't want to think about it anymore, I don't want anything to do with this, I feel like I deserve to feel this way and that I don't deserve to be forgiven. But I do want to forget about all of this, I can't /not/ think about it, I feel constantly feel horrible and I want to talk to him, but at the same time I don't. I'm just so empty-feeling and I really don't know what to do, I'm driving myself insane.  I'm at a complete loss, and if you've read this far I am so appreciative. Thank you.

430,"So my parents developed some land into three town houses, one for us to live in and the other two to rent out. Since our land is next to a university most people interested are students, and the whole two rented out houses are filled with people studying at the uni. Except for one woman. A middle aged nurse not working anywhere particularly close by. My parents thought it odd that she would want to live here but thought a woman her age would be reliable with rent and cleanliness. So what was interesting is that this nurse began to pay us rent, however had not moved in yet. My mum offered to ask if the nurse needed any help moving in, however the lady quickly brushed over the answer and then changed the topic but saying she had just covered her current rent. It has been around 5 months now and this lady has not shown up yet continues to pay rent. I feel that something very suspicious is going on, but when I bring it up with my parents they say that as long as she’s paying it doesn’t matter.

I have botox, fillers, eyelash extensions, nail extensions, dyed hair, tattoos all over me, tan every week. Anything just to cover up or distract from what I really look like. 

It's stupid because I get complimented on my looks all the time but i really don't see it. I see this hideous, aging, saggy embarrassment of a woman. I normally assume people just feel sorry for me if they say that I'm pretty or beautiful or whatever.

I compare myself to everyone and I'm hyper sensitive to the smallest of criticisms. I cry all the fucking time, like a stupid child. 

I'm pretty sure I have some form of body dismorphia. I used to be big. Like really big. I was like 225lbs, now I'm about 155lbs. But looking in the mirror I see no difference, I'm still a complete landwhale but only now I just sag more.

Don't even get me started on my personality. Like I sometimes question if people sometimes think I have some kind of mental retardation. Sometimes I'm so slow, so so slow that if someone is talking to me it takes me a few minutes to process a sentence and respond. Most of the time I just don't respond to things and people say that I'm quiet or shy or they think I can't hear very well or I'm just being a rude bitch and ignoring them but in reality it's my brain not working like other normal human beings.

Right now, I’m pursuing a fall position either full time or internship, and I’m not working right now, so I’m terribly blue and miserable about the wait. Like to the point where I just want to sleep away all my day and not do anything. Career is my focus in life and I’m taking the setback of not having a job real hard. It is also a career transition for me, so I’m lacking experience but generally full of bubbly eagerness. I love the construction work, but I have difficulty landing the field position I want.

Some people have difficulty changing, I am too bold and finicky.

438,"I've had a lot of really low moments in my life, like big events that triggered huge bouts of depression. On a good day, I would casually not mind dying, on a bad day I'd actively wish I was dead. I ended up kind of using someone as a reason to be happy (I never told him about my depression/ never appeared depressed) but when that person ine inevitably left my life, it was like I had nothing to look forward to? It also made me realize how every single time I start to like a person, they always leave (if they're just friends) or choose someone else (as this person did). It makes me feel unlovable.

 I'm told that I'm attractive and have a lot going for me, but I can't seem to form any meaningful connections with anyone. I don't have anyone I know I can call any time I need them. 

More recently though, I've somehow been able to manage my depression, but I'm not sure how. Every time I feel like I'm slipping into it, I think about something good that has happened and try to hold on to it and it kinda evens itself out in that moment? I'm not sure how to explain it, but it has been for the last month or so my brain started working this way, which is completely different from the last 5 years.

446,"I graduated college a little over a year ago and started working in the accounting department of a large company right after college. For context, the department is \~40 people with most people being A/R or A/P clerks, then there are a few entry level portfolio analysts like myself who do work that is both IT and accounting-based.

My cubicle is stationed around 4 others, so there are 5 people in my immediate area - 2 of these people are higher up in the company, at a level that is above entry level but below management (but they work for closely with management). One of these people, we'll call them Jan, has a very important role with managing the IT side of our accounting system. She's trained many employees in the department, including me, and is best friends with the other higher-up in our area.

Jan has been acting very strange lately: taking a lot of sick time, started bringing in her nintendo switch so she can play it in her car for an hour on lunch breaks, and the other day randomly sat down at a table with myself and 2 coworkers in the break room during lunch without saying a word - only playing her switch and not joining our conversation. She's become extremely moody, which isn't ideal considering my job requires me to work alongside her very frequently. A few times this past week, I've asked her questions and she became vehemently angry about it, which has made me start to second-guess whether I should go to her with questions in the future (she's been behaving like this with a couple other coworkers as well, but only people who are entry level like me).

The other day, I'm training a new hire and showing him how to generate reports. The reports can take up to 5 minutes to load, so while it's loading we casually chat with another employee in our area about the route we take home (very exciting conversation topic, I know). This conversation probably lasts about 2 minutes, before Jan suddenly interrupts us and tells us in a weird, awkward tone that it is not break time and to please continue our conversation then. She didn't make eye contact, and her voice mimicked that of an answering machine. If we were being loud, I'd fully expect her to tell us to keep it down as to not be distracting, but the way she said it was extremely cringey and passive aggressive.

It's important to mention that our HR is as strict as it gets, layered with enough bureaucratic red tape to barricade a building. People in my company have been fired for the smallest of reasons, so it's concerning me that I'm suddenly not getting along with a co-worker who's well-respected by management.

My job performance has been excellent, but I inherited a very problematic portfolio when I started (the last guy who had my job got fired after messing up and costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars). I've turned it completely around and put it in incredible shape - this has earned me massive respect from management, but it's also made me easily replaceable, since a new hire could feasibly take over my portfolio now without getting bogged down by the long-term issues that had taken me several months to fix.

Should I be concerned about my co-worker's sudden shift in attitude, or try to get out ahead of it? I'd rather not take this situation to management or HR, but I don't know how much worse it will get, and I feel like if she takes that step against me I'd have to take on a massive uphill battle to defend myself from potential termination.",03Aug2019,1

451,"This is a bit of a read, and I apologize, but I appreciate any advice.

**Relevant information**: I work at a hotel. I’ve been apart of this establishment for a couple weeks short of a year. When I started here, we had a different general manager then we do now. The old one left a few months ago, and the new one (let’s call him Boss) started a couple of months ago. 

Boss is an older man, and he actually worked at the hotel back when it first opened years and years ago, and came back to take the open position for general manager. Upon arrival, he was disappointed by the state of the hotel (it’s not near as glamorous as it used to be- very dated) and has been in a mood ever since. He’s constantly complaining about how the hotel isn’t what it used to be, and that the employees are “in the younger generation and don’t know how to do anything right”. As far as I’m aware, he has made little to no effort to improve anything.

I have been working hard towards a promotion for the past several months. The old manager was skeptical about promoting me because of my age. I put in a lot of hours in this job, and I don’t believe my age should hold me back if I know the job and do it well, My supervisors are also supportive in this promotion (both older women). I decided that it was worth a shot to try and negotiate a promotion with Boss, so I scheduled to speak to him in his office. After speaking with him, he stated that he saw no reason why I’m not fit for the job, but he wanted to meet with my supervisors to discuss it before proceeding. He said, word for word, “You have my word, you will have an answer by this time next week”. 

A week passed, and I didn’t hear a single word from him in any form. I ran into him a week from our meeting, and I confronted him, just asking if he had gotten a chance to speak to my supervisors. The conversation went as follows:

Me: “Hey, Boss, have you gotten a chance to speak with ____ and ____ yet?” 

Boss: “No.”

Me: “Okay, do you happen to know when a good time might be, by chance?” 

Boss: “No.” 

Me: “Okay, I just wanted to check in with you since you had given me your word and I hadn’t heard from you.”

Boss: “Well, my word is going to have to fucking change, I’ve got other shit to worry about” (visibly getting irritated)

Me: “I understand that you’re kept busy, but if I’m honest, I don’t appreciate the lack of communication from you.” 

Boss: *Looks at me, slams what he’s holding on the table in between us, and storms out of the room* 

Boss was not spoken to me since, nor have I seen him around the hotel. It has now been 3 weeks since our meeting in his office. I have heard other staff members complaining about him as well, and there have been a couple of incidents within the staff and guests that he handled unprofessionally. Other staff members have left due to this new management.

I love my job, and as much as I would like not to leave (pays decently, gets me through college), I am actively looking for other opportunities. I would like to reach out to someone above Boss, and explain the situation. I know that my words could mean nothing, or they could provoke action. I think it’s worth a shot.

456,"Hi guys! So as stated, my relationship with my twin sister isn't the best and I want to work on it.
We are both in our early 20's but she has moved out already and lives 30 minutes away with her boyfriend. The last few days I've been feeling very frustrated because I asked her to come on a short trip with me a week ago, and she said she wanted to but then changed her mind and is now doing the same trip but with her boyfriend. She asked me if it was okay and I wanted to lash out at her and say I'm used to her doing stuff I proposed, but with someone else (I'll explain later). But I didn't want to fight and I also felt like I couldn't withhold her from her only vacation with her boyfriend so I told her it was fine and that I would not come.
So this has been happening more. A while ago we booked tickets for a concert together and she was going to give me the money, but then changed her mind and told me she didn't want to go. I had to find another friend to come. At the day of the concert she told me she was going to come but with a friend and she had seats all the way at another side of the concert hall.
So where did our relationship go wrong? For me a lot of frustration started when we were in high school. I was someone who would always defend her, no matter what. Often when she would have a fight with someone or when she wasn't being treated right, I would argue with the person. She on the other hand would never return the favor. I was being picked on a lot by some people in my class and she befriended all of them. As you can guess, this made me a bit resentful.
I'm not going to write down our entire history but basically I would choose her and defend her over and over and never ever has she chosen me. Over the years I've grown bitter towards her and I would be short when she said something or give sarcastic remarks. This in turn has made he rnot like me and thus doing stuff like going to a concert with a friend instead of me. I fully accept the blame on my part, but I wanted to let you guys know where it comes from.
I pass her house twice a week, and she never asks me of I could swing by. Sometimes I do and then we hangout and all is fine. She just never does a proposal. I would love it if one day she would ask me (and not me and my family, but just me alone) to go do something together but I just don't see it happening right now.

How would you guys start mending this relationship?",03Aug2019,1
457,"Hi all,

&gt;It really hurts. It hurts so much. It's unfair.

A person hired me for couple gigs in Shopify + Other Web Development tasks, It's been a month now and he doesn't want to pay me, he doesn't even respond to my messages. I owe him 690$. He compromised my need for a Job and money.

All I got from him is 180$ the first day. He told his friend to paid me using his paypal  (his friend's paypal). This friend doesn't respond to any of my messages (He runs a web dev agency In US).

He told me that the one who paid me is his partner.

I was super nice with him. He was lying to me all the time about offering me a job. When I told him about money he told me that his partner is not gonna issue any payments until the work is finished. and he always say ""I did pay you in the start, So you will be payed and work with us"".

I have his friend's paypal email, can I fill a complaint against him (Knowing I'm not a US resident). 

I contacted the Shop owner in Shopify, but He told me ""I can't promise you anything"".

I have couple of his/Scammer pictures and his friend's too. I want to create a website for him So anyone googling his name will find the website (I'm good with SEO so I can rank it high enough).

I don't want him to scam any other person. I found lately a Negative testimonial about him (With his name), he scammed a lot of people.

Is this a good idea?

During school I will be going from 11 to 1 on t and th to class. My boss had discussed how she wanted me to go in from 8:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday and Thursday and from there go to school. The thing is I don't drive. My mom does. But I wanted to ask my boss if I could go in on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and extend my hours those days. I only get paid 7.25 an hr working at an income tax place. And my trainer was telling me that maybe they will be closing on Fridays since there is not much work. Would it be okay for me to discuss with my boss to go in only those days. My mom can't be driving me back and forth both those days. I will get a raise probably until my 3rd month but I don't even know if I will get one since my boss has the mentality that I will only be working until I graduate there which is until next year of may. UPDATE: I kind of said that I changed my schedule for school and can't go tuesday and Thursday and that if I can go on Monday Wednesday and Friday. My trainer said my boss'
 would work around it. And I think my boss is trying to convince me to stay. She was like whoever stays here with me will get a raise in February.

463," 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is also extremely long, I would appreciate it if you read all of it. I'll try make it as concise as possible. I know this is fucked up. I just want help on what to do in this situation.

A few years ago I began working and I instantly became good friends with two brothers who I will name John and Grayson. I was equally close to them both, and it was platonic since I had a boyfriend at the time. We broke up a few months later and I was getting closer to John, and we eventually started a ""thing"", I don't know what to call it, we never labelled it and we weren't exclusive - people just knew we were ""seeing"" each other. We had talked about it and he never pressured me to label it and we both agreed to just not care about a label. Because of our new relationship, Grayson became quite distant to which I confronted him one day and he confessed he had fallen in love with me. I was shocked at this, and genuinely had no idea, I guess I was oblivious, but I really didn't know about his feelings for me. He explained why he was being distant. We went out for lunch the next day and talked it out and agreed to not let it get between us.

Over the next few months, I was still seeing John and still good friends with Grayson. I realised I was gaining feelings for Grayson but I didn't think it was that serious so I didn't distance myself, or tell anyone. One night I was out late with Grayson after seeing a movie and we were in his car, just talking and enjoying each others company, and... we kissed. He made the first move, but I'm still at fault because I didn't stop it. It was only until I realised what was happening that I stopped and made him drive me home. I didn't tell John and I didn't speak to Grayson for at least a week. We met up later that week to talk about it, and to decide what to do - to tell John, to keep it a secret, to never speak of it again, if we had to stop being friends etc. I honestly don't remember what we decided, but it doesn't matter, because we ended up making out again. It led to.. more. It happened in his car, not far from my house (at night), after it happened I got out and ran home. I didn't speak to him or John for days, until I finally broke it off with John. I didn't tell him what happened, which I know wasn't fair. I told him that I lost feelings for him and fell for Grayson. He told me he loved me.

Stupidly, Grayson and I became friends with benefits for a few months until we decided it was way too awkward and was putting too much of a strain on our friendship, and obviously his relationship with his brother. I decided to cut all contact with him, besides seeing him at work. I also saw John at work frequently, and at meet ups etc., as we shared the same friend group outside of work. I stopped going to them because I knew how unfair it was for him to see me almost weekly. He hated me because he assumed the worst, and rightfully so. One night, he drunk texted me asking if I cheated on him and I denied it. He forgave me (although he didn't know about the cheating, he forgave me for falling for his brother? I guess, I don't quite remember) and we became friends again. Grayson and I never became friends again, and we only talked to each other at work, if it was necessary. However, this time we both agreed not to mention the cheating to anyone. So I never did.

Things were fine for a while, and I had gotten a new boyfriend. Through this, I was still good friends with John however we did argue quite a lot about petty things, we are both stubborn and just overall had a lot of communication issues. I'd always be the one to apologise even if it wasn't my fault and I'd always try to get him to communicate what ever issues he had with me, I encouraged it so I could work on it. However, whenever I would point out something he'd always reply ""why are you friends with me then"", and not in a sad, self-pity kind of way. Anyways, my boyfriend and I broke up and a few months later, John and I became friends with benefits, we knew it was a stupid idea but we made it clear that no feelings were to be involved and it was strictly physical, which lasted a few months. We stopped being physical because we realised it was slowly taking over the friendship and we didn't want that.

One day I went to his house to hang out and we were in his bed watching a movie (he was sitting against the headboard and me in between his legs), he was massaging me and cuddling me and to be honest I didn't think anything of it because cuddling wasn't a foreign thing to us. It wasn't until I felt his hard on that I felt a bit weird, but I didn't mention anything. He started kissing my neck and feeling me up and that's when I told him to stop. But I'm not a confrontational person, so I had a bit of laughter in my voice because I was pretty confused as to why he was doing that. He didn't stop, so I moved to lay down to which he followed and was kind of hovering over me, kissing my neck and trying to lift up my shirt. This time I asked what he was doing, but there was still no seriousness in my voice because I didn't really know what was happening and thought he was just joking around. It wasn't until he was fully on top of me and grinding into me that I knew what he was trying to do. I tried pushing him off, and I was telling him to stop but, again it wasn't fierce and demanding, I didn't yell at him to stop, I didn't do anything except NOT reciprocate, he was trying to kiss me and I wouldn't kiss back, he kept trying to pull up my shirt and take off my bra and I was trying to swat his hands away, but he is a lot stronger than I am and used that advantage against me. At this point, I was scared. I didn't know who this person was anymore, he wasn't listening to me - regardless of if I was being ""serious"" or not, I was still telling him to stop and my body language indicated that I was definitely not into it. He kept saying ""come on, no one is home"", ""don't you miss this"", ""you're making this hard to enjoy"". I finally gave in, because I knew he wouldn't stop and I thought the only way he would stop was to comply and do what he wanted.

I felt disgusting after. He got off me and just... fell asleep. I took this opportunity to just get out as fast as I could. I drove home and later messaged him that night telling him how I felt and that I didn't enjoy anything that happened and that I tried my best to stop it. In all honesty, I froze. I still look back now and realise that I didn't push as hard as I could've and I didn't fight him as hard as I could've and I hate myself for it. After telling him, he blocked me on everything and didn't speak to me for weeks, until one day at work he asked me if we could talk and I said no. He unblocked me and messaged me later that day essentially demanding that we need to talk and that he will be over in 30 mins. I said no again and I ended up blocking him so I could process everything and decide if I should talk to him. We ended up meeting up to talk and he barely spoke. I poured out my heart and was crying and telling him that he destroyed me. By doing what he did and then just blocking me when I told him I didn't enjoy/like what happened. I later found out it was because he was ashamed and felt like a monster, and after a few weeks of talking it out over text (I didn't want to see him in person), I forgave him. The deciding factor in forgiving him was because I cheated on him all those years ago, and I felt like it was the karma that I deserved. I still hadn't told him.

I told my closest friend, who is in the friend group we share, about what happened and that's all. People noticed that John and I weren't talking to each other at group meetings but neither of us would say anything about what happened, however some people knew that we did have a pretty on an off friendship due to our amount of arguing. We slowly became friends again, however we still argued frequently, this time about the sexual assault and his failure to understand that I didn't trust him and didn't want to get too close to him yet. He would constantly question it and kept saying that if I didn't trust him why am I friend's with him. I would always tell him that I wasn't 100% ready to just go back to normal but that I was trying and needed time. I assumed he would respect my request, but instead always got mad and impatient. It slowly drove me crazy, but I kept telling myself that I owed it to him to just endure it. I genuinely did like being friends with him because when it was good, it was good. We had so many interests in common and would never have a boring conversation. He is one of the only people who know a lot of my personal issues and one of the few that I trusted with almost everything.

A few weeks ago, he confronted me and asked if I cheated on him with Grayson. I denied it, like I always did. *I forgot to mention that John knew that we were friends with benefits and that we slept together after our ""fling"".* Anyways, he told me he had screenshots and I couldn't tell if he was bluffing or not but I knew I had been caught by the look on my face. He wasn't mad, just disappointed and upset because our whole friendship was ""based on a lie"", to which I said it wasn't but he replied with ""we wouldn't be friends if I knew back then what I know now"". That hurt a lot, but I knew I deserved it and I knew he was probably right. He kept asking me variations of ""why"" and to this day, I still have no idea why I never just owned up to it, or why I did it in the first place. I couldn't answer his questions because I just don't know. I still feel so guilty and stupid. He's blocked me on everything and we haven't spoken since we last talked a couple weeks ago where he said he was going to stop asking me questions about it. I let it happen, because I just know there is no way to make up for it or to do anything to fix this. I did apologise multiple times and told him I was genuinely regretful and wished I could take it all back, but it was definitely not enough.

I do still care about him, but to be honest I don't think I want to be friends with him again, not that he would agree to being friends or even forgive me anyways. I do want to somehow make it up to him, or at least fix the tension we have. I want to do something. But to be honest, I don't know what to do right now. In the back of my head I feel like this is some sort of relief. There's no more arguing, I'm not being driven insane by him, I feel like I can breathe a bit - I know our whole relationship was toxic. The friend I told the sexual assault about kept telling me to cut him off, and I'd always say I couldn't and when she'd ask why, I always made up excuses such as my attachment issues - which isn't exactly a lie. I haven't told anyone about the cheating and the only people who know are Grayson and John, I feel Grayson may have told some people and that's where the screenshots came from but I still don't know if he was bluffing because I didn't ask about it. This whole situation is eating me alive and is actually really bad my mental health as I keep having waves of depression and constant anxiety attacks (not trying to make this a pity party).

I know that I'm a bad person and I truly want to be better. I want this to go away, I don't want to think about it anymore, I don't want anything to do with this, I feel like I deserve to feel this way and that I don't deserve to be forgiven. But I do want to forget about all of this, I can't /not/ think about it, I feel constantly feel horrible and I want to talk to him, but at the same time I don't. I'm just so empty-feeling and I really don't know what to do, I'm driving myself insane. I'm at a complete loss, and if you've read this far I am so appreciative. Thank you. Please help me, what should I do? Should I try to contact him, or try to move on? If so, how? I don't even know what I'm seeking here, I'm sorry if I've wasted your time.",03Aug2019,1
464,"Before you start to comment on how I should not be doing it and posting helplines below, I just want to say that I have run through the mental gymnastics and I have a plethora of personal reasons why I would want to do so, that I do not wish to disclose, this isn't me being irrational or emotional, I have thought through this and I want to carry this out. 

I'm not exactly sure which subreddit I should be going to if this is the wrong one... but I am posting according to the advice rules so if I am breaking any I would appreciate it if you could point me the right way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the ways that are currently available to me:

1. Hanging: not sure whether I want to break my neck and leave my body for someone else to find. Due to my current situation I probably do not want to be found with a rotting body a month or a year from now, and probably causing unwanted trouble for others and family.
2. Sleeping pills and drowning in bathtub: Highly romanticized way to go, but I feel this is probably the most painless way there is at this point, but like the reason above, the water will probably accelerate the decay of my body and make it harder for others. 
3. 'Accidents': I am going to classify this as a highly selfish way to go, and would personally not want to impose on others or cause emotional trauma. 
4. Overdosing: There are some drugs that are available to me that can be overdosed on, but I think some of them provide... quite an exquisite experience to go. I would preferably want to go as painlessly (and not in an altered state of mind) as possible.

There are probably some other ways to go that would probably fit on this list, but these are the most common ones that I have managed to think of.

TLDR; I want to euthanize myself without feeling as much pain and not be troublesome to others after I go.",03Aug2019,1
465,"I’m a straight trans male and ever since I started testosterone, I’ve been able to be sexually interested in men as well. I was told beforehand that often times guys find their “sexuality changes” but I figured I would be the last one this would happen to as before I knew I was trans, and before I considered myself a lesbian, I had been with men enough to know that I wasn’t interested, even disgusted.

Now, really my problem is that I’m extremely horny all the time and as of lately have been having trouble finding women to engage with. This is what led me to seeking out men in the first place, as men are just easier to seek out for sex as a whole. I know that I am not gay, or even bisexual as I could never imagine myself with another guy romantically, I don’t like kissing or anything intimate with men, and I don’t even like sex with them 99.9% of the time, but I continue to do it because of the ease of access.

I have also become addicted to masturbation and porn, and I have started watching gay porn more often. I have had sex with many men so far, &amp; when I first started I got checked &amp; everything turned out fine. I usually try to play safe, but my hyper sexuality has led me to be unsafe more times than I’d like to admit. What scares me the most about this is, MSM have scary rates of HIV/AIDS and other STD’s and STD’s have got to be one of my biggest fears, specifically ones with no cure. Knowing this fact, in addition to the fact that I am in this situation solely for sexual gratification that I more often than not, do not get, I want to stop hooking up with guys and stop watching gay porn as well. I hear about “conversion therapy” and have always thought it to be a ridiculous notion, and though I know I am not actually gay, I want to know what methods are used for conversion, or if maybe I can rewire my brain to not get these urges/thoughts anymore? My problem would easily be solved if I had a girlfriend or even a girl friend with benefits as I wouldn’t even have reason to think about men, but that is easier said than done as I’m currently going through a dry spell with women.

466,"A few months ago, I was using Google for medical advice and I got some search results that were scary, and clickbait, however I clicked on those links because I wanted information. When I talked to my primary care physician about the information I find on there he said...

&gt; ""Dr. Google is a terrible doctor. He gives you misinformation and doesn't respect your privacy. It's best to talk to your doctor about any health or medical related issues.

At first, I thought that my doctor was just saying that to get me to visit him more often for money, however I realized that many websites spread misinformation about health and medicine in order to get clicks from Google search results. The problem now is that if I have a health related question, I would need to speak to a medical professional and that can be inconvenient. I would have to make an appointment and pay a copay to see a specialist or my PCP to answer my question. With that, I know that the information I am getting is accurate, but its a hassle.

Googling health related information is more convenient and costs less, but I don't know what I am getting is medically accurate. Also, some of the most clickbaity and scary results tend to be on the first page of a Google search result. So I need some advice.

467,"Throwaway. 

I was chilling with my friend last night when I got tired and asked to stay the night, since I didn't feel like driving home. She said okay and made up the couch for me, and she went to bed. 

At around 4 a.m., we both woke up to a few loud bangs and both the pets (my dog, her cat) scrambling around like they'd been spooked. I think we were both too out of it to make sense of what we heard. My dog comes over to the couch and lays down next to me, shaking like a leaf. My friend gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom. 

While she's on the way, i heard the noise again, sounds like someone tapping on the bedroom window with one knuckle. Rapping on it, I guess, not like they're trying to break something, like they want to be heard. I ask her, while she's in the bathroom, who the fuck is knocking on the window. She says no one's knocking on the window, it's just the neighbors lighting off fireworks. 

Didn't sound like fireworks to me at all, but i figured it was her neighborhood, she would know what was normal around here, plus I was still half asleep and didn't really trust my perception of the sound. 

Then there's knocking at the door. 

She comes out of the bedroom and looks at me, terrified. Before we can say anything to each other, the knocking becomes pounding. Hard. 

She's topless at this point, so she goes to the bathroom to grab a bathrobe. She comes back and unlocks the door and opens it. 

No one's there, she says. She steps out onto the porch and looks both ways. They're gone. She comes back inside and starts saying something about how she can hear the neighbors around the corner talking, maybe they needed something. 

Then there's the pounding at the door again. Louder than it had been before. Like it sounded like someone was fucking up their hand, it was such hard pounding. I thought they were gonna break the glass window on the door. 

She opens the door, this time not looking through the curtain first to see who it was — a mistake. 

This part all happened really fast. She opens the door a crack, i'm watching from the living room. The door pushes open from the outside before she can react, not all the way but more than the crack that she opened. 

In a horrible voice that I've never heard anyone make before she kinda says ""who the fuck are you?"" and pushes her full weight into the door quickly, somehow shutting it and locking it. She practically leaps over to the couch where i am, she's shaking like crazy, and she goes ""holy shit someone's trying to get in."" 

We sat there in silence and lit a cigarette. after a few seconds, i sneak to the spare room to grab the hammer i had used earlier in the day while hanging up a picture frame for her. we just sat there, waiting for whatever came next. 

After a few minutes with no more noise, I guess we start to feel like the guy left. She tole me roughly what the guy looked like — about her height (maybe 5'5""), long dark ""wet"" hair, maybe mid 40s, white, not particularly muscular. She goes ""I'm going to see that face every night now,"" idk what she meant exactly. 

We talked about if we should call the cops, but by the time we got our bearings, we realized he was gone and that the cops wouldn't be able to do anything. We both had work the next morning — it's about 4:30 by now — and we didn't want to spend the next 2 hours giving statements to the police. 

She goes back to bed and I stay on the couch. Idk about her (we haven't spoken since then, she was still sleeping when i left for work) but I didn't fucking fall asleep again. I didn't hear any more noises either. 

Then when I went to leave this morning, I realize that someone had been in my car. my ash tray is on the floor, all the cigarette butts have been dumped out on the seat, on the floor, and into a cup holder. A bag of trash from Taco Bell earlier that night is ripped open and the contents all around the car. My rearview mirror is totally askew. My center console has clearly been ransacked, but the bag of quarters that's in there — probably more than $10 worth — is still right there. He didn't want money. 

Idk what we're gonna do. There's not really any legal recourse as far as I can tell since nothing was stolen or broken and even if it was we have no way to ID the guy. We live in a city that has maybe one homicide a year, vitrually no violent crime to speak of and home invasions are unheard of. I left my car unlocked in the driveway, like I often do, because this sort of thing just doesn't fucking happen. 

And like, what's she supposed to do? she's a young woman living there alone, and now she's just supposed to sleep there every night? Why wouldn't he come back? Why would she ever feel safe there again? 

Why would you announce your presence like that by banging on the windows and door? Why would you pick a random house at 4 a.m. to enter, but only try to enter after you **know** that there's someone in there? What did he want if he wasn't interested in the money that he clearly saw? Why just make a mess in the car for no fucking reason? 

It seemed like something out of a horror movie. If i'm this fucked up about it, I can only imagine how she feels. What should I do? What should she do?",03Aug2019,6

•I went to the hearing doctor and they told me my hearing is good but I had to guess the words based on how it sounded even though I couldn’t hear the word in my brain

•I have a hard time remembering stuff.For example in fight scenes that are decent paced or when hearing a video discussing an important event,I forgot the words said as new words are said after each sentence 

•I can’t sound out every word I hear through my brain most of the time and have to force myself but it’s still hard but not that bad

•I can’t focus or keep up with stuff I see.When I watch fight animations the animations are 2 fast so I can analyze every action.I daydream in the middle of the screen making it appear blurry like my peripheral vision or basically ignoring the animations.I also don’t really look at every word when I type on my phone.

470,"i moved schools at the start of year 9 at the same time as E. Straight away we bonded and we have been best friends for over 2 years now. I have always kind of had feelings for her but i was never confident enough to pursue them, but earlier in the year i got very drunk and told her. she then ignored me until a week later when she called me randomly and asked me if i meant what i said. i said ""yes i am into you and have been for a while now but because of a recent breakup and my poor mental health i dont think now is the time"" 

4 months passed and E got very drunk at a party that we were both at and the complete reverse happened, she admitted that she had liked me since year 9 (sounds sus but its legit). i had already been talking to another girl A who i really get along with and we are now dating and have been for a month. i know for a fact that i will be so much happier with E, but i do still like A and i am still with her. E told me probably half an hour ago that even if i stay with A that she will be waiting for me.

471," Before anything else, I just want to say I'm MUCH better now. From being depressed I'm now much happier, and from being idle I'm now setting ambitious goals for myself.
 That being said, I've burned a lot of bridges during a dark time in my life. Just from my username, and history of my posts you'll find a long story about that, and I don't want this to be a wall of text. I don't want to mend all bridges, just one. This person is very important to me, as she was the closest friend I had and the friend that kept me going for long time before I had enough. Long story short, I was very dependent on her emotionally as my old friend group kicked me out before the school year started. I cut ties with her because I wasn't thinking straight at the time, and got really jealous when other people, even new students, could so easily get along with her while I felt ignored and completely unwanted, which is also the same reason I'm very hesitant to try and make up. What if she really did want me gone? I've transfered to a new school and it's been almost a year since I last talked to her. I don't want to be a bad memory coming back to haunt her, and yet I still feel really empty not having her around. Our friendship ended very abruptly, and she chose to ignore me in my last days of school (though I made no attempt to talk to her because I felt like a bother to her). She means very much to me still, and if I'll only end up bothering her again, I'd rather bottle up my feelings than put her through bad times. 
 I still keep an old pen she gave me. It's not some ordinary pen, it's a silly carrot pen with a bunny on top. It ran out of ink really fast when she first gave it, but it meant so much to me because despite her being really important, we had very little interaction in real life, and mostly stuck to messages. I don't think I'll ever have the strength to throw it away, at least not any time soon.",03Aug2019,1
472,"I'd been kind of flirting with this girl for a week, then yesterday I sat down really close to her when we were alone in the room, looked her in the eyes, touched her leg with mine and ran my finger down her arm. She proceeded to move backwards and I stood up and left the room. I apologized three times in person that day, all met with: ""It's ok."". Then at night I just could not sleep, I felt horrible, I still do. So I wrote to her on msngr where we spoke a bit a year ago or so.

&amp;#x200B;

I said:

""Hey, hello.

Sorry, I'm not sure I was precise enough about what I was apologizing for today, I touched you without your permission.

I sincerely apologize, I wish I knew and respected your boundaries. 

I really did not mean for it to go that way. I only see you as a friend, at the time I had a lot of suicidal thoughts and did not find a better way to handle them.

Good night.""

""Hi, yes I understood. Nice that you say you're sorry, let's leave it in the past.""

475,"My husband is in his 3rd year of veterinary school and has started clinical rotations dealing with clients and their patients. So far he has been in rotations which have been mostly doing behind the scenes work in the laboratory, but one of his new rotation duties is actually taking care of animals in the ICU. There are a lot of night-checks and overnight stays with some animals is critical condition.

Today was his first patient loss in his care. The patient had some really intense difficulties earlier that day, but seem to be pulling through somewhat when my husband was assigned the overnight care round. Unfortunately the animal seemed to slowly start destabilizing during the night (mind you my husband had been holding the animal in a blanket all night, so it wasn't just an animal he checked the vitals of at a certain time, he was legitimately holding the animal like a baby in his arms for the entire night caring for it) . There was one intense moment where the animal needed emergency care and my husband totally snapped into action and saved the animals life! Unfortunately coming near the end of the shift my husband was to hand off the animal to the next students and right before that the animal started slowly destabilizing. Apparently the animal's heartbeat slowly dropped until it was gone. My husband said he thought the animal just might make it, and then it all went down hill (he did nothing wrong, the animal just had a very bad defect and would jump in and out of being okay and being nearly gone).   

He came home from the shift late, so I guessed something was likely wrong. I asked him if he wanted to sleep but he didn't and that pretty much confirmed it. He laid down on the bed beside me and told me the animal had passed. I told him I was sorry, and asked him what happened and he told me. I pretty much repeated something similar he had said earlier the previous day about the animal's welfare being better off that way, since the animal was struggling so much. I asked him if he was okay, and he said he was trying to be. I reminded him that he saved the animal's life at one point and he did everything he could do. I have offered him food, sleep, and just general care, and now I am trying to give him space because for me he tends to go off and be alone when he is upset. 

My problem is, I am worried I am not supporting him *enough* or *correctly*. I am TERRIBLE at dealing with loss, and I am not so great with words or being supportive I guess. Even when I am dealing with loss, I tend to go into a robotic state of being emotionless. Just recently we accidentally hit a cat during the night drive home, and he was driving. I had to stare out my window the entire drive home in silence and managed to utter out ""it wasn't your fault, you didn't see it."" because I just couldn't get the *sounds* out of my head. I didn't even know until several days later that it really effected him, and even some things came out about how he was upset over a patient he had worked on and made a small mistake accidentally cutting the animal. He seemed like it wasn't a big deal to him, he even said that to me when it happened - but apparently it all had made him feel pretty rough. I feel absolutely terrible about it all, and how I feel like  I didn't support him enough. 

My question is, *how* do I support him enough? Veterinarians have a very high depression and suicide risk and this scares me more than anything. I am an extremely sensitive person, but when it comes to intense things like this  my way to get through it is to be robotic, but that's *not* going to help him, and there will be plenty more things like this happen throughout his career, especially considering he plans on going into the Military Veterinary field which is really doubling down on emotional stress for him.

What would you expect from a partner in these situations? How can I be better with my words and showing that I care and want to be there for him other than just physically being there and saying the stereotypical things? I really do care immensely, I am just terrible at expressing it. 

TLDR: Husband is in school to become a veterinarian, he will be dealing with the extreme stress of saving and losing lives and I am not sure how to be properly supportive.",03Aug2019,1

491,"This is a burner for obvious reasons.

I don't really know where to start. I was in a long distance relationship with a girl, and her family did not approve of it. They weren't comfortable with her talking to someone far away, but we loved each other. She has a young daughter and the father of the daughter still loves my girlfriend, but she ended things with him when she was pregnant and said it's the best decision she's ever made.

 She had a major accident in January in which she fractured the back of her skull, causing retrograde and anterograde amnesia (she can't remember the past or form new memories). During this time, we talked regularly and I recorded videos to help her every day (like 50 First Dates). By April, she was remembering her family's names and mine and who we were with needing videos or assistance.

In April, doctors did a checkup and noticed major blood clots in her brain that required surgery. She went into the surgery and a week later her sister told me she was still comatose, declared brain dead, and that they were taking her off of the machine. Before the surgery, my girlfriend recorded a video telling her family she loved them and that she still loved me, even after she lost her memory. 

Her sister finally told me last week that my girlfriend is not dead. The surgery didn't go well and she did wake up from the coma, but her memory is worse and her eyesight and motor skills are damaged. She said the father of her daughter tricked her into signing a power of attorney before her surgery so that he would be legally in charge of her and take care of her. My girlfriend's father always liked this guy and approved of him tricking her into doing this. The sister is upset because she knows my girlfriend didn't want him, and she feels like her family took advantage of my girlfriend's amnesia. 

The sister said the family was extremely upset at the video and thinks I ""tricked"" her into saying she loved me in that video due to her amnesia. Methinks the family doth protest too much. But the sister said her family demanded she tell me that my girlfriend had died, but she has had too much guilt and wanted me to know the truth.

I don't know what to do. This is not the life my girlfriend wanted, she never loved this guy. Her sister is upset that her family is controlling my girlfriend's life. But on the flip side, the rest of her family is content with the situation, and my girlfriend's daughter gets to be with her father (even if she never knew him before the surgery). 

The sister wants me to send casual photos and videos to my girlfriend to see if I can help restore her memory like the first half of this year. I want that of course too, but I don't want to cause serious drama or harm to this family. I love her more than anything, but I don't know if I should let her be and let the family get what they want, or try and restore my girlfriend and remind her of the future she wanted (with me).

497,"Hello!

I'm in quite a complicated state of mixed emotions.  Just a quick background is that I have been born and raised in California but am in computer science right now for National Taiwan University as an undergraduate, now going to sophomore.  I've talked to upperclassmen, my old friends at home that changed majors, so let's skip the usual emotions people have about changing majors and cut to the chase due to my tendencies of elongating topics unnecessarily.

I have grown up with given talents in art such as drawing, video editing, photoshopping, picture framing, etc related stuff from my Mom, but was also gifted with a brain good for STEM majors.  I hate to brag about myself but it current is a gift and curse.  Growing up I have always enjoyed drawing and other creative activities and could do those for hours and hours.  It wasn't until middle school where I slowly started to stop any art related hobbies, especially when I got into high school and was so busy with classes to maintain a 4.4GPA and a bunch of high standards for colleges.  My mom thought it was best for me to go with STEM studies due to her own experience with harsh reality on such a subjective job (my mom did find quite huge success with graphic designing with high paying salary).  This prompted me to just work hard for STEM classes that were AP and honors without any regard for art at all.

Let's just say despite all the awards, varsity sports, AP credits waived, etc, my year for those born in 2000, college admission rates were the worst by far in history.  While part of the reason of going to National Taiwan University for computer science was it's high top 50 global ranking for my major, me getting rejected by other colleges, relatives in Taiwan and a chance to master Mandarin Chinese, I am currently struggling on my passion.

I'll admit to being lazy and taking shortcuts for my past freshmen year in computer science in order to pass my requirement classes, but when I actually sit down and code, like what I am doing right now during summer break, it just does not have a spark of interest like I did with drawing as a kid.  There is barely any satisfaction for coding out a hard problem and I cannot do it for hours and hours like I do with my creative hobbies.

To sum it up the problems I mainly am extremely stressed out about is:

1. Some people end up actually clicking and liking their major perhaps 2-4 years into their major.
2. I may be simply overthinking, as I do not entirely dislike my major, but maybe it's just my classmates are one of the smartest people in the world and it's making me put too much pressure on myself.
3. I have made such a huge devotion going to the other side of the Earth for a globally ranked university with close allegiance with many other famous US schools for STEM orientated universities.
4. I honestly feel like only 40% of me belongs in Taiwan, but not 100% (or maybe I'm simply spoiled growing up in one of the richest places in the world).
5. Going back to California to start over in a community college with the possibility of regret is a fear.
6. I have been detached from art for so long.
7. Like my mom said, if I go into art related majors, they are extremely subjective and facing the harsh reality, often people's creative work are either bashed or praised famously.
8. I have been pondering about options I would have never thought I would do growing up, such as YouTube, starting my own collection of designs for clothing, etc.  Which all start from scratch, and again, extremely subjective and risky.

Sorry if this was long, I tried to edit it and keep it as short as possible.  Any replies, suggestions, criticisms, relatable stories of changing to a completely different major with a huge environment change or motivation would be appreciated.",03Aug2019,1

My supervisor has harassed me for months and most everyone in the department can tell and have pointed that out to me, but if I go to HR it would bring a shitshow investigation that the dept. isn’t equipped to handle right now.

I started working with him first and have the utmost respect for him, even if he has sided with my supervisor when being brought with these issues.

My family doesn’t want me to go, they keep the mentality of sticking through and pushing forward, but I just can’t see the logic behind staying in a place that’s toxic for me, especially if my superior is hellbent on slandering my name and LOWERING my chances of getting a new job if other supervisors and managers are going off of what he says.

I told her honestly how I feel about her being up so late and she keeps promising me to wake up earlier, but it never happens. I also know she has issues at home that are quite serious (I tried to get her to find help but she refuses and tells me it's just a matter of time till she moves out and no one will help her anyways).  


There are days I can't talk to her because I've got to wake up early for work. I know this is more of a rant than anything else but I'm wondering if I'm too hard on her for getting upset with her breaking her promise time and time again.",03Aug2019,2
504,"Hi,

I've always bought really cheap headphones that I use mostly for the gym. I don't listen to that much music usually, but I've started taking an interest in listening to music when working. It does seem like my earphones are not giving me all the sounds and quality I could get. I'm by no means an audiophile, but I'm in a big Pink Floyd phase right now and I love listening to full albums at a time. It seems like quality headphones would provide good immersion.

I'm not really looking for suggestions for specific models, I just would like to know if it is really worth it to spend 300$ on headphones?",03Aug2019,1

510,"Let me clarify that my childhood was not some horror story and my parents were not monsters. I think they did what they thought was best at the time and it turns out their choices have affected me greater than I imagined. 

After meeting and getting to know my now husbands family, I saw a family dynamic that I was not familiar with. A simple, loving family that are loyal to each other and hold trust between each other, whereas my own family is negotiable when it comes to a helping hand and revolves around a lot of drama. I feel more like my husbands family is my true family, which makes me feel confused and guilty. My husband has helped me to realize a lot of things about my family that I didn’t see on my own, as you all can probably look back at your childhoods and see how “normal” situations really weren’t as normal as you thought. 

My mother is a sociopath and does whatever she can to get her way. We have a relationship today but I hold many boundaries with her. Oddly enough we are closer today than we’ve ever been; maybe it’s because I have gained the courage to be honest with her and she has learned how to take constructive criticism. She was absent a lot in my childhood and made up for lost time with gifts and money. She was emotionally unavailable and just all around not the warm, nurturing mother we all need. 

My father was the “parent” for the most part but he barely got by. He worked out of town a lot as a salesman and left us alone a lot with a couple hundred dollars to survive while he was gone. I was in high school at this period and had to ask neighbors for rides to school and to the grocery store until I finally got my own car. At one point we (my brother and I) lived with my 19 year old sister in her friends apartment and rotated between a couch and a recliner for about 3 months. This apartment was overrun with cats but my parents didn’t care, they were just concerned we at least had a place to stay, didn’t matter where. When my dad was home, he drank and spent a lot of time writing on his computer. He never really had time to talk to us and if he did, it was all about his work and what he’s “learned” and how we should live our lives according to him. To put him in a box, he’s a self righteous man and I don’t have a lot of respect for him. His way is the highway and he will force you to sit and listen to him ramble even if he knows you don’t care. Might I add that my dads life has crumbled since he divorced my mom (I was 3 and am now 21) and to this day blames every single problem of his on her— his drinking, his money problems, his high horse mentality, EVERYTHING. 

Fast forward to now— my husband has done for me what a father does for his children— he’s clothed me, fed me, put a roof over my head; he’s done whatever he could to make me happy and comfortable. We now have a 16 month old and he’s done the same for her. He’s a proud husband and father and he and his own father have helped me to see what a man really is and does for his family. Upon realizing this and with the help of comfort and communication from my husband, I’m seeing now just how not normal my childhood was. 

My father has made his children his go-to’s and made us responsible for his feelings. If we are honest with him, he cries and brings up my mom. He’ll drink himself to sleep or manipulate us with sappy texts, sometimes will even send us “selfies” with his glass of alcohol and a sarcastic comment about how he’s enjoying his night on the couch all alone.

So to get to my actual point, a certain situation between my dad and I ensued (which doesn’t really have to be brought up for you guys to understand) and my husband just lost it. I have tried to get him to avoid my dad because I was scared of confrontation between them, because I didn’t want my dad to get upset (I’m a 21 year old female with my own child, you can see how this is damaging to me as a person trying to learn what it means to be an adult). He told him all the ways he messed with my head and that he didn’t have respect for him as a man. My dads response was “you don’t understand what it was like being married to her” and my husband literally told him “it’s been 20 years man, get the fuck over yourself and grow up”. I was told that the whole conversation (which was over the phone btw), my dad kept making excuses for his behavior and my husband ended the call with “you took a beautiful, innocent woman and turned her into a fearful little girl because you couldn’t be a man about your problems”. I’m raising your daughter which is fucking stressful but I do it proudly because she deserves it.” 

I was speechless after hearing all of this and now I’m trying to figure out how to respond to my dads last text (which basically just said “your husband has an agenda and I just have to wait it out. I’m not sure why he feels the need to judge. I have to convince him I’m not the enemy”). Or should I even respond at all? My question to you guys is how do I move past childhood trauma. How do I make sense of a childhood that I saw through a blurred lens and move on so that my daughter doesn’t go through the same thing? I’m not mad at my husband for being honest with him, I love him for it and I’m proud to be his wife. I just can’t stop thinking about whether my dad is okay and it’s just fucked that that’s what I’m thinking about right now.",03Aug2019,1
511,"This email included the last 4 digits of the account number and the last 6 digits of the VIN. I called Capitol one and after being filtered through many different representatives they asked for my social security number.

Recently i was homeless but still got my work, it was hard but i had some savings, and by luck i quickly found a room. Even the same day i moved in and everything. In my case you won't even think twice when there is a room for you, understand. 

Okay all good i was about one week in still no problems or troubles but i ate from the recipe of bromazepam (i know it's a no go) because i'm having a hard addiction with benzos for some years and since that moment that was known i started noticing things which gave me the feeling someting was wrong. Be aware i am not registered here or anything, so i have no right to fucking stand on, oke that's that.

 Now i know this woman is so poor and in debt she almost would do anything for some cash to eat, i payed up front until oct this year, thank goed for that.

Now in short more and more conversation i am overhearing about me, like wtf. I lost my job on my birthday and going into rehab this month. So basically comes down to: I'm scared they're planning somethig behind my back to get me out ASAP.

For info i clean my room, have my own life in good control (oke the weed and benzos aren't good) but even she and her neighbors started selling them to me, which i did not even think twice about as the bartard i am, but now the cash runs low and still i'm one month away from rehab... Fuck me.

543,"LONG RANT AHEAD.I’m half a year into med school, and its’s hard of course but I thought I was doing relatively okay. Subjects wise I can’t say I’m passionate about them, but some of them are interesting enough for me to want to know more. The university I’m in has a different mix of people compared to what I’m used to, and while it’s been hard to fit in, I do have a group of friends who hang out together. 
It’s been so hectic the past half a year and I honestly studied my hardest every single day. I listen in class and studied every single day, and because of this I had no time to spend with my family. I live at home still and we’re pretty tight knit, so it’s a bit hard to not even get a chance to have a proper conversation with them since I’ve been nose deep in my studies. 
I’ve even lost touch with my hobbies: reading and playing the piano. I quit my part time job teaching music(which I love) and basically couldn’t do anything outside of studying without feeling guilty. It didn’t help that my friends would say things like “are you sure you have time for this” when they I mention watching a movie with my family or going out with my college friends.
Our first test results was just released yesterday and I failed. For the first time in my life. And I know it’s not uncommon to fail in med school as pretty much everyone I know has warned me about it but it was still quite a blow, seeing as most of my friends passed.  And after talking to my brother about it, he asked me if I think it’s worth it. And it just got me thinking that maybe this just isn’t for me? I’ve wanted to be a doctor for a long time, and maybe was just in love with the idea of it, not with what it actually means. If I really ask myself what matters most to me, it would be my family and music. But without a doubt my parents would never allow me to quit med school for music (they’re really traditional) but then my brother mentioned engineering at his school. Maths and physics have always been my strongest points, and route memorisation such as what I’ve been doing in med school is definitely not. And while I don’t have a passion for engineering either, it’s definitely a shorter course and my brother’s uni’s system is a bit more project-based which sounds really interesting? Plus community-wise it would fit me a lot more better (based on really long reasons) 
So it’s either stay with something I might develop a love for later on, but lose out on family and hobbies, or take a risk and do something else I equally don’t care about, but am much more adept in and spend more time on my other passions. I’ll lose one-two years of time and money if I do go through with it, but is it worth it to go on with this? I’m just scared I’m considering this because of the effects of failing and not because of the overall worthiness of it.

Please give me your ideas/suggestions :(((.  feeling really lost right now",03Aug2019,6

547,"so i don’t know how to word this maybe you’d call me indecisive or maybe you’d call me an asshole idk but i have a bad habit of changing my mind or opinion to make other people happy, let me explain, so for example a harmless thing i do is that if someone likes or doesn’t like something i like/dislike, i’ll change my opinion to theirs, probably doesn’t actually make them happy but it makes me feel like they’ll like me more. however, sometimes it’s not harmless for example, my boyfriend wants to go on vacation to london, not only do i hate vacations but i’m terrible in crowds bc of my anxiety so london to me seems like the worst idea ever however my boyfriend has said that this is the only thing he wants from me and so i feel terrible not going so i told him i would but in the back of my mind all i want to do is say no i don’t want to go london but i worry that i’ll upset him, i know that if i tell him how i truly feel once he expresses that he’s sad i’ll “change” my mind again and say i want to go so he’s not sad. i want the relationship to work out so i’m trying to be selfless and since the vacation would only be two days long it’s not like he’s asking for much at all. but i just don’t know how i’m going to cope in such a crowded place whilst i’m extra sad bc i’m not able to go home to my comfy bed after all the stress. if anyone has any tips on how to deal with being in such a huge and busy place, please give me tips :(

(we haven’t booked the holiday yet officially either just to clarify, i know how much of a d*ck move it would be to want to change my mind when things have already been paid for.)",03Aug2019,1
549,"So i have a best friend whom i text every day. He has the habit of being inactive on social media, because his parents sometimes take his phone but he always finds a way to inform me why isn’t he active. 
Last three weeks I’ve been on vacation so i haven’t really had time to be on social media, but i’ve seen that he’s been posting stories and stuff.
Last message i got from him was 6 days ago to which i responded but haven’t got a text back. 4 days ago i’ve sent him a “ghosting me huh?” and 2 days ago i’ve sent “is everything alright?” and didn’t get a response for either of those.
I’ve asked his other friends if they’ve heard from him but unfortunately, no one did.
Now i thought that maybe he also went on vacation with his family and he just doesn’t have wifi and can’t talk but he would catch a wifi somewhere even for a second and just post a story or smtn?
Now you may think i’m being paranoid and maybe i really am, but last night i dreamt that i contacted his mom who told me that they sent him away to boarding school. and this might be a weak source to rely on, but my dreams tend to have connections to reality (for example i dreamt that one certain question showed up on my entrance exam and it did).
I guess now i am even more afraid about what’s going on, i wanted to contact his mom but i don’t have her number, I don’t know what to do.
In one hand i’m afraid that the worst happened (he used to be suicidal) and in the other maybe he is just trying to get off social media.
What should i do?",03Aug2019,1

552,"I work at a small business franchise location and I am coming up on 4 years here. We are a small location maintaining between 4 and 7 employees. I have received a promotion along with raises on 3 occasions and I do believe that the owner values me as an employee. 

I have taken special training for a department that I basically manage by myself. There have been some sale improvements recently and I have been putting in effort to improve them further, but I do waiver in enthusiasm when I start to consider my personal return compensation. 

I have not requested a raise with the owner directly in the past. He does not seem to have specific guidelines for a raise procedure. He is regularly very busy and it is typical to not see him in person for many months at a time. We communicate mostly by calls and text.

All of this considered, I feel it may be reasonable to text the owner in order to start off this request. A phone call feels too abrupt and I don't want to put him on the spot. I'd like to keep the message short, and discuss it in more detail via phone/in person. I am looking for advice on what I've thought of saying:

-
Hi [name], I was hoping that we could take some time to have a conversation regarding my wages and position here. I feel that my willingness to put customers' needs in the spotlight is showing great improvements of our customer's satisfaction alongside our sales. I would like to continue to build on this. Please can you let me know when you are available to discuss this. Thanks!
-

I would also love general advice on having this raise discussion. I haven't done this before. I am a nervous and emotional person under stress, and could use some tips to better my confidence. I have been putting this off since I'm nervous of the outcome. I have been overly stressed and have considered leaving but I do take some pride and enjoyment in my job. I have settled into a comfort zone here but am stressing over what I put in vs what I see in my paychecks.

Thanks! I'll keep an eye on this and update/comment if there's questions.",03Aug2019,1
553,"So my Girlfriend and i have been dating well today a full year and shes 18 and im 19,  and basically shes Bangladesh and im hispanic, but this whole time dating we have well she has always had to be hiding around and saying shes going out with her girlfriends or that shes staying longer for work but her parents are creeps and always check up if shes actually doing those things instead going with me because shes been caught before with me at the mall. And today on our one ear anniversary i asked her to tell her parents about us, how we are dating because i just want to pick her up without having to worry about her parents catching her lying about where shes at or being back exactly in 3hours and i just want to do normal boyfriend things like that but her parents hate me because im hispanic and they want her to have a Bangladesh boyfriend, but we love each other and they don’t understand that because anytime they catch her on the phone with me they scream at her and when i asked her to tell them because i want to be able to pick her up whenever she got mad because im not “understanding” when i genuinely feel like its her not being understanding.

555,"I'm writing this because I've been having a difficult  time with the people in the smallish town I'm from. Alot of the people here behave like totally selfish a**holes from h*'ll. Mixed in with that is a kind of weird small town tribalism. So, while I'm out and about, my interactions with these people, especially the a**hole rednecks, is very personally
It's as if they crawl right inside of me when they drive by and stare at me like I'm some kind of space alien.

Also, where I live, materialism and money-making is the main religion here. A person's actual life's worth is based on what they own and how many kids they have. I'm a cyclist and I feel like I'm looked down on with contempt and disgust because I don't own a vehicle.

I try to ignore them but it would take a Zen master to block out people in a toilet bowl environment like this one *cough* Central, PA *cough*). Actually, there's this thing I call the ""redneck hypnotic stare"", which is when rednecks deeply stare into my eyes while they ride past. If I lock eyes with them, it could actually cause an accident while I'm out riding. So, I usually try to break eye contact.

556,"My partner and I have been together for 2 and a half years and I love her and her body. She is into tattoos(im not) and she had been contemplating getting a big tattoo on her back for three years. Even though I'm not a big fan of tattoos, she seemed excited to get a tattoo and I wan't to support her in whatever makes her happy. 

We had talked about the design of the tattoo on her back and a couple of times she mentioned it'd be cool to get one on her chest instead of her back. I didn't take it seriously so I didn't say much other than ""I don't think that would be a good idea"". So a week ago she went to the tattoo artist with an idea of what she wanted but wanted to make the final designs alone with this tattoo artist she really admires. 

And guess what - She came back with a big but minimalistic tattoo that stretches from 1 inch above her clit to in between her breasts. Needless to say I have been in a state of shock since then. Never would I have thought that she would get something like that and it wasn't even the design we had talked about. Right now, I'm struggling to even look at her naked and I'm so filled with frustration and anger that it's difficult to hold inside. I can't say anything, I can't tell her anything negative because it's already done, it's permanent and it feels like a bad dream to me. I don't know if I can get used to the tattoo. I loved her natural look and I think she has made a mistake. What should I do, How can I react, Will I get used to it. I'm so sad and at a loss of what to do.",03Aug2019,1
557,"Let me give some back story so this question makes more sense.

When I was a young teen, I was brought to America from Northern Europe for adoption. I didn't understand what was going on, and that was part of this whole problem. I was brought into a very wealthy, snobby household, where before, I lived on a nice farm with a decent, hardworking foster family, but couldn't stay with them for any longer. I just felt like I was ripped away from my life.

All this couple had in mind this whole time was to show me and use me as a source of gossip, drama, and a shiny object to show and talk to other people about. They would constantly disrespect my country, my real family(who I knew very well and talked to some) and tried to turn me against my own past and childhood place. And I only started to piece it together after I started learning english more.

These past 6 years were filled with depression and screaming and emotional abuse from them. They would constantly insult me and call me names and talked about how I looked and were even racist towards many people I hung out with, to the point where I stopped even bringing anyone in the house and just avoided them all together. Anytime they insulted me, they would later deny it and call me a psycho for making things up and tell everyone they knew I was mentally ill or that others were a bad influence on me. 

When high school came around, their other younger son that also lived in their house had become extremely violent and they would excuse it constantly. I had scratches and bruises from him, and I had dents in my door from him trying to get into my room. He has always been spoiled and a favorite, his actions don't even bother them at this point. 

I eventually started working full time, and even overtime to avoid their extremely toxic house, I even slept outside and at others peoples houses, because when I would walk into that house, everything that had happened in there would all come back to me and it made me want to run and cry. 

I graduated a year early and took a year to work and save up some money. They weren't happy about anything I did, so I had completely cut them off and just stopped talking to them for that whole year. Right at the end of march, they barged into my room and said that I was a disappointment and I had to leave, so I packed up and by april, I had gone to her older sons house in another state. He was her biological oldest son, and he knew what was going on because he kind of went through it too.  Let's just call him Jay to make it easier to understand.

Jay could not go with the idea of me not going to college and thought it was ridiculous that his own mother brought in adopted children when everyone around them said no, because everyone knew they are incapable of parenting. Jay then called his mother, and said since she has all the money in the world, it shouldn't be a problem if she cut a check and ended all this because my life wasn't a game.  But he wouldn't take a no from me, to not go to college either.

Now, I wasn't fond of going to college in the first place, I can tell just by visiting it isn't a place for me, and I actually have wanted to join the Coast Guard for a couple years but never said anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem now is, Jay has made this deal with his mother that she will pay for my college but she wants me to talk to her and she wants to know every little thing, but  even thinking of her or hearing her voice makes me physically sick and I just want to cut them out of my life. They caused me so many years of unnecessary pain, I can't handle having to have any relations with them at this point. All the manipulation and lies has made me traumatized and paranoid, and I don't want to feel this way.

I've wanted to go the military route for the last 2 years, join the Coast Guard, but I don't know what to do at this point because all these people decided to get involved, and i just want to be happy.  I want to cut these people out of my life, and just serve the country where I know I'll have something out of it afterwards, and hopefully meet good people. I researched a lot about it and even talked to recruiters and people that are in it now, and it seems like my top and best option. Plus I will be debt free at least for a little while.

What should I do? Should I just go away to school knowing well that I don't want to have anything to do with it, and drop out in the middle, or just drop it now and join in a few months? (I am turning 19 in a couple of months in case you are wondering.)

558,"(btw i’m 17) I just need to vent and get some advice because i feel like my dad isn’t helping me. My dads friend who is my step moms ex husband is staying at our house to watch his 9 year old. he has a lot of dui’s so people have to drive him around including me sometimes. it was ok at first but sometimes he will act like a dick and say shit for example about my boyfriend that he has no business saying, let’s just call him john.(he’s probably like 45)

last night it all started when my boyfriend came over after doing stuff with his brother and cousin and he drove to my house and his cousin followed him, so i went outside to see him and i said hi to them. then john came out and said “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” and i said i’m not going anywhere and got something out of my car. later he told my dad that i started my car and tried to go somewhere. 

then in the middle of the night he storms in my room and starts yelling at me, he says “THIS IS OVER. GIVE ME YOUR KEYS NOW.” and me and my boyfriend were confused and asking him what did i do because we didn’t even know, but he wouldn’t tell us and he just kept yelling at me and he was super drunk so i just gave him my keys. i called my dad because i was confused and then he came back to my room and started yelling at me and telling me that i’ve been an asshole to him and that he’s been nothing but nice to me. and he starts calling me names. i literally have done nothing to him, the only instances i can think of my being rude is when he comes into my room while i’m trying to change and i tell him to get out and sometimes i’ll just act cold to him and sometimes i’ll just ignore him because i don’t like him and i shouldn’t be forced to be nice to him. 

he wouldn’t leave me alone. oh and before this he was playing dubstep music in the living room tv so loud that i sleep in the basment and it sounded like it was coming from my tv. and it was past midnight and the dog was barking because it was so loud and my stepbrother who’s 9 years old most definitely wasn’t sleeping when my stepmom would have had him in bed. i told my mom and my mom called him and told him off. i don’t remember how many times he came into my room just to yell at me but he was calling me things like a cunt it was super rude and i was at the point where i was crying.

then he was talking to my older stepbrother about me, and he kept opening my door so i that i would hear what he was saying about me. every time i closes the door he would open it again. finally my boyfriend went up there to shut it and he got mad at him for closing it. he started yelling at us again and calling us “leeches” even though he’s the one staying at my dads house. i told him he’s leeching off my dad and then he got smartassed with me and said, “oh really? IM the one leeching off your dad?” saying that me, a 17 year old, is leeching off my FATHER, i’m literally a child and he’s the adult. he tells me to “get out of his wife’s house.” when she’s not his wife.” me and my boyfriend kept arguing with him and refuted everything he said about us and asked him to finally close the door and he didn’t even have anything to say, he just kept smiling like an ass and did 2 peace signs and said “deuce bro” and we kept telling him how stupid he is and we’re like wtf does that even mean. 

i went upstairs to get a snack and ignored every thing he said to me because we was so drunk, then i saw him holding my keys and was about to go out the door and asked why he’s taking my keys and he told me to stop being a dick. then i took my keys and my door doesn’t lock and he kept following me so i just gave them to him to make him feel important but he wouldn’t leave my room he just kept berating me. i’ve never been so mad in my life, i was literally screaming at him to get out of my room. he kept telling me what an awful person i am. and in the end he still fucking slept in the basement with me in my step sisters bedroom so all that is separating us is a door. i felt so uncomfortable i was up all night crying. 

then i woke up to him mumbling under his breath about me trying to wake me up on purpose, and heard him talking on the phone and taking a piss with the door open and told him i don’t wanna hear him piss. he kept being rude to me in the morning too. my step sister came back and he went downstairs to her room just to tell her how i’m being a bitch and i told him to stop talking about me and he told me to shut the fuck up and i started crying. i told my dad all of this and how it makes me feel, and how i’ve never been more uncomfortable in my life but he won’t do anything just because he’s not home even though he can tell him to get out. 

i’ve never been talked to in my life by anybody like this in my life and i’m not even related to him. he said so many hurtful things to me i was up all night thinking about it. he called my mom and ugly cunt. oh and he told my mom that she called his son a retard when she didn’t so i’m scared he’s going to lie about more stuff to my dad. my dad won’t do anything is actually getting mad at me for not letting it go. im sorry i don’t want a drunk ass adult harassing me all day. oh and he threatened me and my boyfriend if i don’t do what he says he’ll get physical and he said he  had to walk away or he would kill somebody... he acts like this is his house now and says he’s in charge of me when literally he’s not. i’m not his kid he can’t make me do anything the fact that i had to give him my keys when i didn’t do anything pisses me off because i couldn’t find them this morning when i had to go to work. my step brother had them for some reason.

i feel like i’m being punished for no reason. i can’t believe my dad would let somebody yell and talk to my like this over nothing he needs to leave. even my step sister said she doesn’t feel comfortable he’s here. i told my sister and my mom and my sister got really upset i don’t know why my dad doesn’t care when do i call the police??",03Aug2019,1

566," About 3 years ago, I befriended a woman who was new to town, lets call her Kelly. We met on OKCupid but it was immediately clear there was no romantic connection. All the same, we had similar interests and struck up a friendship. We eventually found a house together. This would be my single greatest regret of my life.

She became psychologically abusive, turned my friend and bandmate against me, and stitch needles into my girlfriend's clothes and my bed. I became so angry that I made a Facebook post calling her out on an act of violence. However, my friend and his girlfriend took her side, calling me a liar, claiming I was abusive, and turning the whole thing against me. I was devastated, and three months later I am still hurting deeply for the fallout of this turn of events, and having a lot of trouble processing it.

I don't feel like myself anymore. I never knew I could hate someone so much. I never knew I could be so generous to someone, to give and give, and for them to just take everything they can away from me. I am going to therapy, I am on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, but I am still deeply depressed. How do I move on when I feel like my whole world has been turned upside down?

The whole story is a long one. But I feel like telling my story is an important part of processing it.

Kelly has a sad and dark history of abuse from her childhood that very messed up. Without going into too much detail, it is some of the worst, most violent sexual abuse I have ever heard of. I felt pity for Kelly, and though there were many red flags along the way, I ignored them, completely underestimating just how mentally ill she is.

I met Kelly on OKCupid about three years ago. It was immediately clear there was no romantic connection. Nonetheless we had similar interests like music and comedy, so we struck up a friendship and made plans to play in a band together. She was new to town, so I introduced her to my friends, including my bandmates. We eventually found a place to live with another friend, and this is when things began to go downhill.

A few weeks in to living with Kelly, I began to notice forks in the garbage disposal every time I turned it on. People make mistakes, so I tried not to make a big deal about it but I mentioned it to Kelly. Her reaction was disturbing. She became very angry and started yelling. I tried to keep my cool, but she began making threats. At first she yelled ""What are you going to do, hit me?"" I was in no way being physically intimidating, but I apparently triggered some abuse from her past. I eventually said that I don't want to live with her anymore, and she told me to move out. I told her to move out. She responding by threatening to tell our landlord that I hit her to get me kicked out. My jaw dropped. I became upset, and our housemate came to tell us to calm down. Things deescalated, but for weeks I did not talk to Kelly, and fell into a depression. I did not feel comfortable around Kelly anymore. I wanted to, and should have, moved. But as we were on a yearlong lease together, we eventually tried to patch things up, or so I thought. But it's likely that this was the start of Kelly instigating my friends against me. She seemed worried that I was going to tell people what happened. Fortunately for her, the few people I told barely seemed to care. When you are a man and the victim of psychological abuse of a woman, few voices are sympathetic to you.

Around this time, I also started dating my current girlfriend. She is amazing and has been incredibly supportive throughout this whole ordeal - as she is one of the only other people who lived with her and really knows what happened. When our other housemate moved out and my girlfriend moved in, Kelly became more distant and colder towards us. It seemed to make her jealous that we were happy together, and she would sometimes try to instigate drama in childish ways - trying to make me jealous if she saw my gf talking to another guy. Her behavior became erratic - she ran around the house, scurrying from room to room. We would frequently hear her tapping a small gong or bell in her room, sometimes dozens of times in a minute, sometimes hundreds over the course of hours. We would hear strange moaning and owl-like noises sometimes.

January. Something terrible happens at the end of this month. it is a story in itself, and a very troubling one. I will come back to this later.

Fast forward a couple months. I go to the local radio station to do my radio show. My gf texts me to tell me she's going to take a nap in my bed. Later, i get a text - a sewing needle was in my bed and went deep into her foot. It was strange and upsetting, but we figured it must have been some strange accident - maybe I had put one in my pocket and it fell onto the bed? Anyway, we didn't think much of it, until we found two more needles in our clothes.

I went to work, and after parking my car I stuck my hand into my coat pocket. I was immediately pricked by a sewing needle. Again I didn't think much of it, but looking back it was clear that it was purposefully threaded into my jacket pocket. When I mentioned it to my girlfriend, she said that she had experienced the same thing - a needle threaded into her raincoat pocket. It should have been obvious what happened, but I began searching for alternate explainations - ""Maybe some sewing needles got into the washing machine?"" It was such a foolish denial. It was clear to my gf what happened, and I feel like such a fool for not acknowledging it now.

Enter my friend and bandmate J. I had been friends with J for years before meeting Kelly, but J and I had something of a strained friendship because of his past with my gf. They had briefly dated two years prior. Now it was obviously never a serious relationship, but J was hung up on her nonetheless, and had unresolved feelings for her a full year after dating another woman. I had to make a choice - between being senstitive to J's, frankly innappropriate, feelings, or pursuing someone I had a real connection with. I have no regrets about choosing her, because she is the person I love and trust more than anyone in the world. My friendship with J did become somewhat strained, and Kelly became close to J and his girlfriend, who also took issue with us dating. T

Sometime before Kelly moved out, she began instigating J and his gf against me. They seemed very eager to believe everything that Kelly told them and take her side, and eventually, I got a text from J saying that he was done with me and the band, that I am an asshole, and that I talked shit about him. I became angry, and reacted poorly. I sent him angry texts in response. I told him he was being manipulated by Kelly, but he had already chosen his side. When I told my gf about what happened, she finally confessed that it must have been Kelly to put the needles in our clothes. I felt like such a fool for being in denial. it was truly the only way that the needles would have got there. Three needles, threaded into our coat pockets and my bedsheet? That was no accident. That was a mentally ill person trying to harm her housemates.

I became very angry and did something I regret immensely. I posted on Facebook that my ex roomate had been putting needles in our clothes and instigating people against me, without naming her. At first people were concerned, but soon after, J and his girlfriend began attacking me on facebook, calling me a liar and abusive. J denounced me and our band and told people not to book us. People really jumped on that bandwagon, and after that, people seemed to not believe me. People stopped talking to me. Unfriended me, blocked me on facebook. I was devastated. Betrayed, humiliated, violated. I feel into the deepest depression of my life. I said some things out of anger that I now regret. J had hurt me bad, and I felt that I needed to hurt him back. it just made things worse.

While in my deepest, darkest depression, I had a realization about something that happened earlier that year, and now I strongly suspect Kelly of doing something much worse than putting needles in our clothes.

Rewind to when Kelly and I moved in together. Kelly had mentioned wanting a cat. When a coworker at my job had kittens, I mentioned it to her and she decided to get the cat. I went with her to pick up the lil guy, and I was in love.

Lets call him Taco. Taco and I bonded strongly, as I would often pick up him and snuggle with him when he was a kitten. He would often come into my room and jump up on my bed to snuggle. He was a very affectionate and loving little guy. Kelly struggled with him, however. She has a hard time showing affection to Taco, and would kind of treat him like a toy or an object - holding him upside down, dressing him up, but rarely petting or snuggling him. he grew to prefer my company and would be found in my room more and more often. Kelly seemed to grow noticeably jealous.

On top of this, she was growing jealous that J and I were playing in another band. J and I had been backing Kelly in a band off and on, but we were taking time away from that to play a one-off show with another female singer. She became very angry about this. After practicing two days in a row at our house, she became extreme angry. Tears in her eyes, she yelled at me that we couldnt practice anymore. We moved practice to another house, but Kelly was still angry and jealous that we were backing another singer/songstress. The next day something terrible happened.

My gf and I went to town for lunch. When we came back, I found Taco on the ground, flailing and struggling. He was trying to eat dirt and plants, probably in an effort to vomit. We grabbed him and rushed him to the vet around the corner, but we were too late. Taco died in my arms on the way to the vet and they were unable to revive him.

I was bawling. I called Ava to ask what she wanted to do. When I told her what happened, her reaction shocked me. She was completely serious, with no emotion in her voice. She just asked me what happened, but it was like she already knew what happened. When I asked her if she wanted to see the body or bring him home, she immediately said no. ""What am i going to do with a dead cat?"" She also quickly rejected an autopsy. I truly wish I had paid for one myself. Taco's death was consistent with rat poison, and Kelly's reaction to her pets death was not normal.

We came home, and Kelly was back, sitting on the front porch. She twirled her hair in her finger and just asked ""What happened?"" a second time. She was still not upset, just serious. When I went into more detail, all she said was ""That's so weird. I had a feeling today was a weird day.""

I cried with my gf for much of the evening. Kelly did not cry once. I couldn't eat for 24 hours. Kelly cooked dinner within a couple hours of Taco's death. I felt like something was off. I had thought to myself, in my grief, that Kelly killed him - but told myself that I was being irrational, that she just doesn't know how to process grief normally because of her traumatic past.

She was barely affected by Taco's death, but she made a point to say things to me like ""I cried about Taco today."" Even then, I knew she never cried about Taco. But it took her putting needles in our clothes for me to realize that she is mentally ill enough to do something like kill Nacho just to hurt me.

I struggle with this every day. I have no evidence, no way to prove that Kelly did it. But everything about her reaction to Taco's death is suspicious. She was also home when we went to lunch - gone when we came back - and back against after we came back from the vet. The timing, the reaction, the cause of death, and Kelly's troubling mental state, her anger at us playing with another band...everything is suspicious. He was a completely healthy cat and not even 2 yet. Kelly killed him just to hurt me, just to get back at me. I gave her so much, and she took so much away from me.

I never knew I could have so much hate for one person. It makes me physically ill to think about Kelly. And I have a lot of anger at myself for not reacting better, for not recognizing her for who she was sooner, for letting this terrible, poisonous person into my life. It pushes me to the point of suicidal thoughts, though I know that I would never go through with that.

Help me Reddit. What do I do? I've alienated my friends and feel shunned by the musicians in town, who J is very popular among. I feel disgusted about Kelly receiving sympathy from my friends after she wronged me so deeply. I don't know how to move forward, I feel broken hearted. I'm afraid to go out because I know some people view me as this abusive monster. When I do go out, I feel extreme anxiety, and i already have lots of social anxiety anyway.

I just want to live my life and move forward. But I can't help this strong feeling of wanting people to know the truth",03Aug2019,1

568,"for about 2 years my friend (let’s call him Ryan) and I were inseparable, I had never met someone who I just clicked so easily with before, we had so many common interests, extremely similar personalities and he understood me in a way no one else did at the time. Ryan meant a lot to me and he told me that I meant the same to him. for a short time initially I liked him as more than a friend but never admitted this. then his best friend became my (current) boyfriend which caused some problems and they eventually fell out over me. anyway, I haven’t spoken to Ryan in a year because he began doing hardcore drugs- cocaine, ecstasy, lsd, ketamine you name it and he dropped everyone who wasn’t interested in supplying him the drugs, or doing them with him. Ryan and I used to smoke weed together but I had always expressed that I wouldn’t do anything else and I’ve stuck to that. for a while I forgot about him, although one of our last conversations where he told me that before I got into a relationship he would’ve like to pursue things but never told me at the time has played on my mind. I miss him a lot more than I’d care to admit and I struggle with the fact he’s no longer really the same person as I knew. a couple of days ago I saw him in the street and since then I’ve had an overwhelming urge to reach out to him although I know I’d probably get hurt because I don’t think he cares at all about me anymore. I also feel guilty because I think I may have (romantic) feelings towards him still even though I have a boyfriend of 18 months.

581,"Hi Reddit.  Lately I've been very *slightly* worried that I could be pregnant.  

The last time I(20F) was sexually active was in April, but we were careful and used a condom and pulled out, too.  I got my period a few weeks after having sex like normal, but after that, they've been slightly irregular.  Like starting a week late or being a bit lighter than usual, but I've still had them every month.  This month though, my period hasn't come yet and it's over a week late.  

Also (and this could be complete paranoia) I feel like I'm seeing my stomach get a very tiny bit bigger.  I honestly can't tell if it's always been like this and I'm just paranoid or if I've gained a little bit of weight throughout the summer, which is entirely possible.  

My diet could also play a part in this.  What I've eaten this summer hasn't exactly been great, as it mostly consists of bread, bran flakes, oatmeal, and frozen burritos that I put in the microwave.  Like literally 90% of my meals this summer have consisted of these things.  I also don't really eat three times a day, I end up eating one or two times whenever I'm hungry.  

Is this worth getting a pregnancy test over?  I'm really short on money right now (hence the shitty diet) but I also know that it would be so much better to know now than to figure it out later.  But I haven't had any weird cravings or anything.   No morning sickness.  NONE of the regular pregnancy symptoms.  The only thing really making me nervous is the irregular periods.",03Aug2019,1

583,"So, some background, the way my gm (general manager) chooses to respond to issues in the workplace is by feeding them down to his other managers to have them tell us, which would be fine if I didn’t just reject the advances of my (married) shift manager. I suspect since then, he has been feeding me false information about certain changes to our polices (it wouldn’t be that hard to do, our owner is super wishy washy and polices change almost every day. Also, he’s usually the only manager I interact with on a regular basis.) as my days working have been steadily dropping every week until yesterday, one of my other managers showed me (in confidence, if the gm knew that I knew, the poor guy would be fired on the spot.) that I was now going to be working one day a week because I filled out a form incorrectly (I didn’t fill out incorrectly, but I can’t correct his mistake without telling him how I know about it.) Quote: “I will not tolerate employees that cannot follow simple directions.” That one really hurt, because I pride myself on being good at my job. I was the top seller before they started cutting my hours and people would come up to the owner all the time telling him how pleasant I was. It was the first time I felt like I was good at my job. Not that my job is hard or anything, but I’m a sucker for praise and I enjoy pleasing people. So to hear that this is what he thought of me really hurt, especially since in every interaction we’ve had, he’s been nothing but nice and praised my kindness, honesty, and salesmanship. All lies, apparently. So, today I got in touch with him asking if I could speak with him today about this issue. I was careful to avoid voicing my suspicions about the other manager and remain as polite as possible. This is what was said 


Me: Hello GM, this is ShimShamFimFam from the work. I really need to speak with you at some point today about how we can communicate more effectively. We can talk over the phone or I can come in and speak with you in person, whichever you prefer. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes of your time. When is a good time for you?


GM: Regarding?


Me: I'm not sure that our method for communicating issues is the best. (Creepy Manager) has mentioned before that you take away hours as a sign that someone is doing something wrong, so obviously there is something I need to improve upon. However, what exactly that is never gets passed along to me unless something happens to remind him of the issue, which is rare. I don't blame him, he is a very busy man, and has a lot to keep track of, but clearly we need to set a different system in place, so I can do my job as you want me to. From now on, if an issue arises, could you please tell me personally, so I can be sure to fix it? I understand you have a specific way in which you want things done, and I want to respect that, but if I don't know there's a problem, I can't fix it. Does that make sense?


It’s been over 3 hours and there’s still no response. I know he’s probably just swamped (this is currently the busiest part of our workday), but the suspense is crushing me. Are there any further steps I should take, something I should fix about what I said or even just something to relieve the stress? Thank you all.

I have known Woman A the whole time since we started at the same retail job at the same time 3 years ago. She knows that I like her a lot but we are just friends at the moment. Maybe we could be in a relationship in the near future after school but we don't know yet. For the time being, we are just school friends, work friends, and just friends in general.

Woman B is a recent employee from the past year since Black Friday. She is cool and all. She knows Woman A just casually at work and I don't know she ever met her at school or not. Woman B recently asked me if I was seeing someone and she would like to hang out and stuff. I told her I wasn't seeing someone and yes I wouldn't mind hanging out and stuff. Pretty simple.

But the thing is that ""my heart"" still yearns for Woman A and is hoping for the chance me and her can have a shot at a relationship. I don't have anything against Woman B but I don't know if I should just straight up tell her that I am totally interested in Woman A and that if I am with Woman B, my heart might not be 100% into it.

I used to live with my mum and my two older sisters. My oldest sister basically looked after us because my mum could barely get out of bed half the time and wasn’t very well mentally. She basically held the whole family together and when she finally got up and left everything fell apart. 
My mum and my sister would argue every night, trash the house and both be covered in cuts bruises and blood. It got to the point where I was terrified to leave my room and one night my sister held me up the wall with a knife to my neck threatening to kill me and then the police took her away and she went to live with her dad (were half sisters so have different dads). Then it was just me and my mum alone in the house so she began to take everything out on me. 
Every night she would tell me how worthless I was, how she wished I would kill myself and  how ugly and disgusting I was as-well as dragging me around the house by my hair scratching me etc. But the problem was is that she was so kind and loving at times and then like the flick of a switch she would change and I was only young so I didn’t really understand what was happening and would blame myself. I cut myself would starve myself and tried to kill myself etc and now I’m on anti depressants bc of all the pain she put me through. She manipulated me, played mind games with me, made me feel like I was going insane and that I didn’t deserve to be here. So eventually I got the courage to tell someone after years and years of abuse and live with my dad and stepmum. Now I realise that she is seriously mentally ill and I never want to become the person she was. 
Becoming a mother and finally having that mother daughter bond that I always needed growing up is my dream. I want to be kind and caring and never up like her. And I think I’m pregnant now. This is all I’ve ever wanted but it’s not the right time and I wouldn’t want to bring up a child with no stability but I feel just as bad as my mother if I abort and don’t feel comfortable with adoption. I’m so scared and confused bc I feel like such a terrible person and I don’t want to become like my mum. 

TLDR : I was abused as a kid and really want to be a good mum in the future. I’m pregnant but too young and unstable to have a child, feel like I need to abort but feel guilty for doing so and feel like I’m being just as bad as my mother was to me.",03Aug2019,2
603,"A couple months ago I rented out a room in a house I found on Craigslist.  The landlord was moving out of the house to live in his camper full time. The house, landlord, and housemate all seemed nice.  I have a clean background and prefer to live month-to-month so the landlord didn't make me sign a lease.  Since then there's been a bunch of red flags:

1. No lock on the door
2. Landlord comes in unannounced most weekdays, apparently it's on his way to work and he leaves food here
3. Locks the thermostat at 77, this is Florida, so sometimes the ac doesn't turn on at night
4. Leaves long angry notes occasionally, the last note cursed me out for leaving smudges on the counter where I wiped and ""the sponge smells like shit""
5. My roommate has reason to suspect the landlord has at least one camera in the living room
6. He moved in a new pregnant couple without any kind of warning, I met them the day after they moved in

I was planning to move out at the end of August but this morning my original housemate discovered some drug paraphernalia in the driveway next to the new couple's car suggesting that at least one of them is snorting cocaine.  My original housemate was pretty pissed and it sounded like the situation was going to get violent so I left immediately with most of my stuff.  I'm staying at a friends house and am looking for another place.

My main concern is that I paid for this month's rent 2 days ago and I'd like it back under the circumstances but I'd appreciate any advice on how to move forward.",03Aug2019,1
604,"I've had weird things going on with my eyesight for a long time I'm not sure what to do, I suffer with anxiety and because it's now gotten a lot worse and I'm starting to really worry about it.

I've suffered with light-sensitivity and squinted for most of my life, I've got glasses that go dark when you're outside, this has helped with headaches but my eye sight just keep getting worse.

1. It looks like I have this overlay of noise, if you've used Photoshop and know what the noise filter looks like it's just like that but a low opacity.
2. I constantly have dark/light patches all over my vision–that are like when you look at a bright light and have light or dark patches in your vision when you close your eyes–regardless of brigthess of the environment. Again at a low opacity.
3. My peripheral and long distance vision is getting blurrier and it feels like it's changed overnight(I know it hasn't but it feels rather sudden)

I'm really struggling to read things now because to keep focus is quite hard with all the distortions? and blurriness. I've been to the opticians and saw a consultant a long time ago but nothing has come out of either of those things. I really don't know what to do and it's really upsetting, I don't want to lose my eyesight and if I do I really don't want to be around anymore.",03Aug2019,2

So this morning I woke up to the news that a friend (who was also my barber) had killed himself. 

The amount of people that it has affected, he wouldn’t believe. 

He would always have a smile and you’d never have known he’d even have those kind of thoughts. We’d talk for ages about different things and always have a laugh

The reality is that he was obviously struggling but didn’t tell anyone or didn’t feel like he could. 

I really want to stress that if you’re down or having these kinds of thoughts to please tell somebody. Give somebody the chance to help because they’d hate to see you go. I wish I had the opportunity to try help my friend but it’s made me realise I need to do more for mental health and for people in need of help.

607,"I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. But it’s got a lot worse over the years. 

It started with small things, which was just a minor issue for me back then, but now years later it’s almost everything. To the point where I’m so indecisive about anything in my life I rely on others opinions too much. I had a long thought about why I’m this way and my conclusion was that I don’t trust my own judgment(s). 

A few years ago it started with just small things. From “what class should I pick on this video game?” or “I’m not sure what I should eat today.”
That sounds pretty standard. But it’s gradually carried over to my hobbies, lifestyle, personality, etc. With so many things on the internet now I turn to that to make my decisions which, in the long run, proved to be unhealthy. 

Now whenever I even think about purchasing something such as a new phone for example, I’d search online for the best phones and just pick the number 1 on the list without much thought. This is the same with almost everything I buy these days which also confuses me because I’ve seen some terrible or outdated recommendations and then I don’t bother buying said genre of item. 

I literally cannot make my own decision and don’t feel like a normal person because of it. It’s transitioned to movies as well, where I’ll only watch something that’s scored high on rottentomatoes.

I’ll just skip right ahead to the end and say that it’s got so bad I don’t have hobbies and such anymore, due to overthinking everything and being unable to make the slightest decision. 
I went to play overwatch with a friend (it has been very long since I’ve played any game) and was overwhelmed by all the heroes, I turned to google what the best ones are or what I should be playing, but many websites had them all over the place I wasn’t sure which one to trust, then I just closed the game in frustration and lied about having to leave.

609,"Hi! My little brother (18m) is heading towards his last year of high school (pre-university education in the Netherlands). 

He’s intelligent and can be passionate about the things he likes. However, no matter how much me and my parents try, he can’t be bothered to look at his future options (in terms of education). 

My dad has suggested multiple open days (those days where you can just check out the university/college and have little seminars about different courses there, I think my translation is a bit literal haha), but my brother appears disinterested and writes most things off immediately. I feel like maybe the reason why he isn’t actively looking for things, is because he doesn’t think there’s anything out there for him. 

Any tips on guiding him to finding something he finds interesting? Or at least convince him to start looking? 

His biggest interest is sports (he’s a die hard gym goer and has a different diet and stuff). Personally, I think he would make a great personal trainer (he’s been helping friends of his and seems to really know his stuff). I think university would make him unhappy because it’s so theoretical, and something somewhat more practical might fit his talents more. 

It’s not my responsibility to find his dream program but if anyone maybe has some starter points that I can use to encourage him, that’d be so helpful! His interests don’t allign with my own so I’m curious for other people’s opinions. 

Tldr; my brother (18m) can’t be bothered to look at universities/colleges (Netherlands), how to motivate him to start looking and does anyone know good starting points (gym/health freak, very disciplined).",03Aug2019,1

612,"This is my first time posting, so bare with me if I do something wrong.

My family and I (20f) are from Egypt but we live in the states. We try to visit Egypt every summer  to stay connected to our family. There is no doubt in my mind that I love my family here, but it gets to be too much to quickly. The culture here is very different from the culture I was raised in, my parents raised us with egyptian traditions to an extent, but are pretty liberal and respect that we are growing up in a different world. My sister (16) and I are very independent and that clashes with my fathers family a lot. 

They constantly belittle our achievements because “you’ll get married soon and stay home.” They essentially think they own us, and my grandfather is the worst of them all.

Not only do they treat my mother like absolute shit. My grandpa thinks he owns us and our house (which my father built on his own). He doesn’t let my mother’s family anywhere near the house when we’re not here, and he doesn’t understand that the house needs to be taken care of during that time, so whenever we come back it’s filthy and a lot of stuff is broken or ruined. He constantly insults my moms choices in the house. My sister and I prefer spending time with my mothers family (because they respect us) and my grandpa is constantly berating my mom and saying she’s brain washing us and turning us against them. 

A couple days ago my parents went to visit some friends in a nearby city and left my sister and I alone in the house, which is perfectly safe and we are capable of taking care of ourselves for a day (I live on my own in the US, for God’s sake). Plus my sister was sick so we didn’t want to go anywhere. My grandfather has his kids calling us all day and telling us to come over so they can feed us (???), and we keep politely saying no bc my sister has a cold. 

Then, a couple hours before my parents come back, my grandpa calls and i picked up. He tells me to get dressed and come over right now, that he won’t let anyone eat until we come. I try to reject but he starts screaming in the phone, telling me not to make him mad and that we can’t say no. I don’t want any problems. And i don’t want this to blow up on my mom, so i say ok. My sister doesn’t want to go, so she calls him and says she’s too sick and i’m staying with her to watch over her, plus our parents are going to be home soon. He starts screaming at her on the phone, calling her a liar and saying she has no right to say no. My sisters hard headed and she yells back, telling him she doesn’t lie and we’re not coming, he hangs up.

A few minutes later the phone rings again, my sister picks up and is silent for a few minutes before saying “i’m not a liar” and hanging up. she tells me he called solely to yell at her and continue to accuse her of lying. He then calls my dad and asks him where they are, then makes him call us to tell us to go over there.

Anyway, we end up going. We walk in and he starts telling us about how far the city is and how we LIED bc my parents would be home by now (they arrived 5 minutes later) then he storms off like a child.

This was the braking point for me. Every summer my dads family stirs up drama and rumors and treats my mom like shit. My grandfather is a narcissist, i’m pretty sure. And he’s used to everyone bending over backwards for him. They all constantly insult my mother even though she cared for them for years,. and they insult the gifts she buys them and used to steal from us. They constantly insult my siblings and I, laughing at us when we disagree with them and talking about how my sister and I should stay in egypt so we can get married.

I don’t know what to do, they make me dread coming. Every year I like them less and less. (I wasn’t allowed to go to the doctors today without my grandpa! My dad was with me but that wasn’t enough, apparently.) I’m always suffocated by them and they make my mom cry. I try to explain to them that we were raised in a different culture and they dismiss it and say no, what we say goes. My friends tell me to stonewall them and distance myself bc it damages my mental health. But i do that already and they still get to me. How can they not when they’re always insulting my mom and my siblings? Or when they take so much money from my dad with promises to pay him back and never do? I want to keep coming here for my moms family, but i can’t avoid my dads family. What should i do to distance myself without causing problems? Since talking to them is impossible and all my parents say is to ignore them?",03Aug2019,1

She calls him several times a day. At least twice within an hour every single day. She wants his location to his phone but he doesn’t wanna give her his phone location because she would yell at him if he isn’t at his apartment 24-7. So he has to put his location on his iPad and he leaves that at phone so she thinks he’s at home all the time. She also has his truck location. 

She blows up his mom and starts texting him if he doesn’t reply immediately and starts threatening him that she’s gonna take him out of college and all of that 

His mom makes him send pictures of the receipts whenever he goes to the grocery store and she checks what all he gets. He’s only allowed to use his credit card so she can check his transaction of what he gets. 

She chose his major and literally everything he does is chosen by her. 

He’s also not allowed to date or anything because it’s not allowed in the culture

619,"The formatting is probably gonna be weird since I’m on mobile. And this will probably be long. Tldr at the bottom. 

So my mom and dad have been married for 20 years or so now, but they’ve been threatening divorce since I was about 7 years old. Well I’m in college now and they’re finally getting their divorce. My mom and dad have a very toxic relationship. My dad is physically and emotionally abusive towards my mom and used to be pretty emotionally abusive towards me, but him and I are getting a better relationship, so it’s much more chill. He’s never been abusive towards my brother (he’s 19). My dad is also an alcoholic, but he is doing better in that regard as well. 

All that being said, my dad has a good stable job and always has provided for my brother and I. He makes sure we have everything we need and then sometimes we get extra. He has high expectations of us, but I feel a parent should. He is kind of strict on me when it comes to upholding my responsibilities but if I want to go out he’s usually chill about it. I will admit that he can be insensitive and do/say hurtful things but I can tell that he’s been trying to improve. He manages to do his daily tasks and provide for his kids despite any issues going on. 

My mom is a very irresponsible person. She’s very immature, entitled, lazy, won’t accept responsibility for consequences of her actions. She’s extremely emotional, tends to be paranoid and irrational, and can be manipulative. I hate to say it, but she uses people. I’m also her only daughter and the youngest of my brothers. She tries to micro-manage my life and makes me feel like I’m incapable of doing even simple things. The weird thing is that we have a co-dependent type of relationship, and the roles are reversed. I have to try to be her parent- I’m constantly the one cleaning up after her, trying to get her to get up and get a job, do something good for herself, etc. 

My dad was incarcerated for a few months earlier this year on a domestic violence charge. Upon his release he was given a no contact order between him and my mom. So my mom and dad cannot speak or be around each other unless there is legal counsel present for the next however long. I think that’s a good thing. So I’ve been living in the family home with my mom and brother while my dad has had to stay with relatives a few hours away. 

I was on a trip when my mom found a new house for her and me to move into. My brother was going to stay in the family home with my dad. Well I went and saw the house when I got back from my trip, it was pretty nice, so I agreed to live with her. Well then she admitted she would only have $60 after the first month’s bills were paid- she doesn’t have a job or a car. 

I talked to my brother about my concerns and then I talked to my dad. Obviously my dad was fine with me staying with him. So I just told my mom straight up that I don’t want to live with her because she has a record of not following through with her plans. I tried to be nice about it. I told her if she could get a job and keep it and show me she was serious and could do it maybe I would live with her eventually. That was about 5 days ago. 

Since then she hasn’t been speaking to me except to say rude remarks, yelling at me for random things, or trying to guilt trip me because I don’t want to live with her right now. She also told me I was faking my (clinically diagnosed) mental health disorders because I’m choosing to live with my dad and I’ve told her that he makes my mental health worse (which wasn’t a lie, but being homeless and dealing with my mom who has a victim complex would be worse than dealing with my dad at his worst).

I tried to explain to her that I don’t want to live somewhere that I could be kicked out of the next month, and that my dad will give me somewhere stable to live while she’s getting on her feet. I also tried to tell her that we would just end up fighting anyways, since I have to babysit her. 

I’m about to be starting my own life. I don’t want to have to babysit a grown woman just because she thinks everything in life should be handed to her and she doesn’t wanna put in the work. I had to basically raise myself since my dad was always drunk when I was a kid and my mom was in bed 24/7. She’s okay with me being an adult when it benefits her, like me doing all the domestic work and cooking and trying to get a job, but when it comes to me being independent and making good decisions for myself that don’t involve her she thinks I’m victimizing her. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t want my mom to hate me, and I love her no matter what. But none of the approaches I have ever taken with her have worked. I’ve tried doing therapy workbooks with her, having heart to hearts, sobbing and begging her, screaming at her, trying to do stuff with her, but it doesn’t work. And I don’t wanna waste my life trying to motivate her to do something with hers. 

So

Tldr: 

My mom is extremely entitled and lazy and has a fit when she doesn’t get her way. She’s being super aggressive and manipulative towards me because I don’t want to live with her, even though she doesn’t have a job and only has $60 to her name. I’ve tried explaining my reasoning as to why I want to stay with my dad and she acts like I’m victimizing her. 

So if any of you guys have been in this situation or one similar, what did you do? What do you think I should do? And how can I get my mom to stop hating me?",03Aug2019,1

My boss has announced that she will be leaving in a couple weeks and they're now hiring for her replacement.

- I've found myself not enjoying coding as much lately, so no more programming (which might also be a con?)
- Would be a good move for personal growth (confidence)
- Higher pay grade

Cons:
- I might not enjoy the financial budgeting portion of the job
- I'm an awkward person that gets anxious in social situations sometimes (I do well when I really know what I'm talking about)
- Not sure if I'm ready to give up on programming and put an end to my technical career track (currently 28 years old, so I have many decades of work ahead of me. Too soon to quit coding?)

This happened before being 17 years old.

Graphic design and programming have been passions of mine in the past 5 or 6 years.

Nowadays, I wake up at 11 am during holidays. I open up Photoshop, Illustrator and try to work on anything, but I give up in a couple of minutes and go back to bed. 

I used to do this before aswell, but it happened once in a few days, and even then I would've entertained myself by watching a movie or playing a game. 

Now, I just go back to bed and take a nap. Everyday is the same. 

I also have issues finishing holiday homework. I just lack the mental energy to stand up and do it.

I used to code quite a lot, but at this time it's been a few months already since I've written a line of code. 

My last high-school year is about to begin and I have three major exams: maths, programming and my native language. 

I want to work as a programmer after following a programming university. I am motivated by this fact, but not enough to stand up and code.

632,"Tl;dr at bottom.

I work in an unusual profession - the kind that can drive people a little crazy. We tend to work in close-knit teams and share details of our personal lives with one another.

I have always been regarded as a private, creative, intelligent, sincere, and reflective person, often placed in para-leadership roles.

As the title says, I'm currently going through some major personal changes, in my early 30s no less. These changes include:

Growing resignation and cynicism about the political climate of the US.

Dreading the likelihood that I may be single and celibate for the rest of my life, following a horrible breakup a few years ago that has left me deeply unsure of whether romantic relationships bring me happiness or a feeling of being oppressed and controlled.

Feeling as though I don't know myself anymore.

Coming to terms with how I am far more eccentric than I'd previously realized, mostly as a result of the chaotic family environment of my infancy.

FWIW, I'm in therapy. A lot of the focus is on these crises themselves, rather than how to pretend they aren't happening per se.

I find myself acting weird most of the time, I suppose just because I'm deeply confused about myself and the world, more than I ever have been before.

How can I pretend to be normal, or at least avoid making others uncomfortable, during this time in my life when I feel very un-normal, disillusioned, sad, and alienated in my daily life?",03Aug2019,1

637,"Hey everyone. First post on here, let's see how this goes.

Just finished sophtmore year of high school, about to go into junior year. My English teacher last year for the second semester was a bitch. Of the 40 kids who had her, we all hated her. Super strict, constantly criticized us, etc. So going into her class was something I wasn't looking forward to. I had a personal encounter with her that I'm questioning whether to report to my counselor or not. I want to see what others say so I don't go in blind. 

This happened the second week of semester 2. I had just gotten back from a field trip with a club I'm apart of, and missed some schoolwork because of it. I had missed some work in English, so the weekend after the trip I emailed my teacher asking if I could come in and make up a quiz I missed. She replied, saying I could. Flash forward to Monday. I walk to her classroom, she's not in there. I look down the hall and she's walking towards me. I approach her, but before I get to say anything, she cuts me off and says she doesn't do ""discussion"" (her words, not mine) outside of the classroom. I follow her in, sit down, and try to talk about the quiz. She cuts me off again, more sternly, and says I need to wait. I sit there for like 3 minutes while she checks her emails. She then gives me a sheet of paper, and tells me to write stuff down. I don't remember her directions but they were vague. I try to ask her what they were again and she just tells me to do it and that it's not that hard. I write some stuff down and proceed to leave. 

Right before I walk out, she calls me back to her desk. I stand in front of her, and she proceeds to lecture me about this quiz. Apparently I did it ""wrong"". She asks who put me in Honors English, and proceeds to make remarks about how I shouldn't really be in the program after *one* quiz. She never directly said ""you're stupid"", but her words made it out as if I was stupid. I stood there angry, and she then says that she must have made me feel terrible, and then just dismisses me, no apology or anything. 

I'll admit, this was a while ago, but the memory of this encounter resurfaced yesterday and I'm 100% considering going to my counselor, the principal, whoever and just telling them about this. I'm honestly getting nervous just typing this, my hands are shaking. This was traumatic for me. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.",03Aug2019,1
638,"I don't know when this started but I've always had this empty feeling in my gut when I date someone. I just always feel like I don't love them and they don't love me and it makes me really upset. A while ago when I was with my ex, I felt like something was just really wrong and I was wondering what it was for the longest time but I've come up with no answer. These thoughts eventually lead me to leaving her because I felt like I didn't love her and she didn't deserve being with someone who didn't love her.

 I remember the feeling of loving someone. I remember the rush I got when I felt someone in my arms and the feeling of their breath against my skin. I remember it all but ever since a few break ups I've never felt it again.

With my friends it's not any better. I feel like I don't enjoy being around them. Its not that I *dislike* being with them, I just don't have fun with them anymore. Things are much different and I don't know what's happening to me. I don't even enjoy sex as much anymore. I've been hurt allot by allot of people I trusted and it never gets easier.

640,"You can look at some of my previous posts if you want more context--

I really like this guy I at my work (we are camp counselors) but I'd been nervous the past few days that he's flirting with this other counselor (who already has a boyfriend, which he knows). My friend (also works with us) who I tend to think is better at reading people (and also an outside perspective is generally more accurate) said no he probably doesn't like her, they barely talk, and his flirtiness is just his personality--

Flirtiness being talking to her and smiling at her a lot, laughing with her, and then today specifically, he was being pretty touchy with her, i.e. hand on her shoulder, arm around her shoulders very playfully.

My friend said he does that stuff to her a bit too but I was like-- well he doesn't do any of that to me at all. She said not to worry about it and I trusted her judgement more than my own so I felt a lot better.

At the end of today a couple of the counselors (including me) and our assistant director (who is his sister, she's 23) were talking about some stuff and it came up that he and this girl are always talking, a lot (according to one of the other counselors). I was a little confused since my friend said they didn't but then the assistant director (his sister) was like ""yeah ***(guy)*** was like hmm ***(the girl he was flirting with)***"" and she was like ""she has a bf"", and his response was ""not for long""

None of us have known each other for longer than 4 weeks but for me feelings get too intense too fast. I don't know how it is for him but I'm really hoping it's a superficial 'like'. I also talked to the asst. director (his sister) about it bc she's easy to talk to and super nice and I feel like she would generally give good advice but especially here. I was worried it would be weird for her but she was fine with it. She said he's ""emotionally stunted"" (jokingly, I think) and that he doesn't usually o the way she tries to guide him but she said ""I'll see what I can do"".

My plan originally was to tell him how I feel at the end of next week bc that's most likely the last time we'll be working together so it would avoid any future awkwardness if he rejects me, but now I'm not sure. Should I go through with it? Should I say something sooner?

Side note: we were co-counselors last session (last two weeks of July) but now he works with the older groups and I'm with the younger groups so the schedules are completely opposite and I barely get to see him/flirt with him (not that I'm any good at that). The girl he has been flirting with shares a similar schedule and gets to be around him all day.

TL;DR: was planning to tell the guy I like at work how I feel at the end of next week, found out he likes one of our other co-workers today; should I still tell him next Friday? Should I say something sooner?",03Aug2019,2

 Weirdly unlike most people with BD I’m happy enough with my body, because in my head it is basically almost perfect or perfect. I feel I have everything there thats conventionally attractive (except my chest is on the smaller side). It’s just my face, and I know deep down thats what matters the most to be attractive and I can’t shake the fact that some won’t find me attractive. I’ve had a guy reject me and he dated a very bitchy girl which basically confirms the reason.

Something I’ll admit is I do look better than two years ago, (when I look at the pictures I feel like being sick I looked that bad) simply because I learned how to put on makeup better and style my hair nicer.

I have a unique name, so at first I thought someone with my name just looked it up and added everyone with the same name. But then they snapchatted me, and knew what city I lived in. I’m on ghost mode so this was freaky, but I just assumed it was someone from my school. I said this, and they said it was my best friend (also 17M) messing with me. 

I started talking and joking around like it was my friend, but they soon said that was a lie. I was getting a little freaked out. They then asked me if that same best friend was gay. I said that I didn’t think so, and they started harassing me for his snapchat. I told them I wouldn’t give it to them. They told me they were just a guy who was closeted at my school and was trying to figure themselves out. I said ok, but that this wasn’t the way to go about it. I said that I related, as I am bi, but that this behavior wasn’t ok. As soon as they heard this, they started flirting really hard with me, asking me what type of music I liked, calling me cute, etc. I said for them to tell me who they are, but they wouldn’t, saying they weren’t ready. I stopped responding. 

The next day, they added a bunch of my friends on snapchat. This included people from school, from my sports team, and from out of state. These were friends who don’t even interact or know each other. How did this person get all their snapchats? Then the person started asking me creepy questions, like asking if I was a virgin, stuff like that. I blocked him, and reported him for identity theft. I had my friends do the same.

670,"I live in a suburban neighborhood. Many houses, middle class life, very normal and average. So, when a man begins to be spotted in my neighborhood and no one knows who he is, where he comes from, or how he’s getting around, my family gets a bit suspicious. 
It all started 2-3 nights ago. My dad leaves the house at 9pm and comes back to see a man on my street corner a few houses down. Dismissed it but tells my mom about it. The next night, we’re all driving home and see a man standing at the same street corner. It’s is 7-8pm, dark out. Again, my dad mentions it but no one thinks much of it. Last night, a man comes to my door and knocks very loudly. My dogs started to go crazy, I didn’t plan to open it but my younger sibling decided to. I then was forced with handling my dogs and a kid trying to see who it was. 
The man was wearing a white Termix shirt, a hat, shorts, and had some sort of tablet thing in his hands. He asks if my parents were home, I answer no without thinking and my dog starts trying to get out the door towards the man. He apologizes for interrupting and leaves. I shut the door and tell my mom about it. 
About ten minutes later my grandma comes over to test if my sibling would open the door again. Luckily, that was not the case. But she tells me she saw a man walking down our street. I tell her about my experience and she warns me about him. My friend calls me and tells me that the same man who I saw was just in her neighborhood on a Segway and went to her house. I confirmed that it was the same man by asking her if he looked like Will Graham from Hannibal. He did. 
After knowing all of this, my family starts to be on caution. No one knows who he is, he doesn’t have a car, nor a Termix truck. He’s walking our neighboor during the day and standing on street corners at night. 
Today, less then half an hour ago, he’s sitting at the other end of my neighborhood by my Uncle’s house infront of the woods. I talk to him about it. There was a man sitting outside in a small park (merely a basketball court and one bench surrounded by woods) for hours directly in front of his house. 
That’s all I have right now on this man, but it’s strange. I keep trying to think “maybe he’s just doing his job”, but I don’t know anyone that works after 9pm and stands on street corners for their job. I don’t know anyone who sits in a park for hours, or on a curb doing what appeared to be nothing in the same area. Why wouldn’t he have a work truck? Where was his Segway my friend saw him have? Who is he? Is he dangerous? So, I came here for advice, maybe to gain a new perspective on what this man could be doing. Or if it’s as weird as I think it is.

TLDR: There’s a man wandering my neighborhood by foot with no clear intention at strange hours in the day.",03Aug2019,1
671,"It's the school holidays at the moment and my younger siblings are stuck at home 24/7 watching TV all day. Our life consists of school/ college and home. Nothing else. Not even extra clubs whether it's ballet or boxing.

676,"I won't beat around the bush, my great granduncle was an evil man. He sexually abused his children, he was violent, just all around a disgustingly nasty person. Naturally he lived a long life, but he still died decades before I was born.

My grandmother always had a somewhat rose-colored image of him, and kept a portrait of him as a boy, painted in the 1800s. When grandma died, the painting came to my dad, who tried to sell it in an antique mall for years as a neat hundred year old frame with anonymous art. (The frame is in good shape, it is very nice carved wood with a gilt frame) I, at that point, did not know the story of it, I thought it was just a weird old painting of a kid.

Dad eventually gave up and asked me to take it to goodwill. But for some reason he told me the whole story then. And for some reason I could not bring myself to throw it out. It is one of my ancestors, after all, and is definitely the earliest depiction of any of them. After that, we don't have any photos until my grandparents (not sure why). I did not tell dad I kept it.

But now... what the hell do I do with it? I've had it for five years now, it's lived in closets and basements, and I have carried it with me to three apartments. I am about to downsize, and need to get rid of as many belongings as possible. And I come to the  question. I have a roughly 18x20 portrait of my evil great granduncle. I will never display it.

Should I throw it out? Is it worth keeping? I feel weird throwing it out, but almost as weird keeping it.",03Aug2019,0

682,"I am doing my best to move on to another job. At r/assistance, I made a post asking how I go about reporting a Daycare. I realize just how unethical it is and the director is no better.
I plan to resign but I want to be just a bit spiteful about it.

Here are a few base things I'm thinking of doing.

-Thanking for the time I spent helping these children grow and improve in life.

-Apologizing about my sudden leave.

-Rebuttling with how it completely goes against my moral compass.

Now for the spiteful parts:

-Make an almost Hamilton-to-Pence message about religion. (She was very hypocritical. Sworn to indoctrinate but told me I dare not teach them the same.)

-Post the message at 12 in the morning. (She made me sit down in her office the other day, scolding me about messaging her at 11:30 despite how polite my question was.)

-Finish it off with two screenshots of how allergies can lead to infection but you cannot get a cold or a fever from just allergies. (She tried to tell me wrong. There are horribly sick kids here and one of them made me sick. She had green snot but the director said it was allergies.)

Pointers? Tips?

683,"I work in a produce department at a grocery store and noticed that under one of the tables there was a lot of dirt and what not so I took the task of cleaning it even though it wasn’t my job.

When I pulled out the bottom of the table, i was disgusted to find a full box of rotting bananas that were dated two months prior. The bananas were covered in black and white mold and had a horrid odor that made me nauseous. Somebody must have stored them under there two months ago and forgot about them.

Knowing the dangers of black mold and with disregard of my own health, I took pictures and cleaned up the mess (the box had collappsed and the bananas leaked all of the floor). It was like it was never even there after I cleaned it.

I alerted my department manager and he was obviously alarmed that it was left there for two months, but didn’t seem to quite understand that it was a severe bio hazard, and he didn’t do anything else like report it to store management so they don’t even know about it.

684,"So, my friends and I were at Pride and it was great. However when we walked towards a few stalls I got a text from a friend asking if I was at the parade, I said yes because it was true and you could tell by my snapchat maps. However I never told him where exactly I was, and he found me. He has had a crush on my other friend for the past year, and has been obsessive. Constant messages, always asking to go and see her. Not cool. But he does has autism and struggles to understand social cues, however she has said on multiple occasions straight out that she had NO interest and yet he kept pushing.  So we tried to get away and came up with a lie which wasn’t the best but the girl was beginning to get uncomfortable so my boyfriend and I walked him to his bus and he left. We did this so that we could have time as a group with everyone being mutually happy. But by the time his bus came everyone had decided to go home, keep in mind we were only there an hour. I just need advice on speaking to the guy, and explaining that wasn’t cool in a way that will not seem rude or harsh but gets the point.

685,"I made this account just for this post to relieve embarrassment from posting it on my main. A couple years ago I hated my voice so much I didn’t want to speak to anyone, and as time passed it was still something I was insecure about but got over it enough where I was able to forget it was even an issue during a conversation, but out of the blue I’ve been feeling that way again. It’s probably my biggest insecurity, I don’t think I’m physically attractive but I’m more confident in my looks than my voice, and personality wise I’m super proud of who I am, it’s mostly just my voice. I don’t know how to describe it without fear of being offensive, but the way I would describe it is the stereotypical voice of an over-the-top flamboyant gay man (with that said, I’m very pro lgbt, I’m just self conscious that I sound like the stereotype). I don’t think it’s remarkably high pitched, it just sort of has a feminine tweak to it, like a valley girl voice but for a guy. The people I’ve confided in about this don’t think it sounds this way, so *allegedly* it’s just me. It’s hard to give advice to someone on something that they have no control over and can’t change, but I guess that’s kind of what I’m doing. I know most people are insecure about their voice when hearing it through recordings, but how would you recommend coping with it? If age helps I’m almost 19.

686,"Little backstory, I have a brain injury caused by several different blows to my head. This has led to me having a short temper, depression, anxiety, etc... I also come from a family that would constantly take their anger out on me. Which led to me having a lot of self esteem issues and I just hated myself as a kid.

So I want to have a kid one day like I look at babies and I'm like I want that. I want a small family. I want a cute little girl. I just adore it.

The problem is that I have SUCH a short temper. My sister is 8 and I pretty much raised her from birth to age 6 due to shitty circumstances. During that time is when I got my brain injury and I just didnt have patience for her anymore. I can do a few hours of playing then I just get completely exhausted and drained and my patience just breaks. Especially when kids go on their talking sprees or get crazy excited. My brain just cant handle it.

I want to fix this. I want to be a good loving mother one day. I dont want to be like my mom and take my issues and anger out on my kids. I want my kid to grow up knowing for a fact their mom loves them. How do I gain patience?",03Aug2019,0

693,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, my best friend is a very large part of my life and I care for her a lot. Why wouldn't that she's my best friend.  Over the past couple months my boyfriend lay have been planning on moving out of Minnesota and down to Iowa, only 5 hours away. 

Recently her parents haven't been treating her very well, she's 20 years old and I know she needs to move out and trust yourself. But her parents don't really hope in encouraging her to do what feels right and what's best for her.  Right now she does all the chores around the house while her mom sits on her computer or watches her nephew, she helps on the farm and takes care of the animals, she goes to the store whenever they need her to, she's basically a parent to them.
 
Every time that my friend tries to move out they manipulate her and make her feel badd for not staying there and helping them out around the house and saying stuff like she's turning her back on the family.  It's very hardr her not to move out because of them saying we'll put down the animals because they don't wanna take care of them. I know she's strong in all of it other aspects but she always does what she is she is told, especially by her parents.  Her confidence isn't the best due to water parents always told her, You know how it is when someone tells you over and over how bad you are doing with something or how bad you look you start to believe that. 

She's tried to move out twice now each time right after she's looked at the apartment and right before she signs the lease her parents talk her out of it.

Here's the part that really stings.  As I mentioned before my boyfriend and I are moving to Iowa, we just got here.  She's been kind of planning on and off to move in with us because rent will be super cheap for 3 bedroom house split between the 3 of us. We figured it out rental be $236 month if she moves in. We have a good enough relationship all together to know that nothing bad should happen, yes I know there's always a chance but we've been best friends for almost 6 years now. We got this shit I just wish she could believe in herself. Any advice to give to her? Or me being the best friend?",03Aug2019,1

I’ve been browsing reddit for a few months trying to find someone with a similar story to my own to sort help me get out this slump, but I finally worked up enough courage to just go ahead and ask for some advice. I feel like I’ve basically ruined my life. My credit score has dropped from 720 to about 558. I am currently enrolled at a pretty good university where due to some financial troubles I’m just not enjoying anymore. I graduated high school in 2011 and immediately started working. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life,  so I began working at Home Depot. I worked there for about 5 years, building up my credit at the advice of relative who I was living with at the time.  I was promoted about two times going from pushing carts to becoming a retail sales person. It was a huge confidence boost but after working there for a while I started to get burnt out, I didn’t enjoy the retail environment and felt that I wasn’t doing myself any justice in staying so I started applying to other jobs in the general area. I eventually transition to another job working in patient transportation at a small area hospital. I worked that job for about 1 and a half years before being promoted to a nursing assistant in their critical care unit. I worked that job for about 3 years. I loved the patient interaction and being able to watch the interesting procedures physicians and nurses performed and this inspired me to pursue a career in medicine. While I worked I went to community college part-time, I wasn’t the smartest guy in the world but I studied hard and was able to swing a 3.7. I was seeing therapist regularly at the time, I should mention, I have dealt with depression all my life. I grew up in a very strict religious environment where I attended a small private school with about 100 kids up until about 8th grade. I didn’t learn much, and to be honest wasn’t really interested in learning. The religion taught that the end-times were coming I never really thought that I would make it to the age that I am at now (27). I thought that the world would have ended by now. My parents eventually divorced and my mother moved both me and my sister to another state where I experienced what I can only imagine was culture shock. I didn’t leave my room unless I had school which was almost quadruple the size of my old one. Never made a friend, and the anxiety I experienced would be so bad some nights that I would take NyQuil and Tylenol PM to sleep. Anyways my therapist recommended that I apply to a very prestigious public research university to finish my bachelors.

My GPA was right around the area needed to be competitive and I was very excited. Up until this point I struggled with depression, and to this day I’ve never dated, never had a social circle, and for the most part spend most of my time alone and I felt if I just took the leap maybe things would open up for me socially. I apply, and was lucky enough to be accepted via scholarship. The university would pay for my tuition and would provide me with some money for rent.  I sell my car, quit my job and move about 45 minutes away from home near the school. This is where things started to trend down hill. I ended up renting a place at a co-op, I would have roommates and I felt that it would maybe it would help ease me into a social life but when I arrived to move in no one could provide me with a key to my apartment. I had paid about 1500 dollars to them at this point and really couldn’t afford to lose that kind of money. I come back three days in a row and still no luck. Finally, the day before the semester begins I am still unable to get access to my apartment. So with the money I have left my mother recommends that I get a hotel and Uber to school which I did until I found a place to sublease. I move into the place and things are great for the semester, I start doing research in a lab (which I enjoyed) and was even enjoying my biology courses. Just to sort of wrap things up the student who I subleased stiffed me on my 1500 dollar deposit. He couldn’t afford to pay me back in full and asked if he could pay me in monthly installments. After two months he disappears, graduating and changing his number which led to even more of a financial strain on me. I decide to pick up some odd jobs working nights working anywhere between 20 to 60 hours a week some weeks. I eventually give up my volunteer research position because I was losing sleep and my studies were starting to drop off.  I would work from about 10PM to about 7AM and run to class at 9AM and because I ride the bus there wasn’t much time for sleep. 

I eventually end up dropping one my jobs at a grocery store because I thought that maybe if I timed my finances correctly I could use my financial aid with my student job to help me stay afloat. But rent was just so high I could barely afford to feed myself. I decide to make the idiotic decision to try and feed myself with credit cards. I explain the issues I am having financially to my counselor at the time and she recommends I drop my course load and maybe sublease for the semester and go part-time which I end up doing. I move back home for the winter semester and and commute using a family members car. This, however took a toll on me as well. Driving back and forth like I was doing cost quite a but with gas and the roads here made it very difficult to to travel during winter months. 

Fast forward to now, I currently owe the university about 2500 due to the dropped classes, my credit score has dropped by about 200 points and I am considering dropping out. My GPA is decent I am sitting at a 3.4. I feel like maybe this wasn’t for me. I find it hard to focus in class now, and when I go to office hours I get so anxious when speaking to my professors that I sometimes forget what was ever even said. I am a non traditional student who is a minority , just to add, and it’s weird, I never really thought much about who I was and how I looked but it has had a weird effect on my psyche. No one here looks like me, or even talks like the environment I’m used to. I grew up in  predominantly black areas and while I wasn’t the most popular guy at least I was able to blend in. Here I sort of feel like I’m being stared at all the time it’s strange. Of course it could all just be in my head.  I’m not able to make it to therapy anymore and have pretty much become a shut in, aside from going to class, the gym, the library and work I pretty much just watch Youtube in my spare time. I try to push myself, I’ve been on dates but after my card got declined one night during a date I decided to give up on that lol. Fall semester is approaching my apartment is completely paid off for the rest of the semester and I am considering my options from here. I’ve been considering dropping out and maybe joining the Air Force but after doing some research I think the credit check might ruin any opportunity of me joining. Any advice in regard to what I should do to get out of this hole? I’ve emailed my counselor and asked for his advice as well and I am waiting to here from him. I pretty much explained everything that I’ve put into this post. I just felt that maybe it wouldn’t hurt to receive a second opinion. Thanks everyone for your time and I appreciate your help and sorry for the long post!",03Aug2019,2

708,"There's this kitten that has been living on our back porch for the past few days.  I first spotted him playing with one of my other cats through the glass door.  So over a few days we've been feeding him both dry and wet cat food and providing water.  I've also been able to play with him with a cat toy but he hasn't been too keen to being petted.  Well today i've managed to grab him and get him into a bathroom.  Currently i've provided him with food, water, a clean litter box, and a cat bed.  I'm planning on Monday to take him to a vet to get checked out.  Is there anything else i should do?

721,"This is pretty embarrassing. I was always told in life university is a stepping stone after high school. I am about to start my second year but i also have 1 year worth of credits from high school. I am a really good student. I feel like a kid and im scared im wasting time and money right now. 75% of my tuition is paid for by a scholarship.

The main problem, there is no real job i actually want. I am 19F and have been a server for 3 years and i make $25 an hour, many times more. I make a lot of money for someone who lives at home. My parents take care of me. I love my job right now, but obviously not as a career. I dont mind being in school either, but the issue is im putting all this work / money into a psychology degree. i have 0 interest in graduate school, and many people say a psych degree is useless without it.

I look at lists of careers in big companies and i just cant see myself there yet. I still feel immature. Picturing myself in an actual adult career feels strange and frankly i cant help but think some of the party aninals and slackers i go to school with feel the same.

I cant find myself getting excited about the desk jobs that college preps you for. There is no major that interests me. I am your stereotypical psychology major. 

anyways please dont bag on me too hard for being a baby or needing a reality check. I am confident that it is okay for a 19 yr old to not know what they want to do career wise, but i am 2 years into a damn degree which is a very large, permanent decision. 

i get really bad anxiety and panic attacks about how i am wasting college / my parents money, gonna be screwed with no career one day, or going to regret my major. Are my fears true?

TL:DR I feel too immature for college because i dont see myself working a serious career yet",03Aug2019,1

725,"so this post was mean for a group called “am i the asshole” but i had a lot of trouble posting it, then realized it more so didn’t fit too much in that group because i was asking for advice.. here is the post —&gt; 

so there’s been a number times in the past year where my girlfriend (19) will fall asleep early and i have friends over.. i work swing shift so sometimes i work 3-11 so i stay up pretty late or before i work the graveyard shift i stay up all night. she goes to be fairly early once in a blue moon.. she’ll tell me goodnight, then i tell her goodnight etc. so about four days ago this happened and a handful of my buddies came over and we drank and had a great time which is very rare for me because of my work schedule. she wants me to update her on what’s going on but sometimes i just don’t pick up my phone and it doesn’t cross my mind and i wake up to texts like “i saw this persons snapchat story, thanks for telling me he came over last night. fuck you” then proceeds to ignore me for hours or even days. so i’ve been texting her i hope you slept well, i hope work was good, hey i’m thinking about you, i miss you, etc etc etc every few + hours (we usually text 24/7 minus when i’m at work or if we’re together) and i get a response or two every eight hours + right now. so today i’ve been fed up with it thinking she’s overreacting and i say i’m getting tired of this and she replies “What? Ur mad because you’re getting the consequences of ur fuck up? Break up with me then ur absolutely pathetic” exact words just copy and pasted.. and she’s been calling me manipulative for saying sorry then continuing to forget to update her when she falls asleep. btw it’s not females i have over, i don’t go to parties, it’s only me having some dudes over to my apartment.. we’ve been together for about four years.. this is stressing me out beyond belief. i don’t know if i’m an asshole for not getting on my phone &amp; i know it’s common curtesy to update your S/O.. i know it would be more respectful... maybe it’s just me feeling freedom for once and having a good time with my friends i rarely see and just being too distracted.. or is she overreacting. assuming i’ll get a bit of answers saying i’m the asshole but is she also bring an asshole? it’s not a constant thing.. but 70% of the time i hangout with my friends it ends in an argument.. AITA? or is she kinda over reacting? she tends to often but i don’t know if this is normal or not, ive asked coworkers and they look at me like i’m crazy for being with her..",03Aug2019,1

730,"I’m 28M and my cousin is 25M. We were raised together like brothers and had a mutual best friend growing up. The three of us were best friends up until about 7 years ago when they told me that they had been using heroin. We smoked weed all the time and experimented with psychedelics often, but I thought we all knew better than to mess with heroin. I told them they were idiots and that they were making the biggest mistakes of their lives, but they said it’s just an every once and awhile thing.

I ended up not spending time with them for two years after that. I would occasionally run into them at the gas station and my cousin always looked like a zombie. Track marks, bags under eyes, super skinny, etc. He looked like he was on the verge of death. After two years of stealing from the family and being a general piece of shit he got sober. Idk how he did it but I was so proud of him and relieved.

My old best friend (27M) has been using ever since. He has gone through patches of sobriety and we would hang out during those but he would always relapse back into that life. I still stay in contact with him on social media but refuse to chill with him because he’s always doped up. He lives about two hours away but still drives to town often to spend the weekends here. 

Last night I went to a concert with my cousin and he drank way too much. On the ride home he told me that he’s been “fucking up” and using every couple weeks with our mutual friend. He says that he is the only person who he uses with and that it is only when they are together. I know that that will change very fast. 

I am very angry/concerned and I’m having trouble deciding what to do next. I am going to contact my old friend tomorrow and confront him about this. I really don’t know what other steps to take. Do I tell our family? Do I try to resolve it myself without making a giant issue out of it? I’m also really afraid that he could overdose while using it infrequently like that.

So while at work today, we had a bomb scare. Someone rang in saying there was a bomb in one of our bins, so we had to evacuate and all that jazz. Thankfully, it was bogus. But the situation has been on my mind since and it's causing me a lot of stress.  

What's on my mind is just how unsafe I feel now and the fact that someone wanted to make us fear for our lives. And I just can't push that thought away. Once I got home after my shift ended; I did everything I normally do to calm myself down and distract myself but this time I just don't even feel real. I'm at a loss at what to do now. I have work tomorrow morning and I'm beyond dreading it because, in all honesty, I'm kinda scared if someone's gonna try it again. I doubt that it'll ever be real if it happens again but how do I deal with the fact that someone wanted us to think we were gonna die and went that far to mess with us?  

Has anyone here dealt with a bomb scare? Did it really mess around with your emotions and how did you deal with in? What's the best way to deal with it if everything I know to do isn't helping?

733,"I’m 16(M) and my older brother is 21. Me and him have, or I guess had, a very solid relationship recently. In the past, I used to be constantly harassed when were both very little, although nothing serious. Around November of 2018 I started drinking for the first time. Since then, I usually drink about once a month and my brother would always ask me about it and at the time, I thought it was really cool to have someone to talk to about it and he shared stories about him when he was my age. Every once in a while, I also relied on him to pick me up so my parents wouldn’t notice anything. In turn, I have also picked him and some of his friends while they were very drunk and could not drive from places up to 45 minutes away and at times around 2-3AM. On some occasions, we’ve drank together when my parents weren’t home and in fact one of those times was the most drunk I’ve ever been to the point of throwing up all night and into the following morning. So today my brother was on the couch playing grand theft auto when all of a sudden the TV started acting weird and he immediately blamed it on me. (he’s also had a past of being somewhat bipolar and petty) Although I wasn’t doing anything, he came at me, smashed me into the couch and I guess he scratched my face in the process. Normally, this wouldn’t be a big deal as I would just leave the room. But my mom walked by right after and he told her that he just beat my ass. And she jokingly replied with “I’m going to beat your ass!” or something like that. Either way, she wasn’t taking it seriously as she figured we were just kidding around like normal. Then my brother tells me that she doesn’t even care so I took it upon myself to clarify. I normally don’t “tell” on people, but I did anyways in the hopes that he would get in trouble and that could be my revenge ig lol. It worked, and my parents and my brother ended up getting into a heated argument after my mom saw the scratch on my face, which I hadn’t even noticed at the time. Afterwards, my parents had to leave for an event and told us to not go near each other, but of course, after they left, my brother came into my room and explains to me that I should be very careful of what I do because he could ruin my social life by sharing with my parents my drinking. He also claims he has evidence, although I’m pretty sure that parts a lie, but I’m an awful liar and I think my parents would believe them if he told them. At first, he said “if you ever do that again,” so I wasn’t too worried as I figured I could just not do it again lol. But then a few minutes later, after I hadn’t said  a word because I find it’s usually better to ignore him when he’s this upset, he told me that he was just going to tell them now, and asked me if I’d like that. I obviously started talking then, said no, and went into the bathroom. So thats where I am right now. I’m not sure what to do. The last thing I want to do is let my parents know that I’ve been drinking. Anything helps, thanks!",03Aug2019,3

He was fairly smart and we always went the extra mile to make eachother happy.We had great chemistry and nearly always had interesting conversations in person and over text. I think both of us being young and naive (He was 15 at the start,I was 16) also helped.This was the first year a half of our relationship,it wasnt perfect but it was realistic and we were both very happy.

After that he slowly started changing as a person...he started to become more controlling. At first it was small things like staying with him for a bit longer when we hung out. But then it slowly ballooned into other things like forcing me to like the same things he liked,not talking to certain friends or he would make me to dress a certain way. ( such as wearing skimpy clothes in the winter which I didn't feel comfortable with) He started to become alot less considerate about how I felt,if I felt uncomfortable with what he wanted he would compare me to other girls and make me feel like a terrible person. At the time,I knew this was wrong and I did object to some things such as the skimpy clothes but then he would proceed to cry or get angry at me. In retrospect I think that I was so blindly in love that I didn't have the confidence or will to tell myself that he wasn't the same person I fell in love with. I really hate that I didn't accept the situation for what it was or maybe talk to someone....

He was the one who broke up with me (in the middle of my exams....) because he ""didnt want to commit to a relationship"". I was devastated, I broke down and I couldnt sleep/eat. My friends and family were really scared for me and I was scared of myself and him as well.I found out shortly after that he had a friends with benefits thing going on with this girl while were dating....I blocked him off all social media and got rid of all his pictures and most of his gifts.After maybe 2 or 3 weeks my sleeping and eating went back to normal so healthwise I was alright.But mentally I was really in pain,I never ever wanted to see or talk to him ever again.

Nowadays,I'm really happy with my life. In retrospect,this experience has taught me a lot of lessons about any relationships in general. However every third day or so im somehow reminded of him and it only makes me angry/annoyed for a few seconds or maybe minutes depending. Like I could be in the shops and just randomly think of him. Sometimes I wouldn't think of him for days but then I get a dream where he tried to track me down and hurt me. (he always had bad anger issues...) He lives in the same town as me but fortunately I very rarely see him.But when I do,hes with that girl or another one and that instantly puts me in a bad mood because of how much that hurt me when he broke up with me. I'm over him and definitely much happier being single. Thankfully all this stuff happens a lot less often now than before. I know theres no way to forget about him completely but I really want to find a way to stop thinking about him randomly like this so often. Any suggestions?",03Aug2019,1

I have no talents and have not amounted to a single thing in life. I am 17 and have tried so much only to watch others do what I fail at with ease. Are others like me? Honestly I have gotten so desperate to feel unique in any way, that I started making up stupid crap and connecting coincidences to act like I was lucky and that was my thing. But I finally realized that I was and am just living in a fantasy. I realized that I am nothing. This isn't a cry for help or a search for sympathy or pity. I just want to know if I am missing something. Making a mistake (as that happens more often than success, obviously)

737,"I had to call the police on my husband yesterday for pointing a loaded gun at me. He pulled the slide thing on top and the bullet flew out, I don't know if that's what it was supposed to do or not? He has severe mental issues and had been drinking heavy all morning. He was convinced the internet was out to get him. He thought everyone he knew was plotting against him. I only called the police when he left arguing on the phone with someone and grabbed a crow bar and the gun on his way out (called 911 with car description and gave directions to where I thought he was headed. They got him before he could hurt anyone). Our relationship has been rough for almost it's entirety. He has been abusive, but I have quite the silver tongue myself. I fully admit hitting him before out of complete frustration. He would hurt me for talking back or saying things he didn't want to hear. I went to with work a hand print on my cheek, bruises on my neck and mouth. He wouldn't talk to me, he would just pull the covers over his head until I went away. And then he started threatening my daughter (23), and forbidding my granddaughter (2) to come over. She's the one thing I enjoy, she's what's keeping me alive, honestly.
I can't afford our house without him. I don't even know what to do with his stuff if I have to move. I got an ex parte this morning so there's no contact, and he's currently in jail and no one is willing to bond him out. I need to talk to him about what to do but I can't. I don't have any real friends and I'm so scared and alone and my anxiety is through the roof not knowing what to do next, not knowing what the near future holds.
I feel awful. Guilty. I feel like I've abandoned him when he needs me the most. We swore we'd stay together forever. That we love each other even when we hate each other. He goes from loving me and needing me to not caring and hating me within minutes. Why do I feel so damn guilty? I miss him. I love him so so very much. Why can't I see that it's best for us to be apart? Please help me, give me the strength to not give in. I know that it wasn't the real him acting this way, it was the mental illness and alcohol. But I also know that's who he prefers to be because it's the easiest. I have to be convinced somehow that this is for the best, but my heart hates it 😢",03Aug2019,2

741," I (F/25) have been renting a room in a house for about 18 months. The owners are a retired married couple with a daughter my age, who live out of state and visit a couple of times each year. They have access to the spare bedroom, next to mine, whenever they choose. Last year I met the woman and her daughter for the first time and they were lovely. Last month I met her husband when he came to perform maintenance alone and stayed 4 nights. I didn't immediately feel uncomfortable, except that he hugged me closely when we parted after our first brief chat.. Wrote this off as him being over friendly. He then texted 3 or 4 times inviting me to spend time with him, including a drink downstairs together late one evening. Politely declined as it felt a bit weird, but still put it down to him being friendly/wanting to get to know his tenant. 

Weeks later alarm bells are ringing. Texting me  “I really did enjoy meeting you.......”   “It would be great to see you”  “I'm staying alone in (this state), there's room for you” “the bus is 6 hours and I'll pick you up” … I of course declined to which he said “One day xoxoxo” I don't even know this man beyond 20mins of smalltalk. I pay my rent to his wife who I just recently met along with his daughter, my age. I feel sick that he can come and go as he pleases and I'll be forced to be around him alone.   

I'm now cancelling my lease but I need to go over the condition of my room one on one with a landlord to release my bond. I do NOT want to be alone with this man.

I suspected it a bit from the beginning, after I tried some of the ice cream and felt sick, but I passed that off as cramps or an allergy (I'm a teenage girl) but after watching some r/antiMLM videos, I realized that it was a scam and after research on other websites, confirmed it.

So when I refuse because I'm working on my own interests and trying to learn the skills I need to make a living, he gets mad and says he doesn't get support from anyone in the family. 

 And in the beginning, I got really depressed because of that, but now I'm just angry, he doesn't give any signs that we are truly running out, he still does a bunch of things that aren't necessary for living, like ordering expensive food, smoking a lot, etc...

750,"    Hey, so I've know this girl (19) from highschool, we used to talk and stuff, then we stopped for a while for a reason, then few months ago we started talking again, not kids anymore we got mature enough to hold proper/serious conversations...
   2 months ago we agreed to start meeting every week just to talk and walk arround the city, drink some coffee, we started getting intimate, speaking out our fears and problems, we managed to get so close to each others.
 
    The problem is, sometimes when I think of it , i feel like this whole situation has to take us somewhere, and that we should step up and form a good couple/ healthy relationship. But I'm afraid, I always ask myself if she really likes me back or not (even if it's obvious), sometimes I feel like It's not worth my time cuz it'll end up with a hard breakup that I'm not ready for, and I feel deep inside that if I saw her dating another guy I'd be so upset (and it'll be my fault).

   I know that I'm just being an overthinking pessimistic dude, and it's not healthy, my biggest problem is me.

however, i’ve applied to at least 15 places and most of them don’t ever even email me back, and the very rare occasion they do, they decline me and don’t even set up an interview. i thought it was just my lack of experience at first, but something recently happened that makes me question if i’m being discriminated against somehow. 

both my friends with American or “normal” sounding names that are easy to pronounce both applied to Target and got interviews and then got hired on the spot. me? i have the same job experience as them- like literally; we all worked the same summer job this year- and i didn’t even get an interview. they just declined me right off the bat. 

i’ve read before that target has gotten into big trouble for discriminating against blacks, latinos, and the disabled. i looked it up and there was a lawsuit last year against them for it. my friend even told me that the women that work in her store aren’t allowed to wear shorts, only pants or skirts- which in my opinion is borderline sexist. but that’s not the issue right now. 

this is becoming a pattern, and it makes me so sad but is it possible they didn’t even want to hire me because of the way my name sounds? heck, they never even met me. never spoke to me. they just declined me, and accepted both my friends who have the same level of job experience as me but normal sounding western names. please let me know what you guys think.",03Aug2019,2

754,"I'll get this out of the way first and then post more detail below.  


**TL;DR**  
My girlfriend is from India and she moved here to the USA when she was 10. Her US ID and birth certificate says a different age than she actually is. She is 20 and her ID says she is 22. Is she just going to marry me to become a US Citizen and not tell me or would there have to be papers that I would have to sign? I don't know if those are fake ID's or if its just actually that easy to spoof your age when you come to USA from another country.  


**More Detail**

So I'm 25 she is 20 and we met at work. We have been in a relationship for 6 months now but she cant tell anyone in her family about me because she is not allowed to have a boyfriend. Recently, about 3 months ago her ""brother"" got hired in at our work. We cant tell him about our relationship so we keep it secret from everyone at work. Through certain events I found out that he was actually not her brother so now I don't know who he is because she is being weird about everything. Things just don't match up, like his facebook family is different than her family, he told me that he still lives at home with his parents but his and her address is different. And a family friend of theirs told me that they are not really brother and sister but did not go into detail because I'm just a stranger.  


So with all that, I'm thinking he is her real boyfriend and she is just using me. She doesn't seem to enjoy sex with me, everytime she just says it hurts to much and pushes me off. We have only hung out in like 10 times in the 6 months that we have been together. But she says she loves me more than anything.

757,"One of my best friends in high school and I pretty much lost touch after we graduated, except for an occasional Facebook message. 

I moved to New York. He moved to Chicago. 

Fast forward 30+ years and my wife and I decide to visit Chicago.  I get in touch with my old friend and he meets us for a drink before a Cubs game.  

We had a good time chatting and reminiscing. At least that’s how it seemed to me and my wife. 

We enjoyed Chicago on that trip and decided to move here. 

I told my friend we were Chicago bound. A couple of months after settling in, I reached out again and we met for lunch near his work. 

Again, good times. Easy conversation and laughs. He even mentioned that next time I come up, I could bring my guitar and we could have a little jam session. He works at a place where we could do that. 

A couple of months later, my wife was going out of town for work.  I texted my friend to say that if he was around, my wife was going out of town and that he could bring a guitar, come check out our place, and have some beer and a pizza. 

My iPhone showed that he read the message. 

No reply.  That was last November. Not a peep from him since. He’s never been one to initiate anything really so I guess no surprise there. 

I get that he’s married and he and his wife pretty much keep to themselves. My wife and I are then same way. I really had no interest in having a couples get together. I was just hoping to stay in touch now and then and maybe get together even once or twice a year to catch up or play some music or just have a beer. 

Today I was cleaning out my text messages and I came across the last one I sent him. For laughs, mostly, I wrote him again “I guess that’s a no...haha”.  No reply so far. 

By accounts from other old friends who have kept in touch and seen him now and then, he and his wife pretty much keep to themselves as mentioned, but it’s just so odd to me to be able to pick up where we left off 30 years ago, laughing and chatting and not be able to get even a superficial friendship going again.

He was a really confident guy and the most well-liked in the restaurant. This did not bother him at all, at the time. I quit the job as I was offered a better one, but one of my friends from high school (Brian, we’ll call him) started working there not too long ago. I told him to call Nate a cück for me to continue the joke, as at the time it meant nothing more.

Well, between that time and when Brian called him a cück, I stopped by the restaurant to take a shift, as my other job (construction) was rained out for a few days. Nate told me his gf broke up with him, and he seemed hurt about it. I was supportive and tried to cheer him up, and of course at this point I would never call him a cück, as that would be insensitive in the situation. But I had forgotten what I told Brian, and a few days later when they next worked together, I suppose he said something like “OP wanted me to call you a cück.” And I only remembered this when I saw Brian after this happened. I would hope that Nate would take it as a joke, but I doubt he has in this situation. If I had known about the break-up, I never would’ve asked him to say something like that.

We were at a birthday yesterday, all three of us. From the start my bf was in a bad mood and it got worse when i told him to fucking eat something before drinking alcohol. He says himself that he gets drunk easily and has eaten like three spoons full of nutella for lunch. 
When we went out to get so fresh air he almost yelled at me for annoying him with eating something. He wasn't happy about me smoking and started discussing with me what we will do about going to university this fall. I really didn't want to talk about all those topics and just get back to the party because i didn't want to fight. But somehow he was being really argumentative. Normally he is never like that so I didn't get why he wanted to talk about those things right now. 
I was happy to get back in and just sat next to my friend who comforted me. 
About 2 hours and some drinks later. I left with my friend to get some cigarettes because I didn't have any anymore. So we talked and laughed a lot but then I told him about the argument with my boyfriend before and our discussions about the university topic. I got sad again and he embraced me. We just stood there and he hugged me really tight.
And to be fair from this point every thing is just a big mess because i was so in shock.
My bf showed up and wasn't happy about us cuddling so he hit my friend. It than escalated really bad so i tried to stop them.
I got pushed to the ground really hard. I have to many bruises on my body and I broke two of my front teeth really bad. I was always so proud of my teeth because i wore braces for seven ducking years and they were finally perfectly in shape.

My other uncle who hasn't been involved starts to laugh and I laugh really really hard because his laugh is just the funniest laugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Then, my uncle who I was in a heated debate with starts to get REALLY  aggressive, I tell him what's up?

and he thinks I laughed because he had no work because of the ""90-year-old - 10 years old depends on the work"" comment I made earlier. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him it has NOTHING to do with this AT ALL. And assure him multiple times

yet he tells me I'm a Kid I need to grow up and I'm a little baby for acting so immature

Tells me how he takes no shit as a 50-year-old, 

Proceeds to say ""I don't care what you say I'm old enough so I don't care"" 

And so much with his age and how he's better than me, how he's more intelligent, and ya da ya da. 

I tell him he's not talking to a kid anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know 24 years is not old. But I'm reaching a point of my life, where I'm starting to see stuff in a new light. I'm more mature in my actions, I don't act like a kid. I'm a well-spoken, proper grown man. 

&amp;#x200B;

And every time he uses his age excuse I roll my eyes. 

And he's been using that excuse ever since the day I was born I swear. 

He uses it for everything. And I have no idea what to do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, he's got more life experience, but I'm not some 18-year-old kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------

I took multiple breaks from him because of stupid comments from him, and I'm always the one returning to say ""sorry it was my fault"" to be the grown man and let's have a nice friendly chat again. 

&amp;#x200B;

He keeps poking me with negative comments, try to make me angry, sometimes I talk back other times I let it slide and tell myself - ""and you say you're so mature"". 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know I could just contact all contact with him, but he's my uncle after all. Most of the time we have it pretty good and we get along together a lot. 

I know I make him out to be an asshole on this post, he really isn't. But when he acts like this he is. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's a great guy all around and we tend to have some nice chats together. 

&amp;#x200B;

\------------

&amp;#x200B;

\- I know I could just not go into a debate with him and brush it off, but I just don't wanna sit and be a - target for him he can spill his shit on. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- If I leave he sits and talks shit behind my back I know it, and I don't like that at all. 

\- If I go into a debate with him, he throws the age and mature card. 

\------

He says he isn't a person that ""remembers stuff and think about it"" 

but if we've been into a debate he remembers everything and can't let go of anything and all I have said he takes as negative. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone got any ""ADVICE""?

I like him and he is family, I told him multiple times not to act so ""selfish?""

but it always ends wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's a good guy, but very ""arrogant"" and ""childish? - selfish? in arguments. And worst of all. If I don't react or I do react he always ""poke me"" with negative comments and try and make me mad. If I call him out he says he does nothing wrong and I should stop being so susceptible",03Aug2019,1

Temp was in the 80’s and it was way too hot). She stumbled out and fell asleep on the bathroom floor. I’ve been with her for two hours. Her breathing has been regular, she hasn’t thrown up anymore.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",03Aug2019,0
768,"I went to a job interview, passed that. 20 turned up and 11 were supposed to go through to the next round. Went to the job induction a few days later(yesterday) from 7:45 to 4 only to be emailed an hour after I left that the company have decided not to continue with my application. They had invited 13 people and only had 11 spaces, we all assumed that they wouldn’t go through the trouble of having to turn away 2 people as they were getting us to sign all sorts. But I guess they did.

I’m fine with their decision because everyone gets rejected, it’s a part of life! But it still hurts that I was one of 2 that got rejected and everyone else went through.

To be fair, I wasn’t planning on staying long at this job but it still hurts. The weird thing was, a job I applied to ages ago called my number during the lunch break to offer me an interview which i’m going to on Monday. Perhaps someone up there knew what was going to happen. I don’t know.

769,"I'm planning to major in computer science, my reasons are mostly because I feel it would be practical and I love working in computers. I have 0 experience in coding or any knowledge beyond just simple tasks in computers/tech, so i feel somewhat inadequate. I also never did well in math back in high school, because it often felt overwhelming and I always lacked any motivation to learn it if it wasn't practical. Geometry was the only class I loved and excelled in, and it was thanks to my teacher explaining it in a way that was grounded and based on logic/reasoning. 

The worst part was that in high school, whenever I attempted to ask why something worked the way it did, I'd usually be frowned down upon for even questioning it, it was like ""how could you not know?!?"" Well shit that's why I'm asking! This in turn has made me lose confidence in any advanced form of math. 

I want to know what minor would best compliment a computer science Major?

My goals in life is to be qualified to become a Police Detective/Officer and in the case that it's not my thing,  have the qualifications and knowledge to also start and run a Business in any industry I'd like (I'd prefer anything culinary or artistic). I want to be able to manage and maintain a business successfully. I'd also like to expand and understand myself so I know my strengths and weaknesses.


Options for my minor/AA to compliment my Major:

1.Business Administration

2.Accounting

3.Computer Science (with the risk of potentially screwing up my college GPA because of my weakness in math).",03Aug2019,1

But I'm not exactly ""handy"" when it comes to this kind of stuff. And really  the WHOLE place needs updating. Even the bathrooms have this hideous, pink tile, the carpets need replacing (I'd probably lean towards that flooring that looks like wood, but isn't actually wood, which I could install myself). Just a lot of work.

I'd probably be inclined to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room to open the place up, all the cabinets and appliances need replacing, and I'd probably put in an island in the kitchen.

As far as anyone can tell, though, it SEEMS to be in good condition, cosmetics aside. I'm just curious what those kind of renovations might cost, though? Kitchen and 2 bathrooms are the main things, and replacing all of the carpet. Also painting, but again, I could handle that.

780," 

I am a 26 year old male, Through circumstance I am forced to live with my mom now while I go to college. I am starting a new part time job weekend job, I drive for lyft and uber, and I build websites for my dad sometimes. I asked my mom to pick up seltzer water since she was at the grocery store. She said no, and that took me by surprise, so I told her please, I will give you money. To which she says we will see. I went out of my way 2 nights ago to pick her up tylenol at midnight, and I will help her out whenever she needs it. Not because I expect I am owed anything, I normally don't really ask for anything, I just help out because it is the right thing to do and I feel bad if I don't. I reminded her that I just went out of my way and did an errand for her, so why can't she just pick up seltzer water at the store for me, essepcially since I am giving her money for it.

When she came home, she told me ""I don't have a pot to piss in, so she was protecting me from the judgement of my step father,"" who apparently would look down on me for not being able to afford the $3 seltzer water, and I dont do favors for her becausue I expect some kind of reward. She then proceeded to tell me that my thinking was toxic because I was going to the worst possible place when the reason she didn't want to buy me seltzer is because she doesn't think anyone who can't entirely support themselves financially shouldn't be able to enjoy anything. I don't know what she expects me to do, just eat nothing but flour and drink water? How should I handle this situation?",03Aug2019,1

our history is complicated as fuck, but here’s a general. in the past her and i were in a committed mono relationship.. things didn’t work as we wanted really different things out of life. i wanted to be married and have kids (things we’d agreed to through our relationship, not just me pushing her into it).. she eventually found that she didn’t want those things at all. fast forward to after the break up she finds herself in a poly relationship with a male and ends up getting pregnant. i was destroyed, felt betrayed, and generally did not fare well. 

we’ve maintained a pretty close relationship, despite everything. except when i took a break and my time trying to figure out if we should be in one another’s lives. 

i’ve become more accepting of the life’s circumstances. i understand that she is happy and i have a chance to be happy and grow with her.. if i give up a few things, which at this point, is okay by me. not because i want to be with her.. but because life.

I have given him every piece of advice I can think of: Look for a new job, confront your boss and ask for a pay raise, go back to waiting tables at restaurants and go back to school. But he always tells him it's too hard for him to go in there and confront his boss, even though I give him specific advice on how to approach it. He says he doesn't have time to look for a new job, and he can't afford to go back to school (even though he is living with his mom and she has offered to help pay for his schooling) I love the guy, he's been a loyal friend of mine for over a decade. But he is in a supervisor role and is literally afraid to confront people about things and has grown up in a laissez-faire parenting situation. I can't take much more of his one-way bitch fests and occasional drunken sobbing over the phone. I have tried to just stay silent for awhile so that he'll pick up that I just don't want to listen to this, and at some point he'll go ""Sorry man, I know I'm ranting"" and when I try to change the subject he'll eventually revert back to work. I've told him over and over that what I've told him are his only options and he's just going to have to face up about it.
