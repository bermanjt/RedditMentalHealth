0,My parent’s house was recently robbed (I live there) of $1500 worth of electronics. I have called the police and they have investigated already. Is there anything we can do? We know the people but also know they have guns that they can use on us. Help!,24Sep2019,1

3,"Any advice on how to assist him through this horrible time? It’s been hard for me to hear some things people are saying about the poor boy who is no longer with us (suicide is selfish, he knew he was going to be found by him, why did he do it at home, so selfish, etc etc.) , as I am currently suicidal myself. My friend does not know and this certainly is not the time to tell them. But it’s hard trying to assist him and listen to him vent to me and hearing about the way he found the body, the note etc etc. 

But I won’t let it hold me back from looking after my friend who is now struggling and grieving. 
Not only was he my friends roommate, he was also family friend for years beforehand. 

I personally have not experienced loss (that I can properly remember, only when I was very young) so it is hard for me to help with that and even more so with him being the one to find his mates body. 

Tldr - my friend found his roommate after he committed suicide and he was also a family friend to him. 

Any advice would be immensely appreciated, thanks for reading!",24Sep2019,2

5,"I work full time and enrolled in 6 credits. 

Life has been currently throwing a curve ball at me. I’ve had a cough since late August and it’s bounced between a cough, loads of mucus, fevers, headaches, vomiting, etc. 

The reality of it is I can’t focus, between this and work, it’s really hard to pull it together at this point. 

I got diagnosed with bronchitis, and I feel like this is going to last until the end of the year. 

I have plans on emailing admissions tomorrow and letting them know my situation. I started doing work in early to mid September, but I started to slowly taper off. 

Any tips on how to compose the email?",24Sep2019,1
6,"I don't want to live in fear, I'm not in a bad part of town or anything. My house is small and cute and not spooky at all. I have a can of pepper spray just in case. I dunno, I'm not used to being alone, I'm really not used to being alone with a baby at night. Before I was put in this situation where I'm alone here a lot, I liked scary stories and horror movies and spooky YouTube stuff and that's coming back to haunt me now. How do you get relaxed and enjoy being alone. I want to enjoy my time alone in my house with my son instead of count the minutes until my husband gets home.",24Sep2019,1
7,"I hate my hair. I’ve lived with it for seventeen years, and I feel like it’s time for it to go, so I made an appointment to get it cut in a few days.

I haven’t told my mom this. She knows I’m going to get it cut, but she doesn’t know how short. When I tried to cut all my hair off three years ago, she flipped out and we got into a huge fight, so I’ve been planning on only telling her once the deed is done. She thinks I’ll look like a boy.

This is a pretty asshole thing for me to do, but I’ve been waiting so long to do this. No matter what happens, I’ll end up unhappy. Either I’ll have hair that I hate or a massive fight with my mom.

I feel like there’s no sense in waiting because no matter what age I do this at, she’ll get mad at me.

Do I just bite the bullet and cut my hair, or should I put it off for another two years? I really need some logical thinking here and not just my friends telling me to do whatever I want.",24Sep2019,2

Super long post. Just warning you. Semi-Long TLDR at bottom.

I don't care what advice you give me, i'll read it all. Thank you.

INFO: I'm 13 and a guy.

Sorry if this wall of words is confusing, and thank you for trying to read. I really appreciate it.

I \*think\* I have been dealing with depression for a while. There is a voice that keeps telling me that I don't have it, and that i'm just being edgy. I \*think\* I have known I had it since like, 9? I dunno just one day I was very happy outgoing and a really cool and funny kid than I just became so anti-social and would hole up and was super self concious and it killed my parents inside a bit, I can tell. I am so sad and lonely and I get sucked into toxic relationships and hurt people all the time. I don't think of myself as very smart and I worry myself sick about school even if its not a big deal. I don't have the heart to tell my parents because when I told my mom when I was 10 she cried for 2 days straight. We had moved to a condo at the time and that was very bad. My mom and dad fight often and every time I hear yelling I get so scared. We all have a decent to good relationship with each other, and that is good. If I get yelled at sometimes i'll be at the verge of tears, and its so embarrassing for me. I don't have too many friends besides at school and we're pretty much only friends because of school. They're nice people, but I feel like I have absolutely no one. I know this sounds really stuck up and I sound like a fucking idiot, but I feel like I am more mature than them. They still joke about poop and laugh about it. Of course a lot of the time i'm no more mature but in other aspects I just feel so alone. The only other people that age that actually want to talk to or that I have the courage to talk to are people online. I've met some good people but in all honesty i'm horrible making friends online as well. And don't even get me started on all the weird people that have added me trying to get something out of me, and all the people who I trusted who were strange and bad people to hang out with. When I find a new friend I kind of get really clingy and I never want to be left behind, I will always say wait up or something because I have an extreme fear of getting left out. I get a sinking feeling in my stomach when I feel like i'm missing out. The clingy thing I do is embarrassing to me because I am so annoying sometimes I feel. Not to mention i'm self concious as hell. Sometimes I will be doing okay in a social situation, and can do alright, but other times i'll freeze up and panic and stumble and fucking trip in my mind. I love video games and music. I know this sounds stupid and of course its been said a lot, but its a nice escape for me. My dad is actually the same and we both understand the fact we need alone time after school/work. I am glad that we get along on that front. I have made one or two friends from my music taste, and a lot from video games. But I don't have a lot (like 1-3 at most) friends online at one point. I focus all my attention on one person online and I forget about other people when I post somewhere to find friends. I am also extremely reluctant to share my music taste to people in real life, and I panic more than if I were to tell them a dark secret for some reason. This is embarrassing to say but honestly I kind of long for an S.O. I am bi and i'm not ashamed to say that, but for some reason I am to say my goddamn music taste but that is besides the point. I want an S.O but I don't see the point until at LEAST the last year of high school to try to find an S.O. There is no point because obviously 99 percent of the time these relationships fail and aren't even serious, yet all my friends have girlfriends. I dunno its just a desperate want for something that I know I will not get. I love to make people laugh too, but I don't succeed very often in it. When I do I feel really happy. I have online friends that make me laugh a bunch, and when I try to make them laugh and they don't or just let out a pity chuckle, I feel awful. Some friends pretty much only laugh at practical jokes towards me or occasional really good jokes by me. Everyone of my friends I feel is either smarter, more popular, or has some other one up on me. I am not jealous, kind of the opposite actually. I often actually wonder WHY these people would want to be friends with me. I don't understand it, because a lot of the time I think I should be the loner, or have only one or two friends. I've drunk before, and it was pathetic. I did it with some friends online and the times we did it when I think back on it now we were all so goddamn stupid and sad. I don't take good care of my ears by blasting music into them, my eyes look at a screen all the time too. I don't know what I want anymore. I know this also sounds really edgy and I sound like i'm posting a qoute online, but I don't cry often unless if I hear yelling. I will get so extremely sad (i'm actually really sad right now, that is why i'm posting this) and just not cry. I can show happiness well, anger VERY well (we'll get into that soon) and all the other emotions I guess I do fine. But I don't cry much anymore. It was a day before school started and I was so goddamn scared. I was shaking. But I just wasn't crying, and I worried about what was wrong with me and what people would think, what I would do, how smart I am ect. I get very angry when i'm at my limit and flip out, throw stuff and yell really loud. But I always cry while doing it. I think its not i'm as angry (even though i'm pretty damn angry to get to that point) but I think it might be my sadness coming out that way? I don't know.

TLDR: I think i'm depressed, wonder why friends are friends with me cause they're ""better"", can't cry unless i'm angry, but cry when I hear yelling - think i'm too mature for my age (yes I know it sounds edgy) don't want to tell my parents I think i'm depressed because i'd make them really sad, Want a S.O but at the same time see no point in getting one, and a lot more.

Thank you for reading the TLDR or the whole thing. Thank you for trying to help in any way shape or form. If you need info i'll be getting home from school at about 2:30pm so i'll respond around then guys. THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!",24Sep2019,1
11,"I recently stood up for a kid who was being picked on in a team that we both are a part of. This team consists of kids/adults of all ages ranging from 5-20.

They constantly state that they're humble and that they're a family. However, in recent times, these morals have flown out the window.

They constantly talk other teams down and recently, have been picking on this kid since he joined. Is this really what humble and being a family means?
They're justification for picking on him is ""we're a family and that's what family does"" and ""the world isn't fair, we're preparing you for the outside"".

The kids join to destress from whatever goes on at home or school, but instead, they're exposed to the same exact environment that they were trying to avoid.

Am I crazy for sticking up for the kid? I have now left the team as they're building a culture that bullying is okay.
Yes I know, fun banter here and there is fine, I'm not saying it's not.
They make me out to be the bad person for starting a shit fight, but I feel as if I'm just sticking up for what's right? 

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm at work so there isn't much time to write a whole essay.",24Sep2019,2
12,"I'm at a point in my life where I really want to go back to school and get a bachelors degree, as well as a good college experience. I have some college credits from attending state college for a semester (school wasn't right for me/wanted to spend time traveling) and some community college classes, so I would want to transfer the credits rather than starting from scratch. 

Heres the problem: I'm from California, and I don't really want to stick around, if I could I'd go to school somewhere like Colorado or the East Coast. My grades in high school were shall we say, unimpressive, and my college credits grades are A's and B's but I haven't taken a lot of Math and Science classes. Financially, my family doesn't have the money to put me through college, and I doubt I would qualify for a lot of financial aid because my grades aren't very sexy. Also, I would consider going to a UC or CSU but California schools are pretty rigid on transfers. So the question is, whats the best move for me here? Does it make sense to stay in California and knock out more Community College even if I'm unhappy? Should I just move and establish residency someplace? Should I say the hell with college and just try to make it without a degree? 

Any advice would be very appreciated, thank you",24Sep2019,2
13,"Yesterday I got a job offer for a position I would really like to have, but I found out that the drug screening would be this morning. 
By the time I found out yesterday the local smoke shop was about to close in 15 minutes,

I bailed on my friend and gassed it all the way to the store to get the Stinger extra strength. Because that thing will help you piss Aquafina. It works great, five stars on yelp. 

I bailed on my dead end job this morning to go to this interview. I was already guaranteed the position, I knew that part walking in. I was just nervous about passing the drug test. 
I was allllll set up, good to go, my bladder was locked and loaded with 30 dollars worth of cheating the system. I was about to burst when I was sitting in that chair. 
Aaaaaand that’s when she broke the mouth swab out....

Uh oh.... I can’t piss on a mouth swab... 

So she waits 10 minutes to guarantee that I haven’t drank anything before the test. 

She steps away for a minute for a phone call and I ask if I can use the restroom. She says sure!

My mischievous self goes and let’s loose on 30 dollars worth of piss, and then I rush to the sink. I start swishing water around and then I have a brilliant idea, WASH MY MOUTH OUT WITH THE HAND SOAP. 

Ooooh boy it was delicious scrubbing that around.  I opened my mouth and blew a bubble, I swear to God. 

Then when I took the test I kept moving it around the upper part of my mouth and using my tongue instead of my gums. 

I also drank tons of cranberry juice prior to the test, and I brushed my teeth multiple times, once with charcoal powder ( for whitening and cleaning purposes) 

Was the brushing my teeth intensely, cranberry juice all night and morning, extra strength detox drink (intended for piss), scrubbing my mouth with hand soap and drinking water within 10 minutes of the test, and not holding it still in my mouth enough to throw this test????

I do smoke often
And Incase of a retest, I have the mouth wash now. 

But damn I’m nervous!!!!!

14,"So basically this girl was trying to give me Doritos but I'm not fond of them so I said ""I don't really like doritos I'm good.""

Anyways i didn't think much of it but then my sister told me that the teacher said if someone's offer you a present just accept it. But it's like I don’t really like Doritos and I don’t really want to look for someone to have it. I know this isn't a big deal but was I being rude or should i just accepted the chips?

15,"My boyfriend and I just recently went through a really rough month. We couldn’t seem to decide whether or not we wanted to stay together. He left me a few times (times in which we never stayed broken up for more than 4 hours) and one of those times I told my friend he broke up with me. My friend suggested I give her single male friend a ride to the movies. She was obviously suggesting I flirt with him to get my mind off of by boyfriend (assumed ex). I agreed to go to the movies with him, my friend and her boyfriend and their other couple friends to meet him as a friend only, not to flirt. I skipped out on the movie to go to my boyfriends house (we’d worked things out for good) and I told him about this situation. He read the texts and now does not want me around my friend, though he says he’s not going to tell me not to be around her because it’s not his place. He refuses to try and forgive her.

19,"5 years ago I met the love of my life, he was my best friend and we did everything together and he helped me become the best me. But, he suffered from mental illness and about 2 months ago he committed suicide. I've been totally lost, alone, and not to mention broke from losing 1 income. I've been trying to meet new people since this happened to get out of my house and I met this woman who is a sugar baby and she was talking about how she loved it. While, I have admittedly thought about this in a joking tone, it's growing on me more in these last few weeks. I'm so alone, I miss the comfort of a man, but I'm in no way ready for a real relationship, and I don't do hook ups. She said there is an option to say you don't have sex, or sex has to be worked up to. Anyway, that isn't an expectation the Sugar Daddies are having. Is this so wrong? To make some money and enjoy some company by spending time with an equally lonely man? Please be kind, I'm looking for real advice, maybe even from a current or previous Sugar Baby/Daddy. TIA

She drove an hour today with me, my friend, and my 4 year old sister in the car, drunk, swerving and having a rough drive.  Not only that but it was raining today and I just feel like shit today in general. How in the hell do I stop her? I already confronted her and she just took off in our car. I know she’s going to come home, drunk, and wail and cry all in her bedroom. We’re Christian and I told her that as not only her son, but her caring brother in Christ that she should stop.

21,"Hey guys, so quick background that is important to the subject I need advice on. I was kicked out back in November when I turned 18 and have bounced jobs for a couple of different reasons. I currently sell computers and related items with no commission and barely make above minimum wage/it’s only a part time job as I can’t find a full time one yet. I get paid bi weekly and have roughly 700-800 a month in bills before paying my “rent”. Now onto the question at hand:

I live with my mom rn and she’s been screwing my financially asking for random bits of money here and there. As well as I pay her 250 a month for the “electric bill” as she says. Well rewind about a month ago and turns out where we live she pays 0 dollars a month to live here (it’s an old family home), and she just uses my 250 for bar tabs and CC payments. I was curious over that cause she at least could have been honest and lowered the amount cause 250 pays like 4 of her CC bills every month alone... I’ve been broke as a joke recently barely scraping by myself and I had ~100 in my bank the other week. She says she just needed some money towards the “electric bill” that month cause she couldn’t pay all the bills herself. (Keep in mind I’ve given her almost 2K in payments now) I say fine and go along with it and give her 40, what does she do with it? Gets a tattoo at a convention about 30 minutes away...I’ve literally been fuming over the last few days cause of this and am at my breaking point (there are other factors involved as well). My issue? If I confront her I’m scared that I’ll be homeless again cause I have no where else to live at the moment. Both me and my gf live here and sleep on couches, if we confront her over this BS we could both end up on the curb and I want to avoid that. What do I do? Where do I go from here?",24Sep2019,1
22,"Tldr: Fine arts major, working and in college,  but I want to learn guitar. Don't know if I should try cause of serious time restraints though. 

About a week ago, I bought a first act guitar off a friend. And I've been debating weather I should spend time learning it or, spend more time on my actual craft, which is like drawing and painting and stuff. But at the same time I've been wanting to try learning for years, enough that I tried to grab my father's left handed guitar and learn on my own a few times, with no amp, and got nowhere. (I realized that was a big mistake lol, no amp no sound. And I was such a noob, I didn't realize you need an amp to get anywhere.)  I also thought it might be a bit of stress relief. Art is nice and all, but since it's my major, I spend a lot of time drawing something serious and it gets stressful. So I can't really take a break from it/relieve stress by drawing some more. Hoping maybe someday guitar will be that stress relief, and I can spend less time playing games and spend more time doing something that's self improving. Maybe one day I can write a song, and it'll get me more into music! (Hell maybe in someway shape or form it'll help my art!) 

Anyway, point is:  
Is it worth picking it up as like a small hobby, or is it something I have to really invest myself into to do anything. (I know with art that you have to invest a month to get anywhere.) 

Also how do I learn? ( I know with art, just drawing and doing drawing drills won't get you that far, but learning tricks and techniques will get you a lot father. And there's the whole fail fast learning strategy for art. Is that the same for guitar?) 

(Should also include I have no musical knowledge what so ever. I know I said I picked it up a few times, but I gave up without learning anything since I just had no sound.)",24Sep2019,2

24,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Ok so I have had this really good friend (Male) for about 8 years now, and for one reason or another, I have never met his sister until this weekend. She's 10 years older than me and we had a good time at my friend's birthday party. We drank and partied at his house until 6 am, at which point my friends went to sleep and I stayed talking with his sister for a good hour, then we came to talk about sex and past lovers. One thing lead to another and we ended up having sex in the backyard. We had a good time and then went to sleep as we were both really tired. Next morning we went to breakfast with his parents and his sister. It was super akward for both of us. As we were hungover, we didn't really talk about it. 

My friend has no idea so far about the whole thing. My question is should I tell my friend or should we both just stay quiet about it? Should I contact his sister to talk about the thing and agree on something?",24Sep2019,2
28,"Hi, I don’t know if anyone will see this. It’s gonna be a long story but it would mean a lot of you take the time to read because I just need some unbiased advice. I ask if you use my story anywhere to cross out my name and profile please. Okay, so I’m 20 years old, soon to be 21. I’ve had a a pretty traumatic life that has caused several mental issues. Which has caused my serious attachment issues. I’d like to think it began with my dad, my whole life he has been on hard drugs. Never consistent always broken promises to follow. He pops up every once in a while when he becomes clean for a few weeks then will disappear again. My mom who I love so dearly is also an addict. She’s always been in my life but it wasn’t always pretty she started using drugs after meeting my dad. But always did her part and work as a mom. The only stability I had as a child was my grandmother my moms mother. She had us everyday because my mom was either at work or running around with my father. Around 2005 she developed cancer of the lungs which has spread to her brain. She suffers for a few years then finally passed away. Well my mom went off her rocker and began using drugs very heavily, met a man that abused her which made the drug use even more severe. One night he beat her so bad she had broken bones and CYS took us. We were in custody for several months. (Me and my brother) our foster home was worse then home. I won’t give details for sake of time.... soon after we went to our grandparents. My dads side. Not for long though. My mom got a new boyfriend to get custody of us. He was an honest man but loved my mom so much he’d let her have whatever she wanted as long as she would stay &amp; love him. He was an enabler. I’m the worst form. Yet he never used drugs. She really go bad then. She started going to jail and from the time I was 9 to now my mom was always in jail. He took care of us best he could for a man with no experience but after my mom went to jail for coming home high begging for money and when her boyfriend was out or wouldn’t give to her she would sell our belongings. I can count dozens of Xboxs &amp; tvs and computers she sold or pawned. Many Christmas mornings we woke up to nothing. But on this night it wasn’t  Christmas she came in realized there Was no money or anything to sell  she stabbed her boyfriend several times while I was in the kitchen. Scared to death I couldn’t even move. She continued to grab a second knife. It was a serrated knife she sat on the floor crying to me she dosent wanna go jail forever so she has to kill her self. She began sawing at wrists. I watched in horror not only losing my step dad I was gonna lose my mom. As blood fills the floor a snap out of it. I grab kitchen towels &amp; tie them on her wrist &amp; call the police.  They both survived but I went away . . — I was sent to a children’s homeless shelter where I lived for 3 years. It wasn’t bad. But I had no freedom. I could go outside or do anything regular pre teens do. At 15 I got out. My step dad was granted full custody though my mom was jail I was ecstatic. I was going home. I was home for a few months life was decent till he got sick of me then I was fat, a whore, and every terrible name you could say to a teenager. I wasn’t a whore though. But I started acting out. I went to party with friends and met up with a man. He was 25 I was 15 I lied to him. I told him I was 17 turning 18 soon. We had sex that night and I fell head over heels since then. Fast forward I moved in with him at 17 escaping my terrible home life. then told him the truth about my age. He was upset but he wasn’t going to put my on the street. He loved me and I was so mature nobody really saw me as that young I was advanced as any grown adult. As time went by things were great to me. I was completely attached to him.  I should’ve known it was off because when I got paid he took my whole pay checks. And blew through them by drinking and if I didn’t give it to him he wouldn’t take to me. Then things took a turn he was messing with other females they started harassing me. I went to the bar he was at one night and he completely embarrassed me. That’s when I should’ve ran but I didn’t. I was head over heels. Then things got more controlling and physical with him. But I brushed it under the rug because as long as I had him all was right in the world. I’d never had love in life and if this was it I was addicted. Then things started to get real bad with us, he wasn’t just hitting me or smacking me. He was beating me. Kicking me. Throwing me. Dragging me by hair. Punching me all over my body. Choking me. But afterwards he would say sorry. And hug my bruised body. And then again. All was right. Shortly after he was shot. I cared for him like child. I never left his side in the hospital, and when he came home I was at his beckon call for anything. I nursed him back to health. And In that time. That’s the happiest we ever were. He never yelled. Or got angry with me. We cuddled each other and endless affection. all day &amp; all night. As he got back to normal. So did everything else. He became the cold man all over again. He had a daughter which at the time I started becoming so close with. ( from his previous relationship) I loved her dearly. She held us together. I would watch her every weekend while he left us at home as he partied. Would come home and act like he wasn’t just gone for 36 hours. I got so DEPRESSED. Bad. Because no matter what he did I loved him so fucking much. Sooo much the thought without him drove me absolutely insane. So I started using pills. And they became my second love life. When I take them. It seems everything is just fine. I’m not hurt. I’m not depressed. I’m level. It became my only escape. And it was pure bliss to me. He shortly noticed it was becoming a problem then I was just an addict like my parents. But truth is at that time I wasn’t an addict. I was sick without them or anything but boy it was sucky day without them. I just was irritated without them. Then about 6 months go by and I find about another woman. Skip ahead to more trauma I could list. He leaves me. I was devastated. But I wouldn’t let anyone know I was sad about a man that mistreated me to several extremes. I’d look completely foolish. But I stopped using pills. I was broke I couldn’t afford them. But I was kinda relived. Because if I continued I was headed somewhere BAD. &amp; FAST. As I packed my things back to my parents I wasn’t so sad. But I missed him so much. I did anything not be sad anymore. I shacked with guys I had absolute no feelings for. It has been about 7 months now. (September 2019) and heres my problem. I still love him. I still want to be with him.  And I know it is so wrong and so pathetic. But I can’t help it. I’d do anything to have him back. But I know that’s not a good option. Can someone please give some advice on how to heal and move on from this trauma. How can I move on from this man. I’m so damaged &amp; my attachment issues are so screwed up I feel like I’m beyond help. Someone. Anyone with advice, is appreciate it. Please no mean comments as right now I’m going through depression. Thank you. 😘",24Sep2019,1

32,"So we were doing a notebook check in class, i noticed that i was missing an assignment that i never got back from the teacher. So i told the kid grading my notebook to just ignore it for now, and i would go and ask the teacher about it. After he finished grading the rest, i took my notebook up to my teacher, and told her about the assignment that i didn't get back. She then accused me of lying to the person who was grading my notebook, because he wrote i told him to write N/A when apparently he should have just gave me a zero. Now i can accept that i was wrong, but i can't accept her just accusing me of lying when i wasn't hiding anything from her. Then she threatened to give me a zero on the notebook check just because of this. And finally the next day she called me in to tell me off again for ""lying"".

36," 

I've been diagnosed with eating disorder for 17 years. Otherwise, I got several differential diagnosis and I've been trying to look for help for ten years. I've been prescribed many antidepressants, benzies, Seroquel, etc. Antidepressants would make me go ""out of character"", like in a manic craze to avoid the depression. I don't remember a lot about these times.

I've been in treatment for personality disorders for 1.5 years now. I tried to follow up, I told my therapist at times I thought I might be bipolar or ADHD, or something. She saw me being very agitated at times, she often said things go way too fast inside my own head. When I get really depressed, she says I'm much more ""well-thought"" as before. Today, I called her in an urgency because I felt like my whole world was crashing down - and has been for a while (I talked to her about it two weeks ago but she didn't seem to mind).

I told her I want to get a sick leave and she told me I can't avoid life again, and that I need to just ""hold on"" and show up on therapy, and everything will be alright. I told her I don't think the diagnosis fits, the therapy doesn't seem to work that well, it is a cyclic thing (always on autumn and spring, and it resolves magically 2-3 months after and always come back). I told her that if I need a treatment, I would like to get it because right now, I'm fucking dying. She said I called her, showed up her, still go to work - everything is fine, I'm still doing things. I got out of there crying. Felt hopeless.

To be honest, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel kinda like my whole life is going to be destroyed by these periodic moods. Right now, it feels like the walls are closing on me.

I don't know what to do, I'm afraid to show up at the clinic and to say ""Hello this is me, I'm still not good."". I feel like the only way out would be to just... IDK, I need help and advices. Thanks.",24Sep2019,1
37,So tomorrow I(M15) have a school trip coming up. Didn't think much of it till this lady approached me in recess. She asked if I'm coming to the trip tomorrow. I told her probably and yes. Then I asked why she was asking. She laughed and said just asking. Didn't think much of it but was still intrigued. I'm new to this school. And this trip is a great opportunity to make new freinds and meet new people. And I really need it. I've been sitting alone for the past 2 weeks. But my sister who is working to become a dentist has an appointment for me. And I can't cancel because that would ruin her credit as she is studying to become a dentist. So I have no option but to cancel on the trip that could really do me some Good with a few freinds and whatnot. Am I overthinking this? I really wanted to go and it really breaks my heart that I can't. But maybe I'm just thinking too much of it? I sure hope I am. Because I can't go. Well what do I do in this situation? (where I can't go) am I maybe over thinking this? It's really pissing me off. What do I do?,24Sep2019,1

I'm not super introverted and I connect with a lot of people but I have trouble making the connection between acquaintance and friend.

I have 1 close female friend and 2 good male friends who don't go to school with me.  I'm not really an ugly guy, skinny build and kinda average look, but I've never been great socially mostly due to the confidence thing.

I'm probably overreacting and getting in my own head too much but I've just noticed that in the month or so since school started my overall mood has dropped drastically.

We get along amazingly and he's always really considerate about me being comfortable with everything and never pressures or pushes me to do anything I dont want to.
Long story short we recently started exchanging pictures on SnapChat (nothing raunchy and no nudity just a bit extra skin) and he asked me if he could safe one of the pics (just some cleavage, no face), It was kinda spontaneous so I agreed to it but I started feeling weird about it shortly afterwards....
Isn't it weird for him to have a pic of me later on when we perhaps stop talking/have other relationships? 
Am I being weird about this since its my first time experimenting with anything like this or should I ask him to delete it?

42,"I am on mobile, and I am currently venting as this last argument happened less than half an hour ago, at the time of writing this, and it's pretty long, so if some things don't make sense, I'm sorry.
Recently, my mom and I have been at odds with each other, because I recently started going to a local community college, and my dad is currently overseas (he works for a contracting company that works for the US Military, but I won't say which one). Because of my recent start at college back in August, I have had tons of homework, and barely any free time. I still clean up after myself, but my mom seems to want me to clean up after my little siblings too. I am an 18M, and my younger siblings are  9F and 11M. My younger siblings are in a private elementary school, but don't seem to have much homework after coming home, but I have homework to finish after every class, but I'm still expected to clean up after them.
We've had multiple arguments, but they've been getting worse and worse as time goes on, until it ends with my mom telling me to move out, and I sat okay. Today she said, ""My life would be so much easier without you here,"" and I was offended so I walked away, but it keeps coming back, in different arguments since then.

45,"I’m at my limit from all this. Im going to try being as objective as I can so that i can get some real advice. 

I (21m) still live with my parents. I work a full time job and I don’t make enough money to live independently yet, but I’m taking on a couple better paying jobs soon in the city I want to live so that I can hopefully move out. 

My parents want me to give them all my spare money to help cover their bills. I’ve offered several times to give them a set rent if their choice amount as long as it’s reasonable for my earnings. They keep refusing in the basis of “the bills cost a different amount each month, so you should give us what you make to cover what we can’t.” 

They even go so far as to try taking over my personal bills so that I have less of a reason to keep my earnings. I let them do it a few times and every single time, they let it fall two or three months behind and I have to double down to get it back in control. 

For these reasons and many others, I think it’s time for me to get out and live my own life. I’ve had severe depression for years now and this situation is slowly killing me.

My mom broke down in tears today after I told her again that I’m still trying to move out. She thinks I hate her because I’m so tired after work I don’t want to help her with her small business anymore. 

My dad is completely passive to me every time I see him. I don’t see anything but disappointment when he looks at me. 

My brother constantly asks me why I want to leave this town. I’ve told him every time that this town isn’t what I want in life. It’s traditional and so removed from the rest of the world. I don’t like most of the people here and I truly believe my mental state will improve once I’m away from it. 

It feels like every step I’m taking to become independent, the more my home life is fractured. We don’t ever talk, we don’t go out to celebrate anything, it’s only work and sleep. 

I’m sitting here in my floor crying right now because I’m so alienated by the people I’m supposed to trust the most, but if I actually get away, I don’t think I’ll have a family to come back to in the future. Whether my dad leaves mom because his work and home life is in shambles, or my mom commits suicide from thinking I don’t care about her, or my sister runs away because she’s in the same situation I’m in. I don’t know what to do and I can’t keep up with this anymore. 

It feels like I’m stuck between either destroying my family or killing myself eventually. I need advice for real on how to get out of this situation without ruining everything. Thank you for any advice",24Sep2019,1

We planned a trip to cedar point and everything but I was saying how I was gonna go with someone else to purposely hurt her and just straight out saying a lot of things I didn't mean too.

52,"It’s hard because I live with her and can’t move out until a year because that’s when the lease is up.

My roommate is my age, she has a good job, and she’s usually home all the time but she is extremely passive aggressive and controlling. She’s like a helicopter. So I’ll cook, and she’ll hover over my shoulder and ask “why are you cutting potatoes like that?” And I go “uhh idk this is how I prefer them” and then I’ll mix my spices and she’s like “don’t use that fork!!!!” And then I put the potatoes in the oven and she makes me cut the parchment paper perfectly aligned with the pan so I don’t “burn the house down” because she thinks I’m stupid and will set the kitchen on fire. Then I put it in the oven and she’s still hovering making sure I take it out the second it beeps so it doesn’t “cause smoke” and she freaks out over everything.

She’s very controlling in how I spend my money. I saved a lot of money for the apartment so I have good control over my savings and money but she likes to try and dictate how I use it saying I should just live paycheck to paycheck like her instead. I tell her that her opinion isn’t wanted and I can decide myself how I spend my money but she doesn’t listen. 

The worst part is her jealous and rude behaviour. She screams and yells over very small things like the dryer wouldn’t turn on so she presumed I broke it and started screaming at me. The landlord heard and said he was just cleaning it earlier so he unplugged it and must have forgotten to plug it back in and apologized. So that’s one example but picture stuff like this happening maybe 3 times a week.

Then I had a serious bladder infection and was on some antibiotics. I started taking them and it was macrobid so anyone that’s been on that knows how nauseous that makes you. So my manager told me to stay home and not to worry about work that day. While I was sick, my roommate starts telling me I probably have an STI and caught it from my boyfriend because he’s “disgusting and probably doesn’t clean himself” which isn’t true at all. My boyfriend is very clean. Then saying I should be getting tested for STD’s and all these other problems when she’s a hypocrite because she’s had Syphillis (spelling is wrong) after sleeping with married men. Like she’s one to talk!

anytime I try to apply for a job, or if I buy like a new piece of clothing, or anything, she just trashes me and tells me I’m not good enough, puts me down, etc. Talks to me like I’m stupid like “do you really think you’d get a job like that???? Did you even read the requirements?? I doubt it!” She clearly doesn’t want me to do well at all.

She always has to be right, picks fights over little things, will stomp and sulk around the apartment and just sit in the living room so you have to stay in your room so you don’t bother her. She’s extremely difficult to live with!!  If you stand up to her, she’ll take it as an attack and just unleashes her miserable mood on to you. For example, I went to the gym this morning. She said “you look like such a stick” and I go “Hey you know what? I actually like my body!” And smile. She gets angry and starts making all these passive aggressive remarks. Goes into a mood to make me “suffer” the whole day.

So I am in high school and there is this girl  that I did  ask out at the  beginning of this year?and I was awkward on trying to ask her. Well I did it and she straight told I’m not looking for a relationship but you know in like a couple months maybe ask again. So I wait until later this year and ask her out in July after we been talking all summer and she waits until the day after my birthday in August to say no but I figure anyways I still want to be friends. I was wrong, she figure it was for the best if don’t talk for awhile. Of course I want to still be friends so went by what she said and move on to other friends. Well the thing is we never actually pick up to being friends again and I really didn’t notice but what I did notice that I still care bout and I confused that for love and I think I realize that now. And if fast forward to a couple days ago she got with one of my friends was I hurt yea a little bit but I want to move pass that the hurt and be friends again you know welllllll me thinking Im just trying to be friends apparently it didn’t look that way. Like that everyone figure I was jerk because I was trying to pick someone else girl which I wasn’t I was talking to her and trying to be friends. She blocked me on everything and it’s making think should I just forget about the situation and lay low until everybody moves on or should I actually talk to her about because I think really thing that bugs me I though me and her were really good friends before this but I don’t really know.

56,"For the past couple weeks, during school days, I've started to feel really anxious around the same time each day and I'm not sure why. It always happens in my 6th hour calculus class (I'm a senior in high school). The class itself doesn't give me any trouble and I'm actually doing really well in it to my surprise, but I still get this sort of nervous feeling and I can't ever seem to focus in the class. It's flipped teaching (meaning we do lessons at home and homework assignments in class), so we're just supposed to be working, but I can't even focus on doing that. I always find that I'm worrying about something completely unrelated to the class itself.  


Today, my teacher was trying to get me to do the assignments and I just wanted to cry (and honestly, I almost did lol) because I was feeling so anxious about it. Even though I know and understand the assignment., I panicked and just told him I was confused on it. I sit at a table with these two smarter kids because it's assigned seating and I always feel like I'm just the dumb one at the table and then I felt awkward getting help from my teacher even though my two classmates are right there. And then, I just felt even worse and yeah, I just kept feeling more and more panicky.   


Anyway, I'm not really sure why this is, but what can I be doing to not feel like that in class? Or at least, how can I bring myself to focus? Even when I tell myself I should be focusing and doing my work, I just cannot bring myself to do it.",24Sep2019,2

He's not officially my teacher anymore, though he'll probably tutor me every other week.

The problem is, I never stopped feeling this way about him. I haven't seen him in months but just the sound of his voice after a casual phone call had me thinking about him again. Even a text has my heart beating faster.

I have friends and have had other people I've been interested in but haven't been on a real relationship since meeting him.

I don't think about him all the time but anything like seeing, hearing him or hearing people talk about him drudges those feeling back up again.
 
I know it's wrong, I know he doesn't reciprocate how I feel, I know he's taken, I know a relationship could never be possible. None of that helps. I still feel the same. It never fucking changes.

I never let him know how I feel but he's fairly perceptive so I don't know how well hidden these feelings are.

I don't know what to call this. I don't get how I could be in this deep without him ever showing me a spec of reciprocity. Feels like a mental illness.

My bf is a great looking guy, so I wasn't surprised to know he's been out with many women. Here's the thing, I would consider myself on the same level of attractiveness as he is (don't mean to be cocky here). He would always tell me ""I'm sure you've been with way more people than I"" but I would tell him the truth and say ""not really"".

I was going through his old posts from 8 years ago on facebook. His friends were saying ""last night was amazing with (so and so). You were so drunk and you were all over that girl""

He is my first real boyfriend and I'm happy to have him but, I can't help to feel almost jealous that I haven't experienced many other partners before him. HOWEVER!

61,"My best friend of 7 years is getting very obsessive. It started about a year ago when she started reading this online story and she really loved it. She talked about it often but I thought it was something that she just had an interest in like anything else, yeah know like a movie or show. But over the course of probably only 2 months it became all she talked about. I have refused to read it because A) it doesnt interest me and B) I didnt want her to keep talking to it about me. But it didnt matter if I didnt read it, all she did was talk about it and show me fanart and talk about the author. Nothing else. I even went to tell her I was getting tired of hearing about it, but it didnt matter. Soon she would send me updates on it, show the authors livestreams, send screenshots of her group chat with other readers. I told her clearly to stop but she wont. She still talks about it everyday, all day. She is obsessed with the author now and wants to be her, she has invested countless amount of dollars into buying merch and on the authors patreon. She only wants to like the same things as the author and do what the author does down to the T. She stalked the authors old information online and screenshots everything and rereads it all over and over. I hate it so much and its so scary honestly. I had ghosted her for 3 months over this, but eventually reached back out because she is my best friend of 7 years, only to see that it had gotten worse since I have been away. We go to college together and see each other everyday. A part of me wants to break off the friendship over this but another part of me wants to help her somehow. She cant even think for herself now, I have really lost my best friend over the weirdest thing. I want to talk to her and tell her to stop or calm it down and that there is more to life then an online story and the author who doesnt even know she exists but I am afraid she will freak.

I work night shifts, 7-7 4 days consecutively, this has done a real number on my mental health over time and I rarely feel happy anymore.

I’m currently broke and I have to call in sick tomorrow because I literally can’t afford to get to work until I get paid, my grandad is quite sick and lives on an island fairly far away and it’s expensive to see him, my girlfriends birthday is next week and I can’t afford to do anything special which breaks my heart, the week after that I have my close friends wedding which I’m gonna have to spend about £150 to go to for the weekend, I’ve been looking for therapists and the only one I’ve found can only see me on my gfs birthday so I can’t do that, not to mention the price... my parents aren’t taking my issues seriously and are pretty much telling me to get over it... I have pretty bad OCD from meningitis as a child and I’m currently fixating on a girl flirting with me from last year and every night I feel ashamed and like I’ve betrayed my gf.

And lastly I can’t afford to quit my terrible job but I’m probably gonna die if I work any more nights.

66,"I met some who we will call Al. Now Al is actually a pretty chill dude, we met my freshman year of college and later moved into an apartment with another friend from the freshman semester.
He's always had a problem with substance abuse since I met him, but during the time he was my roomate it was only alcohol and weed. He later move back to his home town for a year and half. Over there he got into harder shit pills and stuff he could get from the darkweb. 
Since then he had gone thru 2 cars and pretty bad break-up. He has moved back and is now fucking up his life further and further.
His life is going off the rails and I wanna help him but at the same time I don't wanna get burned.

I live in Montana, me and my roommates are all 22 and drink and smoke from time to time. Al is currently being evicted from his current residents in a neighboring town. We played with the idea of having him stay with us, I doubt the environment would help his problem. Al was fired from his job after failing a drug test, because he came to work high. He's being evicted for sleeping in his roommate bed when he was all fucked up. Another problem is Al denies doing many of these things and more. 

Basically I'm asking what my options are at this point me and my friend both wanna help him, but neither of us has alot of money, or space at that. I just don't know what to do, but I'm sure if nobody does anything he will probably die with in the year or next.",24Sep2019,2
67," 

I need help determining if I should go back to WGU(a very cheap online college like 6-7k/year) to get a masters in math education or a BS. in accounting? I work an entry level accounting job in San Jose making 46k per year. My job is literally entry level. My job doesn't take much skill and knowledge. I don't have much knowledge in accounting.

I live in my coworker's house for only 500 a month. I am close enough to walk to work and live right next to a Costco. I consider my current company's health insurance and dental insurance to be top tier meaning I don't pay anything. The deductible is 250 and I pay less than 2000 out of pocket max. I am sasying this not to brag, but to point out that if I live anywhere else in the country my cost of living would probably skyrocket.

I think getting an education degree teaching math is very high risk high reward. School districts in south bay pay a buttload to teachers. Lots of counties start at about 65k if you have a masters. In less than 5 years your salary can get to 75k easily. Santa clara unified school district pays you about 90k in less than 5 years with a masters! In less than 10 years your salary can skyrocket to at least 90k. However, teaching doesn't pay well any where else in the country. Also student teaching=massive loss of income. Also, if a recession hits then I'll probably have to settle for a shitty paying job somewhere elsewhere in the country. I have been a professional tutor before. I love working with kids! If Silicon Valley ever collapses, I can see teaching salaries collapsing. What's also dispiriting is that teacher's health and dental insurance suck. A good thing is that pension contributions are refundable as a teacher if you ever leave.

I am thinking about accounting because that is what my job is sort of like right now. All I do is compare what sales sends me and purchase orders. If I get an accounting degree, I could also say that I have relevant experience meaning if I can't find a job using my accounting degree, I still have my current job to fall back on.

What do you guys think? Should I do accounting or teaching?

If you guys havent fig. out, my biggest fear is a recession. I graduated college 6 years ago. The current job I have is my first full-time job, and I started it this summer.

68,"My husband and I are planning a pretty big, expensive trip to Europe next summer and we have invited another friend couple (4 people total) to come along with us. We all get along and have known each other for a long time so I’m not worried about the group dynamic - I know if we get annoyed we’re all ok with doing our own thing for the day. 
One of the people in the other couple (let’s call them Sam) has a pretty good friend (let’s call them Reg) that generally has a lot of cash to blow and can travel on a whim. Sam was telling Reg about the trip and how excited they were and Reg basically invited themself along because it sounded so fun and great. While I know Reg and am OK with Reg in small doses, I am not ok with Reg in large doses. 
Reg has a lot of anxiety and eating restrictions that make Reg kind of annoying to be around a lot. While I am supportive of these issues because they are 100% not Reg’s fault, that doesn’t mean I want Reg to go on my big fun vacation that I’m planning with Sam and their spouse. A lot of my travel has to do with food and new (sometimes scary) experiences, and I anticipate Reg being obnoxious about these things. Especially since Reg doesn’t have the best social graces sometimes and will take things too far and/or demand the group follow their lead. 
Sam and their spouse also do not want Reg to go, but don’t know how to tell Reg this without being extremely hurtful. Knowing Reg, Reg will take it extremely personal and it has the possibility of damaging a friendship. 

How do we communicate to Reg that this vacation is only for the four of us without damaging the friendship irreparably?",24Sep2019,2

70,"Hi there everyone. I'm a 19 y/o female who's hoping to start college soon. I tried starting last year, but problems with financial aid and other factors caused me to miss a year and I'm starting late this year too. My parents (mom and aunt) really want this for me and have been waiting my whole life for this. I've been anticipating this as well. However, as of recent, a lot has been going on. My aunt (a hairdresser) can barely work and recently had a bad gout flare up, along with a UTI and dehydration, which meant she kept having to leave work early or not go at all, not to mention her customers are all older so her schedules are pretty unpredictable and unreliable. My mom is disabled from an illness she had shortly after I was born, but the money she gets doesn't cover all of our bills and food entirely. She also has congestive heart failure and has a past history of epilepsy. My aunt is currently waiting to see if she qualifies for disability, which I also applied for due to my severe anxiety, depression, and dysmenorrhea (painful cycles), but did not qualify.  All of these recent events plus the fact that my insurance lapsed and I've been having trouble being fully enrolled again has made me afraid to leave and part of me just wants to try and find a job I could manage to help out. It has made my anxiety about college worse, as I was already worried about debt and the fields that I'm passionate about aren't exactly viable/stable ones. They are strongly against me getting a job and want me to go to college. They also have no idea that I've been thinking about this. I don't want to break their hearts because I already feel like I disappoint them so much, but I'm really concerned for their well-being.

But even after a year, I can’t get over that life. All the good times we had and them being the only ones to share it with. But what really drains me are the bad times. They remind me of why I cut them off but it also angers me. I would sometimes be humiliated by one individual and constantly let down.

I think it just hurts me sometimes to know they probably occasionally bring me up and talk about me in a bad manner (especially the one individual) and share all sorts of rumours and secrets with all my past high school friends. I know I should just move on but it’s so hard to. I wish I could if confronted them about it but that’s impossible now. The humiliation has been set in stone and there’s no going back. How do I get past this?",24Sep2019,1
74,"This is going to be a rather long post, so I definitely apologize for that. For starters, let me fill you in on who I am and who my wife is.   


I am 28 years old, 29 in December. I am a transman (female to male) and have undergone my top surgery, as well as hormone replacement therapy since 2012. I am currently working towards my associates in Cyber Security and will probably be done by next spring. I was disowned by my entire family about 10 years ago, so I do not have any support/guidance...which is why I'm reaching out on here. I suffer from anxiety and depression, so I don't need a bunch of people attacking me for my transition or what a failure people may think I am. 

I only bring up my transition to properly address why I can’t just talk to my own family. I don’t have family and explaining my transition will better help others understand my depression/anxiety and having to resort to a Reddit page for guidance. 

My wife: She is 26 years old, working full time at Amazon making $15/hr. Has a great relationship with her family, but they don't really seem to provide good guidance/advice. 

Us together: We've been married for about 5 years, and our relationship is very strong. Unfortunately, we were both laid off by the same company last November. Combined, we made around $75K a year. So, losing that job was a huge blow to our finances. We live in Las Vegas, and for those who don't know-- the economy here is terrible. The only areas Vegas ranks high in are domestic abuse, lack of college graduates, failing housing market and a terrible job pool. 

I can't explain it, but Vegas has always been a great source of my depression for both myself and my wife. The people here tend to not be goal driven and the trend seems to be settling... constantly settling.   


After losing our jobs, we did some research and found that Seattle, WA had a really strong job market, was very trans\* friendly and shared a lot of our personal beliefs. From November to February, we saved my unemployment and moved to Seattle in February. We moved in with my in-laws to save money prior to moving. We were able to get moved into a 245sqft micro studio with our 100 pound Golden Retriever (he isn't overweight, just really tall). My wife got a job at Amazon making nearly $19/hr and I was working at UPS, offered a part time supervisor position for $21/hr. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why, but the whole moved really scared both my wife and myself. We both felt really overwhelmed with the move and convinced ourselves that we should just go back to Vegas so I can finish my degree and stop working these dead end jobs. So, we moved back in with my in-laws by July 1st. Unfortunately, with losing our good jobs the previous year, we couldn't keep up with our creditors and we just filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

Now here we are, depressed and feeling helpless in Las Vegas again. We originally planned to move to Southern California (Long Beach) once I got my degree. This is something we've wanted for years. Being in Vegas has really brought back terrible feelings of helplessness and depression... I don't have family to ask for guidance, and her parents don't really have much to say about anything we ask. Believe me we have asked several times for some guidance from them. They are great people, but advice is not their forte. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what this whole post is leading up to... Here is my question. 

We are stuck in a rut and don't know which direction to take next. We have thought about trying to save up $1,000-$2,000 and move back to Seattle. We'd both be able to get our jobs back. Or should we stay in Las Vegas and hope I can mentally get through to my associates and finally move to Southern California.

Things ended badly at my last job after I blew up at my head supervisor after months of trying to do college and 12 hour shifts. I didn't make many friends at my last job, and I grew to hate every minute I was there. I was kept on so long there because I was a hard worker who could cover large areas if 2 or 3 people are slacking off/calling off/fucking off, but doing that for months will leave me exhausted and resentful.

77,"So here's the situation, I need to rent a place to stay for 30 days in denver and I thought I'd try my hand at Airbnb. So I found this place at a reasonable price and the next day the owner got in contact with me to discuss my situation... type of job, length of stay, working hours, etc. Normal questions you'd expect a reasonable person to ask.

Here's the kicker. The lady says she's willing to rent the room but we should not use Airbnb. Instead she wants me to cancel the pending request for the room. For those of you who don't know, Airbnb requires you to put down a method of payment, where they will hold onto the money for the stay until the host accepts or denies my request, after which they would issue me a refund should I be denied. In my case it would be around $960. I should also mention that if I did get accepted, but then decided not to go through with it, I would NOT be issued a refund, even with cancellation.

She instructed me to cancel the request and just give her the money upfront, eschewing Airbnb entirely. For some reason, I agree and proceed to try and cancel the request, only to find to my surprise the request has already been accepted and cancellation is no longer possible. At least not in any way that gives me my money back. Even more surprisingly, though I didn't notice it at the moment, the acceptance went through just a couple minutes before she called me, though I didn't think anything of it at the moment.

I proceed to inform her about this and she tells me to contact Airbnb. A little prodding on my part and she confirms that yes, she actually did accept the request but it was by accident. I contact Airbnb, I explain the situation, they check with her and hurrah, the cancellation goes through, I will be refunded and she will be expecting me tomorrow at check in with money in hand.

Yeah, now as I'm typing this I can imagine what most of you will say. I guess I just wanted to be naive and hope it would work out?

It took me until the whole process was over for the pieces to come together in my mind. Even now as I write it just becomes clearer. She'd accepted my request just before getting in contact with me, so if I refused to go through with her plan of dropping Airbnb(which she was insistent on) she could deny me the stay and I couldn't get a refund. And if I do go through with her proposal and show up tomorrow with cash on hand, I can only hope she keeps to her word and not take my money and deny me a place to stay anyways. 

Well that's it, what do you guys think? Thankfully I haven't given her a penny as of yet but I recently moved, have no place to stay and am looking for something temporary while I get settled. If any of you could impart some advice, it'd be greatly appreciated as I need to find somewhere ASAP and I do mean ASAP.

My question comes from how bad they are. I heard that they can cause heart trouble, and seizures. However, I was wondering if just a sip or a can every now and then would be bad.

82,"There’s this special ed kid at school who I think might be an autistic micro premie (not entirely sure but he is pretty small, has tiny teeth, limited cognitive abilities, an oddly shaped skull, hearing problems, and was non verbal until around 4th grade and is still hard to understand). 

He made a Snapchat group chat with me and some friends about a year ago because he was getting bullied by some kids. We talked to them and they stopped for a month and then started bullying him again. The second time we filed a school report but that didn’t help at all, all the school did was tell the ghetto kids to stop (they continued and we had to deal with them again since the school wouldn’t do anything). 

We were pretty firm with his bullies and they stopped messing with de and pretended to be his friend (literally all it takes is saying “sup de” when he talks to you and then he considers you his brother). With no more bullies the group chat was more of just a social thing for de. He doesn’t actually have any friends so we’re his only social interaction for him outside of school. He is very passionate about rap and basketball and we hype him up when he makes a song or some lyrics or records a video of him shooting the ball or says he dated a girl (he said a different one every day lol) or says he’s cousins with literally every African American in the madison area. Things were going pretty good for him, we even hung out a couple times as a group and we helped him record his rap video.

Now it’s happening again and a group chat he made that was filled with “[his] people” keep calling him retard and shit like that. I think he might be realizing he’s special needs because when he denied being retarded they just brought up the fact that he pushes the coffee cart at school, does the mail at school, is only in other classes with other “retards”, and he has a helper who follows him around.

We’re all telling him they’re just joking around and they’re just haters and he’s not ed etc. but he just responds with “you are is lie. I my Ed 😢” I’m afraid this is going to ruin his self esteem and happy persona and ruin his dreams of becoming a basketball rap superstar but at the same time it just seems inevitable that he becomes self aware of his disability and it’s wrong for us to hide that from him and lie to him.

86,"I am a generally insecure person with several different insecurities. That’s just been a fact of life for me for years, though I’ve never known where exactly they came from. My insecurities include: 

* generally not being able to accept compliments
* generally being insecure and ashamed about my appearance
* not always having faith in and believing in myself when I should
* believing that people think I’m weird or unlikeable, not wanting to be friends with me
* being overly afraid of what people think of me
* (not sure this counts) being unnecessarily scared of talking to certain strangers
* being afraid of what most people think of my art, afraid of them thinking I’m crazy
* being afraid of what must people think of my interests, again afraid of them thinking I’m weird and unlikable
and the list goes on. I may or may not add more if I remember them. Adding to my confusion as to where they came from, some of these don’t make sense as almost everyone I’ve met and everyone in my family has been very loving to and supportive of me for my whole life, and I’ve only been, quote, unquote, “bullied” like only twice, and it was really small.

So, my family life is a bit.. unenjoyable. You see, I have great, hard-working parents and a generally good younger brother, but all four of us clash *so much, every single day*. Arguments and fights are a big, recurring issue in the family.

My father is a great, loving dad who means well and only wants the best for us, but he is also an alcoholic, trying to drink away memories of his hard past. This habit of his brings a lot of pain to the family, and sometimes makes me cry at night, but I don’t consider it the primary problem in my life (I try not to think about it too much, and I have talked to him multiple times over the years about it), just a significant one.

I struggle with feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem, as well as a few somewhat-existential crises, which are all significant problems in my life, leaning more to being the primary problems.

And so, my mother has claimed for some time that my insecurities are a result of my family life, which I strongly disagree with. How could these problems of mine stem from my family issues? I just don’t see the connection.

I’m asking for advice on evaluating whether or not there is a connection and/or where these insecurities are coming from. Anything would help.

A week ago, she informed me she’s pregnant. Roughly 5 weeks pregnant. Normally I would be happy for her. But I’m not sure if it’s her boyfriend situation, the fact she actively keeps things a mess, the fact the baby is going to be sleeping in a closet that had the door removed from it, the fact she is in debt and not financially stable or if it’s just me having grown up a great deal to where I’m unsure how to feel about any of this. 

Is there any chance that this situation will be a good situation or should I just start planning to move as soon as possible? Because she’s messy now. I can already foresee that her having a child means outside of her own trash she fails to clean up, baby stuff will be everywhere.",24Sep2019,1

Just needed some advice on if I should get a second job. I'm currently taking a break off from post secondary school, and work full time at a retail chain. I usually work 30-40 hours, and make 50 cents above minimum wage. I'm struggling a little bit financially, but can make ends meet. 

I mostly just want to know who out there has a second job, and how they manage it? Do you have 2+ full time jobs? 2+ part time jobs? I just want to know how you guys handle it! What are you stress levels like?",24Sep2019,2

i really want to try to overcome these fears so i can actually get a grip on my life, if there anyone who can relate or have any advice for me? how can i overcome my phobias enough to pass the trade school, i wont be doing anything with needles once i get a job but during school i know they have a section with needles hands-on with the other students, and i'm pretty sure with blood too.

Whenever I bring in my own lunch, he is still insistent on buying me food. The other day I brought in food and he irritatingly said “Why did you get that? could have bought you lunch” he then went out asking if I wanted anything. I politely declined, and he bought some anyway. I don’t have a clue as to why the dynamic is this way. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to make me fat and unhealthy because he hates me. 

I’m concerned about two things: 

1. The food he buys is always oily, fatty fast food, and it makes me feel disgusting. (I never eat all if it) 

2. Could there be ulterior motives? I appreciate his generosity but the unhealthy food daily, and his annoyance at me bringing my own meal is starting to really bother me.

100,"I'll try to explain this the best I can. I worked at a warehouse about a year ago  as a temp employee but called out sick to many times and was laid off and given a year ban from coming back. (Yes that's a thing, it case you're curious, it's through adecco) I was then in a car accident that took a few months to recover from, along with some other family and personal issues that that took some time, my point being, I have a job time gap of a year. I spammed out about 250 job applications (over the weekend) and received about 15 calls today and will probably receive another 15 or so tomorrow.

This is what I need advice for. The warehouse job pays pretty well, at least far better than the stuff I applied to, but if I try to go back to that job, it would make me sick and I'd probably be kicked out of where I'm living, I live with a friend and if I went back after a year, that probably wouldn't go over to well.

101,"Hi everyone! I (16F) have been struggling very much for past two-ish years, with severe mental health problems.

My parents completely reject the idea of mental health (they don't believe in it AT ALL ) and every time I've tried to breach the issue they forcefully change the subject. 

I only really moved to America when I was nine or so, and I came here from Korea, where mental health issues are totally ignored and glossed over (which is how my parents were raised).

The main root of my problems is definitely my parents. From a really young age they've always been telling me how much of a failure and how stupid I am, and I'm constantly was compared to my brother, who's a very successful med student right now. 

This led to me getting pretty severe anxiety over not being able to meet their expectations and standards, to the point where I had panic attacks just about every time I thought they might end up getting disappointed in me. Around the time I turned 15, ended up getting diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

I ended up completely screwing up my day to day life. My grades took a nosedive, I was constantly exhausted and unable to eat, and I ended up entirely cutting off all of my friends. 

My parents became furious at me, and ended up completely taking away all of my free time to send me to supplementary classes and extracurriculars. 

At that point, I was so depressed I was seriously contemplating ending my life.

But luckily things are getting a bit better now. An old friend reached out to me at the end of summer, and after really discussing my problems together, we both came to the conclusion that to start getting proper help, I have to sit down and talk it out with my parents properly.

The problem is, being the stereotypical Korean parents that they are, I'm terrified they might tell me that I'm being unreasonable or overdramatic, and there's a high chance they may not even believe what I tell them.

What should I do?",24Sep2019,2

105,"

I am from the middle east where a man spend a lot of money (crazy amounts of money) to marry the girl he loves and I think this is completely insane. And this is how it all started. 

I [F28] met a guy [M35] online and since day 1 we chatted about the crazy middle easter traditions when it comes to marriage. It was a randon conversation, and I told him that I don't want my future husband to pay anything, because I just don't accept that. 

I am financially very stable and independent, and if someone loves me I don't want him to spend all the money he saved all his life on me just to be with me. I believe in love and true love is all I need, I don't care about money and I don't even accept to take money (and even an expensive gift) from anyone. I just feel that my dignity cannot let me do that. 

So my bf was then kind of impressed to meet a middle eastern girl who doesn't want her future husband to pay anything. He started telling me he loved me since the first 5-6 days we spent talking! And he barely knew anything about me at that time, so I have been wondering how he could love me so deeply, so quickly. After some time, I started to feel that I was falling for him too. 

He keeps talking about money all the time, (I don't know if he does that because he is financially so unstable or because there's something on his mind). He has to pay some money for some people and the other day he asked me:""what would you do if I was your husband and I was on debt"" I am not saying there is anything wrong with his question but he doesn't stop talking about money. Now i am not sure if he loves me, or he loves my money. I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I want someone who loves me for who I am, not for what I have. 

Since we met he has been asking me to tell my family about him and in a couple weeks I tell my father about him because my mom and my brothers already know him. But sometimes I feel afraid, I feel he will not be the right guy for me and I wonder to which extent I should listen to that feeling inside me.

We argued several times and once i really wanted to break up with him because he kept me on hold and talked with him ex gf, but he said he would commit suicide if I leave him and that was not the only time he threatened me of committing suicide. Sometimes we argue about other things and he keeps talking about suicide. He says that his life will be over if i leave him. I really don't know if that's true love or something else. 

One more thing. When we met, he told me he hates living in his country. On the other hand, I have two nationalities and I can live wherever I want, either in my country in the middle east or in another country in europe. So i also wonder if he sees me as a way to get out of his country.

A few months ago, he reconnected with his mom and step dad and moved into their new house with them. Since then, he has always paid rent early or on time, and even picked up a construction job with his step dad. Unsurprisingly, he didn't last a few months before quitting.

He is now extremely suicidal and has confided in everyone: me, his girlfriend, his ex, and even his family. His family saw him leaving his job and getting depressed as him being on drugs. Even though he is not on any drugs and even after he took a drug test in front of them. 

There is a huge theme of miscommunication in this family, and he can't seem to hold down a conversation with them. Apparently they still see him as a kid and dismiss everything he says. They go great lengths to create a false conspiracy just so they can throw him out in the cold again. They just keep giving up on him when he needs help the most. It's stressing him and me out immensely.

But I was honest and told her that I did text the crush 

Anyhow we have been together for a few months. And the former crush texting me how things were. I replied and we had a convo. I found out she is doing some medical procedures in a city couple hours. So I asked her about it and I told her next time she comes by just let me know. I’d like to hear more about it. As I’m in that field. 

Well I didn’t really think much but I was logged into my gf’s phone on FB.

I mean, we'll be in the car, he'll be joking, laughing, telling stories and everything. But, it seems like whenever we get stuck behind bicycles on the road, he becomes a totally different person.

Like, some kind of monster. It's scary. We get stuck, it's usually on this somewhat narrow road. He gets pissed about this sign on the road that says to share the road with bicycles. He huffs and puffs and growls the whole time.

But if we actually get stuck, he'll honk his horn at the bicycles. And if they don't speed up, he'll start yelling out the window at them to move faster.

If they don't, he'll pass them. Regardless of whether it's a double yellow line or not.

I don't know what to do. I've offered to drive and when we did, he still gets angry. He'll continue to shout at them. He calls them ""Pansy Machines"". If i drive, i always pass on a safe road. He'll always stick his hand out the window and flip them off as we pass or yell ""Get that God D*mn piece of Sh!t off the road"".

112,"So it's kind of difficult to explain, but my ""best friend"" basically cut me and my other friend off because we refused to help him jump someone. So here's the story.

Me, my friend, and my ""best friend"" were planning on walking to the gym near our house right. So as we are walking to the gym this guy is driving his car and didn't stop at the stop sign (but we were still on the sidewalk. He wouldn't have even hit us). My ""best friend"" continues to make sarcastic remarks towards the driver and the driver puts the down the window and apologizes and says he is sorry. I was ready to just say it's fine, but my ""best friend"" continued to give him sarcastic remarks and giving him a attitude and eventually asking the driver to fight him. Me and my other friend are both like trying to talk to our ""best friend"" and tell him to just forget about it and let's go, but he was so ready to fight him over nothing basically. So the driver agrees to fight him (even though he obviously did not want to, but his girlfriend was with him and I guess he didn't want to seem weak or something) because my ""best friend"" (Let's just call him Gary) just escalated the situation for no reason at all.  So Gary looks at me and my other friend and says ""We about to jump this n\*\*\*a"" and me and my friend both looked at him and said ""No what are you talking about?"" and Gary says to us ""Yall not gonna ride for me?"" and me and my other friend said ""No, why would we jump someone. We aren't jumping anyone"". My other friend was trying to talk to the driver saying he's sorry for our friend acting that way and the driver actually being nice and saying it's fine it's no big deal. The only reason they did not fight was because we refused to jump him. So me, my other friend, and Gary walk away on our way to the gym and Gary calls us bitches and hoes because we would not assault someone. My other friend was trying to tell him there was no reason to act like that (I'm just in the front walking quietly) and my other friend said ""If you're gonna be mad Ima just go home"" and Gary yelled and said ""go the f\*\*\* home then"". Of course, I went with my other friend and walked home with him because Gary was mad at me too. On our way we both agreed that he is just reckless.

So I get home and wait a few hours. Later that night I text him telling him he was being way too aggressive and sometimes it's better to just let things go instead of escalating them and making it worse. He never responded. This was a week ago and he hasn't talked to either of us at all. He still posts on snapchat so I know he seen my text. 

The thing is....he's always like this. He just harasses people for no reason at all. He will be driving and pull down the window and just yell ""you're f\*\*\*\*\*\* ugly"" to random people for pure enjoyment and then continue to say ""Lol im such an a\*\*hole"". 

This week I just been thinking and wondering. Do i even want someone like this as a best friend? Should I even try and talk to him again after trying already? Would I be better off not being around that?

113,"So, to try and keep this as short as possible, I'm stuck. My situation at home is really not ok for me, I'm tired of being sad and stressed all the time and I can't think of how I can change my situation. I need to move out but it feels like everything is against me.   


Money is a big issue, I've been applying to jobs, not one has even given me an interview. It'd be a entry level job because it'd be my first job, so I've only been applying to things like ""sales associate"" and ""stocker"" and things like that. My availability is literally every day of the week at any time besides Tues/Thurs because of my classes, so I don't know why people aren't even giving me a chance.  


And without the job, I can't make rent, so I can't move out. I'd move in with my dad but he lives out of state and I'd lose my scholarship for school because it's in-state only. I can't ask my mom for financial help with moving out because she literally has no extra money, she has to bail my sister out so much (my sister is the main problem). I don't have any local friends that I could live with, the closest one is over 45 minutes from me in the opposite direction of my campus, which is already over an hour drive away.  


As for my sister, I've tried to set boundaries with her before, and it always just bites me in the ass and they get undone because ""I'm the only one that can help her"" and all that bull. She's in a bad situation with 3 kids and isn't doing ANYTHING to get herself out of it, in fact she's only making it worse, so my mom has to keep helping her. My mom has told me already that she would stop helping my sister financially if it weren't for the kids, so that's out of the question. My sister has pretty much taken advantage of me for the last year and a half, I pretty much got forced into babysitting 4-5 days a week (on top of having what my college classifies as overtime school), for usually 8-12 hours a day, sometimes more if she wanted to argue with her baby daddy (she literally left me with her kids at 7am, got off work at 3pm, shoulda been home by 4, but instead got home at almost 9pm because she insisted on going to argue with her baby daddy). I didn't even get paid until I put up such a fight with her about it that she was like ""fine I'll pay you $30 a day"" and that didn't even stick.

But I got functional. I escaped my childhood and my past. And I move a lot. Get job after job, change hobbies almost weekly. My wife is the only one I let in.

The girls were the only exception. Their parents were both extremely dangerous. Drugs, crime. So we took them in. We worked with the parents not against them. The dad got put back in jail, and the mom was still working the streets with a drug dealing, abusive guy (caused 3 miscarriages by beating her while she was pregnant).

The department of family services was making everything happen so that it was legal. I was happy. I was happy because I was able to save 2 kids with my wife. They were the happiest most screwed up kids. 

We literally fought off and chased out of our house and yard gang members sent to hurt the children and their parents. We left state for a while and I took off work. 

I’ve never opened myself up to having kids. My wife is my first real relationship in 5 years. I loved them more than anything.

I make music, and on the way to record a project 10 hrs away, my wife texts me barely able to explain. The girls never came back from their grandparents movie day. And none of them are answering their phones. The girls are 10 and 12.

Cut to now. The grandparents used personal ties in the police and department of family in their town to literally, disputes the girls begging to come back and telling others about the horrors they’ve experienced there.... I even got to talk to the girls and they asked me to take video of what they said. The lawyers and cops in their town have chosen a side. 

Before you say anything. I want to make something clear. We have tried everything, lawyers, federal, everything. Everything. The only reason I’m writing this is because it’s hopeless. Because of the grandparents insane views and illegal ways, the girls aren’t allowed to call or see any of us. It’s been 10 months now.

I’m trying so hard. I finally made peace with not killing the grandparents. But now we’re just gonna move 700 miles away and give up. I’m going back to writing music cuz it’s the only way I can express this stuff usually.

I hate this world. I hate so many people now because of this. Their ignorance and hate and selfishness, even in small doses now only reminds me of these terrible grandparents.

i really need to know whether that’s something embarrassing or not, please tell me 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐧𝐨 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫",24Sep2019,1
119,"May not be the right thread, but I'm a 21 year old woman with high functioning autism, as in I can live on my own, manage my bills, do all the adult things. I however have trouble interacting with others, have trouble relating to others (getting better), sometimes have sensory overloads and subsequent meltdowns. But most meltdowns are done in the privacy of my home. 

Anyway, I will be seeing a new GYN in a few weeks and I'm...well...active...but a lot of doctors mistake ASD as an intellectual disability that impairs the ability to make conscious, sound decisions and I'm TERRIFIED of any action by my GYN taken against my partner or any past partners. 

For example calling social services and having them deem me a vulnerable adult, thus preventing me from bodily autonomy and having serious legal issues for my past partners and present partner. 

So do I just wait for my doc to find out or tell them up front to prevent any further issues?",24Sep2019,3

Now that my interviews are completed I’m waiting on a response and the anxiety is driving me up a wall.

123,"There’s a lot of single people my age in my office. There’s no office policy against dating &amp; I get the impression that one of the managers knows and was hoping it would work out for his friend.

Biggest issue is: I really do like both of them, and am worried that as soon as I decide I’ll want the other. Which would be bad.

General issues I see are:
 1. One of the guys gets salty and moody if I go with the other guy
2. I get wishy washy and can’t decide and get myself into trouble
3. Things go sideways and it affects work (mostly for the two guys cause they sit next to each other and work for the same client)
4. I get salty and moody if things don’t work out

The office setup and our positions are somewhat separate, we work for different clients but are in the same team. Which means that some people on the team will do work for both clients as needed, and we’re all in the same weekly meeting.

124,"Hopefully this is the right place to put this.

I'm currently speaking to my 2 siblings and making a plan to help move my parents out of their home of \~21 years. Long story short, my father was laid off and my mother had a stroke a couple of years ago. They do not need a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom, 3 story home.

The advice I need is just how to start! They have so much stuff. Like rooms and rooms of just stuff. I remember about 10 years ago travelling to help move my grandparents out of their home of 50+ years. But at least they had 7 children and countless grandchildren to help them. 

I fear I'll be doing this by myself. My 2 sisters have work and school and will use that as an excuse, my mother has mobility issues and will have trouble packing, and my father is...without getting into too much detail just useless.

He has apologised since because he was going through a minor alcohol addiction but I just hate him. I'm fine with her talking to her friends and stuff no matter the gender but all he ever talks about to her is sex, a lot of the time it's about me and her and what we do etc. But I find it so fucked up especially because of their past.

126,"So this is a really weird situation but here goes. Very frequently I hear loud thumping bass through my living room and room, to the point that it keeps me up and distracts me at night. I had assumed it was the people above me and I've asked them several times to be quieter, and gotten the property management involved. I went up there again today and when they opened the door it was clear it wasn't coming from in there. I apologized for doing that and explained that wherever it was coming from it was really loud in my apartment. (However I do think some of the time it has been them).

I don't think it's always the same people but whenever I go out in the hall to figure out who it is its much quieter and I can't identify it, but in my apartment its loud and to the point that it pulsates through my furniture. I think this is the result of thin walls in between units but thick walls in the halls. I have left feedback in the surveys management sends out (I live in non-university student housing) that they should be enforcing courtesy hours. 

I guess my question is what should I do at this point?",24Sep2019,1

128,"Hi so long story short, I recently had to ask my ex-boyfriend to move out of our apartment because he was unable to pay rent with me for about 10 months. I've been paying it by myself while working a minimum wage job and it's really not affordable for me. So the other day at work I was sitting in the break room with my manager and a coworker, when my manager mentioned that me and said coworker should live together. At first I was open to the idea but now I've realized I don't want to take the risk.

Said coworker is 32 and has had trouble finding reliable housing and has mostly been living in her van or with family members until it doesn't work out and she has to go back to the van. I am unclear about her whole situation but it also seems she doesn't have custody of her child. I do need a roommate and need to make my living situation cheaper, but I don't trust this person. And I feel awkward about that because she comes off as a nice person and everyone at work likes her. But after all I've been through with my ex, it's not a risk I'm willing to take. How do I break this news to her? Should I be blunt and honest, or come up with a different explanation? Thanks.",24Sep2019,1

131,"So long story short, I really like this girl and earlier today, one of my friends (who’s a girl and talks to the girl I like) said that “signs were good” and that the girl I like is (or I guess now was) “interested”. 

Right now, my friend’s telling me that the girl I like now isn’t so sure about like things in general and she wants to focus on herself/figure herself out and not have a clouded mind. Which is like cool and I’m absolutely fine with; she’s not entitled to like or date me. Like hey, more power to her for wanting to work on herself. 

But I would be lying if I didn’t say that I’m a *little* I guess somewhat sad. Like obviously I’m not going to cry a river over something like this but I am sort of/kind of sad since I wanted to at least ask her out and get either a yes or no since at least then I would’ve gotten a firm, solid answer. Obviously I don’t hate her and I think she should work on herself and stuff and I respect her even more. But I *am* still somewhat sort of sad over it. 

I’ll be honest, earlier today when my friend said that she had “good news”, I knew that there was gonna be some sort of twist or catch. It just seemed WAAAY too good, especially for someone fat and ugly like me. Like I knew something was up. Something felt just a little off.

Now: So new school year starts and im in the same class as my ex I try to ignore her but she keeps coming up with lies to get me expelled but she keeps writing notes and making people read it then gives it to me it say the same thing every time “Op you have to stop i have feelings to stop calling me names it makes me sad and it brings my worth down” and so i usually put it in my bag and forget about it but now she is giving my phone number to her friends and having them harass me (Check below more for a picture of those texts) I go to my teacher about this and my teacher says sorry it was out of school hours i can’t do anything about it and so now idk what to do about this and it’s annoying SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVE WAYS TO STOP THIS LET ME KNOW

My little brother is 11, we have two PS4s in the same room, our internet is pretty crappy that if someone uses their phone in the room, it would occasionally make the online games we play lag. Also if someone ever was downloading/updating something in the house, it would make everyone lag.

My little brother was playing fortnite and he was lagging a lot, when I went to check my PS4 I was updating RDR2 which is one of my favourite games. It said it approximately took about 10 mins but my little brother wants me to stop it instantly, I said no, because it only took 10 mins and also he could play an offline game. He has frequently updated games when I'm playing an online game so I switch to offline games. When things don't turn to his favour he would tell my parents and there is a 99% chance that they will be on his side since he was the one who was complaining first and he did that, but this time my parents weren't on his side and when that happens, he starts crying about it.

We did this thing we called ""sibling movie night"" where me and my brother are on a truce (basically no teasing, name calling, or general fighting on that night just having a good time as siblings.  Its kinda dumb but our little brother likes it, and its been a good bonding moment for all 3 of us.

Saturday was supposed to be our movie night and my brother was our with his friends, its whatever as long as he's back by 7 (our brother's bedtime is 10).  I tried to text him over and over with no response, I say what if me and him (little brother) just watch the movie without him and he said sure but very reluctantly.  I felt bad for him and a little mad that my brother wasn't here but we watched a movie.  We finish a movie that was 1 hour and 30 minutes and still no sign of my brother.  My younger brother wanted to stay up so he could see him but my parents forced him to go to bed, he was crying to stay up but they wouldn't budge.  I was pretty sad for the little guy.  He didn't come home till like 12 or something when our parents were already asleep.  I basically yelled and called him a fucking asshole, and I brought up how he made our brother cry.  He told me to shut the fuck up and he was busy. Then a screaming match ensues.  My dad hears the commotion and tells us to go to bed and then the next day grounds us both.

I wasn't mad that he skipped movie night but he made our little brother cry, wouldn't even text me back with a simple ""Im sorry I won't be able to make it"" and made me waste a saturday night.  This was 2 days ago and I'm still mad about it and we haven't been speaking since then.  He has apologized to my little brother, but we have yet to apologize to each other.

Alright, so my GF and I live in Arizona in a one-bedroom apartment with two cats.  I have almost no bills outside of rent, while she has a car payment and insurance that takes about a quarter of her monthly income. She works two jobs and goes to school, while I just have the one job, and have graduated college. Rent is going up at our current place, so we've been looking for a new apartment. We found one that's about $1500 for a two-bedroom two bath 1200 sqft right next to my work. (She commutes to work and is okay with a 30-minute commute.) GF and I can afford this place, but we'd be sacrificing some of our freedoms because we would have to budget differently. We haven't put any deposits down or anything, but filled applications to try to get the place.

Here's the dilemma:

My parents offered to give us a place to stay in California while GF continues college, and while I wait to get into Grad school. We would be able to transfer from our current positions to the same positions in CA for work, so there wouldn't be any concern there. It would be rent-free, but it would be difficult to keep the cats and their dog separated. It's temporary and would save us about $15k in rent and other expenses, but I'm unsure of how my relationship would change with GF and family accordingly. My family loves GF, GF loves my family, but I've heard so many horror stories of couples moving in with their significant others' families.

Then the night before, she wanted to reschedule, because there was a football game on Sunday in the city, and she wanted to avoid gameday traffic.

She suggested Tuesday instead since it was the next ""available day"" she had and she was supposed to pick up someone at the airport along the way, and that's what we agreed upon.

Now it's Monday, and now she wants to wait until the weekend, because she'll be busy dropping off her kids at school, then come over to my home, then pick up the guy at the airport. 

Normally, I would've said ""fuck no"" if this any other person, but this is my friend of 10 years. She's definitely had some rapport with my dog, because she used to own him, before she re-homed him to her aunt, and eventually approached me to adopt him when her aunt couldn't take care of him. Since then, she's doggysitted him once while I was out of the country, and she did such a great job with him so I decided to ask her again.

Should I be frustrated at her because she's flaking out for a second time? Or should I relax and be more understanding, given that she's busy and I don't have a car or any cost-effective way to come over and pick up Buddy? I know she's taking good care of him so I don't have to worry about his well-being, but at the same time I'm kinda anxious to have him home.",24Sep2019,1

159,"So, before the new school year began, this friend and I confessed our feelings for each other. We're both drama kids, and we have a lot in common.
Both of us made it into the play that we're doing for the first semester of the year. One thing our director always says is that you shouldn't date each other while working on a play. Along with that fact, my girlfriend told me that she still needs to get over some stuff from the summer, so we're going to take a break for now and see how things are after the play.
I'm all for that, I just want her to be happy. This happened about a week or two ago. And while I'm willing to go through with this, I've felt like the days are going by slowly. On top of the play and school, I'm also in the debate club, and I have a part time job, so I don't have much free time. Is there any way I can make time go by at a normal pace again?
Any ideas are welcomed. Thank you in advance!",24Sep2019,2
160,"School only just started two or three weeks ago and I already feel like it's mentally kicking my ass. Even being in some of the higher-level classes doesn't take so much of a toll on me as talking to other people and trying not to be a loser does. Literally my mood throughout the entire rest of day revolves around whether or not I had any awkward interactions with other people in my classes; if I said something slightly off and someone had a weird reaction to it I'll keep thinking about it hours after it happened and it'll slowly eat away at me until I'm driven into this panic state. Sometimes I'm so afraid of rejection or just being judged the wrong way that I don't even try to step outside my shell; part of me is okay with this but  more and more I find it's not just affecting my social life but also with things I try out for (or decide not to try out for) related to academics.

On top of just general things that happen day to day theres so many other things that keep nagging at me. I have a feeling that none of my teachers really like me (which is alright because I don't see how I have anything worthy of their respect anyways), and when I look at some of my best friends this makes me feel really shitty. All of them have something to bring to the table (one of them is really loud and talkative, the other is easy to get along with and a hard worker) and have specific teachers and friends that they click with, and more and more I'm just finding that I'm a really unattractive person personality-wise. A lot of times I don't get why they even bother talking to me as they could be using their time talking to other people who are smarter, funnier, prettier etc. than I am; this has led me to become kind of distant from them, which hurts looking back at how close we were a couple of years ago.

People have always said I'm a relatively smart/gifted kid and I have the potential to go places if I put in the work, but I have no idea what I'm doing with my life or how I'll ever become useful to society. Deep down I feel like in the end I'll just end up in some mediocre job I'm not really into, live out the rest of my boring life and die alone.

I guess ultimately I'm looking for advice on how to cope with school anxiety or just scrape by, anything helps. Yeah thanks for coming to my TED talk if someone actually read through this garbage; I'll probably delete this on my own in a few hours.",24Sep2019,1

165,"I love my brother, I really do. But im drained, and sometimes I cant help but feel that I wish I had a normal older brother. Im 18 and he's 20. He is either at university or playing video games on his computer in his room, he has no other interests. He has never had a job, never got his license to drive. To a large extent I understand a lot of it, he's spoken to me himself saying he's scared of having any responsibilities, and I think to some extent he has social anxieties. However, I also know that if he stays as he is he will never move out, be dependent on our parents forever and be socially isolated. I'm not really able to speak to my friends about this, as my brother has said that he'd rather me not tell my friends that he has aspergers, which I respect but also makes it hard for me as then the only person I can talk to about him when I feel upset about something he's done is my mother, who is already trying her best. He has gotten a lot better as he gets older but still whenever he's upset it ends up being that he takes it out on me or goes and sulks in his room. I'm concerned for him but also angry, which i know is terrible because its not really his fault, but I hate feeling like the eldest sibling when he's almost two years older than me. I also feel like I have to be the translator or negotiator for him between my parents, as since he will not tell them whats going on in his life I will have to tell them why he might be upset, which is fine but also difficult. I know my brother loves me now, and I love him, but I am just tired, which feels awful when I know its not his fault.",24Sep2019,1
167,"So I'm 16 and I've done a pretty hefty amount of drugs. I won't go into details but chances are if it isn't heroine, meth, or some flower extract from the Amazon I've probably done it or something similar to it. 

I've wasted far too much time, energy, and money on drugs and I think it's time to kick them. 
Now listen close, this part is important. I am not worried about the physical withdrawals, the drugs I'm currently doing don't have any super radical withdrawals. For me it's all mental.


See, I'm pretty depressed which makes this *much* more difficult and the even bigger issue is I was depressed far before I started doing drugs and there's no doubt I'll be depressed after. And I'm afraid that even if I do quit, I'll always have the knowledge that there's something out there that can help me, maybe save me. Even if it ultimately kills me. 

Really, what I'm trying to ask is how can I cope with that mentality that there's always gonna be drugs out there that can help me get through the day? To clarify, I'm not asking for help with my depression nor my addictions. I know myself pretty well and I know a lot of you might say ""Oh well the root of all your issues is your depression, if you fix that the rest will follow."" Well I 100% agree with you but I truly don't believe that it's possible to fix that root-problem. But I do the whole shebang, go on walks, exercise, eat healthy, all that bullshit that's supposed to help but it just don't work for me. 

So yeah what I'm ultimately asking is how can I deal with the fact that drugs are always gonna be there to relieve me? At least until I can get my depression under control because that mentality that they're always gonna be there is what *always* keeps me coming back.",24Sep2019,1

But I feel like I get along better with girls. Probably because they tend to have this welcoming vibe about them that makes me feel like I can trust them. And for the record, IM STRAIGHT OK!! it’s just that I’ve never been really close to my dad. I guess you could say I was a mommas boy. I just feel like I can be more open around girls.

174,"Ok so this is gonna be kinda long but I really need help with this. 

So it's been a tough few months. My house burned down (the camp fire, thanks, PG&amp;E!), once we finally moved into our new one a family member (who I despise with all my being) moved in, and I've spiraled down the path of depression and self harm. 

These past few weeks, month and a half? I don't even know any more, have been, extra hard. (Mods please don't delete this because of this sentence.)  My self harm has been worse than it's ever been (think razors.) The person who moved in with us is making everything difficult. They're a raging narcissist, and have some form of dementia so interacting with them and trying to tell them something is infuriating. They constantly lie and accuse us of doing things that are flat out untrue, and we have put up security cameras all around my house (inside and out) to back us up.

This person causes me so much stress and frustration. I don't even want to be at my house anymore. It's my favorite thing in the world (this house is really special, it was a literal dream house for us before we lost our old one to the fire) and I want to be as far away from it as possible. I make excuses to go to stores or to stay after school just so I can avoid going home for as long as possible. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this, which is really hard. I don't want to burden any of my friends with my problems because they're all going through their own problems at the moment. 

I'm so exhausted from dealing with that family member, and everything else (this school year is proving to be particularly awful, I have 4+ hours of homework a day and I genuinely hate one of my teachers, who teaches a mandatory class, of course.) that I barely have any energy left for social interaction. I can't even speak to some of the people I'm closest with, which is hard because I really care about all of them. 

This has really been noticeable to the person I would call my best friend. I haven't been talking to them as much, they've been making a lot of plans for stuff for us to do. I really appreciate that, they've been helping me get out of the house, and they somewhat know about what it's like to be there.  They don't know about my self harm and the causes/reasons behind it.

They ended up sending me an anonymous message (it was obvious that it was them) saying something along the lines of ""You never talk to me anymore. You never text first. I wanna keep being friends but it seems like you don't. I just want you to tell me what's going on."" I responded with something along the lines of, ""I know that this was you, and I promise I don't want this to happen. It's just been a been a really rough week.""

They didn't really take that well.  Their response was along the lines of ""Ok, well you better explain what's going on. And so what if you've had a bad week. I've had what could be considered a bad day, every day, for months, but I just put on a smile and push my way through it.""

I...I just don't even know. I want to salvage this, I really do, but I just don't know how. I'm afraid to open up to them, to anyone really.  But especially them because I know they don't view self harm in a good light. Nobody should, it really is a bad thing, but if I brought it up in anyway, everything would be over. I really don't want that.

176,"Okay so I’ll try to shorten this up as much as possible. There is this guy. He was in a long term relationship and he and I had been friends for a couple of years before hand. I was in a relationship with a guy I didn’t really like. Well while I was still dating this guy I didn’t like and while the main guy of the story, let’s call him F, was still dating his gf, he and I started talking. Casual at first then things got more serious and stuff. Well I would talk to F about how I was unhappy in my relationship and log story short, F helped me break up with him, through text. A day or so before this F tells me he has feelings for me and wants to explore them but doesn’t want thing to get complicated since he has a gf. Well he ends up breaking up with her and then we continue to talk for about half a month and then we start dating. During that month I opened up to him more than I have ever opened up to anyone (I seriously don’t open up to people at all). I basically fell in love. (And I know what you’re probably thinking, was it actually love? My best answer: Yes. I was actually in love) We dated for about 5 days and then one night a friend calls me up. She asks if I was dating F and I said yes. She then told me how F was trying to get back together with his ex-long term gf. Later that evening he basically said that he wasn’t ready for a relationship (lol through text and I said I understood). His ex then texted me and me being me (I literally have no idea what was running through my mind when I did this) sent her the messages of what he had sent me. Even some of the ones while she and F were still dating. (I guess in my mind I though if she didn’t want him maybe I could be a close second??). Either way that completely ruined F and my relationship (the friendship we had that was holding on by a string). The following weeks he followed around his ex like a puppy dog. He and I did everything we could to avoid each other, never making direct eye contact. But the thing was, was that when we were in the same room together, I could feel his eyes on me. I had several friends tell me that he was staring at me, with a look of regret or something like that, and a couple of times when I felt like it, I would look back and catch him. Fast forward to about 5 months later. One day I mustered the guts to talk to him and basically say things were awkward between us and I wanted them to go back to the way they used to be and he was like “yeah” (but kind of a distant “yeah” if that makes sense. Like he was listening but wasn’t sure how else to respond). Nothing really changed. Now fast forward to a year later. He and I never really hold a conversation.  We don’t even say hi. I offer my help when it looks like he needs it and he’ll basically give me answers if I ask. When I said hi to him the other day he goes “mmm hmm” but no real “hi” back. And yet I still feel him look at me. I’ve still caught him looking at me. I still feel this love for him. I also know that he is toxic in the fact that he likes to do drugs and alcohol. And it worries me. But I really am quite helpless and clueless on what to do. Any advice on what to do? Or why he might be acting like this?",24Sep2019,1

After my will to continue basically got trashed because of the issue I freaked out and did everything I possibly could do to get out, shortly after I got myself out and I was on a plane back home. Once i got home i got a job and got said personal issue situated. I kept working and shortly got a job I'd been wanting since I made it back home, working at a motorcycle dealership. I now work at a stable 40 hour a week job with decent pay but a few days ago a co worker that was also in the army brought up how he wanted to go back as soon as possible. As soon as we got into the conversation I could not stop thinking about how I didn't give it all I had and how I basically just gave up, and looking back and knowing what I know now I know I could do it. I'm in decent shape now (mostly thanks to the bit of basic I got through) it's also been over 6 months since I've been out so I can go back since I have an uncharacterised discharge. I'm stuck on whether or not I should try again and I want lie I'm probably more scared of going into the army a 2nd time due to just how the whole first experience went.

A little backstory is that my best friend has been really struggling for a few years and I do what I can but pretty much everyone in her family and her fiancés family have not helped them one bit. They refuse to help them when they are struggling and always say they will help but back out in the last minute.

181,"I was really excited for this formal event. I spent a lot of time and money on it, and even got ready for it hours in advance when I could have taken 1 hour at minimum. It only comes a few times in a lifetime, so I wanted to make it worth it. 

This happened at a time where I was at my worst mentally (I didn't have a therapist or take medication at the time. Everything is better now). Nothing in felt worthy of excitment, but this was. That's how important it was too me.

Thing is, it's a type of formal where you bring a date, whether it be romantic or platonic, but usually romantic. I decided ask my partner, and they agreed.
I was excited for dancing and hanging out since we barely have time for that.

Then when the time came around, we went to the nearest table. For the first two hours straight, we didn't speak. I didn't get on my phone because I didn't want to be on my phone when this is a social event, so I looked at the table for 2 hours. They were texting other people during this time.

A lot of our friends started asking them ""Dude, why don't you talk to [my name]?"", and their response was to either laugh and say ""No"", or say ""Hi"" to me and then go back to their phone.

During the last three hours, I decided to start texting my other friends who live out of state, and I think I gave my partner my phone to play games or something, because their phone had died and they started trying to start conversation again. Neither of us moved from that table for that entire 5 hours.

I was really upset, but didn't voice it until I had stopped being angry about it. I don't remember if I had cried when I got home, but I do remember being upset. I told them about how I felt, and that ended up being a short conversation ending with both of us apologising, me for being upset and them for what happened. 

This was in the past, but here's what's happening now:

One of my friends and her girlfriend decided to ask us to go to this formal as a kind of double date. I said yes, and surprisingly so did my partner. I feel like it would be rude to back out of it. And I have a tiny bit of hope it could go well, but reality says otherwise.

Anyway, I am ill equipped to become a scientist. I wanted to know if there is any jobs similar to a scientist that I could still feel accomplished doing but you also do not need to be smart.
I have thought about electrician but decided I am probably ill equipped for that, too.

Thank-you. :)",24Sep2019,1

189,"Hey guys, long time lurker here.

So just as the title says, I'm seeking legal advice for a (sketchy) situation with a doctor in Florida.

I had an insurance plan through my employer that ran from October 2018-September 2019. I sought out a psychologist for diagnostic testing back in December of 2018. Upfront, she said she would run the ""pre-authorization"" with insurance before any diagnostic testing was done to be sure my medical insurance would cover the fees (visits, tests, etc.)... She then says, her office asks for $500 upfront to cover the medical costs, BUT that I would be getting refunded whatever is then covered by my insurance. Thinking this is reasonable, I paid the $500 (knowing I have great health insurance coverage) and she gets back to me shortly saying the pre-authorization was approved; we then move forward with testing.

Over the course of December and January, we have appointments involving IQ testing, intake questions, diagnostics etc. However I soon find out, due to reasons beyond my control, I would be losing my health insurance eligibility and therefore not have medical coverage after March 31st. I communicate this to her.

Our last appointment was January 14th, in which she tells me I will be hearing from her shortly about results and that I should make an appointment with a psychiatrist because psychiatrists typically have long waitlists, stating that it won’t take long for my final documentation (from the psychologist) to be ready. I remind her of my insurance coverage ending soon on March 31s, she reassures me that she will have the documentation for me to bring to my pending psychiatrist appt.

January 28th (two weeks later), I reached out to her not having heard anything yet. She says there was an issue with insurance coverage, and they are trying to get it sorted out.

March 11th, I reach out to her again asking for documentation to bring with me to my psychiatrist appt (set for March 19th). She responds on March 12th with this long explanation: “Hi, I’m still trying to get the insurance company to hopefully cover more of your testing. They have denied the claims that were resubmitted for 1/7 and 1/14. I am writing a letter to justify medical necessity for the testing to send to them. You can also provide the psychiatrist with the letter. There are also 2 pending claims for 2/28 and 03/04 that account for the report writing. If you prefer to go ahead and pay for the balance of the testing and then get reimbursed if/when Aetna pays an additional amount, I can provide you with the complete report by next Friday 3/22, regardless of what has paid or is still pending.” Following up with “We had no idea that their procedures for processing testing claims would become this challenging. Prior to their codes changing in January 2019, it was a much more straightforward process.”

March 13th: We go back and forth discussing the issue and she asks if I’m wanting to pay the balance out of pocket to get my documentation in time for the Psychiatrist appt. She then says she can’t send finalized documentation over to my psychiatrist or release the report until my balance is paid.

September 23rd: I have tried to contact her THREE TIMES since March 13th, and she is just getting back to me today saying: “Hi, it’s good to hear from you. Unfortunately, we never received any additional reimbursement from Aetna past what you’d known about, so there is a balance still of $702.30. Would you like us to charge the card on file? And are you still in town or have you started school elsewhere? We can schedule the results appt for next week or a Facetime/google chat appointment if you prefer that.”

Mind you, I have already paid this woman and her office $500 and have nothing to show for it. This documentation is important for school and personal growth. I have no documentation – nothing. I already told her not to charge the card and that I would be getting back to her soon. I feel cheated, duped, and as if it were all a waste. So, where do I go from here??

Tl;dr: I had insurance and went through diagnosis of ADHD with a psychologist in Florida, but she hasn’t forwarded me, my school, or other doctors any documentation from this process because she claims to have not been paid by the insurance company I had. I paid her $500 out of pocket, did extensive testing, and now have nothing to show for it unless I pay her $700 more that she should have from my insurance company based on the pre-authorization she did with them prior to beginning testing. Where do I go from here?",24Sep2019,3
190,"In 2014 my family picked up an adorable calico off the streets of DTLA. We named her Rosie. Rosie is the cutest thing ever, with one green eye and one yellow, a white tummy and paws, with red, brown, and black stripes and dots all over her. I love that dumb ass cat with all my heart, and so does the rest of my family. However, my sister really wanted a new kitten for her birthday, and my dad (being the absolute cat slut he is) got one for her, we name her Lavender. We got her in the same place we picked up Rosie, and pretty sure they have the same mother or father because they look very similar. She was an absolute baby, and we thought Rosie would like her. We did everything online forums told us to do (letting the new cat integrate, letting them smell each others scents, etc) but when the time came, Rosie just sat in a corner growling. Ok, we thought, maybe too soon.

&amp;#x200B;

A month goes by and we start letting them in at intervals of time. Rosie gets the house during the mornings and all throughout the nights (she is more of an outdoor cat, and never really spent the day inside the house anyways), and Lavender gets the afternoons when we're out for work or school. Now Rosie, despite rarely ever seeing the new cat, and my family being very clear with Lavender where she can and can't go by closing door and setting up blockades, will only come in the house on special occasions. She used to come in for all her meals, but is now frequently skipping either breakfast, dinner, or sometimes both. She hates spending the nights in my room (however the new cat isn't allowed into my room, so no chance of a scent), which she used to like. And hasn't even been losing weight over the skipped meals, but I can't for sure say she has been gaining weight either.

&amp;#x200B;

January rolled around and he moved in, but it wasn’t just him, him his wife and his two kids moved in with him. At first it was ok, things were a little cramped, but it was ok. His wife got a job and moved into an apartment with their kids, yay it was only him it’s fine. He had a job for a few weeks now, it was ok, then he quit because he didn’t like his job, then she moved back in because she didn’t like her roommates. So the 4 of them are living with us again, nobody other than me and my mom clean, my brother pays rent so Hese ok, but my oldest brother hadn’t and still hasn’t payed a penny. Not for him nor his 4 kids, plus they don’t clean up after themselves or their children, two days ago every single dish in the house was clean thanks to me. As of today there is not a single clean dish in the house. They still don’t pay rent, they have taken well over $5000 from us for multiple reasons. And yet I’m expected to take care of the house, I go to school 40 hours a week, I work 40 hours a week, and I never get time to enjoy myself. But somehow I am the one elected to take care of the house. My mother works more than me, but I’m the only one that will actually clean so I suffer so she doesn’t need to.

I've been living in this apartment with my single roommate for just over a month (Aug 19th). We've gone through, as two individuals, 6 entire rolls of paper towels and nearly 16 rolls of toilet paper. Like, heavy duty stuff, not wimpy. I was okay with it originally but then I mentioned to her that I'd buy the next round of paper goods since she bought the first. So now these are expenses coming out of my pocket.
I've literally had days where I'd come home and there's just massive wads of doubled paper towels she had only used to dry her hands sitting in the trash. The most I had counted was over a weekend [https://imgur.com/a/gkIMFSe](where I found 10). Today I replaced the toilet paper roll (after putting it on the roll because she just sits it on the sink...) both this morning, AND tonight. 

I know this is entirely her because I'm a busy lil college kid. We both are I guess, but I'm often out of the apartment for hours. Think 9 AM to 8PM. I like the library as a work environment. I'm not home weekends because I spend them with my SO (our weekdays don't overlap well).

I got the next batch of paper towels as half sheets instead of full, thinking I'd trick her, but she still uses 3 half sheets. Less than the 2 whole I guess. I've also tried buying kitchen towels for hand-drying (which is what I do!) but obviously she's not using them.

I'm kinda at my wit's end tonight if we're going to go through stuff at this rate continuously. I don't know how to approach her about this, especially because she's a senior, I'm a sophomore, and I have no idea how to approach a roommate about a bad habit. (I didn't have a roommate in my dorm because she dropped out.) The fact that she's older than me and has probably been doing it for years is also something that I'm a little weary of.

How else do I try and approach this? Sorry for the wall.

I am FINALLY graduating from 6 long years of undergrad and graduate school this upcoming June of 2020. It's been a long, hard road in a challenging academic program, with many twists and turns along the way.

I will hopefully be employed shortly after graduation but I guess my conundrem is this: How much in savings should I have acquired to comfortably and ethically get a dog? My boyfriend is graduating a month before I, and we intend to live together (so double income, once we both have jobs). He is very far on the practical end while I am not always so, and tend to get carried away with excitement (Think Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope dynamic, bless his heart!) and thinks we should wait until we have acquired about 5,000 in savings.

217,"To start out, I will explain both of the guys. 

One of them is my ex-boyfriend of two years on and off. He had cheated on me multiple times with significantly younger girls. We have been through hell and back together with our families. We both lost our mothers to cancer and I had happened to be dating him when he lost his. Since then, he was never the same and had a go through a stage of severe depression. I was there for him and we eventually lived together for a year or so for our freshman year of college. I forgave him for cheating the first time and everything went pretty smoothly until he decided to join the army. It was tough for him and I both, but he knew it would ultimately help him and his future with paying for college and guiding him into maturity. Once he decided he wanted to join the army, we created a plan for us to move on to base together and get married. He then decided to move back to his home town to be with his family for the summer before he was shipped off to boot camp. He cheated on me again with the same girl and her friend. And also wrote the girl a note to wait for him until he gets out of the military. I eventually ended things with him and continued out my summer single and focusing on myself. Up until the day he left, we didn't talk. But, we decided to spend his last night as a civilian together to talk. We decided we wanted to be with each other, but because he was off to boot camp it was going to be hard. So, we left off at we will keep in contact and see how it goes. Not even a week or two later, he calls to tell me he wants to get married and wants to do this. He claims in his letters still to this day that he wants to do it and talks about how the camp is allowing him to become a ""man"". A ""man"" he has always dreamt of being. I do have tickets to go see him for his basic training graduation, but not sure if I should go with this other guy situation. 

So, this other guy. I met on August 17th. A month after my ex left for boot camp. We met at a party and clicked almost instantly and have been talking since. He is very mature, understanding, and is not afraid to show me off. All of my friends have talked nothing but highly of him and his loyalty to his past girlfriends. He was in a relationship for 8 years and only ended because of long-distance and his ex cheated on him. He is friends with my friends, which is great because I can bring him around and they love him already. The only issue is that he lives 2 hours from me and does not have a car. He is originally from out of state and lives on the campus of this small college for football, so he has no reason to really have one. I have really only been the one driving to see him and paying for things as well to do things with him. It almost seems as if I am his sugar mama at this point. But, I can tell he really does like me the way he shows me off to his friends and the way he treats me. He is a sweetheart and has helped me a lot through some family stuff that I went through early on into our relationship. He is a very attractive guy, and I enjoy having someone who everyone wants yet they cannot have. 


Ultimately, I am torn because they are in two different situations.I'm scared to commit to someone who cheated on me and turn my life upside down for him and believe he has changed when he has proved multiple times that he has cheated over and over.

219,"So at the place I volunteer, one of the new volunteers I work with has a major hygiene problem. When she came in for the first time, every time I stood behind her I got wafts of a feces smell. Not farting mind you, but feces like the smell you get from not flushing a shit. It was consistent too, not coming and going like farts. So I guess she's not wiping or maybe just not washing? I'm not sure. She might be autistic going by her other behavior. Nice person, though, kind and well meaning.  


So when I volunteer with her and presuming the problem persists, what should I do?  We will have to sit right next to each other on some shifts. It was hard to be around her for only a couple of minutes, I had to get up and walk away when she was standing in front of me.",24Sep2019,1

I've only been staying with my roommate for 3 weeks, so I can't really be a good judge of character. All I know is that he's a quirky guy and does strange things sometimes.

223,"I don't really know a consice way of asking this so I'm just going to give as much information as possible and let you guys decide what to do with it.

To start off with I should tell you I'm working a tech job at a very large company in their corporate office. I got the job out of highschool because of a program my school offered. One of my blood relatives also worked there and got me a job under him. I don't necessarily like or dislike working under him, it does feel like I have less privacy than if we weren't related, but it doesn't bother me too much.

There are 3 other people my age working there, two I directly work with and one works on the other side of the building. One of them has also recently become hostile towards me, I couldn't really tell you why.

And although when I started working there I was interested in pursuing a career in the IT field, after working there, I don't think I want to. I just can't see myself working a job like that the rest of my life, considering I've been unhappy for most of the time I've been there.

My work also provides me with a college program in which they pay for a significant amount of my college tuition and I can work full time while I do it. They also provide some pretty good benefits other than that.

The reason I've started thinking about leaving recently is after I've had several conversations with my co-workers and my father and I've come to the realization that I'm not really getting anything out of my job (other than money). I'm not really learning anything that would help me later in life. It's just not something I'm passionate about.

I've always wanted to be some kind of entertainer, and at some point I latched onto the idea I want to be a YouTuber.

I don't know what to do. If I quit my job my parents would likely pressure me to sign up for college in the spring. I would also have to leave one of my good friends hanging since I promised I'd move in with him later this year. I really want to follow my dream of being a YouTuber but I'm not sure if I have it in me. It's also not a very stable job, so I feel like I should go to college but I don't know what I would go for.

Any advice is extremely appreciated. Thanks.",24Sep2019,1

232,"Apparently Kik is shutting down, which could potentially have a crushing effect on me. Kik is, sadly enough, my social life. I enjoy the simplicity of the app, the anonymity and the myriad of different kinds of people you’ll encounter. I love how there is a group for everything! It’s easy to find people with a similar interest or with similar struggles. Now, if Kik truly is shutting down, I will no longer have a social life and will spend my days alone. Thankfully I’ve met one person who I’ve already started talking to on Instagram (we met through Kik), but if Kik shuts down, it’ll leave me dependent on that person. If that person is away for most of the days, or for a few days, I will have no one to talk to. Yes, maybe others would add me on Instagram, but the person in question is an exception to my rule of near total anonymity. Also, I want to keep group settings as I find private messages to be awkward and kind of boring (in most cases).

Anyway... are there any similar apps to Kik? One that allows private messages, a group for everything (example, if I search for movies I will find a bunch of movie related groups I can join), and the option of complete anonymity? Some people have suggested discord, but isn’t that for gamers? And can you search for groups?

245,"A little backstory here, I grew up with an slightly abusive mom. I’m an adult now (actually just turned 22), but due to being in graduate school I still live with her and don’t have the means to leave. When I was younger, it was really bad. Everything was my fault, everything was about her. But we’re at a point now where we can communicate &amp; she acknowledges her wrongdoings (somewhat) occasionally and we have a lot of conversations about what’s going on in our lives etc.

My mom has very few friends, and even the friends she does have she barely shares anything personal with them or barely even keeps in touch with them. She doesn’t keep in touch with family, and has actually partially cut everyone off (they’re not the healthiest bunch, but she’s under the impression that they all just use her). Her and my dad have been divorced for 10 years, and he cannot stand her to the point where when I was younger after the divorce he would barely see me because he just did not want to deal with any of her shit.

Here’s the thing — my mom tells me everything. EVERYTHING. All about work, about money, about family, about friends, about school, about everything. I do share a lot with her, but only because she seems to genuinely want to hear it. But recently I’ve been feeling overwhelmed because I feel an obligation to listen to every single thing she wants to talk to me about. And if I don’t she gets visibly upset. She’ll ask me if I’m mad at her. She’ll say that it’s not fair that she listens to me but I don’t want to listen to her. But she also comments on how I “keep things from her”, which isn’t done maliciously, I just genuinely think that some things are not her business. Just now, she came into my room after I had already spoken to her for almost an hour, and had a really good conversation, and I simply said “ok” to what she was saying, and she said when I do that I make her feel dismissed. She once said that we can either “have a mother daughter relationship or a friendship but not both”. And that just doesn’t sit right with me. Because I feel as though a mother daughter relationship at a certain age does not have to be authoritative, but does not have to cross boundaries into a friendship. But I also wonder if I’m wrong or selfish for thinking that. 

I’m just overwhelmed. I don’t want to be her sole support system but I also don’t know what a mother daughter relationship is supposed to look like. I partly feel like I’m being selfish and rude when I don’t want to speak to her. My chest literally feels heavy and I want to cry and I don’t know why. I’ve read about emotional incest and enmeshed relationships and it doesn’t seem that extreme but it’s just frustrating not to know what’s normal and what’s not. I’m going to talk to my therapist later this week but for now I just need some advice.

246,"This is going to sound like an interesting issue because anytime I ask any of my friends for advice they say it's not a problem. I think it is a problem. I have found that I am completely unable to keep male friends for more than a year. I am a 16 year old girl, and I really relate more to guys and I enjoy their company more than girls. I have a long history of losing guy friends, and so far only one has stuck around. 

Let's start at the beginning, in sixth grade I was best friends with this guy (who we will call MB). We had amazing conversations and we truly ""got"" each other. Or so I thought. On the last day of school, he announced that he had a crush on me. I had no clue how to react, so I ghosted him. That was the end of our friendship. We still haven't talked since and we see each other nearly everyday. 

Making a close guy friend, then they announce their undying love for me has become a pattern in relationships. (Not THAT many, but like 3 or 4). With some, I ghost. With others, I attempt to remain friends but it never works. 

Earlier today, my debate partner asked me to homecoming. I really don't want to go with him. I want our relationship to remain professional because we will make a great team and I probably won't be able to find another partner this late in the season. I need your advice on how to let him down easy. I would also like tips for how to keep the relationship normal, like it was before.

250,"Hi r/Advice.

Hoping to get a little bit of advice about a conversation I am going to be having with a coworker tomorrow - we are both unionized.

We don't really have much to do with each other and usually stay out of each other's way other than a good morning.

The person is a woman who works with me at a clinic in a hospital - she is not my manager, and not a designation higher than mine, just different.  But the people from this designation walk around like they are superior.  The coworker in particular seems to have a few run-ins a year with some of clerks up front where they will mention how arrogant and b\*\*\*\*y she can me.  It's not too common, though.

Today, I was in a communication centre minding my own business printing off something for a patient when a very public conversation happened about her schedule with two of the clerks.  To give you another indication of her personality, she has refused to learn to schedule her own appointments, when others do it themselves.  She was having a hard time understanding what they were saying, so I piped up ""they just want you to know that your schedule will be on the new system and not the old system going forward"".  She looked at me like I screamed a profanity (I later confirmed with the 2 clerks that I didn't come across mean etc) and abruptly pulled one of the clerks away to finish the conversation.

I finished stapling and she came over to ask me ""to talk in private"", which I couldn't because I was busy, then she told me to ""call her"".  I did neither - my day was super busy and I am not obligated to talk to her - she caught me before going home to ""touch base with me tomorrow"".

Now my first reaction is to tell her that she is not my manager and to get the hell out of my office - nothing would really come out of this because we are unionized and it seems to be the kind of things that happens around here.  I want to try something less harsh, but I do not want to roll over for her either.

Some of my coworkers I have chatted with this mentioned hearing her out, then stopping the conversation to grab someone one of them to witness - this is very common at the hospital and usually disrupts the meeting.  

I'd love to hear some of your advice!

TL;dr:

A high maintenance hospital coworker (not manager, both unionized) was getting very public advice.  I interjected my 2c to be helpful.  I think she is pissed and wants to have a closed door meeting with me even though we don't say more than basics to each other.  I don't have to meet with her, and want options to telling her to get the hell out of my office if I do meet with her tomorrow.",24Sep2019,1

She told me back then “I’m done with him” then turned around and slept with her cousin’s cousin. He had the same last name as her. But she said it was coincidence. 

A week later she was back with her guy. 

Then left him 2 months later for her fwb. Then came to me.

255,"A year ago I was in a weird place. I had just moved, so I had quit my job and I wasn't in school. I hold myself to high standards and without a sense of purpose, I completely lost it. I felt like I would never succeed. I had a whole bunch of responsibilities to recover that ""purpose"" (school, work, etc) on my plate and couldn't cope. 

In the months following my move, I cut off every single one of my friends. Two of my long time friends from other cities and coworkers. I decided that I was ""tired"" of being treated like shit -- you know, these friends seemed too busy for me and while I valued our communication the only way I could (text), they couldn't seem to keep up and I was hurt by the one-sidedness. I still think this is valid, but now I realize I shouldn't have burned these bridges and perhaps it was a desperate attempt to control something when everything felt like it was going wrong. You don't have to talk every day to be friends, I guess. But of those two long time friends, I wanted it to be like when we were younger and stayed up until 3 am talking. Of my coworkers, I think they were just casualties.

I've been an asshole like this since my early teens. I cut off acquaintances from school for petty reasons and one of them apologized to me recently. We got a few messages in but they haven't responded since (I don't think they've read it). It's fine, we're worlds apart in context of religion and political beliefs, but naturally I respect that. A few years ago I contacted people from my past and said I was sorry for all the times we fought. Now, I feel like it's time to do that again. One of my old coworkers is in my new city and doesn't even mention it anymore. They said they were sick when we almost met up one time.

I recognize now that I have time and time again been a bad person and a terrible friend. I understand that there are consequences to my actions and I do not think that my relationships will recover, so perhaps the question is: how can I cope knowing that I have irreparably damaged my relationships and hurt my friends? Not even how do I cope, because I don't deserve that feeling of peace; how do I move on when the apologies are accepted/rejected and things go back to silence?

I already know how to explain myself, and it's mostly as I've laid it out here. Not excuses, only explanations. To ask forgiveness but not that we forget, and nothing has to go back to normal because I understand why it wouldn't. I just don't know what to do when I've said my piece.",24Sep2019,1

However, I had a big issue with being absent last year and the administrators are going to be a bitch and chase me up about it whether or not my reason was valid - they once had a meeting with me to decide if school is for me because I was absent with a CHEST INFECTION.  Yeah, they’re going to kill me if they find out my period is the reason I want to stay home.

We’ve been friends on Facebook for years but never really chatted.  I was always just silently crushing and admiring.

Most people in my major are more passionate about fitness &amp; health/wellness than me. Some of them are also on sports teams. Even though I do care about fitness &amp; health to a certain degree, my main interest is more sports related, like football &amp; hockey. My main goal is to be working for any sports team, college or professional. My intended job title goes along the lines of gameday setup/tear down, stadium work, &amp; working/handling the equipment. Furthermore, I already got a head start by volunteering with the football team this season, along with working as an eqiupment assistant for the other sports teams prior.

I'm also open to becoming an athletic director or a behind the scenes worker rather than becoming a personal trainer, yet there's not really a major for the goals that I listed.

However, I just feel out of place at times. I'm not sure if it has to do with how passionate I am about health &amp; fitness, or my increased sports interest.

Unfortunately, it's too late to change my major now since I'm in my last year &amp; almost finished, but our Sports Management major focuses more on the business side of things, which is why I chose my current major:

Up to this point, I’ve lived with my mother and siblings (I just graduated college a month ago, and living with parents up to this point is normal in my circle) and I’m just getting the overwhelming sense I’m gonna end up leaving. My degree is of basically no use in the area I live, but I’ve found it’s useful in other major cities. The thing is, I can’t imagine not seeing my loved ones a regular basis, especially my mother (I’m a momma’s boy). In fact, the one time I came close to thinking a move was imminent, I collapsed into my mom’s embrace, sobbing and telling her I didn’t wanna leave. Like a baby, I know, but that’s my favorite person in the whole world. It pains me to think about not having my parents and my best friends; they make my life livable. However, I’m also aware of the necessity of carving out my own path in life, which might require relocating. Additionally, my fiancé is a foreigner, one who would be comfortable having me come to her (I can probably get a job where she lives if I try hard enough). I’m just at a brutal crossroads, has anyone encountered a similar situation? How did you cope?

It was like a roller coaster; whether it went well or not, the thrill of playing on that field was unparalleled. I took pride in knowing that I was very good at something and always had that ""skip"" in my step. Everyday when I woke up in the mornings, I had purpose in knowing that I had to improve my game in one way or another.

As the years passed, due to injuries and reality setting in, I phased out of competitive sports and into the normal workday life. For the past 6 years, I have found myself trying just about anything: I've given my all professionally and have advanced my career fairly quickly, I have graduated from university, I have hit the gym almost every day, I have taken up hiking, I have signed up for boxing, and I have thrown myself at countless other activities.

I'm chasing that feeling that I felt when I was younger and I can't seem to find it. That skip in my step is gone. I cant seem to find that confidence that I once had knowing that I was really good at something. No matter how much I apply myself, I cant seem to find that passion again.

271,"I'm not sure if this is exactly what this sub is for, but any feedback would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I weighed myself I was sitting at about 256 pounds, and I can only imagine that that number has increased since them. I'm about 5' 10"" and male. I don't think my figure makes my weight obvious; most people are surprised when I tell them I weight around 250. Its not something I actively try to hide; I don't have a problem telling people how much I weigh, and I usually just wear jeans and a t-shirt to school. I'm not super athletic, but I did do a bit of wrestling and shot-put in previous years. Currently I do Marching band, and am capable of doing at least two full pull ups (with no kip), at least thirty consecutive push ups with good form, and running a mile in just over 11 minutes. My latest squat was 325, and my bench was 215. I know none of these numbers are phenomenal, and some are even pretty sub par, but I don't find them standard for someone as unfit as weight makes me out to be.  Though my strong opinions and personality have certainly gotten me enemies, I am not hated or ostracized or even really teased for my weight. BMI will put me in the 99th percentile morbidly obese, and while I'm certainly susceptible to the occasional binge, and have never really made huge efforts to watch what I eat, I'm not quite convinced that I am horrifically unhealthy, based on my reasonable physical abilities. I haven't really met anyone like me in this regard. Is my sample size too small or what?

Wight loss and lifestyle changes are scary thoughts. I've always been fat, and I guess I just sort of figured that I wouldn't be someday, but according to my (admittedly very shallow) research, there's 3500 calories in a pound of fat, the challenge of dropping even just ten or twenty just seems impossibly daunting. I'm not particularity active: beside school and band I have a boring retail job, and the only ""activity"" I do there is standing and occasionally taking out the trash. I'm not looking for affirmation or to whine or anything, but I'd like to hear what you different and perhaps more knowledgeable people make of my situation. I know that I am not happy with my life as it stands, and while that is not solely the result of my weight, fixing it would change my life for the better. Is there any profound wisdom you can impart to me on the matter?What do you think I should do?",24Sep2019,1

One of the first things he noticed was he lost his pills when he woke up.

It's not secret dating is freaking deathtrap for men who are not extremely attractive and have really good game. It's probably been this way for a long time. I have known this for a while. It's alot harder for men to get dates, sex, and attention from women. But I never knew on what scale of how bad it was. And YouTube perfectly illustrated it.

There are multiple videos of this but I'll say the channel the has the most views and popularized it was definitely Whatever. So the channel decided to test the myth of ""if a guy asks a 100 women for sex one will say yes"". I think this was popularized from the show RJ Berger where the main characters coach gives him advice on finding dates and insists on him using the 99 slaps rule. Well...low and behold. The guy proved it be fake. Not one girl said sex to him.

So whatever said....let's kick it up a notch and try it with a girl. And what do you know? The girl got 28. It's madness!!!! 

Ok so Whatever said,...let's kick it up a notch.

They decided to get a girl to ask other women for dates and sex and what do you know. A bunch yesses while guys got hella no's.

So the vids conclude to us that men have hella small chances of getting dates, sex, and numbers. 

Don't say that the videos don't talk about dates because me and my friend tested it out and we got less than our female friends who got dates and no they were not extremely attractive either.

I generally don't like to get involved in activism. I believe that you do not need to act out against the ""system"" to act against the ""system;"" I believe that as long as I condemn negative behavior in my actions, conversations and personal relationships, that however small, I am doing a part.

277,"So I’m in a bit of a weird situation. I own a house that I was renting for the past year, and I’ve started renting two rooms upstairs. One housemate is super quiet and the other is a friend - but someone I did not know that well I am realizing.

The guy, let’s call him Ned, is nice and usually good company. But I feel he’s been taking advantage of my desire to accommodate housemates/ be a good landlord. 

- He has been pretty consistently needy. The first room that was open was not ideally situated for him. My cousin was renting the other room at the time, but he wanted to take it when she left even though I had already offered to rent it to someone else. The new renter said she’d take the room he didn’t want, but I had to change the price to not make it seem like a bait and switch. 

- The room he took, he completely rearranged, including getting rid of a full bed I had inherited from my roommate the year I rented. (I got to keep it as I covered his rent when he left). He put this in the living room for a week, and then when I asked if he could move it upstairs, and he complained and asked me to help (I have a sprained wrist), I let him give this away for free on Craiglist.

- He complained to me that the AC unit we inherited with the house was moldy. I told him he could throw it out.

- I replaced the HVAC for about $7800. The old one was dying and ran up energy bills. He keeps turning the AC off when he leaves the house, even if others are here, and when I asked him not to set it to 84 degrees when it’s 91 out, he stated he would need to talk to me about splitting the utilities differently. (I was upfront about costs, have a tracking spreadsheet, and have the English basement AirBNB covering 1/4 the house utility bill).

- He has repeatedly brought his bike inside even though I have asked him to leave it on the gated / locked patio. 

- He moved a few storage items from under the bed from the prior renter and left them in the living room, expecting me to clean them up.

- When I tried to explain my perspective (that I felt disrespected), he said I didn’t understand his financial situation as mine was “so different” and that I was “name-calling” by saying I felt his behavior had been obtuse and a bit cheap. (He previously asked me to stop being passive aggressive so I tried the direct approach). 

Honestly I just bought this house and I no longer want him here/ feel comfortable in my own house.

He said the fact that i was underage made it hotter for him. although he lives nearby, i have never met him in the flesh (thank god). I checked his instagram recently, and he has a lot of younger girls following him. I have no doubt he targets multiple girls. seeing as he targeted one of my friends as well back in the day, even kissing her and trying to make out while she was 14 and he was 19. I know all of this, and i want to protect other girls from him, but i don’t know if i should report.

I kinda shy'd away from her in the beginning thinking I'd have no chance but after a conversation we seemed pretty compatible. I just keep unintentionally acting super awkward with her which, imo, is preventing me from getting to know her better. Right now, she has a group with like 2 other kids that I've been hanging out with but she seems very close to those students; I feel kinda left out even though we've all been hanging out together. I just wanted to know what I can do to start talking to her and create a friendship that isn't dependent on the other kids. I feel like I'm left at a blank whenever we are alone and I don't know what to say or do, I just act super awkwardly. 

I've also noticed that I tend to misinterpret my own feelings. While she's cute and all, I just want to be good friends with her and whatnot. If that works out and I feel comfortable, then I'd consider taking things to the next level.

My mom’s professional life was basically destroyed trying to work with my school to stop the constant bullying (which had been going on since 4th grade but I only made her aware of it at the beginning of Junior year). It’s just kind of been a spiral since then.

I’ve been living with my mom, I’m now past my graduation date, no job. After I dropped out I traded my Golf GTI for a Camry to sell it, then my younger brother’s roommate trashed it and moved out without paying me back. So I’m still broke, now with no car. I moved up to New Hampshire with my mom. I’m starting a job at a Dollar Tree for $7.50/hr. It’s not like that’ll give me purpose, I’ll never find purpose in progressing corporate America. I’ve started smoking, that makes me feel good for now. Aside from that I haven’t done anything with my life. 

I just am kind of feeling, like, why am I even here and do I need to torture myself with this existence. It’s not like I even like me, everything about me disgusts me. I just need something. I want something to give me purpose but I also don’t have the drive to find it. It just seems like the only way out is my extinction. I mean I’ve considered it for years but I’ve also had friends and school, now that I’ve moved I’ve got nothing, nothing holding to this place that we call life.

I feel like I’m having a mid life crisis but I’m like 25 years to young and can’t afford a Corvette.

I don’t know what I need, I just need help.

286,"ok so this may sound weird because the date hasn't happened yet but i want to be prepared just in case it doesn't go well because i know that i am going to struggle with the rejection part if it happens and i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. basically i use tinder and for other times i've met the guys in person, they didn't really look as good as their pictures. the thing is, i will swipe right on most guys even if i don't think they're insanely attractive (just moderately is fine) because i am not looking for a relationship, i just want to get to know people and build connections, even if it is just to be friends. but recently was asked out on a date and the guy offered to pay too which honestly right now i can't even afford to go out to eat for myself so it's either let him pay or just completely turn down the date because i am seriously broke. the only thing i'm worried about is that this guy made it pretty clear this is a date so i'm worried that if i meet him in person and then realize i'm not physically attracted to him, i'll feel super guilty about the fact that he paid for my food and then i basically reject him. what would be the right way to go about this situation if it were to happen?",24Sep2019,1

I felt so scared and I wanted to throw up or something. It was then I was realizing ""I guess no matter how much I accept death as a natural thing, I'm still terrified of the unknown."" After that whole thing happened, I now feel nauseated and I was so scared I didn't know what to do except just cry.

289,"Ok here’s the deal: about a week ago, I (20F) matched with this boy (19M) on tinder and we started snapchatting right away. He’s attractive and seems super sweet and respectful of me, and I feel like we could potentially make a great couple. The only problem is that he goes to school 3 hours away from me and I don’t think he has a car (I haven’t asked him whether or not he has one, but he’s asked me to come visit and hasn’t made an offer to come to me... I don’t get the sense that he’s being selfish though bc he seems super sweet so I genuinely just think he doesn’t have a car on campus). I’m kind of tempted to drive all the way to meet him because I’m really interested in him, but that would also most likely mean spending the night at his place. I’ve already told him I wouldn’t wanna have sex right away if we did meet up and he’s cool with that, but I’m still not completely sure if I’d be comfortable spending the night with him. At the same time though, I’m dying to cuddle with him all night, so I’m very torn. I’ve never driven a long distance to meet up with a guy from tinder, and I have no idea if I’m getting way ahead of myself or if this is a common thing that people do.

For this and a lot of other reasons, my sister developed anxiety disorder (she got diagnosed, but dad has no idea).

However she has been refusing to come home a lot now, and says it's because Dad just triggers her anxiety. Every time she tries to tell dad about this, he refuses to believe that he has anything to do with it, and only blames my sister's ""speeded up and panicked"" mind. I try to tell dad about it to, but he keeps refusing the idea.

Context: I'm studying abroad @ Yonsei University for a year and this about my treatment of my Korean friend from my Japanese class which is all in Korean, but for KLI I'm only in advanced level 1 and I'm in Advanced Japanese for my minor at my home university (which doesn't offer real Korean classes, just a self-study class).

Problem: I'm always flaking on my Korean friend who wants to study w/ me and I need to study w/ her because I need her to translate the Japanese grammar since the book is in Korean. The other issue is, I need all assignments, plus words translated (I can at least use a translator for the words, but Japanese grammar is way different than English).

292,"It’s been four days. I am unable to keep any leftovers and am fearful of the eggs, lunch meats, salad dressing, etc. that were already in there. I noticed when soda from a 2-liter left in all night wasn’t as cold as I expected so I stuck a food thermometer into the salsa. It was 52F. For those not in the know, 40 degrees is the maximum temperature to keep food safe. I work at a pharmacy and if the cooler is over 40 degrees for more than 2 hours, we have to dump the food and some drinks. 

I have $0 and a low fuel alert in my car so I can’t just go pick up a mini fridge rental or anything. The aforementioned lack of funds means throwing out leftovers after I’ve cooked is wasting what little food we have left. 

What is like to know is there anything I can do outside of calling them everyday to expedite the process. I live in Texas in a metropolitan area. 

The people who answer aren’t known for their intelligence; when I called to complain about some outlets sparking, they claimed it was normal.

297,"I cant say it’s ptsd cause maybe I just can’t find a better word for it and I won’t self diagnose but, almost every single night, it’s the weirdest feeling and images I get in my head. My childhood memories replay over and over, like you’re watching your life flash before your eyes. Memories as far back as to when I was 4 years old up until now, they flashback in my head almost every night. Memories of me watching those old heartwarming kids movies and singing songs with my grandpa in his arms (my biological father isn’t in the picture, my grandpa is my father.) going out everywhere with him cause I was his little tail. Following him around bothering him always because he made me feel safe. I have a much closer bond with him than I do with my mother, this may be why I feel so sad about the past. He raised me. I have so many memories of Just being with him and now I don’t get to spend much time with him. He’s always outside working or doing errands, things aren’t great with mom and I live with both of them so we don’t get to bond over those little things from when I was 5 anymore. Just he’s always too busy or I’m not home because..being home makes me sadder. I just see my past and childhood in all these walls. Something I can’t go back to. And me and my mom’s relationship is rocky so sometimes I stay away just to avoid issues. I know it’s all gone because that is life. We’re little and everything is safe and everything made me so happy especially being with him, but I’m not little anymore. Watching cute dog movies, singing me to sleep, getting me little toys and knick knacks to make me smile, cheering for me when I did good in school. I can’t lie in his lap and be held like I’m 6 anymore. I can’t be babied and there’s never free time to watch those kids movies together or do anything anymore. I miss the simplicity of it all. Perhaps I was babied too much and never mentally weaned myself off him. I see him as this savior who has done so much for me, when I was little I guess I saw him as mommy when my real mom wasn’t able to be around. And he was always around, taking care of me every single day. Caring for me when I’m sick, anything I needed, he automatically provided. Now it pounds my head how vividly I can remember my childhood and all those baby moments with him. What’s more disturbing is that I notice myself looking for this in other men now too, I never noticed before. In my past relationship I looked to be babied, to be held in someone’s arm and told everything will be okay. To be spoiled and treated like this little princess. I kept looking for affection 24/7 that needy type so clingy. It sickens me, makes me want to vomit how I somehow turned myself into such a needy child like person because of this. Because of what I miss from my past so much maybe? I never realized how much I still act like a child, wanting to be babied constantly. Looking for constant reassurance and affection and being very needy and dependent. It’s like I never really grew up, because I would follow my boyfriend around too when I didn’t know what to do. To the point where he would say “you can’t do anything by yourself” because I am like a lost puppy. Wandering around looking for others to know what to do. I know I need to fucking grow up but those childhood memories won’t let me. I want to be a kid again and I hate that my brain won’t let me grow up it’s clinging onto these childhood memories for dear life, maybe as a coping mechanism? I can’t crack the root of it all. Happy nostalgic moments like the beach with family, vacation trips, fun school days, all that nostalgia towards my childhood, makes my insides go bitter and rotten thinking about it. Because I can’t TURN BACK time. And disturbing images from past trauma replay over and over ever night.  Disturbing images of my mom being abused in front of me when I was 6. I still see her crying in the bathroom with blood on her fingers, telling me hey it’s okay he’s gone now it’s okay. I can’t get those images out of my head either and I blame myself for not stopping him. Why didn’t I stop him ? Why did I freeze in terror ? She told me something more disturbing a few days ago about what’s happened to her and I can’t get it out of my head. Why couldn’t I save my mom ? I feel like a coward. Why do all these memories sting and flashback in my head every night ? Why do I want to be babied so much? why do I want so badly to be 6 years old watching spongebob with my grandpa again ? If this isn’t pstd or anything related to my depression, then why can’t I get these memories and images out of my head ? I remember everything like it was yesterday. I want it all back just to redo it and fix it all to save my mom, do some great amazing thing to change my life around and make my grandpa proud, or just to be able to relive all the happy times with him and in my childhood. I miss it too much. All of it is gone and I want so bad to go back but I can’t. Why can’t I detach myself from that past ? My soul is clinging onto my past and childhood for dear life saying no go back to simple times go back to those movies go back to the beach please go back to your childhood and I CANT. And I keep hearing these songs i my head, feel like I’m going crazy. Too many thoughts and images racing. Over and over. What the fuck is wrong with me ?",24Sep2019,2

299,"hello, thank you in advance.

I am a 21 year old male living with a family of 4 in a small house. i live with 2 sisters and a single mother. I've thought about this a lot but I figured I can get a bit of advice or opinions from others because I am a very open person and I might have a wrong mindset on this but I feel I am being used and manipulated by my family, or my mother mostly. this isn't a story of pity but I need to explain the backstory for it to make sense.

I love my mother and I respect the hard work she did after my father left when we were just kids. My mother has always been on welfare ever since my father left. My dad was the bread winner while my mother stayed home providing everything a ""housewife"" would do, we were poor ever since my father left. we have always lived in poverty, mother never having a job. she would rely heavily on welfare and would do little jobs like babysitting to get income which I do appreciate. As a kid, every single time I would receive money from either a birthday present or gift of some kind, I would give her almost everything, and give myself very little. I've noticed my mother was always very money hungry. she would be a different person when money was present, I've noticed every single time I got money I'd feel my mother right behind me expecting it to be given to her, which would happen since I knew she needed it more than I did. but it was stuff like my mother buying stuff from my money and lying about it, stealing my cash from my shelf, or taking more than what was needed from my bank account.

At my teen years I've noticed this more and more. I got an internship at an early age during high school and would go straight to work after my school hours ended and got home late tired, but I would do this for my mother. when I would get my check I would do the same as I did before, keep almost nothing for myself and give it all to my mother. 

jumping to the present I would say, compared to my sister and my mother, I gain a lot of money. I work 2 jobs and i would say I gain about $2,000 a month while my sister gets $600 and my mother gets no income. before my sister, mother, and I would pay equal or enough for the rent, but my mother and sister guilt tripped me into paying the whole $700 dollars rent myself as well as $102 for cable and wifi while my mother pays nothing and sister paying for food which would be around $250 I'm guessing. the reason I know they guilt tripped me is because prior to the responsibility of the rent on me,  I was talking to everyone about saving up for a car and planning to move out with roommates. I feel I am stuck in a small 1 bedroom 1 bath no living room very small messy house. Im a nice guy. I feel they are abusing my niceness and know i will never leave them struggling. If i leave, I know they will be homeless and struggling to live and i am not the type of person to just abandon them, i am not like my father. I've had so many missed opportunities from job sites, car purchases, and living opportunities. 

when I first started paying rent, my income was small. I would only get about 1k every month, went to college and only had 1 job. I had 6k in my bank account from me saving up at around 19. ever since then my bank account has decreased and decreased and today, I am at less than 1k. I've had to stop school for a semester, I cant buy a car. i am not able to move on with my life. I cant move out. im stuck. i feel depressed. I tried talking many many times. they do not listen to me and shrug me off by saying ""you're complaining about this again?"" or something like that. they don't seem to care for my future and opportunities. they only care that i keep the payments coming. i was a happy man before. now every single day i dread coming home and seeing my family. I've always done things alone, with no help from family or friends, i hate asking for help but i dont know what to do. i hate my life and i need help.",24Sep2019,2

302,"    It started over the weekend while I was sick, my mom gave me an allergy pill to help me sleep and get some relief. Usually since it's only one pill I only get a bit tired and then I'm fine so I didn't think anything of it. The next day I took a pill on my own, but my mom didn't know and she gave me another one(basically an adult dosage).

   She then had to leave for a lunch with a friend  and was gonna be gone all day, that's when the two pills hit me. It gave me the same disconnect and floaty feeling when you stay up until dawn just talking with a friend or maybe like a lower version of being high on weed, it was a feeling I enjoy a lot and I wanted more of. So over that day I took around 10 pills (5 times the adult dose) and was feeling great. 

   I'm very vulnerable to addiction so I'm not sure how I didn't see this coming but I had already started showing the signs of addiction (if taking ten pills wasn't enough) and today I had taken 5 with me to school. After I took them all at once the rest of the day was pretty much me not working at all and almost passing out tons of times... but that's not all

   I had told one of my best friends who I'd smoked with a couple of times before about taking the pills while I was sick and how great they felt. Then he asked me to bring him some, so I show up to school today with 3 pills in a tiny bag for him. We talked at the end of the day and not only does he also like them, he wants more.

   He gave me a quarter on the spot(yes it isn't much money but they were pretty cheap pills) to bring him 4 pills tomorrow and they are currently in my desk. On top of that I filled a plastic  bag with more than 5 adult doses for the rest of the week (so my parents wouldn't notice too many pills missing). But now me and my friend have plans to go buy our own bottle at the store since I can't use the family supply, I'm honestly not sure what to do now...

308,"I just started a new college semester and have met a friend-girl with whom I have been flirting for a week or so with very positive response. I also have a new roommate who is a really great guy I have also become friends with over the past week. 

I really like this girl, arranged a date to go dancing with her in two days, and I think she likes me too; however, my roommate started flirting with her as well a couple of days ago and here is where I made a mistake: I decided to just be chill about it and not say anything because I figured it wouldn’t go anywhere and I was already on pretty solid footing. I thought it would display insecurity if I bristled at this sort of “competition”.

The problem with this is that she is very sweet and is sort of leading him on/ having him as a backup of sorts. What I mean by this is I worry that she will misinterpret my lack of agitation over my roommate as a lack of interest in her, thus will start to date him more seriously if nothing changes. This has gone on for about three days.

But I’ve already allowed my roommate to become emotionally invested in this girl, and it’s a bit more complicated than “ripping off the bandaid” because I think he is capable of developing a relationship with her. I also don’t want to seem like an arrogant jerk if I were to try to talk to him about it:

“I just think I have a greater potential with her than you (despite the fact I haven’t been very actively showing interest over the last few days)”

Side Note?: tonight she sort of “escaped” our apartment prematurely because apparently she thought my roommate was going to try to kiss her, which I just found out was true. But I’m they had been snuggling before that. He beat me to the punch with the snuggling so if I started making those types of moves now it would be pretty obvious what was happening in a way that may make everyone uncomfortable. This may give a better idea of the dynamics of the situation.

Also, my roommate doesn’t know we have a date planned. If I begin steady-dating her without his knowledge that seems to me it would be more harmful when the truth comes out.

What should I do? Should I talk to her and rely on her to sort this out? If I do nothing I will lose a potentially great relationship, but if I handle it wrong I could lose that and a friend to boot. We are already friends and I do have to live with this guy for the next few months so stakes are high.",24Sep2019,1

 She would tell me everything from what she she ate for breakfast to what her boyfriend's size is. On the regular she sends me nudes to see if they're good enough to send to her boyfriend. We call all the time like 24/7. I'm good friends with her boyfriend, Spencer [M29]. They've been dating for the past 7 years, it was mainly online until we moved to his hometown in Georgia last year. They really seem perfect for each other.

But something feels off about them. I drive by their house sometimes without them knowing and it's dead silent. No music, no TV, no distant chatter, nothing. But when I let them know I'm coming over, when i arrive they're the loudest house in the street, loud music, bright Christmas lights hung up around the house and Loud chatter between them. 

I was at a party with them a while ago at their place. I helped them after the party to clean up, I went to take the lights into their closet and I found something. It was their floor plan, the one's that you see before you buy the house. I noticed that they had a basement, I paired the placement of the door and saw that a bookshelf was covering it up. I haven't opened the door yet, I'm not sure that I will.

I know somethings is off about them, every time I talk to them about it they deny that anything is wrong. What do I do?",24Sep2019,1
315,"My girlfriend has DID (dissociative identity disorder, google it). She has about 14 alters. Most have trauma, because the disorder is caused by this. About 5 of them I am very worried for. Most of them have depression, most of them cut (even when they are out and not in the inner world), all have panick attacks and flashbacks, one has bulimia, one bumps his head against the wall to stop panick attacks which causes constant headaches for everyone. There's only one of them I'm very close with and feel confident talking to them about it. It's very hard for them to get therapy because their therapy doesn't believe them fully yet and scheduled switches are very hard to impossible for them. I know this is not my responsibility but I want to help them in any way I can. I know it's a very complicated situation but please try your best to answer :)",24Sep2019,0
318,"I over heard my friend (14) saying that multiple girls (also 14 or 15) have been sending him nudes, he also said that he is going to have sex with them. so what do I say or do (he doesn't know that I know)",24Sep2019,0
319,"I have real self esteem issues. Though my ex and I are getting along well now. He contributed to I want to say all of it but I have to blame myself to let it get to the point it did. He would never say anything about my weight when we were happy and good. I mean maybe it was like hey I think we should start eating healthier or let’s just drink water instead of cokes. Or he’ll tell me we should workout. And when it came to candy he would take it away from me because he was trying to help my sweet tooth addiction because I would buy 3 packs of candy and eat them all in like an hour. I know he meant well but to me it was him being mean. That I would make up excuses why to go to the store and buy candy and eat it in my car. I would always say I wanted to lose weight but would never do anything about it. But when we would fight he would never fail to mention my weight. He would always call me a mouth breather and I don’t want to look at
 You and your triple chins your just a stupid fat bitch and I know he was mad but I let the words get to me and instead of losing weight I emotionally ate more.  We ended up breaking up and remember trying a pair of 1X leggings and they barely were becoming small. I checked my weight of of curiosity and I was at 240. I am 5’2 and even though there was a lot of signs that I needed to lose weight. Like my feet would swell because my shoes squeezed my ankles. That I told my mom I quit a job cuz a box fell on my feet but in reality the walk was so much for me I would be asked if I was okay and why was I walking funny. I was embarrassed to admit the walk was too much for me even keeping up with my kid was becoming hard. I did change my lifestyle around and I am now at 177 and still losing but I noticed I tend to get social anxiety. I get self conscious. And I’m trying to have a good time. For the first time in months I wore a shirt that wasn’t long sleeve. And went to the fair with my ex and kid and tried to have a good time but realized that I felt self conscious because there was a ton of girls who looked very nice. And they were thin. I was feeling self conscious about myself that even if my ex was hyping the hell out of me I couldn’t help to feel like wow all these girls are so pretty and look at me I’m not even close to their level and he hyping me up when he could go talk to one of these girls instead. He says I look amazing and my sisters have said I lost quite a lot of weight but I can’t help to feel super big still I know 177 is a lot smaller than 240 but I have days were I feel like I look bigger and it makes me so self conscious cuz That’s all I can think about instead of having a good time and living in the moment. Then I start feeling like a narcissist that instead of having fun I’m worrying about myself. How can I avoid letting these thoughts get to me and be confident in myself ?",24Sep2019,1

322,"So my friend has a reaaaally old cat thats like 22 years old. For about a year its had these tumors. The cat has been looking frail for a long time and underweight, lost its eye sight due to cateracts.

Anyway so some tumors burst leaving open wounds that look infected and the cats eyes were also weeping and infected.

Iv been telling my friend and their family to take the cat to the vet for over a year and get it treated but they wouldn't.

Last time i saw their cat it was in worse condition than ever and they didnt seem to take it seriously when I said to take it to the vet. So in my distraught state i reported it to the RSPCA saying the cat needs immidiate treatment.

After I reported they took the cat to the vet apparently but it was too late as I made a report. 2 days later an RSPCA person arived at their house and demanded to see the cat. Told them its suffering and to see a vet and have it put down. Wtf. Anyway they threatened them with court if they didnt go.

So they took the cat to the vet and im just finding out they said it should be put down (I assume) now its been put down and I feel terrible.....",24Sep2019,1
323,"So I’ve just started up my second year of college about a month ago and I met a great girl pretty early on. We’ve been talking for about a month and about 2 weeks ago things started getting more serious. However, she got out of a long relationship right before the school year started. 

About the time that things started progressing further I asked her what she was looking for by talking to me. If it was just a casual hookup or if she was looking for something more. I don’t like hookups, never have, and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t wasting my time. She explained that while she did like me and she wanted to keep talking to eventually reach a relationship, she didn’t want to make anything official because of her recent breakup. I agreed as I thought it was too early anyway to start a relationship anyway. 

Cut to a couple days ago, we are hanging out and I asked her if we were exclusive in her mind. She said yes and I was over the moon. I really do like this girl so I was understandably happy about this. 

However, today was a much different story. She texted me very late and said she didn’t want to define the relationship. She wants to keep things the way they are and says she’s not going to hook up with other people but she doesn’t want the label of exclusive because it was stressing her out. 

I have told her I don’t want to rush into anything and that I don’t think we are ready to take the step to a relationship but I don’t know why she would suddenly have this change of heart about the label exclusive. 

So I guess I don’t know what to think here. On one hand, this girl is very special and I don’t want to let her go, but on the other hand it seems like she’s just hoping to keep her options open and look for someone else while keeping me as a safety net. 

What do I do? Am I being naive by waiting around for her to make a decision or is this just something that needs to run its course and will pass?",24Sep2019,1
324,"So a bit of background here, got hired for part time position in a office basically taking orders. I’ve had little customer service experience and dealing with people on the phone feels scary. There is added pressure as I feel like I received this position solely through a family member who is at the company in a different department. It is a 180 to what I’m generally used to doing. Typing on computers is a important part of the job and although I can type fast 60wpm I still type with my index fingers.... while no one else does.

My questions were regarding my first week alone on calls which is next weekend. How do I be more confident? If I am unsure how to help a specific customer what is the best course of action ? During my training I noticed some calls that I was unable to understand what the customer was asking so what can I do in a similar situation for the future? What are some terms that I should use more often ? And which ones should I stay away from because I I tend to say “yep” “thanks man” often.",24Sep2019,1

326,"Hey, just one of the probably many college students who want to drop out here. I’ve realized since returning for my second year that I really have no reason I want to be here. I have no real interest in my major, I can’t think of any other majors I want to switch into, and I’m now doing the major courses so aimless switching would be a waste of time. I’ve never been able to commit to a student club or organization, my friendships from last year fell apart since they weren’t well-maintained over the summer and were probably just surface level anyways. So overall, not doing too well, I basically just kinda drag myself along through my day, it feels very much like a “just existing instead of actually living” type of situation right now.

 The problem is, I have a full ride scholarship. I was always motivated to get high grades. I succeeded at that, but from high school through my first year of college, I was so hyperfocused on grades that I forgot to develop any actual interests in a particular major or career goals. I still don’t have any. Sure, I have things I enjoy doing and learning about in my free time, but nothing I feel strongly enough about to want as a major or career. Now that I’m  getting to the point where we need to be decently interested to do well, I’m struggling. I don’t see the point in trying so hard, sometimes only to still fail, in classes I don’t have any real reason to take because I don’t have a goal I’m working towards. I feel so burnt out and clueless that it doesn’t feel worth it anymore. I let myself believe that education was only about grades, not goals, not interests, and it led me to where I’m at. A 3.9 gpa full ride student with no direction, no drive, who has bailed on every attempt at getting involved so far, and is now terrified of failing because I no longer have the motivation to try hard for nothing but grades. I hate to admit that college isn’t right for me currently, but I don’t think it is. The scholarship and gpa “success” is the only thing standing in my way from leaving until I figure out some actual goals. Is it too much to give up though? I know that this is an opportunity others dream of, and I would just throw it away.",24Sep2019,1
327,"Long story short.

I went to bed last night at 9pm and woke up at 6am. Around 7am, I got a call saying that I need to a shift today between 6pm and 6am (the next morning). Which means that I would be up for 24 hours. To add to that, I also have to do something else after my shift ends, which will last from 9am to 4pm, which means I would be up for almost 36 hours straight before I get some sleep again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any possible way that I can get myself to go back to sleep so that I can wake up at 5pm today before my first shift starts? Bearing in mind that I just woke up from a good sleep like 2 hours ago? If I can somehow do that, it will reduce my awake time to around 23 hours, which is more than manageable by me.

Any advice? I've tried just laying in bed for the last hour but all that gave me was a headache. Would sleeping medication work, or do I already need to be tired for them to take effect?",24Sep2019,1
328,"Hello 32yoM here

Recently I have been thinking about my behaviour patterns and emotions and it seems quite weird.

My boss at work has mentioned quite often that I never seem to express any emotion when it comes to work. I don't show any stress on my face, even under extreme pressures. He says, it is almost impossible to read my face to know whether I am angry, happy or sad.

The other day I broke my arm while mountain biking in the forest with my friends. My friends mention that I never panicked, but calmly mentioned that I broke my arm and that I need to go to a hospital, so much so that they thought I was joking initially. Even when my friends came to visit me at the hospital after my surgery, they claimed that I don't even look like I had broken an arm and just had a surgery. One friend even mentioned that, he was glad he was not there at that ride with me. He would have passed out looking at my twisted arm and all the bleeding. But, I honestly never felt like that. I was like, okay broke my arm. Now what. Take pain killers, drink water, get to a hospital asap.

Why is my behaviour and emotions so misplaced? I mean I do feel the pain and the pressure. I still do tear up while watching feel good movies or wholesome posts but when it comes to myself, I seem to not have any emotion. It feels really weird. Is it normal? Should I make an effort to change in anyway?",24Sep2019,3

330,"Hello,

I wouldn't say our relationship was unhealthy and we got along well. We never had fights or anything and she dumped me months ago, because she doesn't see future with me and wants something different. She 'grew' during our relationship and she said she doesn't see the future with me, because we are different.

I tried to talk to her for awhile that we can make this work and all people are different. You don't always have to be the same to make the relationship work (things like religion. She wants a Christian boyfriend and when I told her that she knew that I was an atheist when we started dating she told me she wasn't that religious back then and back then it didn't matter) and some other ""small"" things to me that much to break up. I mean for example there are plenty of people who are religious and dating non religious people.

So, anyways, today she told me she's going on a date with a guy that she met and I burst out of the anger and blocked her then after I calmed down I unblocked her and she was furious.

Anyways, it's a difficult thing to do, but should I delete everything? Pictures of us together and everything, including her number, because I feel like we can't stay friends since I still have feelings for her?

Also, I know I sound immature, but I'm like deeply hurt and though I've been through this before I dont know how to move on. When my other ex girlfriend (before her) broke up with me I was in so much pain and I don't want to go through that again. I really don't and my other ex girlfriend before her wanted to stay friends as well and she left me completely when she found new friends and started going on dates.

So should I delete her number and all of the photos etc? Should I throw away her gifts like right now or should I wait?",24Sep2019,2
331,"I basically have depression since my time in high school. I really didn't know it until now. Bad grades and problems in my private life have led me into this situation:

18 years old, living with my mother, attending a private school to graduate (payed by my mother) and no intention of going to school, because of my depression

My mother pays for the school, but she isn't willing to pay for another year (couldn't really afford it since the beginning). She always said that i am just lazy and she just can't understand why i would hurt her so much, by not getting good grades and by not going to school, and honestly i feel like trash, because she is a single mom that has to cope with a loser at home.Â 

And i really want to change, but i just feel so empty. Years of not treated depression and just being a failure trough it since the beginning of Highschool made me a empty shell of my former self.Â 

I don't know what to do. My mother is in financial trouble and time is running out.

I've told him on several occasions that cutting ties and not communicating is going to be the fastest way to truly healing from the relationship but they keep talking and meeting up. I know that it's normal for people to back slide into a relationship and want to try to work things out as friends but it's been almost a year and their ex-fiance isn't even putting in much effort to spending time together so it's not like the pursuit is mutual. In addition, our communication together diminishes significantly when he's talking with his ex-fiance, which sucks.

Ever since moving in 3 months ago, our neighbours have been nightmarish, from what I can tell there's two guys and a girl, and all I ever hear is one of the guys screaming and shouting, throwing stuff, slamming doors and punching walls, with the occasional voice arguing back. It's mostly always late at night, usually around 11pm but its been as late as 3am before, so it keeps me up because I'm not the best at sleeping even under ideal circumstances.

Now, I've got a hell of a lot of rage and anger built up in this 5""6 frame of mine, I think I could take this dude, and I very quickly get to the ""that's f*cking it!!"" stage and start heading over to hammer on their door and do that. I'm always stopped by my level headed boyfriend saying no silly girl, you're going to get yourself hurt, you never know who's behind that door... I guess it looks a lot like a cartoon mouse being held in place by the cat, with legs still peddling. Anyway I settle for banging on the wall but it does nothing to their shouting or my anger. 

This brings us to last night, the shouting was till 1am, so I was wide awake and quietly fuming until a bit after then. It started back up again at 6am, instantly woke me up. I'm ready for blood, getting annoyed my other half is so easy going and doesn't seem to care, and I want to do something.

338,"I’ve noticed as I’ve gotten older, I tend to break the rules a little more. I do things I’m not proud of really, even if they’re small things. But most of the time I don’t really care.
I wasn’t raised this way, I was taught right from wrong always. 
Some examples of my behavior:
Telling little lies. I’ll say I worked out even if I didn’t, mostly so people don’t think I’m a lazy piece of shit. I’ll lie about grades I’ve gotten at school. I’ll lie about smoking weed to my family and boyfriend (my friends know). I’ll lie about what time I went to bed, because I don’t want hassle from others because I stayed up too late (it’s a cycle; I stay up late, tired all day, take naps). Sometimes I run late to work and make up excuses. 
I’ve smoked weed for a few years now. I started when I dated this guy (ex boyfriend) who was a total pothead and turned me into one too (I take responsibility for my choices though). My boyfriend isn’t the biggest fan of it, so I hide it. I buy vape pens and edibles so he doesn’t smell weed and do it in the bathroom. He knows I smoke with my friend sometimes but not to the extent that I do it. 
Sometimes I steal pain meds from my mom or friend, I’m not addicted at all, I just like to do it every now and then. This is just wrong in every way and I know that. 
Sometimes I steal things from stores. Very rarely though. Not that it makes it any better. 

I never used to be this way. I don’t recognize the person I am anymore. 
Could it have something to do with weed? Does it make me not care? I know it makes me lazy. I’m happier when I don’t do it a lot, I notice it makes me a little depressed sometimes and even anxious. 

I have a seizure disorder. I started having grand mal seizures a couple years ago; I had about 10-12 seizures in the span of a few months. It definitely fucked up my brain a little bit, I haven’t had one in 2 years so that’s good. But it changed me. Maybe rewired my brain. 

I don’t know. I just want to be a good person again. I don’t know where to start. Is that stupid? Oh well. I would like some non-judgmental comments with advice.

This post (on this burner account) is also awaiting moderation on [r/bipolar](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/)

Hi  everybody. I know this is long, but please, I really need your help to  figure out how to be an ally to my best friend and his wife who is also a  very close friend. This post includes references to an extreme and  triggering situation including sexual assault; so please proceed with  appropriate caution. I never expected to be navigating something as  horrible and confusing as this. My best friend, ""B"", a 38 y/o man, was  recently (8 days ago) committed against his will following a growing  manic episode that began 10-30 days prior, depending on whose opinion  you ask. He was diagnosed bipolar (1, I think) as a teenager, and has  had two prior major manic episodes, and three major depressive episodes.  The most recent manic episode was 17 years ago, most recent depressive  episode was about 3 years ago. He has a prescription for lithium at the  lowest therapeutic dose.

B's most  extreme behavior was during the 4 days leading up to the police being  called. He was heavily impacted by the very recent suicide of a mutual  close friend. He'd spent days supporting her husband, drinking, talking,  and barely sleeping. I was extremely concerned about how this support  structure mirrored his previous major manic episode 17 years ago. After a  week of supporting our widowed friend, the pattern continued and became  extreme delusional mania; he couldn't work, barely ate, didn't sleep  more than 1-3 hours per night, and became increasingly untethered from  consensus reality. By the fourth day of obvious symptoms, B invited his  family, myself and my partner to come over to dinner. Everyone was well  aware he was manic, and the plan was to try to get him to a hospital  voluntarily. The evening started relatively well, but after a series of  small agitations and emotional outbursts, he pushed his sister to the  ground, tried to do the same to his mom, and threatened his wife.  Everyone fled the house screaming, and 911 was called. Seeing him being  forcibly restrained and put in the ambulance was probably the worst  experience of my life so far, despite knowing he needed to be brought  somewhere safe.

Soon after, his  wife, ""H"", told me and other close friends that 2 nights before he was  hospitalized he had violently raped her. He forced himself on her and  insisted that he \*was\* our widowed friend. After a struggle, H hit him  and he partially snapped out of his delusion. She told me B said ""I  would kill any man that did that to you.""

She  is deeply traumatized, like anyone would be. Everyone close to them is,  but H's trauma is profound. B is still in the hospital now and is  beginning to recover, but it's taking a long time for him to come down.  In the process, he has flipped the script in his recollection and  insists that H ""forced him do it"", and that he's deeply angry. He has  confessed to the staff in the ward, but only with his version of events.  H has now given her version to the staff as well. H is getting a  restraining order and going to court to make sure he can't come home  right away, and is talking very seriously about divorce. They have two  wonderful kids, aged 9 and 15, and this is a massively confusing and  traumatizing event for them as well.

I  don't know how to -think- about this. I'm having major cognitive  dissonance because I know that B is the gentlest, kindest, and most  honest soul I've ever met. We've been the closest of friends for over 20  years, and I never had any worry that he would be violent in any way  towards anyone, ever. I know the stats on mental illness and violence,  and that mentally ill people are far more likely to have violence  perpetrated against them than the other way around. I was with him  through his last episode and he never even approached any violent  behavior. This has been absolutely shocking devastating to everyone  involved, H, of course, most of all.

So,  what to do? How to proceed? How best to support H \*and\* B? They are one  of the most resilient and loving couples I've ever met. They've been  together for 16 years, weathering extreme obstacles of poverty and  misfortune with incredible grace. They've always been an inspiration to  me, and I love them both so, so much. I can barely believe this  situation is real, but the fallout has been all encompassing for over a  week and is unlikely to improve anytime soon. H will always have this  memory, and B will always have to live with what he did while manic and  delusional. And so will all their friends and family. H knows it wasn't  ""actually"" B who raped her, it was a body and a brain flooded with a  terrible chemical imbalance. But how does H find forgiveness after such a  terrible trauma, and how does B forgive himself once he comes to terms  with what he did?  His lithium levels were almost undetectable when he  was admitted, which means he had been lying about taking his meds. H,  understandably, views this as an almost unforgivable breach of trust.

For  now, I and others have urged H to see a therapist as now as possible,  and given her references for trustworthy PTSD counselors and therapists  in our area. Along with another close friend, my partner an I have set  up a fundraising circle to make sure she can pay rent and bills. We've  made sure she always has someone physically with her or at least  immediately available. I've let her know that she'll be loved and  supported no matter what she chooses to do with her marriage, while also  expressing concern about making big decisions so close to the assault.  My partner and I are very actively seeking out therapists for ourselves  as well.

I don't know what I would  do in her place, and I don't know how to support B once he reemerges  from this. Once his lithium starts working I know he'll be devastatingly  ashamed and very possibly suicidal. This is uncharted territory, and I  can't find anything online that addresses a situation that's even  remotely close. Any guidance, especially if you've experienced something  similar, would be deeply appreciated. I love these people dearly. Thank  you.",24Sep2019,3

343,"I am 16F and my mum is severely depressed and I don't know how to help her or what to do. She hasn't eaten a proper meal for 5 days and she has bipolar disorder and some other mental health issues for which she has a heavy load of medication for that she has stopped taking altogether. 

She has been crying almost everyday, she hasn't slept in days and I don't know what to do. I keep telling her to eat and she won't and I threatened to call the ambulance if she doesn't eat and she told me to go away. Then she came and apologised and she said she doesn't want to stress me out but I can't help but worry about her wellbeing when she is constantly crying and displaying suicidal tendencies. 

She keeps saying that the only things she can control in her life right now are her medication and her eating and so she hasn't eaten and stopped taking her medication, she has been drinking alcohol a lot and also water. Please help what do I do because whatever I have been trying to do is not working at all.",24Sep2019,1
344,"So...this will be a half story half question. I live in Romania. Over here you join a school/get an instructor and then after doing a certain set of hours you go take your written exam and after that you get booked for an exam with a police officer.(you cant do it in your own car either. Just your instructors) And I'm not the smartest it took me ages to pass it. So I hadn't driven in about 4 to 5 months now. The other day I had met up with my instructor to take some lessons as we talked. Extra stuff and during the entire 2 hours the car was full off other people. Despite him knowing I have anxiety issues (he did the same before. But I somehow handled it) And at smallest mistake hed start full on raging at me and yelling at me and pretty much acting like an over glorified drill sergeant even swearing at me. Last lessons before this happened he already was acting like this. Even tried smacking me for a mistake I did. But I dealt with it because my dad told me hes gud instructor he will get you your license huehue. But yesterday it got very very bad. The shouting and belittling just got to bad. To the point I snapped and told him to fuck off and stop acting towards me like I'm a piece of shit and show some respect for once instead of swearing at me. He got even worse and started full on swearing at me. Telling me I will never pass my test in front of everyone in car and passerby. I got kicked out of the car and he gave me my dossier (the paper necessary for the test) and told me to fuck of to whatever school would take me in because I'm never passing that test and he will make sure of that.

I was about to leave. Didn't say anything...just wanted to find a buss to get in and go home and cool off. He gets in my face all puffed up as I am about to fucking raging at me again. Asking me why I FUCKING swore at him (I didn't) and kept trying to push me with his chest to pick a fight. I just pushed him back and told him to keep his fucking distance not to make this any worse then it has to be. I walked away with him swearing at me.

So...does any Romanian know if its possible to get another school to sing me up? I'm 2 weeks away from taking my test. With no car to take it in,no lessons to get used with the car again...and well an ego that feels like complete shit after all the belittling. At this point I'm starting to think I should have legit him over that...but that wouldnt solve shit just make matters worse. Just help my ego I guess...but to late for any of that.

347,"My boyfriend (20m) is mistreating me, we have been together for 8 months. He has been diagnosed with depression about a month ago and is taking medication for it. I don't know if he started therapy. I'm away for a month and he kept on avoiding communicating with me. Me leaving for a bit will be happening in the future as my family lives in different country. Recently he messaged me saying he knows he wasn't treating me right and we should talk about what to do with the relationship once I come back.
 
The thing is, after a few days he kept the communication to minimum. He didn't even call. And he started ghosting me again for like a whole day or so. Leaving me on seen etc. He keeps on meeting other people and having fun. I know he will be making excuses but I don't want to hear them anymore. 

I need to be strong and break up with him. But I'm worried once I see him in real life or talk to him, I will immediately give in cause I'm so desperate for contact with him. Can someone help me with this?

348,"I've been trying to formulate this like three times now, but it's really hard to explain the situation. Fuck it, here we go...

Me and this girl have met like 4-5 times together with other people. (She joined our choir a while back) I didn't really think that much about her, until last night. We where on a party, both where sober. We where standing together with some other people, and had a really nice  ""group talk"" for a really long time. I felt that we had a really good connection. I felt safe. I felt like the better me. I felt like she really cared for what I had to say, and so did I. I just felt happy. She also gave me her WhatsApp.

So after a while people started to leave. Soon it was only me her, and a few more there. We all collectively decided that it was time to go, and we both left the building. When we got out I realized that I had forgot my phone. So I went back to get it. She had waited for me. We realized that we where going the same way, so we walked together. We kept talking with the same good connection, feeling of safety, and happiness, until our paths split. We gave etch other a good hug (Maybe 3-4sec) and said goodbye.

Based on the previous, what would you say about our situation?  
Personally, I'm like ""Interested"" but not ""In love"". Since we just got to know etch other a bit more, an it's not the ""we've been best friends for manny years, but I think I love her"" situation.  
I feel like this is the point where your able to kind of steer the relationship.

I also want to ad that I have female friends, and I know the difference. I feel like this is different. I want to be close to her, both physically and mentally.

349,"Not sure if dependant is the right word here but..

I recently moved into a big house converted into flats with my boyfriend. I’m on the ground floor and my neighbour who lives upstairs is my landlords daughter. I was told by the estate agents that she has mental health issues but nothing specific about her situation apart from that I probably wouldn’t see her that often and her parents bring her food shopping etc. 

I’ve lived here just over a week. A few days after I moved in she knocked on the door to introduce herself. She seemed nice enough, saying to let her know if she’s being noisy or if we need anything to text her and she gave me her number. 

Then a few days ago she knocked on the door asking me for cigarette papers so I gave her some. She then text me saying we should have a film and pizza night and get to know each other. I’m pretty introverted and work night shifts as a mental health support worker so I’m pretty knackered most of the time and prefer my own company to relax, but thought it’d be nice to get to know her because I think she’s a similar age to me. We arranged for me to go to her flat Thursday evening. 

Now today I’ve just finished work and come back to the flat. She must have heard me come in because she’s just text me asking me to take her to get tobacco and she will buy me a mcdonalds or give me petrol money. She said she doesn’t know anyone around here and her parents live 45 mins away so can’t get to her. I know she knows people around here because I’ve heard her with friends at her flat and seen some guy around at hers. Also there’s a shop literally 2 minute walk away from here she can get tobacco from. 

On one hand I understand she has mental health issues and probably doesn’t want to go out alone and I want to be nice seeing as she’s my neighbour and my landlords daughter. But on the other hand as bad as it sounds I’m just exhausted enough from working with people with complex mental health needs as well as trying to cope with my own mental health and juggling work/renting a flat for the first time/my own social life. 

Working in mental health I know how people can become manipulative and if you do nice things for them will become more demanding or dependant on you. 

Just looking for advice as I’ve only spoken to her very briefly twice and don’t feel comfortable letting her get attached to me because I know I’m not emotionally available enough for that. 

I feel like I can’t really ignore her because she lives upstairs and I don’t want her to come knocking on my door and it being awkward / I know I’ll give in and say something like ‘I didn’t see your text yes of course I’ll take you to get baccy’ 

Sorry this is so long I know I probably sound like I’m making this a way bigger deal than it is!!!",24Sep2019,3
350,"So for starters me (24m) and my friend Jeff have been friends for about 10 years. We went to the same high school and college, and always get along well. Jeff has been dating Stacy for about 7-8 years. They were long distance at first so I never really knew stacy until about 5-6 years into their relationship when they moved in together. She moved from across the country so other than Jeff and his family she really knew no one else here. (New Jersey) Us 3 now started to hang out and we became very close. I tried to always make her feel very welcome into our friend group from the beginning.  Stacy and Jeffs relationship seemed to be going great. 

About a month ago all of a sudden Jeff texts me out of nowhere saying they are breaking up. They say everything is fine and they both mutually agreed to end things on good terms. I am shocked and so were all my other friends. We all thought they would be getting married one day. Jeff moves back home with his parents and Stacy continues to live at their apartment by herself. I console Jeff over the next few weeks. He was sad at first but seems to be doing better now. I deeply miss my friendship with Stacy however and am not sure what to do. We went from hanging out 3-4 times a week and we all even went on multiple vacations/trips togethers to all of a sudden rarely any contact other than the occasional text/snapchat. I don’t know what to do. On the one hand, I want to ask Stacy to hang out but it feels weird and I definitely wouldn’t want Jeff to get upset over this. Everything feels so awkward now.  I also considered just inviting her to come out when the entire friend group goes out but Im not sure that as a good idea either.",24Sep2019,1
351,"So my little brother is 9, and he’s always on his phone or ps4 playing fortnite. 
He’s doing ok in math but fails reading and language overall. 
He doesn’t have any other interests and no hobbies, I know he’s only 9 but all of his friends go do something like karate or piano and whatever. 
He refuses to read after school, he will just cry if we make him, we had to get him a tutor and they’re still working on 3rd grade material (he’s in 4th) so he’s really behind other kids. 
When I was a kid I also played a lot but I was a straight A student, played soccer, parkour and had many hobbies. 
I have this theory what differentiates us - back in my day my parents were low-middle class, my dad had to work really hard and I barely seen him, I remember as a kid making a promise to myself that I will never work this hard in my life for money, and I will just educate myself and become rich, so I put a lot of effort in education and learning. 
Now we’re Middle - high class, we have everything, all he asks for he gets, PS4? Sure. VBucks? Sure. 
I think he just doesn’t know that money isn’t easy to get and you actually have to work hard and learn to have money and have a nice life. 
How do I make him change his ways and actually be interested in learning?",24Sep2019,2
352,"English is my second language so bear with me.

So I travel back to my country to enjoy my gap year from college. I travelled to a suburban area far from my parents where I attend a temple and work. I work as a part-time language teacher. It is not close to the temple, and for several reasons I cannot commute from the temple where I stayed to where I work. Just so it happen that a distant relative of mine is walking distance to my workplace, I asked to stay and was welcomed there. I stayed with a father and son (~60M and ~30M). The house was big, so when I came back from first day of work I was greeted with hospitality from my distant relative. He was nice to me, sometimes take me out for breakfast and morning coffee, take me around and show me the places in town. Sometimes he cooks me lunch, which I really appreciate.

Up until one day I came back from work, I forgot the keys in my jacket at work, but instead of calling him on phone and ask him to open the door, I made a dumb move of shouting his name from outside at 9:30 PM. He open the door and I was scold a little, but I apologized, no problem, I learn fast, it won’t happen again and I’ll call if I ever forgot my keys.

The day after, I heard slamming doors from the bathroom, then he went to slam the balcony door. I was the only one upstairs with him, so I am throughly confused. He didn’t talk to me anymore at home. I don’t think a lot about it by then, because I assume there might just be his bad day. A few days forward I saw him going the opposite direction while walking to work. I talk to him but he didn’t respond, just look at me and walk past.

2 days ago, I heard him started the washing machine. He then open my door without knocking, and say he will need to use the PC regularly for a while. The PC was in my room, he probably need it for work, so I didn’t mind. He told me to bring all my stuff, and move downstairs into another room. So apparently at 10:00 PM at night I had to move literally all my belongings and move them downstairs. It’s ok, I’m currently a freeloader, I’ll manage. (His father, the elder relative, does not accept my money that I offered for staying no matter how I tried to convince him.) After I bring all my stuff down, I realized the “son” relative put all my laundry outside, stuff his clothes in, and wash. What is ridiculous is that from the beginning, he told me we would wash together and whatever dirty clothes just put in the washing machine. When it’s full, wash it. We had been doing it for 3 times. We stuff our machine with dirty clothes, and when it’s full, we wash and hang dry it. I ask him why all my dirty clothes were outside and he simply said “Wash your own clothes”. I look into the washing machine, it is half full. He could’ve keep my clothes in there and it still wouldn’t be full. I have to wake up, go to the temple and hand-wash all my clothes the next morning. I almost have no clean clothes to wear to work.

Now I don’t know what room I’ll sleep in. I don’t even feel comfortable staying here. I wanted to do something to stop the passive aggressive actions but I am a shy introvert and I don’t want any confrontations. Confrontations is a pain too, since he’s a relative. What should I do?

Let me know if you need extra info. And by the way, when I came up to go to the bathroom the other day, he was using his PC to play some random old-school game.",24Sep2019,1
353,"I(20F) just moved in to a student apartment about a month ago with two random people who I don’t know. We each have our own rooms &amp; rents, but the living room and kitchen are shared. (It’s a normal apartment, except rent is separated per tenant &amp; roomates are randomized) 

I knew going in that this could be year-long shit show, so I went in with pretty low expectations. I was expecting someone loud or dirty, but I *didn’t* expect a complete control freak. Not only does she make all these rules for our apartment, but she’s also really rude and petty about it. Maybe you guys will disagree, but IMO this is ridiculous. 

When we first all met, we discussed our pet peeves and laid certain guidelines for the apartment. pretty easy, nothing too particular was mentioned (ie, no smoking inside, dirty dishes go in dishwasher, etc). From our first conversation, I can already tell who the dominant one of the apartment would be: Brittany. The other roomate so far has been super chill- Brittany on the other hand.... omg. Let me give you some examples.

1.  A minor one. Brittany is new to the area and doesn’t know anyone. She also has no job. She’s at our apartment hanging out 24/7, so anytime I’m there, so is she. I bring people over a few times a week, and this girl makes it a point to introduce herself no matter what. She often comes and knocks on my bedroom door to see who’s at “our apartment”. I’m pretty friendly, so I didn’t mind at first.

2. The last time I had a friend over, she came and knocked on my door and asked if I could take the trash out. I’ve taken the last 3 out (in one week), so I was confused why she interrupted me to ask that. I told her no, if she wants me to take it out I’ll do it when I have time. This chick is not my mom. The next time, she did the *same exact thing* with the dishes. *knock knock* “hey, did you know the dishes were clean?” dude, I literally don’t even own any dishes at this point. I was still eating at my parents.

3. I had 3 people over when I first moved in to my apartment. We hung out until around midnight and cleaned our mess after (we didn’t really do anything). I get a text the next day from Brittany asking to literally SCHEDULE a time to talk about the mess in the living room. come to find out, she was talking about my blanket and backpack on the couch. I’m not exaggerating. 

4. When my boyfriend stays over, he leaves in the morning for work (~9am). I work late, so I like to sleep in until like 11. This means that for a few hours, our door is unlocked while I’m home. Everyone’s bedroom doors also have security locks, btw. She put bright sticky notes ALL over the front door saying “keep this door locked at ALL TIMES”. I’ll budge on this and try to keep the door locked, but she could ask me like an adult. Locking the door WHILE I’m home would be out of respect for her(not a violation of the lease), so she could at least nicely ask me to do so. 

5. This was the last straw. I’m a server at a busy restaurant next to a football stadium, so we’re always working really hard. I can’t have my phone out at all, however, I keep it in my apron in case of emergency. This weekend, during a football game, my phone is blowing up. vibrating in my apron. I try not to check it, but I start to worry there’s an emergency. I go to the back to check, and it’s Brittany. She wanted to clean the fridge (we literally have lived there 1 month) and wanted to throw my food out. I hadn’t responded to the first message- since, ya know, some of us have jobs- and she texted the exact same message 4 times in a row. Then, I got in trouble for having my phone out. I went home and TRIED as calmly as possible to tell her it’s not ok to blow my phone up, and her response was “well, you should’ve responded to the first message.” 

Not necessarily relevant to her as a roomate, but info on her as a person: she’s one of those people that corrects you on everything. Even if it’s a matter of opinion, she’ll insist her idea is the “right” one. Just keeping up a conversation with her is exhausting. She’s pretty abrasive in general. 

There are soooo many more examples. I wish I could type them all. I’m literally going crazy here. My parents were controlling, but they paid my bills. This girl doesn’t even pay her own bills, let alone any of mine. The funny thing is, I’m *not* a bad roomate. I’m clean, I’m not loud, I’m hardly even home. Honestly, I try to avoid home now because she’s constantly nagging about something. What... do I do? Should I just follow her “rules” to avoid confrontation? I’m sad because I work so hard to live here on my own and I’m miserable. I’ve already tried to get a new roomate, all of the rooms are already full. 

Any advice appreciated!!",24Sep2019,26
354,"I'm 16 years old and poor, currently living as a student visa holder in Australia with my mom. My dad lives in Cambodia and receives calls from my mom daily talking about how much I'm into music; in a bad way as if music was a drug.

First some context:

About a year ago, my mom decided to move to Australia, using my English skills as our key but I didn't want to move at all because all of my friends are here, and also because I thought I couldn't afford to live and study there. After weeks of contemplation, I finally gave up and decided to leave them. How I left them was a bit harsh, but because I thought I would never see them again, I intentionally lost touch with them. Now that I'm here, I made more friends and now she finds that she would have to work a full-time job to be able to afford to pay for my school, something she does not want to do (she used to be the owner of a local souvenir store in Cambodia). And when I refused to go back, because I knew my social life would be shit if I do, she told everyone that it was my idea to come here and I love it here so much I refused to go back.

Anyway, something I've been clinging on to, the reason I'm alive, is my passion for music. It's not that my parents hate music, my mom likes to sing karaoke (even though she can't sing). I've been learning singing and keyboard by myself and they didn't know that I could sing until I decided to post one of my recordings on youtube. Before then they knew I liked music, and I spent an hour a day on the keyboard (I was afraid to spend anymore, trust me, I would've). And now they are starting to oppress my passion more than ever. Anytime I was doing something musical, even if it wastes no time, like when I was humming when I was helping my mom cook, she would get mad at me, saying things like ""why can't you do something useful for once, all you do is sing and hum"" and she would get on a call with my dad saying that I spend all of my time on music.

I can't get any help from anyone, because then they would send me back to Cambodia. What are my options?",24Sep2019,167
355,"I have about 40 days to study a textbook composed by 400 A5 pages. My study method has always been very slow, as I waste time rewriting everything and I just don't have the time to do it. How would you approach it?",24Sep2019,2
356,"My family is all sorts of messed up and trying to explain it would take a million years or more, I'll try to give some context and keep it short. My parents are still in the middle of their divorce because my it took my dad a couple years to get a criminal case against him dropped and now he is continuing to fight for custody of my youngest twin brothers who are from a rape and who he didn't want anything to do with in the beginning. (he left only a couple months after they were born) When it came to deciding which parent to live with there wasn't much of a choice because our dad pretty much walked out and we didn't have a choice but to stay with my mom. Long story long, my mom and her household is very dysfunctional. Its always a mess, she's never here and if she is she's the one making the mess or she's locked in her room. She's always mad and when she isn't, she's finding something to be mad about. My dad threw our whole lives upside down when he walked out. We got kicked out of our house because my mom didn't have a job to pay the rent and it was literal hell trying to get back on our feet, all because of him. Its still not perfect but its somewhat manageable. My dad is abusive, manipulative and very narcissistic. Since the whole custody thing he has been putting on a very good show for the custody evaluator. Basically, my brother is burnt out from the hassle of keeping up with my mother. I know exactly how he feels as I was in his spot a few years ago and even 'ran away' to my dads house. The thing is, my brother is very stubborn, rude, and has absolutely no respect for anyone. He is constantly getting into trouble with teachers/losing friends/getting grounded/etc, for the way he acts &amp; treats people. Tonight he had a curfew of 10pm, being a school night, and at 11:30 when I called him he said he was downtown hanging out with a friend. Mom blew up, he came home and they got in a big argument. He left, saying he was going to our dads house but ended up going to a friends house which involved their parents in this whole mess too. I can't have my brother go to my dads. My reasoning is going to make me seem like the biggest asshole but please bare with me. Since leaving, my dad has found himself a new family that he has treated better than he ever treated us, and he has made sure we are aware of it. Making the idea of living with him seem intriguing. I always had a feeling he was doing that just to urge us to choose him over my mom. My brother's biggest reasoning for going over there is that he wouldn't have to do chores and could go out with his friends more often and such. I completely understand the mental stress my mother's home puts on him as I'm under it myself, my heart hurts so bad for him but him going to live over there would heavily favor my dads side in the whole custody ruling. This is where I sound like an asshole. I don't want to prioritize the whole custody battle over his mental and emotional health but him and I have been 'fighting' from the inside (putting up with my mother, siding with her so the youngest twins get to stay with her) for years now. He's only 2 months away from 18 where he could then do whatever he wanted, he would throw away all our suffering because he doesn't want to do chores and wants to hang out with his friends. I know my fathers might seem like a better place, even for the twins to go but I need you to just trust me. I get that sometimes you have to be selfish and help yourself out first which is what my brother needs but he's not thinking about our younger siblings in the long run. I know from experience that being with my mom is the right choice for the twins and we need to do whatever we can to make sure that happens. It might seems like neither house is ideal but this is just the way our lives are. Im sorry this was all so messy, hopefully you can make sense of some of it. As much as it would help to have him here I still care about his well being. It's been a crappy situation for all of us and as much as he wants to leave I need him here too.

I'm not a porn addict, I don't spend hours upon hours watching porn and masturbate like 5 times a day. I've never dwelved into the area where I start watching bestiality or gay porn and do not plan to but I feel like I'm starting to get fed up with porn. I can easily achieve an erection without the assistance of porn and I can definitely separate porn from reality. I don't really believe in NoFap, I have tried it for more than a month and a half and I felt the same before I even started it, I just felt frustrated and annoyingly horny.

 I'm a 25 year old virgin, nor do I have a girlfriend and I don't have a girlfriend because I'm not in the mental state where I can support a relationship properly nor am i financially stable to be able to do things I want and buy things I need/want, however I am taking the steps to change this.

What I mean by being annoyed at porn, it's basically me just using it as a sexual outlet. I feel annoyed that I'm not able to experience sexual intimacy with something rather than watching two people having sex on a screen and the shit thing is, I can't really do anything about it because of the ""rut"" I'm currently in. The voice inside my head is telling me to stop watching it and that it's a goddamn waste of time but at the same time it's like ""Hey, you've got fuck all to do, like you do anything anyways, so let's just masturbate"".  


I think it's also reaching the point where even masturbating is starting to annoy me, I feel like I only do it out of habit. I don't feel sad, depressed or lost before and after masturbating, I just feel like I could've just done something better with my time but I literally do nothing in life, my life is empty (again, I'm taking the effort to turn my life around).",24Sep2019,3

@Zypher  I talked to him about it and he got offended that I didn’t trust him with the money we need
I guess I see his point of view but it makes me nervous when I’ll be financially dependent on someone who wants to spend lots of money on gaming stuff. He said he wouldn’t do it until we could afford it, but still, idk. Makes me nervous

So there is this girl I see on train to college almost everyday. Looks like a student as well, is most likely Japanese judging by her Asian look and the fact that I have seen her watching anime unsubbed (she watches on speakers in a rushed train so maybe she actually wants attention? Could be just that she forgot her earphones or something though, as I have only seen her doing it twice or so). I am a big anime fan myself and I have been learning Japanese for 2 years now so I can have light conversations. Should I approach this girl? I have always wanted to talk to someone irl in Japanese but it is really not possible where I live (India) as classes are too expensive (and self study is working fine for me anyways). I feel like anime can be the common platform between us. Maybe I can stand next to her and say 'oh that is &lt;insert anime name&gt;' and then move to stuff like 'what is your favourite anime?' and stuff. And then perhaps ask her in Japanese whether she is Japanese?
I am socially awkward so it's kinda difficult for me to decide whether I should do it or not, I don't wanna come off creepy
Like on simulating, shit that comes to mind first is I ask if it's that anime and then she replies so what if it is?
Please help me out",24Sep2019,0
362,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit and I don't really know where to post it and I wanted to get advice from people. I can't really tell my family as most of them I am on bad terms with and the rest probably won't understand. I'm 18 years old male and right now going to college to become a preschool teacher, but I'm having doubts if I should still pursue this path.

I always felt that something in my mind was wrong. Emotions were one thing I didn't really understand. Why are people always enthusiastic? Why can't I describe how I feel to friends and families? Why do people call me cold and heartless? These questions plagued my mind through life and decided to see what was wrong with me, mostly for curiosity.

I was diagnosed with high alexithymic traits, mostly on Difficulty Describing Feelings, Problematic Interpersonal Relationships, Difficulty Identifying Feelings, though all categories I showed very high alexithymic traits. 

I also had a lot of suicidal thoughts for no reason. The last time I thought of suicide was around 1 week ago, but I don't know why, I wasn't feeling any particular emotion when thinking if I should kill myself. I haven't told my family and friends any of this because I want to keep it to myself.

The doctors are sure that the reason I have alexithymic traits is because of the abuse and neglect in my childhood. When I was five to eight years old I was physically and emotionally abused by my mother's boyfriend at the time and somewhat neglected by my mother.

My earliest childhood memory was my biological father telling that I was a mistake, he wanted nothing to do with me. 

I didn't have a lot of memories of my mother at the time because she was mostly working and when she wasn't she was sleeping. That gave me ample time to bond with my mother's boyfriend.

One instance of abuse was when he gathered up all my stuffed animals, toys, blankets, and pillows, piled them up, and surrounded them with cement blocks. He grabbed two of my toys and said, ""This toy represents your mother and this one represents your sister, if the house was on fire and you can only save one, which one would you choose?"" I was six at the time and like any six year old, I wanted to be a hero, so I said, ""I want to save them both."" To which he replied, ""You can only save one, not both, that decision costed you your mother's and sister's lives."" He through the two toys in the pile, doused it with lighter fluid and proceeded to light my stuff on fire.

Another was on the day after my seventh birthday. He wasn't there for my birthday so the day after he came into my room in the morning and told be that he had a present for me. He opened his hand and had seven thumb tacks. He said he had one for each year and proceeded to stab them between my fingernail and skin in seven of my fingers.

I was put through daily with beatings with studded belts until my butt was black and blue to different emotional scenarios. I was also bullied a lot in school for the way I dressed, which usually consisted of baggy long sleeves and pants. The teachers saw this and did nothing. I even showed one of the teachers I trusted my bruises and she said she would help me, but after six months of waiting, nothing changed.

This went on until I was eight. My mother decided to break up with the boyfriend because she saw the abuse and we moved to a different state. My mother never really showed a lot of regret, except for talking bad about the guy behind his back.

I'm 18 years old now and believe I want to be a preschool teacher, mostly to help children going through what I did. I think I really want to help, but I'm not sure if I should continue on this path. Teaching, especially with young preschool children, requires a lot of emotional feelings, something I can't really provide.

So I need advice, can a person with has thoughts of suicide and alexithymia become a preschool teacher? Or should I pursue something else?",24Sep2019,1
364,"This started yesterday and now today everything has gone to shit.  I really need some advice.  I'm a 15 year old male in Australia, and I have 2 parents &amp; a brother. (8).  

Yesterday after coming home to school I was sitting on the couch, on my computer browsing youtube and my parents just went out to get my brother and pick up some stuff from the store.  When coming back, the first thing my Dad says is ""Go get the clothes out from outside, it's about to rain"".  I responded with ""Why the hell do I always have to get the clothes, for once I'm goddamn relaxing and the first thing you tell me to do is 'go do something' "".  I said this in a really snappy and aggressive tone, because I just had a really bad day in school as I found out I got low grades for a test (I normally get high grades, but I nearly failed this one assessment because my essay wasn't thorough enough) and I was in a bad mood because I messed up badly in the test.  

My dad immediately gets pissed off and starts shouting at me for being lazy, arrogant and ""anti-house"".  He then gets a cricket bat and basically attempts to chase me around the house until he then managed to hit me on the back of the knee hard enough for me to start limping (later I found that it was really swollen).  He further screamed at me and told me to put the clothes out, which mind you was really fucking hard because I was limping.  I spent the rest of the evening in my room and didn't eat dinner.  

Now, this morning after doing my morning routine, I told my mum that I couldn't go to school in this condition (because I was still limping and the swelling on the back of my knee, she then screamed at me that I have to go to school and called me a ""fucking bitch"" and a ""bastard"".  My dad woke up from my mum's screaming and then started to get physical with me and slapped me, and said ""You will go to fucking school or I will kick you out of the fucking house"".  At this point I just gave up arguing, got dressed and limped to the bus stop.  School passes by without any problem, and I just spent interval (recess) and lunch in the library.  

After getting home, we were all having a coke, and when I was going to put mine in the bin since I finished, my dad said ""Put mine in the bin as well"", to which I replied ""Or what, are you going to try and break my knee again"".  He again got pissed of and said ""I'll fucking remember this"" and just ignored me.   Now this evening, my dad started pissing me off again by making those passive aggressive side-remarks, and it really got on my nerves because after hearing him for 1-2 hours, I just had it.  I said ""If you don't shut up, I'm going to get that same bat and break your knee with it"".  My dad then said ""Ok, go goddamn do it then"".  My dad followed me to the area with the bat and I said ""don't make me do it"".   My dad then lunged for the bat, and I pushed him into the corner and held him down.  I shouted ""next time you try and hit me, I'll hit you, AM I CLEAR?"" I head a muffled response, and I let go.  I completely snapped in that moment.  Big mistake.  

My dad once again chased me around the house, but this time I  was genuinely fearing for my safety, so I ran out of the house and my dad locked the door.  After an hour or two, my mum told me to get back in ( I overheard my dad telling my mum that he'll never speak to me again, and I'm on my own now blah blah blah).  My dad just ignored me, and when I got to my room, I saw everything in a complete mess.  My bed was turned upside down, mattress lying against the wall, sheets thrown everywhere, my desk broken, etc.  I nearly started crying.  Now I'm just sitting on my half-reconstructed bed and awaiting some advice from this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Moving out is not an option for me, and I will not consider it.  I already have plans to get out once I turn 18.  I don't think I should go to the police, however this isn't the first time my dad has effectively assaulted me over something so fucking small.  (I think he's bipolar or something).  My 'relationship' with my dad is now basically over, and I don't even fucking know what to do (my leg is fine now).  I'll try and respond to as many comments as possible until I can figure out how to go to sleep.  I'll edit anything if necessary, i.e clarity or anything else that has happened now.",24Sep2019,1
365,"So I play a lot of video games that require communication with random people, anyways with that, these people that I most likely won’t talk to again, or will just never meet them in person- I make up dumb lies for no reason.

369,"I will try to keep this as short as possible! I’ve been dealing with PTSD, depression, OCD and anxiety for 8 years since my mum died in extremely traumatic circumstances but I’ve tried to keep my life as normal as possible and make sure I leave the house and socialise regularly. A friend of mine who I’ve had for about 13 years used to always invite me to social events with her and her friends and I really enjoyed these events and thought I got on with everyone really well. However I did have a few instances (3 out of maybe 10) where I was feeling a bit down / anxious and I was probably being a bit quiet and anti social. She also lives ages away from me and we would always stay at her house and I think that would sometimes magnify my anxiety by knowing I couldn’t go home. 

Anyway, over the last year I’ve noticed that I’ve not been invited to anything anymore. I brought it up with my friend after I saw that she went to an event I introduced her to a few years ago without me.  When I brought it up with her, she told me that I was too rude to have at social events with her anymore and that all of her friends think that I am moody and that I bring the atmosphere down. She also said that I make negative comments and act like I don’t want to be there. I asked her if she could tell me which times she was referring to and she mentioned the 3 instances where my anxiety and depression were particularly bad (as mentioned above). I have explained this before and also said that not being invited to things makes me feel way worse than being invited and having to say no / unexpectedly feeling anxious while out. We ended our conversation because I was pretty hysterical and needed some time to calm down. 

My problem is now that this conversation has happened I really don’t see how I can carry on our friendship. I feel so deeply hurt by what she has said and can’t help but think that if she really was a true friend of mine she would understand that sometimes anxiety can strike completely out of the blue and that it has only happened a few times and it hasn’t been consecutive (there have been lots of good times inbetween). Regardless of that, she’s adamant she doesn’t want to invite me to group events anymore but says she is happy to stay friends with me and do things just the 2 of us. She’s been a friend of mine for such a long time and we’ve been through a lot together, but I think I’ll struggle if I now have to have to see / hear about all the things I’m not invited to anymore. I also know it’s her friends and I’m not really close enough to any of them to ask for their opinion, so maybe I have no right to be upset. 

I can’t figure out if I’m just being sensitive or if I have a genuine reason up be this upset? Anxiety has such a nasty way of clouding reasonable judgment so any advice would be welcomed! Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this!",24Sep2019,1

371,"My roommate is a fucking slob. He doesn't clean up after himself at all. I don't mind doing my part &amp; helping out. But I'm not a housewife, I'm not a maid, and I'm definitely not his mother. It's genuinely.. infuriating to have to clean up after a grown man. After living with him for less than a month, he's only done the dishes like once. Never swept. Never vacuumed, never mopped, and sometimes doesn't even pick his clothes up in the bathroom (despite there being a hamper in the bathroom). He's disgusting. We used to be friends before but now, I cannot stand the sight of him. I have to tough it out, unfortunately because.. I can't go back to my mother's house . I'm definitely not financially stable enough to live alone. 

I don't mind doing the dishes &amp; cleaning. But when I'm being obviously taken advantaged of, I have an issue. I've mentioned it to him &amp; told him how he needs to clean up after himself more but...he only did it once. To put things into perspective, he needed his mother to come over to help him clean his own room! 

When he does clean, he does less than half. I'm just tired. He knows I have to  go to school &amp; I'm trying to get a job. The entire reason I moved in with him was so that I can get on my feet &amp; then move out. But I feel like 90% of the time, I'm cleaning. Cleaning after him. 

I try to understand him but I can't take him seriously when his number 1 excuse for why he doesn't do something is because ""he's lazy"". We all get lazy, but he uses that as an excuse to not clean at all.

All he does is work from 3pm to 11pm. When he has a day off, all he does is sleep &amp; eat &amp; play videogames. He does absolutely nothing else. 

Then you have me, who has to WALK 17 minutes nearly everyday to go to school, then I have to come home to a dirty house &amp; clean, then I have to study, then I'm trying to find jobs &amp; still deal with my toxic mother on top of all of that. It's HARD. And I'm tired.

I've never had a job but i went to university at 20 and got a great degree by 23. Unfortunately in my first year at uni i went overboard on drugs, particularly pills (the ones that destroy your serotonin) and it has taken me 3 years to get over.

Sitting here now i cannot believe the periods of depression and outright insanity i've been through just because of my mistakes in drug abuse in that first year (and second) of uni. I've always had a fragile mental balance and it was never the plan to get sucked into it. But i used to be such a social person and personable person, people were all doing it and i stupidly didn't want to let anyone down.

&amp;#x200B;

I've ruined my 20's, i'm nowhere near as good looking. My teeth are horrible and they used to be lovely. The past three yers i havn't even noticed i've been grinding them daily. Obviously depression came with a lack of looking after myself and i barely brushed them  - sadly i really, really fucked myself up i promise you

&amp;#x200B;

The old me was this young, bright, full of life, extremely hard working and motivated guy who also happened to be a complete hit with the ladies. But now most of me is ruined, my looks too, i want to get out of this slump and get a job and start fresh. Unfortunately as this worse looking, less happy shell of my former self I feel terrible about getting out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be the type of man willing to do anything to achieve my goals. Thats why i worked so hard to get to uni and also got myself in amazing physical shape before it (to impress girls of course!)

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs are fine, but only in moderation. Please forgive me - i never planned on going crazy partying. It just happened. And now i'm finally ''ok'' mentally, well enough to work, but i have to do it as this worse off version of myself and i'm just incredibly sad about it. Can i do this reddit? How do i get over myself and accept my mistakes. I'm even embarrassed to see my friends who i created life long amazing relationships with

377,"I put myself out there as best as I can. I have friends who tell me that I should be able to get a girl easily and who are always encouraging me to make a move on someone. But I just get zero interest from girls. Girls treat me as just a friend, and nothing more. That's fine, I have nothing wrong with that, and I'm always happy to make new friends. But at a certain point, I just have to wonder when I'm going to click with someone. When is that magic moment going to happen for me?

I was told when I was 16 ""just wait, it'll happen"". I was told when I was 18 ""just wait, it'll happen"". And the same at 20. Well now I'm 23 and aging rapidly, and soon I'll be graduating college. I've done enough waiting. When is it going to happen?

I'm just utterly bemused as to what it is that I'm doing wrong. I go out, I meet girls, I speak to them, crack jokes, make them laugh, I get contact details, but nothing happens. They just don't seem romantically interested in me at all. They never flirt with me, and if they ever compliment my appearance, it's only ever in a purely platonic way, like complimenting me on the shirt I'm wearing or on my hair style. I don't get it.

Several of my close male friends are in relationships now. I'm too scared to ask them for advice because I can tell that they don't know I'm this inexperienced, they for whatever reason presume I must have dated and been with a few women who they just haven't met.

It’s poorly managed, the person running receiving is rude, will make little comments on what you’re doing, and my store manager will literally stop what she’s doing and act like she has to do something in the back where we work just to basically hover over us and tell us what we’re doing wrong. Last month my great grandmother passed away, I told my store manager I couldn’t make it in the next day because I had to attend her funeral, that same day the person managing receiving was super rude to me and told me I wasn’t going “fast” enough. I then was called back after work to basically be told I’m not good enough and I need to work harder. They already knew I was going through the loss of someone and they didn’t even care they just made me feel worse. They want us to bust our asses but don’t even give us the hours they promised would increase as the season approaches. They try and rush us out to get us out as fast as possible because they don’t want us to get the hours we need. The only reason I’m still here is because I really need money. I also don’t want to be chastised by my mother who thinks I just need to “tough it out” and just deal with it because that’s what she does at her job and that’s why she’s miserable. I don’t want to continue to put my mental health on the line for a job that doesn’t pay me what I deserve, but I also don’t want to be made to felt bad for not having a job. I am really on the verge of walking out, my stomach hurts when I have to wake up in the morning and come in.  I don’t know what to do and could use some advice.",24Sep2019,1
383,"Within 5 minutes of her being home after work, she opens one and drinks until she goes to bed. (5pm-10pm)


In the past she wouldn’t even begin drinking if she had anything to do later in the day after work (run errands, pick people up, ect). 

Now she’s beginning to “I’m only going to have one or two” if she has any window of time before going out again. (Example: getting home at 5, having to pick someone up at 6 - she will drink one or two until 5:30 and then go pick the person up)


So I am noticing the slow increase of consumption but honestly, it’s not harming her work, relationships, ect.
Do I just let it be? She claims it helps a lot with stress at work, which is understandable but I’m not sure if 6-12 beers a night is normal nor safe.",24Sep2019,5

386,"Lately my girlfriend and I have been debating on whether we should get a dog or not. She already did some research and found a little cutie named ""Papi"" who is looking for a new home. The little one is 7 years old and was part of a regulated household. My girlfriend misses the proximity of animals very much as she grew up with them (a cat and a dog) – they were very well behaved. She knows the tasks and duties to dogs (eating, drinking, visiting the doctor, going out for a walk, and so on.). I do like animals too, but I also think that I am a bit more skeptical or rational in this regard. What worries me is the ""dependency"" of the dog. Not because I do not like to be there for him, but because we both have full-time jobs. She is a teacher and I am a real estate estimator. Overtime is not infrequent for us, but my girlfriend is allowed to finish a lot of the typical teacher stuff at home (she has also started to prove it to me). Well I can do too, I’m basically allowed to do home office whenever I want, but I don’t want to be dependent on it. I mean, what if I decide to look up for a new job without as much freedom?

Now we come to the planning part. On Mondays we could arrange a dog sitter from 10am till 4pm – she’d be picking up Papi and bring him back home. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, my girlfriend has the afternoon off and would be at home at 12.30. On Thursdays, our cleaning lady comes by for 3.5h, alternatively, as on Fridays, it would be possible to leave Papi at my girlfriends grandparents place. Then there would be the morning walk before work and every evening after work. Weekends are not a problem. Also, longer vacation absences are no problem, as our parents and other friends offered their help if we can’t take Papi with us. We have 4.5 rooms in a 120m2 apartment if this is important.

What do you guys think. Does this sound like a plan?",24Sep2019,0
387,"I have been with my partner for almost 6 years. We've been through everything together, sat with each other at our lowest, stood with each other at our highest. He's smart, kind, thoughtful, funny. He is by no means perfect, but neither am I. We love each other, and we support and understand each other. We have a deep connection that took hard work to build.

Before we started dating, he had just left a seven year career working on an ambulance. He was very devoted to the job, was awarded several times for bravery and outstanding service, and worked nights in some of the most dangerous areas in the country (US). He experienced numerous robberies, attacks, and gang violence; he has scars from both bullets and knives, and he has a bump on his nose when an aggressive patient head-butted him. 

He has PTSD. It shows mostly when he's startled. He jumps and leans back and his fist goes up, though he has never lost control and struck me. He prefers to be against a wall when we go to eat, but he'll sit in the middle without complaint, just frequently looking over his shoulder. Every once in a while he'll have a bad dream, but he just needs a cuddle and for me to stroke his hair a bit, and he'll fall back asleep. For the most part, it's mild and manageable. He's in active treatment for it, so it stays manageable. The worst thing, however, is the way his mind associates black people with danger. He has black friends, but he gets nervous around black people he doesn't know (which is all of them except the 4 he knows). He will say vicious and untrue things, mainly the usual shit about blacks=gangs and crime. I don't stay silent about how wrong he is, I tell him exactly that, and I can usually pull up an article or a stat or something to point out his flawed logic. I talked to my therapist about it, because his comments really upset me, and she suggested that his seven years in the worst parts of Stockton warped that thinking pattern. In his heart, I know he isn't racist, but his mind IS. I don't want that thinking to trickle down to any children we might have. I want him to talk to his therapist about it, but he truly believes he's just correct distrusting an entire race. Maybe I'm just being an apologist, and he's just a dick with nice qualities. I don't know. I'm really torn. Do I just keep going with the soft approach, trying to change his mind gently, or should I be harsh, try to snap him out of it? And what if he's just a racist? How can I differentiate between the real him and his trauma?",24Sep2019,3
388,"When I was 14 I was in a happy relationship with a guy named R. He was a few years older than I was and went to the same high school. However, I was also very attached to a dear friend of mine, J. Later in the year J. revealed he had feelings for me. Because I was very emotionally attached to him as a friend I couldn't let him go, but I also wasn't going to break up with R. for him.

J. couldn't take this. He started threatening to leave me. I wasn't in a relationship with him, but I was in a bad place and couldn't handle not having him in my life. He knew this. He started forcing me to send him pictures. And the night I did, he did the thing I feared most. He left me. I self-harmed to deal in a physical way with the pain I was dealing with emotionally. Incredibly stupid decision, though it was 8 years ago the biggest scar started to swell and become infected just recently. At school we used to hang around the same people. This had led to very difficult situations and even physical altercations. Teachers were all up our asses because we couldn't be in each others presence or it would leave to some sort of fight. I remember specifically I showed him the scar. He smiled. He fucking smiled.

A little while later we both calmed down. We talked things out and I decided to come over to his place to properly sort things out between us. Bad, bad decision. He immediately started wrapping me around his finger again; playing me, getting into my head. I want to add that **out of free will** kissed him on the lips. We are both autistic and he was saying he was afraid he would always be alone, yada yada yada, and just wanted to know how a kiss felt. So I did, while I was still in a relationship with R.  He kissed me back, holding me, slowly sliding his hand underneath my shirt, you know the drill. It didn't go all the way fortunately. I am autistic too, and in these situations I completely freeze. I can say stop but I cannot push someone away in these situations. Instead I started hyperventillating. I had a panic attack as he was touching me. At some point where he understood he couldn't progress unnoticed, he left me there on his bed. He just sat there, waiting for me to calm down. He tried to touch me again but quickly stopped as he noticed I was starting to panic again. He barely said anything until I left approx. an hour later.

And then he left me, again. I told R. about this pictures and he suddenly said he had received an e-mail from J. I asked him to forward me the mail. He said he saw the picture and quickly deleted it. I asked him to check his trash folder, it wasn't there either. Turns out eventually J. actually never sent it. So after all this I found out I basically dated a dick and was emotionally played by a sociopath.

And now J. is at my university... I study German, he studies Japanese 'cause he's a disgusting weeb. I'm constantly looking around to make sure he isn't staring at me somewhere. I don't want him to know I'm here. I wouldn't say I'm afraid of him, but I'm very uneasy walking through the school now. I don't want him to be there. Why does he have to go to the same uni? Wtf do I do wiht this?",24Sep2019,1

410,"She claims the dog likes it, she claims its apart of her training. I've asked her multiple times if I may walk the dog during the day, or let her out for potty breaks. I'm met with all no's. No because if I do that it will reinforce the idea its ok to whine to be let out. She claims the dog is a high energy dog and this is a good way for the dog to counteract that behavior. The ""trainer"" my step mom goes to / got the dog from also condones this type of training apparently. She \*might\* take the dog out ONCE a week for a couple hours for ""training"" from this same individual who tells her its ok to lock the dog up for this amount of time. I'm absolutely appalled, and this is been going on for a month now, since we got the dog. I had a long heated conversation with my dad about this, saying how it disgusts me and I consider it neglect. My dad echos the same BS ""well she is a high energy dog"" or says ""its not like your step mom is physically harming the dog or not feeding it""

I've taken the dog out myself without step mom knowing, and this dog is NOT the monster my step mom makes her out to be. She is a normal dog, sweet dog who has been branded as a high energy ""dangerous"" dog and I think my step moms line of thinking stems from the breed of dog it is. The dog does get excited when its let out and can be a little spazzy but then calms down. I think a lot of it is also from being PENT UP for hours on end and or just normal dog behavior. How is this dog going to get adopted if my step mom isn't properly training the dog like she thinks she is, has this dog on a choke collar and acts like its a deranged animal that needs to be locked up most of the day! If anything I actually what she is doing is making potential adopters view the dog in a negative light and thus not adopting her! To my knowledge she has taken the dog out twice to an adopt a dog event.

TLDR; My step mom's foster dog is locked in CAGE 20+ hours a day. I am here about 24 hours a day, willing to help this dog out and I've been told no. ( I actually go against her wishes sometimes and take the dog out without her knowing.) I've talked to her and my dad, both of whom i live with about my concerns for the dog.

412,"Hi all. I am currently facing a dilemma of choosing between my health and the scientific fact of climate change and its impact on human life on earth.

I am a male, early-thirties, 5'11 and and currently 158 lbs. I'm a software engineer by trade and spend most of my days sitting or standing at a desk with minimal activity.

I would like to improve my health, fitness and body by bulking up, starting a bodybuilding routine and putting on some mass. My goal would be to bulk up to around 185-190 lbs over the course of a few years.

In the past months I have learned a lot about the causes and effects of climate change here on our earth. I believe that the way we are currently living is not sustainable. I also believe that excessive meat consumption is not viable for long term survival, especially in terms of water consumption and CO2. It seems like everyday there is another news telling us that it is even worse than previously thought and we may literally be part of the last humans to live on this planet.

On the other hard, in order to achieve the fitness I desire I require about 2800-3000 cals and ~150g of protein per day so that my body can adapt to the physical requirements and build up muscle.

Due to health issues I am unable to completely avoid animal products and cannot rely on a vegan/vegetarian diet. The food I can eat is already limited by congenital health issues and I have to avoid most fruits or severely limit the amount I eat.

Now I feel like I'm at a crossroad: I want to improve my health, body and self-image, but I feel like I am massively contributing to climate change and feel incredibly guilty because of it.

All I know is I’ve been trying to force the anger away because its usually not rational and it’s been working but I’m afraid I’m not truly letting it go and I’m just gonna end up blowing up at something small.

Quick run down of my life. Right after high school I attended a semester long trade school. Finished that up and got a well paying job in a larger city about 4 hours from home. I stayed at that job almost 5 years because it was a good place to work, and the pay was good. There were times when I thought it wasn’t, but looking back now I realize it was just me being spoiled. We’ll call this company 1. Around the 5 year mark I had the opportunity to move back home for a job in the same field, for the same money, and at what seemed like an equally good company. The company was not what they promised, and after 8 months I was applying to another company in a town about an hour away. I got the offer at the new company and took it. The pay is much more than I’ve ever made, but that’s the only good thing about it. I recently spoke to my boss at company 1 and he offered me my old job back, and matched my current hourly pay. If I stay where I’m at now I’ll still make quite a bit more due to overtime, and other little perks, but company 1 is still offering a very live able wage with great retirement. I honestly believe I would be truly happier at company 1. Company 1 is also in a much larger city, where as the current company I am with is in a very small town and I am 25. So my after work life is rather boring. I am also commuting an hour one way each day whereas with company 1 it would be a 10 to 15 minute commute. Any insight would be appreciated, and let me know if you have anymore questions to clear things up.",24Sep2019,1

418,"I want to start this off by saying that I am a 19 year old male with a degree in IT and a wonderful job. On top of that I will continue my academic career and start on my bachelor this year as well. So if you think about it I have everything to look forward to but I just can not.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know why but with everything going on in the world (Amazon burning, climate change, housing prices going up, economy waiting to collapse and so on...) I just can not make myself believe that I will get older than maybe 35 if I am very lucky. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far no problem right? Right, the problem comes from my self destructive behaviour which originates from the reasons listed up top. I smoke heavily (weed and  cigarettes), I drink far too much, I ride my motorcycle like I am absolutely bat shit crazy, I  immediately  want to have kids because I feel like otherwise, I will not be able to/will not see them grow up.

This list goes on but the point that I am trying to make here is, that I know all of these things are bad and I also know how I could easily stop doing every single one of them but I just do not see a reason as to why I should change anything when I will not get old anyway.

What to say/ anything i should do or know?

Calming nerves before the interview?

Anything else?


So I was wondering what to wear on a interview- I don't want to give a wrong impression, I prefer low cut clothing (looks better on me) but im not sure how well that will go down in a professional interview (due to ma bust).

They even invited me to their annual company barbeque last weekend and I happily attended. At the barbeque nobody (including me) brought up the topic of me being hired, which is understandable, they are there for a fun evening and don't necessarily want to discuss work or serious issues. I also wasn't comfortable or socially adequate to bring it up myself. Finally when I was leaving the boss told me he would speak to me personally soon. I said alright, thanked him for the evening and went home. Now it has been 3 days (Sun-Tues) since the barbeque.

424,"Hello Reddit Advice! 

This is my first post on thi ssubreddit and I joined it because - well, you guessed it - I need advice on something.   
To keep it as short as possible let me dive right into this:   
My boyfriend and I are both 21 and live together for a year now. His little sister, 16-17, still lives with her parents at home.   
We all live on the country side in like a town where everyone knows everyone. I never really had a very well relationship with both of his parents but I wouldnt consider it a bad one either. They are just really their own kind of people but I never really judged them and got along with them.   
But moving on.   
My BFs sister used to be a bit chubby when she was younger. Not really fat just a bit overweight - but you know how kids can be and she got really bullied because of it. A few years prior she started to work out and eat healthier and she really made herself fit and even somewhat muscular! We were all really proud of her and I really was happy for her!   
Latelty I really am concerned however. She has been loosing more and more weight, has been stricter with her diet plan, memorizing literally every little kcal etc and so on.   
A few weeks ago my bf and I were having lunch at their place and I kind of got the vibe from the parents that they both arent really happy with her eating behavior either lately, but since we were over I am sure they didnt wanted to cause a scene. 

Anyway, my advice I really want to ask here is on how can I approach this best? To understand this further is, that, my Bfs sister is like the holy grail in the family. She gets everything she wants, she literally is the Boss in the house and even though she has a good heart she really is naive and stubborn if needed. Her parents just cant say no Or, I dont know, what.   
To top it of - and what got me to write this post was - that she sent me snap today (we do snap recently and I am actually on good term with her but just on a somewhat surface level) that she was on 30 kg now ( thats around 66lbs). And she sounded so proud!! 

I am no doctor but I do realise that she is in danger if she continues this! I really want her parents to talk to her or that she talks to a specialist but I just dont know how to approach her. Whenever I did make a side commentary about her weight she immediatly shuts down the topic.   
I also already talked to my bf so he should talk to his parents (since they are in fact his parents) but he always shrugs it off and says that they will eventually realise it. I am really worried about her and her health.

428,"Okay. So I am currently a first year in college, along with my roommate, whom I have know since my Junior year of high school. Pre college, I really didn’t have a lot of friends other than her, since being an online school student with strict parents and no car kind of prevented me from having a decent social life. She, on the other hand, was pretty wild. Out with her girlfriend most nights, getting high, and just having a good time. We also have a complicated history, and dated briefly. It was rough.

When we were talking about our rooming arrangement, we always joked that I’d have to be the one to make sure she actually stays home every once in a while, and she’d make sure I go out and have a little fun.

Well, turns out, the roles have switched a bit. I lucked out when a mutual friend introduced me to her friend group, and I clicked instantly. They are a sort of wild bunch, but total concert junkies who record their own music and whatnot. My dream. Through this, I also met my current boyfriend (only 3 weeks so far), and I pretty much hang out with them consistently every single night, to record music, just spend some time with my boyfriend, or get high every once in a while. Relatively speaking, our night life is pretty chill. Nothing crazy. Still, when I get home it’s usually about 1-3 in the morning, and when I get back, all I want to do is sleep, since I have early shifts at work, and morning classes.

Meanwhile, my roommate has been having a bit of trouble finding her people. She has totally isolated herself and refuses to make any effort to meet new people or get out, because “her kind of people don’t go out”. She consistently stays in, binging Netflix, and constantly complains about how lonely she is, and misses her friends back home.

She has recently started to become quite frustrated that I’m never around, but I didn’t realize that I was supposed to be her babysitter. If she was trying, it’d be different, but she’s literally making no effort to fix the issue. I always invite her to come with me to school hosted social events, but she refuses. 

In addition, every time I come back late at night, she insists on talking way too much about randomly unimportant things, like her uncle’s dog or whatever happens to be the most important thing on her mind. I just want to sleep. I don’t like being in my dorm for any other reason. 

It’s all kind of silly, but I am starting to become quite annoyed how every time we end up being home at the same time, she always criticizes how late I am out, and how my boyfriend is taking up all of my time. I’ve tried to get her to go out, but I really feel like it’s not my job to make sure she is happy.

I finally feel free from my parents and have never had so much freedom. I’m not being reckless, and I am on top of my classes so I don’t see any issues with how I am living. 

I just don’t really know what to do at this point, and any advice would be fantastic.",24Sep2019,1
429,"Hey
I've [17f] struggled with mental health issues earlier and I've been extremely insecure since then. I'm mostly fine now, but the insecurities are still here. 
I don't feel like I'm worth anything. Idk why is it about money. I feel like I'm taking up too much space and resources. These insecurities sometimes hinder me from doing simple daily tasks like eating ( bc I feel like I don't deserve it) etc. 
• So my hair suddenly began falling out. This started a year ago and it has abated but it's still alarming to me. I wanted to consult a doctor. So I asked my mom. And she said she would take me but she didn't. ( This was about a year ago when it all started). So I gathered all my courage and asked her again a few days ago, and she said hmmm. 
This is just an example which illustrates what happens most of the times. I always feel like she doesn't wanna spend money on me. My family is financially stable but IDK why I always feel like I'm depleting the resources. 
• I'm passing out school this year so I need a dress for the informal party. I haven't asked her if she would take me to get one because I'm not sure how's that gonna turn out. So I indirectly gave her a message, by telling my sister that she has to help me choose a dress this weekend. She got the message and told me I already have one.

So yeah, I know it might sound like a cliche, but I just beg you to stay and share some experience, thoughts or any advice on the situation. I’m really stuck and I can’t figure it out by myself. 
So the story goes like that:
There is that one girl in my class I never imagined going out it. Or maybe just a little but  it wasn’t anything. I looked at her as a friend and that was it until one day (in this March) we went out to have some fun. We aren’t alone tho, there were two more people joining us. And we were basically 2 boys and 2 girls. We went to play billiard (8pool¿) and some other arcade games. We had so much fun, but we still had a ton of time left, that’s why we decided to go and watch a movie in the cinema. The other boy left eventually and I was left alone with the two girls. Anyways. We went to the movie and we watched it, obviously nothing happened. After the other girl left and we were alone. So I decided to escort the girl to her house. I did and then we hugged ( normal as well).
A few days pass and she texts me that we need have that talk. I was confused but she then said “I know you like me, I like you as well”. It came out of nowhere. After a minute i answered with “And now what?” agreeing with the thing she said although I had no feeling to her. She said that we can’t be a thing, cause we are in the same class, school etc. I agreed. 
Weeks pass. We were in one club with her, so we spent a little more time together. We eventually kept going out and one time she was really getting really close to me and idk, decided to hug her out of nowhere.She returned the call and hugged back. Then we sat on a bench and cuddled for maybe half an hour.  We had a competition in that club and after she won it she hugged me, but like with real feeling ( i guess). It seems that she still liked me. And i was starting to like her back too. But strange thing comes. As i said we are in the same class and at school we say almost nothing to each other, we don’t talk, we don’t touch, we do nothing together. The summer comes and she had a few things to deal with for two months. In August i asked her to go out. Nothing really happened then. We only talked. But in the beginning of September there was a concert time of thing near our town and i asked her to join me and to go together. So we went. She didn’t really like the music, so we leaved the concert. We stared to walk and all of the sudden we grab our hands and we hold hand like for 20-30 minutes. Than  she had to leave. We texted and made clear that we like each other. So we go out again and we basically do bf and gf stuff, but we never said that we are in a relationship or that we are bf and gf. The thing is that in the school we act like we almost don’t know each other. We don’t really talk there and we don’t do anything. 

What should i do now?
Do i make a move in the school and show everyone that we are a thing?
Do i leave the things the way they are?
I really don’t know and i’m asking for an advice here. I know i may have wasted your time, but i’m sorry, it’s just bothering me for a decent amount of time and i wanna so something.",24Sep2019,1

433,"First time posting so bare with me. 

I got a call from my older sister telling me that her husband found out that she had been talking to another guy. She knew this guy from before she met her husband but never met him.

When she told me, I couldn’t believe that my sister could do such a thing. My dad, cheated on my mum years ago and they went through the whole divorce process. I know how hard it was on my sister when she was younger. 

My sister told me she had slept with this guy a couple times and that she felt like she could of had something significant with him before she met her husband. 

Long story short, my sister came clean after her husband confronted her but she only told him that things happened but no sex. He’s in turmoil and doesn’t really know how to feel. My brother in law is a really level headed guy, doesn’t make rash decisions but I can’t help but feel so bad for him, he’s an amazing guy and an even better father.

435,"alea iacta est.

I'll start with my original plan. Sorry in advance but I need to get this out of my system, I can't talk to anyone about this. My idea was to study International relations, and then do a master in International Security and Intelligence. That has been my idea for a very long time. I've had this path ready to be followed in front of me for years, since the first years of high school. I'm in the third year now of my bachelor and I'm going to graduate and I'm literally ashamed of the doubts I've been having.

I'm studying in London, and I'm from Greece. I work here and study at the same time. My dad sends me 800$ a month, and with my other 800 a month from my job (retail) this gets me through rent, living expenses and whatnot in one of the most expensive cities in Europe. Also, my dad is paying for my school, 9250$ a year to be exact because he said he would've taken care of it so that I wouldn't have been indebted from student loans. To be clear, my family is not rich, my dad made sacrifices to have that kind of money.

Everything was going according to plan, I was enjoying my degree, my studies and I was constantly keeping up with choosing what was next, what master, what internships. Always in the field of international security and Intelligence.

Then it hit me. One day, out of nothing. I started looking on Wikipedia. The interest grew like weed. What's an MBBS, how does medicine studies works. How is life for a doctor and what they study? This was 4 months ago. Before I knew I was looking at courses on UCAS, seeing what subjects they studied, I started reading about biology, and diseases and how the heart works. I bought books on general medicine, anatomy, biology. I was reading how a cell works, how to treat snake venom poisoning. The difference between emergency medicine and diagnostics. I downloaded apps on my phone about medicine vocabulary and anatomy. I started looking for undergrad courses for an MBBS, what are the requirements, what do you study, how they are planned. I started watching Doctor House and Grey's Anatomy (never been interested in medical dramas). I know it sounds silly, but you have to admit it is crazy how things quickly escalated.

But I haven't told you the most shocking thing yet. One night I had a dream. And inside this dream, I was dreaming. (I know I'm insane.) The dream inside the dream was my normal life here in London, studying International Relations. but the i ""woke up"" and the dream was me, 3 years ago still making a decision on what to study, happy that my 3 years in London were a ""dream"" and ready to choose my Medical School. In the dream, I was relieved that these 3 years in London were just a ""dream'. When I actually woke up, I was a disappointed mess for the whole day.

I can't change my mind. My father invested 30k$ in my education, probably more. I invested 3 years of my life and I'll be 24 soon. There is no time machine. I keep hoping this is just a temporary 'curiosity wave' but it keeps not going away. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I feel I'm acting like a stupid child that wants a new toy.

Sorry in advance.",24Sep2019,1

438,"Hello! I'm here seeking advice and tips. In 6 days i will be homeless. I am a 26 year old male, and due too some unfortunate circumstances i will be forced to live on the streets. As a frequent reddit user i was hoping this community could help me prepare and give advice and tips on my journey. 

I have no friends or family in my area (upstate New York) who will help me or let me live with them. My father told me he would of let me live with him if i had gotten my license and a car like he told me months ago. I was living pay check to paycheck on minimum wage At 55 hours a week, so it never happened.

So my plan is to make my way to Florida where i can link up with my father. And i think i can prove to him I'm worthy of him still taking me under his wing by making my solo journey to him. If trekking 1200 miles dosen't show enough determination than nothing will. 

If this fails, my back up plan is to link up with my older brother who also lives in Florida. My older brother says he will take me in if father does not. 

So here's the situation: As of writing this i have $0 dollars to my name. I have a bank account and no driver's license, only a permit. I have a few things i will put up for sale on craigslist which i can atleast net myself minimum $150-$200. (Trust me they will sell fast) I have an outdoor hiking backpack. I also have a knife, and first aid kit. I have no drug addictions. I know i need to buy a tent, and or tarp. And i need to buy a sleeping bag. So far my plan is to sell what i can and make my way to Walmart to purchase these things. As well as some emergency dried food. I need to know what essential things i should and shouldn't carry, and or buy. I basically need to know everything. 

I wont lie im a bit scared. Im mostly scared because im physically handicapped with mild cerebral paulsey in my left arm and leg. It's kinda noticeable because of the limp in my step. And im afraid people will see that and try to take advantage of me or hurt me for my things. Im afraid i won't be able to defend myself, I'm not a fighter. But i have been in many fights over the years, so I'm not a total push over either. (thanks bullies).

So, I'm a previous Foster Child from 7y/o-21y/o. Currently, I don't know who I am. I'm on a mission to love myself and to try to be a productive member of society, but I'm so lost. 

All my life, I've been in foster care. All I know is what I've been through and experienced.. I feel like I don't know how to move forward. For example, a year ago, I though hot water was pumped from the city, not a water heater. I know, crazy right?

I've been through so much and I don't even know where to start. My ""family"" doesn't talk to me. I haven't had a real conversation with my ""family "" for years. I came out to my oldest sister as bisexuals at 14 y/o, who had custody of me at the time. A week later, she called child protective services to remove me because ""She was afraid I would molest my nephew, because I was Bisexuals, because that's what homosexuals do."". My own ""mother"" who had tried to kill us, told her that ""homosexuals are pedophiles and I should get me removed ASAP. "" 

I went to a CPS shelter and I was constantly getting beat up because I was Bisexual. The staff didn't do anything to protect me and my caseworker said that I have to stay there because no one else can take me. After that, I ran away and lived on the streets with other homeless youth. I was so scared. 

I lived in abandoned houses, slept on trains, buses, the lake front, anywhere I thought I would be safe. No one was there for me. I was 14.

I didn't know where my next meal was, didn't know if I was going to be alive tomorrow. I was all on my own. I called all my brothers and sisters, they didn't answer. When I talked to them, they didn't have anything to say. 

I found someone who was in the ""same situation as me"". But she had an apartment. She had housing assistance. She let me live with her, she fed me, she made sure I was Safe and ok. After a few months, things changed. She told me I had to bring in money to stay. She posted my pictures and ads to Craigslist and Backpage. Selling my body for sex. She told me if I didn't do it, I have to leave. That meant going back to abandon houses, trains and Buses. I didn't want to do that again. So I did it. She posted me on the Internet to have sex with random men to gain money for her. I was so scared but I loved her. She was there for me. I was 15. 

I got a job at what was called the ""$3 store."" It was a second hand store and everything was $3. How did I get that job at 15 and homeless you may ask? The owner and his partner conspired to give me the job as long as I had had a Sexual relationship with the owner. I agreed and did it. All I wanted was to be better and get ahead. I mean, I was already having sex with people for money, so what ever. 

After a while, (we will call her Keisha) she made me do more and more to keep the cash flow coming. She got CPS to give her custody of me. Granted, I could have spoke up and stopped everything, but I didn't. I was scared. After she got custody, she started setting people up. Basically robbing them. She would set up ""dates"", come in during the ""date"" and blackmail them into emptying their bank accounts because they were involved with an underage person. 
I told her I didn't want to do it several times. Every time I expressed how bad I was feeling doing those things, something happened to me. She had pepper sprayed me a few times. Chased me with a knife, cut me a few times, beat me ect. When I got a job, she took my checks. I loved her as a mother.

There is so much more trauma and things I still don't understand till this day. 

How do I move on and continue my life as it is? How do I let go? How do I continue knowing my own mother and family, doesn't want anything to do with me? It's almost like I never existed....  I'm married, have a home, stability, people who love me. It's like I'm waiting for the next person in my life to do me wrong, so I fuck it up first so they can't. I am in my mid twenties and I'm so tired. I don't know what to do to lead a ""normal"" life. I have so much potential, but I'm so caught up on the life I use to live, and I don't know how to move on to be productive. 

I'm so lost, Idk what to do or where to start. I just want to Love myself so I can love my Husband and everyone else in my Life. I need to let go and move on and I do not know how. I'm so tired and worn down. I just want to be happy.

Any advise?",24Sep2019,2

447,"Hi there! I've been working for an insurance agent since she opened the doors to her agency two years ago. I've literally been the only employee out of 8-9 to actually stick around the entire time. Currently, her and I are the only two people who work in the office and she is out at meetings and such pretty regularly, which leaves me to be alone a lot of the time. I guess you could say that this is my first ""big girl job"" and since there's only two of us here, I'm pretty valuable to her. She's also someone I look up to and she's been very good to me. I just feel like my position is a dead end unless I want to become an agent (thanks, but no fucking thanks lol). 

The pay is okay but she unfortunately cannot offer benefits or a 401K plan which has started to bother me. I also feel very isolated and would love a job that has room for growth and co-workers for me to interact with on a daily basis. I've also realized that working in insurance is just not something I want to do for the rest of my life. 

My older sister was able to help score me an interview for an awesome opportunity within a reputable tech company and my interview is on October 15th. I really would love this job! The hiring manager said that if I were to get the position, he would want me to start by the end of October (after giving my current employer 2 weeks notice). 

The problem I'm having is if I were to leave my current job, my boss would literally be screwed and on her own. The odds of her finding and training a reliable replacement in two weeks are not in her favor. Part of me wants to be open with her and tell her now that I'm looking for a new job and best case scenario I would be out by the end of October. But of course, part of me is hesitant to do that based on the fact that there is a possibility I won't get the job. I feel like it's a lose lose situation because in the end, I'm still hurting her. I've been told that this isn't my problem to be worried about because she has to handle this as a business owner, but part of me hurts for her because I've personally seen her struggle with being able to find someone to add to our team. I don't think she'd be the type of person to fire me for telling her that I'm looking for a new job, but I honestly have no idea how she would react.",24Sep2019,1

My family decided that all the adults would do secret Santa this year for each other to save money due to Christmas getting more and more expensive. This means that everyone has a very personal gift for them and that we spend more time together rather than opening gifts from every person at Christmas. We all picked last year so we had a year to plan. 

So, I have my sister in law. I love her to pieces but I don’t get on with her massively well and have no idea what to get her. I was thinking of creating a hamper full of stuff. The budget is £50 so I’m trying to get as much as possible for her without losing quality.

We broke up and i stayed in touch because i was the only person supporting her and she needed someone.. that was a huge mistake as in the last week ive found out she cheated on me with one of my best friends for a year, shes given me chlamydia (ive already got it cleared now), shes guessed my passwords to my social media accounts (messaged every girl on my friend list that i now have an sti THAT SHE GAVE ME).. so she was suicidal one night and i agreed to call her to calm her down..it was late and i fell asleep still in the video call.. i wake up an hour later to her accusing me of having sex with someone within the last hour.. so shes delusionally hallucinated me having sex on the call because i was asleep and since it was video chat i showed her the room with the light on to show her there was nobody else there.. shes broken into my house, ripped my brothers hair out when he tried to push her out of the house at 4am..the police were called and she attacked them..so shes now gone absolutely mental and is messaging everyone i speak to.. one of my friends is struggling with mental illness themselves atm and they're getting abused by my ex just for talking to me so ive had to distance myself from them for their own protection.. 

I have a safety notice against her (like a restraining order but its only for a few days).. honestly this is taking a huge toll on my mental health.. what the fuck do i do? She wont go away..and she cant really be arrested for this.. im literally losing my mind

452,"Hey Everyone,

So quick back story -- my girlfriend lives in CT and I live in NY and we're moving in together within less than a week (down here in NY.) She's got a stalking ex from years ago (4 or 5 maybe,) that has been connected to drugs and burglary and arrested more than once. She told me he's monitored her phone before and was able to tap into it when they were dating to control her. He's tried contacting her through Facebook IM when we first started dating (last year,) and then sort of gave up. Nothing too crazy.

Fast forward to last night, a number in MA has been texting her this week things like ""Hey"" and ""\[HerName\]..?"" and as we we were texting - it calls her (11:59PM) and she lets it go as a missed call - no voicemail. 3 minutes later (12:02AM) a number that's 20 minutes from her town calls me. I let it go to voicemail. She's genuinely worried but me being a typical protective bf I decided to look up the number on Google -- it's him. So very quickly it went like this:

Me: Can I help you?

Ex: who is this

Me: Idk you tell me since you called me in the middle of the night  (showing screenshot of missed call.)

\*No answer\*

My gf thinks he's trying to play stupid and she doesn't want me feeding into it but she's terrified he may do something to her. She was up all night looking out her window. I'm scared for her and I feel like he's seen our conversations, found my new moving address, and is purposely trying to do something since she's leaving the area Monday. I'm resetting and wiping my iPhone 7+ (Verizon.) I read about spyware and whatnot but I feel like it goes deeper than the typical ""6 signs to know you're being monitored"" article. I feel like he sees all the texts and passwords and whatever else we've sent each other. How could he have gotten my number? It's possible he found it off Linkedin or something but I know she would never do anything to put me in danger. I want to get rid of this asshole and set the record straight.

Does anyone have any good advice? I turned off my location services and find my iphone app, made a new 6 digit pin, updated to iOS 13 and reset all factory settings. Anything else I can do for my gf and help on the technological side? Should I have her call her carrier?

I'm shit for luck apparently as it turns out I'm diabetic. I've already gotten diagnosed with chronic depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and now type 1 diabetes in the short 15 years I've been on this planet. I'm heavily medicated and have 2 appointments a week with specialists and then counseling on top of that so I already cost my mom a lot more money than she makes. And now, since I live in the US, being diabetic on top of all of that is going to bankrupt my mom for the second time. I have no clue what I'm to do, and have a flat 0 hope for my future. My sister is going to college and my mom is barely able to handle driving her there every day twice, and then driving an hour to work and back on top of managing all of my appointments. We can't afford another car, my mom is under immense stress and is reaching her breaking point, and I happen to be so worthless that I had to start taking high school online as I can't deal with my shitty brain and drag myself to school every day.

We live in Florida, US and essentially have just enough money to survive, the two of us. We also have an elderly person in our life with no money herself. She was living with us for a time but we are both in poor health and can barely manage ourselves so can't manage her as well. We shopped for assisted living places and found a nice one that assured us she would get help from the VA (her husband was Korea vet) and the government to cover costs. It is a nice place, she is happy and we are much happier without her in our home (that's fine if you think it's awful, it's the truth). That was almost a year ago.

Unfortunately, the VA and government have been dragging their feet on getting the money for her (yes, in hindsight we should have got things approved first, but life happens) and the government just said she makes like $80 (yes, eighty) too much money a month (a few bucks from pension on top of social security) and so don't qualify. The VA just keeps telling our attorney ""maybe next month"" and ""we're not sure yet"". So we have gone through all her limited funds and have to start using ours which we need to live. 

At this point I'm not sure what to do. The government seems to have failed in providing anything useful to help and she didn't prepare either, we feel it is going to fall on to us and... well, that will have serious emotional consequences.

Without a car or a phone number, I am unable to get a job which is vital for me to not only move out but to pay for driving lessons.

460,"In July I had a weird living situation and had to find a place to move very quickly. I moved in with a couple I don’t know. They’re so nice, we get along fine, it’s a great apartment. There are no issues atm. They were supposed to live with a girl who decided last minute she couldn’t abide living with a boy and was a total jerk about it. That girl caused them a ton of stress when trying to find me to sublet.

It was so stressful to this couple finding me and they were already on board living together again next year. I don’t mind taking the time to find a good replacement but how will I broach the subject and give them reassurance that I’ll find someone good? I think it’s going to really stress them out since things just calmed down from their bad-roommate experience.  Honestly, someone else might be better than me as I’m about a decade older and in a very different stage of life.

Extra detail: the money-split is not exactly equitable. I was okay with it in a pinch but it will be hard to find someone else that is okay with it, which is a concern. The couple is also very concerned about someone saying they are okay living with a couple and then reneging (which is what happened with the previous person). The couple is also going through a very stressful time as their families do not want them together; they need someone really chill who keeps to themselves, doesn’t judge, and can listen if needed (though the latter is not necessary, per se).",24Sep2019,1

When we do text, it is always me who initiate the conversation first, usually to ask him questions about life and homework help. Only once, he would text me first to tell me about a show he recommends.

We share many interests though, such as the shows, music and games we like.

The roommate refuses to talk to us no matter what we say, and doesn’t listen to the house rules, either. Aside from that, i’m more concerned about his behavior at night. I came back into the apartment one night to see that he had crawled under my bed and turned on a light that i had placed under there.

We had no idea where he was in the apartment, and after looking in every room we saw that the bathroom light was also on. When we looked in the bathroom, it appeared that no one was in there, since the door was wide open - however we then realized that our roommate WAS in the apartment, he was standing pressed up against the wall behind the bathroom door staring at us through the crack in the hinges. We should have said something to him, but we pretended he wasn’t there. There have been multiple cases where he has tried to silently open my friends’ bedroom door unnoticed, and then proceeds to walk back and forth past the door to get a small glimpse into the room.

I'm married a year and a half now to the love of my life, and we decided that we didn't want to buy a house in the city we both grew up in. The housing market is terrible, we're tired of the cold weather, and the number of jobs in my field isn't the best (I’m a software developer).

I have a good job here that I like but I feel like I pretty much hit the ceiling of what I'll be able to achieve, and I always felt like I'd need to make a big move to really be successful in what I do.

I've been applying for jobs and finally landed one with a company in the south that is on the Fortune 100 Best places to work, getting a 20% pay increase from what I’m doing now and going to a city that has a very similar cost of living to where I am now. Plus, there is a ton of growth potential in my new company, and I'm just so excited to be able to make a great living in an area that my wife and I have dreamed about living in for a while.

The problem is that 90% of our family and friends are in the area where we are moving away from. I'm already thinking about how often I'll be able to come back and see people. The first thing that I respond with, when someone asks if I'm excited about our move, is that ""I'm terrified.""

I feel like part of me is partially hanging onto the past, since a lot of my best friends from college, the ones that I would go to lunch with every day, have dinner with twice a week on Thursdays or Mondays during football season, all have kids and I see them maybe once every two months or so now. 

But, I said bye to most of them last night and it hurt. I have to say bye to my and my wife's immediate family later in the week and I can't imagine that will feel any better. 

Am I being hard on myself, going through the tough ""goodbye"" portion now? Will things get easier and be better when we're able to come back home for a few days, a few times each year and see people? 

I feel like I'm making a mistake, but I also feel like I can't stay stuck where I am for the rest of my life, and right now without kids yet is a good time to test the water. 

Someone please help. Tell me it'll be fine and this is a normal thing people do. I have my wife and I couldn't do it without her, and she supports and wants to do this too, so I feel like we could be fine, but things feel so hard right now that I need to make sure I'm doing the right thing.

We searched her car and found marijuana, and after handing her laptop over to the support department, we found that she was trying to sell to coworkers.  Police have been notified and they are already handling it.  

My question to reddit, were we in the wrong for questioning the tattoo?  In our case, it worked out because it turned out this person was actually up to no good.  Are there any other red flags that we should be concerned with when hiring new coworkers? Things like dyed hair, buzzed sides of head, etc",24Sep2019,0
476,"I was with one guy.. we’ll call him John, for quite a while. We touched on the same sense of humor, and where always undeniably ourselves every time we were in the same room together. We had a very strong connection that i hadn’t felt with anyone before. Although, John sold weed, shrooms and acid for a living. He didn’t really aspire to do anything other that go to festivals and party with his friends. Which is honestly fine, do whatever you want in your life. But as far as our relationship went, that made us cross a few speed bumps. Sometimes i would’ve wanted him stay home with me... i wanted him to get off his phone with all the clients and that was that downfall of our relationship. 

Now i’m with Tom. Tom is great. He’s the media guy for a very good and well off tattoo artist. He has huge dreams and never stops working to achieve them. One thing i love in a person over everything else is good conversation. Which we have A LOT of. He’s very smart. He pushes me to do better and has his shit together. We play video games together and have the same interests as far as movies and games go. Although... we don’t really click on the soul connection department. And if i’m being quite honest, sometimes he bugs the crap out of me. Just little things like... “forgetting” his wallet often when we go out to eat or to the grocery. Or playing music constantly, i love music as much as the next gal, but it’s like he rushes to get to he aux cord before me every single time we’re in MY car, continues to play the music from his phone when we get out of the car, and continues to play the same music as i am watching tv. Stuff like that that just drives me bonkers.

So like I don’t know. I’m in a battle where i’m like do i stick this relationship out with Tom because he is very good for me? We get along like 75% of the time. But i can’t shake the feeling that i’m never gonna have the same connection that i felt with John. And thus never truly happy.",24Sep2019,0

480,"TLDR: Boss tells me I have a new position in 4 weeks time.
Then he realised that I haven’t had the interview that he thought I already had (and passed).
Boss continues to tell colleagues/superiors that I have the job. I feel uncomfortable with this, until I know for sure that I’m moving on. Not sure how to proceed.
Prospective new manager calls me to ask my understanding of the situation, and his view on it is entirely different.

~*~

I’ve worked for the same company for around 4.5 years now, and in that time have made steps to progress my career with them. In March I was accepted onto one of their leadership cohorts, where once completed I would be able to apply and take any advertised vacancy at that role: A hefty promotion compared to my current role.

Even in my current role, it’s not unknown within my place of work that I often go above my job role anyways, which helped me to get onto this cohort and practise and show off skills for my next role. Simple stuff. It’s been hard work, but I know why I’m doing it.

Fast forward to now: Cohort is finished and I have been able to apply for vacancies if I am interested, and have done for 3 months. I check most days for new vacancies however haven’t seen anything suitable, so I’ve been hiding my time and carrying on as per normal. Completing the course work, practising the skills I’m learning etc.

2 months ago I sent two emails out to “important people” venturing about a possible vacancy in a new place, which is currently being built and will open in November. It’s close by where I live, an exciting and new prospect as it’s brand new and generally something I wanted to get involved in, so I put my foot in the door.

I never had a response. No biggie, it happens, maybe I just wasn’t right for it. Life goes on.

Last Tuesday, however, one of the “important people” congratulate me on landing my new role at the place I asked about. I said there must have been a mistake, I haven’t been told anything by my employer at all. She verified that it is the case, and apologised as she didn’t know that I was unaware. 
I said that it’s okay, stuff like that happens in a big company and mistakes are made. Again, no big deal.

Come Friday, I’ve still had no one approach me about it. My employer was busy for those days so I can understand, but I was a little miffed it didn’t seem so important. But I digress. Friday afternoon I get a phone notification telling me that I’ve been added into a “group” on the company’s social media. This group is titled the name of the new place which is being built, and I am 1 out of 5 members, the rest of which are going to be managing it. Again, I just think to myself that if they’re hiding it then they’re doing a poor job, but what can I do?

I wait.

Monday comes around. I am finally asked to see my employer. We talk, he shakes my hand, congratulated me. Tells me that I got the job and I leave in 4 weeks. Quick, but that’s how the turnarounds work so I’m not overly surprised. I’m excited and he makes an announcement with my team and everyone is happy.

I approach him a bit later and ask him about an interview process for this: I never had one.

He looks concerned and tells me that he assumed I already had an interview and passed. Well, fuck.

So now we’re both embarrassed, I have no idea if I’m getting this job and I’m waiting for an interview date. He has already announced it to most of my team and word is spreading around quickly. People are congratulating me in the hallways and they don’t even work with me.

This morning I came in to him waving at me and smiling and saying to other coworkers, “Hey OP have you told them all the good news?”

I said no, as I’m waiting for my interview process to finish. He tells me that I’m just overthinking it and I’ll go in and ace it: I said no. He had shaken my hand and told me my last day at this place, and although I realise that some people are aware, I still want to keep it as hushed as it can be until I actually *know* this time.

He tells me that I need to stop with that attitude and be happy, and as far as I know he is continuing to tell others about my “promotion”.

My “new” employer called me this morning to ask about my understanding. I told him that I was told I would be leaving in 4 weeks, but also that I know I haven’t had an interview so I’m unsure about how to proceed.

He tells me that he hopes that I am successful and would look forward to working with me, however “this vacancy is still very desired and if you are unsuccessful with me then I’m sure you can be accommodated elsewhere.”

I don’t want elsewhere right now, hence why I have kept my applications limited in my own time frame.

I’m trying to save face and I’ve had people agreeing with me that my current boss is out of line, and also some agreeing with him. I’m lost and a bit annoyed at how it was all dealt with, honestly.

Any advice? :(",24Sep2019,1
481,"( Sorry if my wording is wrong. It’s 4 in the morning &amp; I am extremely tired so I hope this all makes sense )
Hey! So I’m a female, &amp; i have dated a couple of males in the past. For some reason, every relationship I get into, it’s never well. I don’t know if it’s me? I’ve been in abusive relationships both mentally &amp; physically. I wouldn’t like to go too much in detail about a few other things as they are quite personal. I have been bisexual for a few years now, but recently I have been questioning if I’m bi or lesbian. Anyways, that’s not the point. I’ve been talking to this girl recently, she’s bisexual &amp; we started off as friends until I decided to share my feelings with her. We have only been together for a few weeks &amp; haven’t even seen eachother in the time while we were dating. She lives quite far away from me, which makes it difficult. I am asking for advice, because I just keep overthinking. It’s early in the relationship, as I said, but I just cant help but overthink the whole situation. She reminds me everyday that she’s here for me, she compliments me everyday and she’s amazing to me everyday. Besides all this, I still can’t help but overthink and ask myself if she’s being genuine or if she’s just saying it. She texts me first, we call eachother for hours, she shows me off to her friends, she makes sure im happy everyday. It almost feels too good to be true, and that’s probably why I am over thinking the whole situation. When we text, it feels like we aren’t really talking, just repeating the same conversations we have everyday. Whereas, when we call, we can talk about anything and everything. I’m not the type to ‘talk about these things with her’ and I also feel like it’s way too early to even be mentioning these things. I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to just enjoy the relationship, and not spend most of the time overthinking. I know she has commitment issues &amp; can get bored easily but at the same time, no ones really put a lot of effort into her. I’d like to say i give her my 110% effort and support. But yeah, if anyone has advice on not overthinking every small detail that’d be great. (:",24Sep2019,1

I have let her use my car many times for work and other things this has never happened. Do I call the police or wait it out. And if I do have to call the police do I report her missing and my car missing I don’t think you can report a car missing. She didn’t steal it I let her use it so it’s not stolen.

483,"Ok so let me start by saying I have a lot of anxiety and this intense fear has both times been triggered by watching cold case files/criminal minds.

Anyway, I'm a girl and I work with this guy, he's kinda new to our workplace and from early on I could tell something was off about him but I couldn't place my finger on it. 

He used to be in prison, said it was for gang shit/drugs but doesn't go too much into detail. Now he works 3 jobs to stay busy. 

As for his general behavior... he so fake it’s ridiculous.. he’s way too friendly with everyone and has been acting like we’re great friends from day one, like he does with everyone. 

From the start he kept trying to ask me to hang out and drink with him. He said at least a couple times whenever we’re together, he can just tell that everyone is looking at us, in awe, thinking we’re dating, and that he has “great peripheral vision."" For example, last week a couple of people noticed that we were wearing the same colors, and he made a huge deal out of it saying everyone thinks we’re a thing. He flatters me a lot and tries to make me think we're comfortable with each other. So I get a predatory vibe from him overall. A coworker gets a creepy vibe from him, too.

One time he told me he wants to get a tattoo of the grim reaper all over his back, because he has a fascination with death. Another time he took out a pocketknife and had to cut something and he said that’s his favorite part of the day, and that he loves knives and guns. 

He's really paranoid, I think. One day he was looking up at the work cameras and counting them, he knows where all of them are I think. He occasionally points out people who are looking at him either in some form of admiration or in a bad way. Last night I heard him mutter something under his breath about one of the guys we work with that he was just talking to, it sounded angry, all I heard was “...your black ass.” I said “what?” He said “nothing... it must be the schizophrenia.” Then he started talking about how he’s been trying to stay busy to deal with his anger and crazy thoughts he's had.

##### I’m not sure if I’m just psyching myself out or what but I feel like I might be working with a murderer or something. I have this horrible gut feeling he's going to do something, but my gut is really out of whack lately because of my anxiety. My problem is that I do not want to jump to conclusions and tell anyone and get him fired or whatever, because he hasn't made any threats. Even if he is planning on shooting up work and gets fired, it’ll just make him want to do it even more. But at the same time if he does end up doing anything and I could've prevented it, I will feel awful. Or I won't because I'll be dead.

You’re nice but I don’t want you to feel obligated to especially cause I used to get upset about that”

My dad died when I was 15, and I cut contact with the mother. Currently I have no one else besides my boyfriend, we rent a house together. When I say I have no one else, I truly mean it. In my phone contact lists theres 4 numbers; my boyfriend, his mom, his sister, and my doctor.

492,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. When i was a child my mother formed schizophrenia and as a result she used to violently beat me, my older brother and my little brother because of the voices in her head. My dad was living his own life (they were separated). After they separated my mother took hardcore drugs and her boyfriend used to beat me and my older brother up as well as punching my mother all around. Anyway, cut long story short, my mother lost custody of all 3 of us, she was sectioned under the mental health act, my little brother got put up for adoption (i haven't seen him since, my older brother got put into foster care, and i ended up with my dad.

Throughout my whole life, my dad always lied to me and my older brother, and even til this day, he will lie about the smallest things. For example, if he was watching a tv show, and if i were to ask him the next day what he was watching, he would lie about that. Something so pointless and trivial that doesn't need a lie but he still does it. Anyway, my dad formed arthritis, and because of the pain, he takes codeine and sleeping tablets. Around 3 years ago he become addicted, to the point where he goes to this dodgy pharmacist and uses all of our money to buy them. When he takes them, he takes around 15 codeine tablets a day and around 14 sleeping pills a day to the point where he sits on the sofa and passes out.

My dad keeps promising me he will stop taking as many as he does, but he always never keeps that promise. I am reliant on him to help me with my needs (going to the shop and so on). I confronted him today after he said last night he wouldn't go crazy with tablets, but this morning he was paid and used pretty much all of it on tablets again.

What possible solution would you come up with?

After it was over, I cut contact and burnt the bridges as hard as I could. I haven’t checked his social media or anything like that since and in my mind, he doesn’t exist anymore. Any time my friends and I refer to him or tell a story about him, we use a codename.

501,"So I'm a senior in highschool, and have recently decided I don't think college is for me. Thankfully my family is perfectly fine with that (Dad was first person to a really say he doesn't think it's for me. He didn't say it in a rude way, but looking out for me). However this obviously leads to trying to figure out what I am doing once I graduate Highschool.

I have been talking to a national Guard recruiter, and at first this seemed like a really great idea! However, he's canceled our last 2 appointments, and I also found out I wouldn't be eligible for a signing bonus, which while I know isn't everything, it would've been nice. The job I wanted in the national guard as well may be taken before I can apply for it.

Another thing I was thinking about doing is the Electrician Union. Electricians make good amount of money, there's jobs almost everywhere, however there is the long apprenticeship program, but I'm not really concerned about that, more concerned about having a car to actually do the program. (I do have my license)

Now, I am only 17, but have been with my girlfriend for 3 years now, and there's a good chance I marry her as well. I know it's just highschool, but when you know, you know. With doing the National guard, I'd be gone for about 1/3 of the first year for training, with very limited contact with her, which I wouldn't be looking forward to. I guess I'm just not really sure what to do.

503,"To preface this post, 
I have a severe allergy to tobacco and tobacco smoke. I know there are a lot of posts about fake allergies, this is not a fake allergy. If I’m downwind of someone smoking, my airways will start to close and I could have an asthma attack.

I was recently at a Halloween event at a big amusement park (I’m 99% sure smoking isn’t allowed, especially in line) it was me and two friends in line and one of my friends, let’s call him ‘Nate’ noticed a man about 5 people ahead of us lighting a cigarette. Nate politely stepped out of line, to walk up to this man to explain to him that if he keeps smoking his cigarette, I won’t be able to breathe. 
The man took no interest in hearing what Nate had to say, responded with “I’ve never herd of a tobacco allergy, she should leave if she claims she can’t breathe.” 

At this point, I had removed myself from the line and was sitting on a step about 10 yards away to avoid the smoke hitting me. Setting the scene-there were 3 of us, one of my friends was still in line for the haunted house, Nate was talking to the smoker, and I was sitting on a step. 

The man ended up FINISHING his cigarette while I sat on the step, I waited for the smoke to clear for a few minutes and than I stood up and began to walk back towards to line to rejoin my friends, who had been holding our spot in a 75 minute line. As I approach the line the smoker starts shouting that I’m “trying to sneak into the line” and calling me a “cutter” 
A minute later, this man LOOKS ME ROGHT IN THE EYE AS HE PULLS OUT ANOTHER CIGARETTE

So before he got the chance to light it, and further disrupt my ability to get oxygen to my brain, I step out of line, walk up to him, take the cigarette out of his mouth, drop it, and step on it. I didn’t say a word as I got back in line but he was so angry that he got on his phone and called the amusement park to get in touch with their security (INSTEAD OF WALKING TO A SECURITY GUARD HE GOOGLED THE PHONE NUMBER OF THE SECURITY IDK) 

When security arrived they asked me and my friends to leave the line. We were not removed from the park, we were basically just asked to go to a different area and not bother this guy anymore. 

Am I the asshole?

504,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this or not. If not, i would really appreciate other suggestions. 

So I am a father and my daughter just started med school in a different country. It's her second year. About two weeks ago, while on call, she told me something that made me very concerned. She told me that there were some resident doctors in the hospital, in her clinical posting, who approach junior students for sexual favors or romantic relationships and that she felt scared going to her postings, in case one of these doctors asked her out and she had to say no. She was worried that they might make things difficult for her. I tried to calm her down and told her to bring this to the authorities in case someone harasses her. In the following weeks she continued to miss her postings. It is her first time away from home and she has been very sheltered till now. Noticing this I decided to take action. 

I wrote an email to the college, explaining the entire situation and named the specific resident that she told me about and demanded that they take action. A week later, she called me, sobbing on the phone and told me that the resident has been suspended and the girl he was seeing (who was in her final year) is dropping out because the department might fail her in the finals. Then she proceeded to tell me that the entire harassment story that she told me was a lie and that she was just jealous of their relationship.  

I am very ashamed of her and myself for not investigating the matter further, but I don't want two innocent kids to loose their carrier because of this. I have thought of contacting the college again but don't know where to begin. I know allegations like these are very harmful especially for a doctor's carrier. How should I go about this?  is there anyway that I can help these kids and make the college revert back their decision?",24Sep2019,10

508,"*I'll try to keep it short,*

Its the first year in high school, a new school, a new class, a new experience.

it wasn't my first choice though, In my senior year at middle school for some reason which I won't be explaining here, I got through some intense bullying and humiliation by the ""popular kids group"" in class, a group which I was a part of the time prior to the bullying. those rough times were so bad that they made me take sessions with Psychologies and take anti-depression pills on a daily basis.

It was a hard time and there weren't many people I could trust that time, thankfully I had a small group of people which would support me and the other way around.

^(\^ (That was the reason why I chose a high school where almost no one will know me and about my bullied past) \^)

One of the people which supported me during my rough times went to the same school as I did to the purpose of this post we'll call him Max, he also wanted that sweet fresh start, we ended up in the same class.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start in the first week, everything was perfect, the classmates were nothing but amazing, caring and anything you could think about nice people. Everything went just like I wanted

It's the third week, and we got a group (3 people ) assignment due to next month, naturally, I spoke to Max about asking another classmate if he'd like to join us, which to be honest I forgot about.

A couple of days later, I remembered about the thing I forgot about last paragraph, so I asked someone I got to know better than the other classmates, let's call him Seth.

he told me he is doing the assignment with Gavin ^((yes, another fictional name)), He was also a guy who is nice, so I told him immediately that I'm with them.

Problem is, Max was in the conversation while all \^ that \^ happened and I suspect he saw it as a dick move, which wasn't on purpose at all.

That same evening Max calls me on video chat and when I answer I see Seth with him, It's almost like he wanted to signal me ""hey look who's the better friend now? I invited him, you didn't""

of course, that made me feel left out and a little sad to be honest with you.

A day later, He switches places (We always sat together in class) in class (of course next to Seth and Gavin) without even asking if it's fine that I will be left out, alone. personally I saw that extremely disrespectful. and began thinking about his plan.

Yesterday and today were even worse, I wanna get to know everyone in the class, including Seth but every opportunity I have to get to know him more is taken by Max.

It's that bad that I barely spoke to him without Max just standing there trying to make me go away by talking about the things they have in common. It's okay if it happens from time to time but it happens **ALL THE TIME**.

that's the moment when I tried googling it and found out that his actions are called ""Friend Thievery"" 

It makes me sad and people are starting to ask me why I'm at this bad mood or if everything's okay, which is clearly not. 

I start not to bear this situation and I don't know what to do about it:

* *Do I confront Max the most straightforward way asking him why he is deliberately trying to steal my friends?*
* *Do I ask Seth what should I do?*
* *Do I cut ties with Max?*
* *Do I take both Max and Seth and explain how I feel?* 

**I wish I knew the answer to those questions, otherwise, I wouldn't be asking for advice, so please if you have read all this high-school b.s I sincerely ask you to share with your thoughts, it'll mean the world to me.**

My GF is an amazing person who is kind and devoted to the people in her life.

Her friend and work partner fell on to some rough times ( mostly due to bad decisions and poor impulse control to put it nicely) including breaking her phone and because she is owing her phone company a lot of money she can't afford to get a new phone before the balance is paid.

Insert my GF who See's this and wants to help, so we go and get a new phone under contract, set it up and give the phone to her.

Fast forward to now, it's been a bit and my gf is over her friends BS  and wants to remove her from the plan and idk maybe get the phone back. Mainly concerned about having to pay for her phones cost. Any advice or ideas would be great.

514,"Hello there, first time writing on here and am just looking for a little direction. 

I am 36 and have been in the restaurant industry my whole life and have done pretty much every job there is. I am currently an assistant manager and have been doing this for 2  1/2 years now. I work in a restaurant that is family corporate, 11 stores across the NW but still owned my one guy. I love my management team and most of my crew and we are very close. I work around 60 or more hours a week and have the same work load as the GM just get paid less

I have recently stated to realize how unhappy I am with working there and life in general. I am on salary and typically have Wednesday and Thursday’s off which always causes complications with a social life and even dating. Most people who don’t work in restaurants have Weekends off that I can only get using PTO that need to be approved 20 days prior. This has brought about depression and anxiety which I cannot take due to the nasty reverse side effects. 

I understand working as a manager requires me to be there, but working 10am to 9pm becomes exhausting, especially with only two FOH managers, And with the negativity of staff, being walked on by staff, guests complaints, constant changes with menus and procedures and growing sales...and so on just makes me not excited to go into work.

I have already talked to my other GM and she knows I am unhappy and wants me to do what’s best for me.

I am at a point where i need a job where i can at least be a little bit happy and have life. I am not sure of what job at my point I could get into. Been seriously thinking of serving in a more fine dinner atmosphere but hesitant due to it being all the same again.

I kind of ranted there but I appreciate any advice!

515,"My sister is 19. It's almost as if there are two people living inside of her, and it's been this way since birth. When she was born the umbilical cord cut off the oxygen supply to her brain and my mother is convinced this is part of the issue. 

Basically, most days she is very laid back and kind to everyone. She'll do the shopping, wash up, and even leaves little treats like chocolate or sweets on my bed when i'm at college for me to come back to. Her fulltime priority are her two hamsters and her two ferrets whom she adores- she spoils them rotten and is the most caring and dedicated pet owner I have ever seen. On these days she is very perceptive and will sit down and talk with me about any issues and will intelligently offer a solution. If she sees my light on at night she'll come in and not leave until she knows whats keeping me up. She'll help me with coursework, money issues, sticks up for me against bullies, and can acknowledge and analyse why someone is being weird or acting a little crazy. She is usually perceptive, kind, intelligent and selfless.

Then there are the days/moments when its as if her entire personality flips. One moment she's laughing with you and the next she's swearing and screaming, about the slightest thing... and then she gets violent and will attack. She's strangled me before, chased me with a knife, pinned me down on the floor for long periods of time, thrown a knife full-force at my head, ripped chunks of hair out, punched me, locked me outside overnight, and once I caught her microwaving a live fly. I simply cannot believe this is the same person. The language she uses and her mannerisms completely change. When shes being her normal, kindhearted self I almost forget about the otherside. I cant overstate how sudden the switch to pure insane is, it can happen in literally a few seconds. What could be the issue? she appears totally normal and very intelligent otherwise and has never been diagnosed with anything, and her teachers have never suspected anything. Some advice on what her issue is could really help deal with it and understand better.",24Sep2019,1
516,"My dad has a serious gambling addiction. He’s been like this for the past 20 years. Lately he gambled away the money saved up for college tuition too. 

Simply keeping money away from him was not enough. Anyone who he owed money to would just come to us, and they’d ask us to pay for his debt. 

I think maybe it’s because he can’t find anymore excitement in his life and gambling is his sole escape and pleasure. I want to bring him to see a therapist but he said that he wants to die with dignity. This toxic masculinity is honestly very hard to overcome as he is the only male in the family. I think a man to man conversation would at least open up some conversation, but being the daughter I am I cannot connect with him. 

I also live in a very close-knit conservative Asian community. My father taking therapy would probably become the talk of the town. It’s really uncommon to even mention taking care of mental health as it is seen as being weak or dumb. 

I don’t really know what to do. Honestly, I’m afraid of my father. I feel like he would sacrifice anything to gamble again, maybe even me one day. I don’t want to keep tolerating and forgiving someone who might potentially harm me. I’m very disheartened at what he did and there’s so much pressure on the family, especially on my mom since she is the breadwinner of the house. Lately, I’ve just been avoiding and ignoring him because of how tired I am of this. 

Despite how I act, I still have a little hope. My father doesn’t drink and is very benevolent. He is also very educated and sophisticated, I think it is because of this that it’s even more of a challenge as I can’t just sway him with how I feel. I have to get to both his mind and his heart. I don’t know if I can do this honestly. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to suggest therapy to a parent? Or how you would like to be approached if you were my dad?",24Sep2019,2

I am also living with my girlfriend and mentioned a while back that my friends and I are planning a trip and if she would like to join. She said she would like to. However, when my friends were booking the flight (it was months back because we had to wait for good deals from low cost carriers since we're not well off) a bunch of us joined and I felt that there were too many and wouldn't fit in my friend's place. I decided not to include my gf in the trip because of 2 things: there were already too many of us and we will have to book additional accommodation if we both go (expensive); second is that we are just making ends meet since we are both supporting our families. I only had enough for myself and I know that she wouldn't be able to afford her own expenses because of something her family is going through at that time. The decision had to be made quickly because it was a promotion so the flights were booked with just my high school friends and I.

520,"I want to start off this post by saying that I personally do not mind doing favors for people. It’s in my nature to be giving, but lately I feel unappreciated and taken advantage of. 

When I got my first car, I was happy I didn’t have to take public transportation and always wanted to make plans easier for my friends, so I’d always be designated driver. 

With my first lease, I intended on financing it once the lease was over, but towards the last few months of my lease, the car parts started breaking down (air conditioner, rear breaks, etc.). I figured it was more expensive to commit to financing, and in order to save myself the stress of replacing more parts in the long term, I decided to lease another car. I went over 16,000 miles and owed over $4000 dollars to the dealership. On top of that I had to pay for exterior damages that were observed during the inspection.

Lately, I don’t feel like giving anyone a ride, particularly because some of them drive and never offer to do the same. They also know that I’m not in best financial situation and rarely offer to give me gas money.

The other day my friend texted me, and I thought she genuinely wanted to catch up after a few weeks of not talking, but it turns out she needed me to give her mom a ride to the same event we were going to, so it could save her dad the trip of having to drive her.  It makes me question if I got invited to event for their convenience.

It always something new. Such as her pain in her head, suicidal thoughts, the nurses are mean and don’t listen, and even the threat that comes out her mouth that she will hate me forever when she leaves the hospital. I know she‘a not herself right now because she suffered from a traumatic brain injury, but it hurts so much going in everyday and seeing her like this. Yesterday was my breaking point, it was at the point where I was grabbing my mother’s hands to stop her from ripping out her picc line which I failed miserably because a nurse had to escort me out. Today I lay in my bed taking a day off. I know the hospital nurses aren’t the best but I’m sure they will take care of her. One day away from her won’t kill me or her? I just feel guilty, angry, sad and almost every emotion possible. I don’t really have friends to help me through this difficult time. My siblings aren’t very supportive either.

530,"\[Preface\] I work as a Night Auditor at a hotel. Whenever a guest reports one of those pesky little creepy crawly critters, we call them an ""uninvited."" That being said, let's get to the story:  


We have a new person we're training for my shift (which is awesome because we have several hundred rooms in total and we need more people working the desk!) We obviously get our fair share of reports, but I will be the first to say that we have a fantastic staff and pest specialist on site which result in the reports 9.9 times out of 10 being false. However, recently at the front desk, we have had 2 confirmed reports - BEHIND THE DESK.  


The first report was a few weeks ago, shortly after this person started training on my shift. They were there for a couple of days, and on one of their off days, my co-worker found the first one crawling along the desk. I easily confirmed it, but we preserved it in a clear plastic cup for the pest specialist (who also confirmed it.) Fast forward 2 weeks due to issues and they came back to work. Yet, alongside them, three days after they are back on, we have our second uninvited behind the desk.   


Now I am not one to make an accusation with something like this, but there's three problems in this situation:

1. The entire hotel was just recently inspected (and that includes with bug-sniffing dog)
2. We have never had this issue at the FD before until this co-worker started working here
3. This co-worker has a bit of a hygiene problem (smells) 

We don't really know much about this co-worker other than they live with a family member, and their going to school for ""animal care"" (trying not to make this too descriptive in the event that they somehow find this posting.) They are always 95% covered up though (including jackets when it's been 80-90 degrees recently,) and we are not able to see any of their skin to ""check"" them (unofficially, and of course inconspicuously.)  I have reported this to my management, and our pest specialist has confirmed it both times, but as he said today: Unless we can 100% verify they are coming off of this person, we are limited on what we can do (no matter how ""evident"" it seems the case would be.) Unfortunately, we don't.

  
I sent management an e-mail today that basically said this:  


I worked at McDonald's when I was in my late teens, and we had a manager who had a bad case of uninviteds. They were discovered on her person when they were at work, and yet they continued to let them work. Unfortunately I didn't know about this until I was working the night shift position that day after my stuff had already been back in the break area, and I ended up with them for about a 2-month period (while also spreading them to my mom's house.) That event caused some serious mental trauma, and unfortunately if we cannot resolve this issue, I will be forced to resign as I cannot handle that trauma again.  


I don't honestly know what to do, or if this is even the right place to post this. I am still very shaken about the situation because it feels like ""it's happening again,"" even though we've only had two of them so far. Yet ""one is all it takes,"" you know? I don't know how to process the situation. I don't know how to come into work and not mentally freak out/panic, especially when I work with this co-worker again. I don't know how management will handle the situation, but I don't want to be looked at as a nark either, and then get penalized for reporting this. I am just flustered, frustrated, and feeling hopeless because I don't know how to process any of this. I don't want to quit my job, I love it! I love my position, what I do, and who I get to work under/with. I don't want to ""throw it all away"" over this, but I just simply don't know anything right now regarding the situation. I don't want to make this a bigger ordeal than it really is, but I don't want to put my own health and well being in jeopardy either. Please, what advice can you offer? What suggestions can you send my way? I just don't know what to do right now...",24Sep2019,1

Same with romantic relationships. I date someone and enjoy time with them, but when things get serious I feel constricted and usually leave the relationship. I don’t have trouble finding romance either. 

Do I just have typical “commitment issues”? Or is there something more that I’m overlooking?

Growing up, I was moving quite a bit and our family had lived in a few foreign countries all while traveling to new and interesting places for vacations. My jobs were also usually freelance / contract work that has me traveling all over and constantly moving.  Perhaps this has something to do with my current mentality? I also live in a seasonally warm / very cold climate and usually get quite depressed when the winter comes around. 

I’d like to get comfortable somewhere, but nowhere feels like home and as soon as I think I get comfortable, again, I want to flee.

547," 

My friend's been dating this new guy, we'll call him Ed, for going on a couple years now. He's nice, but most of us agree: he's a bit of an overbearing loudmouth; whatever topic you bring up in conversation, he immediately wants to barrel in with proof that he knows the most about it. He means well, but I've definitely ended up in conversations where he'll be mansplaining a topic I'm very well versed in.

Earlier this year, I mentioned my desire to get a DnD campaign for our friend group going. I've never DM'd, but think it would be fun, and thought starting a group would be a good excuse to cut my teeth on DM'ing. Ed was super excited. When I saw him a few weeks later, he proposed that \*he\* start the group, run us through a few sessions, then pass it off to me. I wasn't thrilled by this idea, but figured I was being a control freak, and because I was super busy at the time, I said sure, thinking maybe it \*would\* help jump-start everyone else's interest in a game.

A couple months ago, we had our first session. Ed had us build the characters from scratch, which I wouldn't necessarily have had a bunch of neophytes do, since it can be such a barrier to entry for people just getting to know the game (he even admitted that it's like doing your taxes without software). During that time, my friends had a few ideas for our characters' backstory and how we knew one another, all of which Ed shot down as they didn't fit in with the circumstances of the module he wanted to put us through.

Furthermore, Ed invited a random friend into the party, which isn't the worst idea, but the existing group is pretty introverted, as was the newbie, and I'd argue four hours at a DnD table is a really poor way to get to know a complete stranger. So he felt like a third wheel. 

One of my friends was so turned off by the experience that he said DnD wasn't for him. So Ed grabbed another friend and sat him down to create  a character on their own. From what I hear, he also pushed that friend into creating a character that tactically complemented our group, not necessarily a character which resonated with him.

This kinda drills into the difference in what Ed wants from DnD vs what I think our friend group wants; Ed plays a \*lot\* of esoteric, technical tabletop games, enough so that the fun he gets is from the strategy of things, the stats, and figuring out how to succeed within a game's system. Conversely, I think my friends would have more fun with the role playing, exploration, and storytelling aspects of DnD. I think a bunch of skilled gamers playing an extensive DnD campaign with ever-increasing stakes should make sure to have a healer, but a few casual friends farting around over pizza every month or so should just play the characters they'd have fun playing.  
I'm very frustrated because at this point, I don't know if I even want to try getting my own game together, and even if I did, the rest of our friend group may have soured on the notion. And if they are still in, I'm nervous about how to navigate around Ed in this. He's been texting and emailing us, trying to get another session together. Two sessions have fallen through and nobody's really responding to him with much enthusiasm, but he keeps pressing us to pick a weeknight we have four/five hours to give over. I'm really irritated that he took over my idea for a game, ruined everyone else's experience, and doesn't get the hint that people aren't champing at the bit for a second session. 

It would be hard to just start another game behind his back (and to be honest, he'd be great as part of the party). I'm not sure if I should just help get his next session going and use that as a chance to ask him to hand over the keys, level with him and say I don't think he's running a game we want to play, or just let the whole thing sputter out on its own and just not bother with my own game.",24Sep2019,1

549,"I have a friend who I admire more than anything. Some of my best memories in my life were created with him, he helped me care about my education and pushed me to be the person I am now. But since last year it just hasn't been the same. I've started dating a girl and they had severe animosity towards eachother, he said he didn't care she was being abused and in response she said some very negative things about him. Other things that contributed towards this was me leaving a festival a day early as all our stuff was soaking and our tests were unusable. But a few months ago it really declined, he cancelled on me one night to go and get drunk with someone he barely knew. He did MDMA which really hurt my trust in him as some of our friends lives have been ruined over the drug. I began spending more time with my girlfriend which obviously impacted things and eventually I just wasn't invited out anywhere with our larger group. I asked him why and he said I'd be a 'tag along' and he didn't know my place'. I was also diagnosed with epilepsy, while I don't want attention or beg for anyone to care he just genuinely didn't bother with me after that. Aside from inviting me to a football game he never offered to come up and see how I was.

554,"Quick side bar before we begin: Since my age will come up at the end as part of my reason for asking advice, I just want to get this out of the way real quick. I'm 25, living with my father because life went sideways shortly after I graduated college. It was something completely out of my control. He was gracious enough to allow me to stay with him for a bit. He's a truck driver and is only home on the weekend, so I'm effectively living alone. That will be relevant later. Alright, onto the situation.

The situation: Last weekend my father had a French drain put in to help with drainage issues that we've been experiencing with the side lawns. Unfortunately, the guy who did the work wasn't too careful and was in a hurry to get the job done and tore up not only our yard, but part of the neighbor's yard as well. The guy used a miniature excavator instead of hand digging the trenches and neglected to put boards down. So the tracks tore up the grass something fierce. Needless to say my father wasn't happy.

The neighbors: Before the incident the neighbors have been extremely kind and we've reciprocated. They've knocked on the door to check on us when the garage door gets left up and she even brought over a dish of spaghetti for me one night because they made too much. We helped them out with their drive during the winter because he was having back issues. We've also gone back and forth on borrowing each others possessions to get projects around the respective houses completed. Needless to say, it's been a pretty good relationship. They even gave us the contact info for the guy who put in the French drain in question, because he had done some work on their yard and it turned out well. Oh what a turn of events. Anyways...

The escalation: The night that everything was done we get a knock on the door. It's the neighbors. They are understandably upset with the damage to the lawn as well. I didn't catch any of the conversation, I only heard enough to realize they aren't just upset, they are extremely pissed. Evidently the neighbors were going to have their house appraised and are worried that this is going to affect the appraisal. So my father gets in contact with the guy and the guy comes back the next night and lays down straw and some meshing on the neighbor's side and sprinkles some fertilizer to help grass to grow.

Fast forward a week to this weekend. The wind has picked up and some of the meshing has begun to rip up. The neighbor's come over in a rage and demand that my father call the guy to fix it. Again I stayed inside and away from the conversation, but I catch a few snippets. They start out by saying his (the neighbor's) mother is in the hospital and they've been driving back and forth from the hospital all week and this is the last thing they need to be dealing with right now (they repeated this three times). She also takes a swipe at my father in mentioning that he hasn't power washed the side of his house yet to get it clean for their appraisal. It's at this point that they move away from my hearing range. Here's where it gets interesting and where things may have ramped up a bit.

The three of them went out and set objects from each of their respective back yards on the mesh to keep it from ripping up and blowing away. My father waters the area and that's that. Or so he thinks. I go out the next day, Monday (so my father has left for the week), to water again and find that the neighbors have moved all of their objects off of the mesh and replaced them with the bricks my father supplied. This has two implications. One, it seems like they aren't comfortable supplying help any longer and it will be up to my father and I to get the situation fixed. Two, the quick 180 implies that they got advice from a third party and that person suggested not giving us help.

Here's where the advice comes in. Me being 25 I have of course never owned a home and never really had to deal with a neighborly dispute like this (which also means I don't know if the HOA can get involved, what legal issues may be in play, etc.). Given how quickly things went south and how nothing is placating them, my father is also confused as to how to proceed. Things went from 0-100 with them in one night. He's is doing everything in his power to rectify the situation short of kidnapping the guy who did the work and physically dragging him here to deal with it. Despite this and despite my father expressing to them how he isn't happy with damage to his own part of the lawn either, the neighbors have treated him like absolute shit. 

So my question here is, how do we handle the situation with the neighbors? Especially now that they've seemingly went and got advice from a third party? That suggests they may want to take things further if things don't get rectified to their satisfaction. Is their any legal issue they could go after us on? Really need some advice here.",24Sep2019,0

Cons:
1. 2 more years of study
2. Could be stressful and may not handle it
3. Only really useful if I want to be actually registered and that requires masters

I'm not afraid my friend is a psycho and she's gonna kill me, she was crying while confessing but I'm seriously very disturbed by what she has done, we've been through thick and thin together and  she's the biggest animal lover I know, has her own cats and she's sweet to every animal and Looks like she'll give her life for one, I really don't know what to think of her after this, the things she did and described were very cruel and painful to hear and to be honest I kind of wanted to punch her even.  


I think she wants to kill herself too, she obviously see herself as scum and what she did was horrible but I really don't want her to die, we're seriously very close and she has a healthy relationship with her family who obviously love her and would probably be broken afterwards.

I'll look up and he'll be intensely fixated on me and then he'll wait for me to turn away- he doesnt even flinch or turn away like he's been caught.

I tried to talk to him when that happened but he ran off.

562,"I literally joined Reddit to post this because I'm at a loss for what to do. My roommate and I are both recent college graduates my roommate's mother is currently paying their rent until they can financially sustain themselves. My roommate is clinically depressed and sleeps until 3 pm almost everyday. He is currently in therapy (and I'm very proud of him) and I completely understand how debilitating mental illness can be but they have now been unemployed for almost a year and his mom is paying his rent but isn't in a financial position to be doing so.  His parents are finally nagging him to get a job. I was under the impression that he'd been submitting his resume everywhere and just wasn't getting a response. BUT NO he has made no attempts to get a part time job citing mental health issues and a desire to focus on getting in shape as why. I wouldn't care too much as rent is still being payed, but his mom really doesn't have the money to support herself let alone my roommate. To be frank I'm beginning to suspect his parents are about to cut them off, and I cannot afford to pay their half of the rent. I would keep my mouth shut and just let them deal with it but they keep coming to me for validation but I can't give it to them because I don't think it's right to solely depend on your parents for money while making no effort to become financially independent yourself, ESPECIALLY when they aren't in a position financially to help you. They constantly ask me for advice but shoot down everything I say if I  even mention that getting a job might help. I've suggested moving back home if their mental health is this crippling and getting a subletter in the meantime (so that way they aren't just burning through their savings and their parents') but they insist their mental health would be worse at home.

563,"Let me start by saying that we have a very difficult family dynamic, and that my uncle (Mike)'s siblings would rather turn a blind eye than ever get involved, which is what they do with any issue that comes up with Mike.   


Mike was once married to a woman named Diane. Diane had three children prior to her marriage with Mike. Mike helped raise them for around 10 years, but then he and Diane's relationship ended in a nasty divorce. He lost most of his savings, fell into a long-term depression and rumors have swirled about potential pedophiliac behaviors. I was young when this all went down, so I don't know much of the true details.   


Now, Mike has quite a severe depression secondary to his divorce and in 2014 had to move into his parents house when his own home was quarantined destroyed due to filthy living conditions. While living at my grandparents, he did no chores other than his own laundry, until my grandfather began doing it for him out of pity. When my grandparents grew frail and very ill, my brother and I took on the responsibility of getting my uncle his own apartment, however he was responsible for upkeep and bill payments. He makes no effort in helping himself out of bad situations or cleaning up after himself, ever. He has since moved out and unfortunately our grandparents have since passed on, which has once again added to his depression. My brother was left to clean up the mess Mike had left behind in the basement, (including cigarette butts, food and dirty underwear) as he purchased the house from my grandfather a few weeks before he passed.   


Since his divorce in 2003, he as referred to his ex stepchildren as his kids and their children (many of whom he has never met) as his grandchildren. We try to redirect him and remind him that while they were once a part of his life, but they are no longer and it is not healthy to view things through that lens. He pays us no mind and continues his ways. He has even admitted to keeping their photos in past conversations.  


After the passing of our grandparents, my uncle, mom and their two brothers HARDLY ever speak and could give two shits less about the others unless they are talking poorly about one another. They tend to go through a rotating pack mentality, which my brother and I have separated ourselves from immediately. We are essentially the only grandchildren on this side of the family, so we deal with a lot more than most folks may have to in regards to playing peacekeeper or middleman between them. Which has led to us being the ones doing much of the legwork in rough situations, such as this one.  


Update to this past weekend: 

While at a family event on Saturday, Mike pointed out a woman who he said looked like his ex. I looked over, told him I could kind of see it but it's obviously not her and to not worry about it much. Right after that, he said that he saw one of her children the other day, his EX-step child. When I asked him where, he stated that he searched online to find out where he lived, and went to the house and sat outside watching them so ""he could see his son and grandchildren playing"". I was absolutely appalled and didn't know what to say. My aunt, who was sitting on the other side of Mike just immediately changed the topic of conversation when she heard what he had said, but no one else at the table even acknowledged what had just been unearthed. This is incredibly typical of my family, they constantly ignore Mike's issues.  


My brother and I need to do something. We've tried approaching Mike several times about other sensitive issues but he does not take well to people intruding in what he thinks is perfectly normal behavior (such as constantly being on his cellphone and being caught looking at potentially inappropriate material or living in filth and squalor).   


We are torn between two options and are open to other opinions as well.   


1. Do we go directly to his ex-stepchildren (whom I still have a minor relationship with, as we are connected on social media and talk about once a year) and tell them what he told us so that they can take the steps necessary to protect their families? 
2. Do we have a stern and direct talk with Mike about his inappropriate behaviors and demand he stop or encourage him to seek counseling?    


TL/DR: My uncle stated that he saw one of his ex-wive's children the other day, his EX-step child of over 15 years. When I asked him where, he stated that he searched online to find out where he lived, and went to the house and sat outside watching them so ""he could see his son and grandchildren"". He basically admitted to stalking them online, finding out where they live and then going to their home to watch them. He has toe'd the line with pedophiliac behaviors in the past. What do my brother and I do? Doing nothing is not an answer for us. When we told my mom she just threw up her hands essentially. Please, any advice or help is appreciated.",24Sep2019,2
564,"A few days ago, one of my friends told me he was doing a bunch of yardwork for one of his family friends, and was going to be paid about 850 dollars for the work. He also told me he is bringing the other friend in the story along with him, and is going to be paying him $15 an hour for his help. I'm guessing that the work is going to take about 10 hours to complete, and both of them are working at the same time, doing the same thing. This means that the subcontracted friend is only getting about $150 in total, while the other one is making nearly $700 doing almost the same thing. I feel as if this is unfair for the friend being paid far less for about the same amount of work, and I can't decide whether I should say something or keep my mouth shut. I've known these guys for a long time, and I don't want to ruin a friendship because of something like this.

He's trying to get back out there but is planning on doing mostly 2 part time jobs. He can make money whenever but its not a lot. But this allows him to stay home if he needs to.

I make enough for us to live, but we have a lot of debt and no savings, and my job now does not pay enough for that.

Does anyone have advice for this? Have I missed out on as much as I assume by not yet participating in hookup culture?

I haven't accomplished much in my life. Sure I got a bachelors degree in a field that I don't even like. I have since graduating 4 years ago been working a crappy job with people I don't like making almost minimum. I still live with my parents. I love my mom but my dad is a complete asshole. I feel like a 17 year old trapped in a 26 year old's body sometimes. I have no career and no drive to really do anything because I can't find anything that I decently passionate about. I want to go live on my own but I am constantly pressured by my dad to stay. He constantly puts it in a way that if I leave the house then I am disobeying the family and that I am at risk of getting shunned. He likes having me where he can constantly monitor me. His master plan is that I buy him a house here in the U.S. while he works to save cash that he sends back to our original country. We currently live in gov housing and my whole life is a mess right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am constantly trying to avoid confrontation with him or even seeing him as he will try to bully me or piss me off on most days that I see him. There are days where he is nice to everyone, but my relationship to him has progressively gotten worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no real friends part of the problem is that if I stay out later then a certain time period then I will be passive aggressively questioned by my parents. I am also constantly brought to the center of every family fight that occurs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was still a virgin until 2 weeks ago, as a my religion (which I don't even believe much in anymore) requires you to be virgin. I couldn't even finish or feel anything with a condom on. Not sure if this is porn addiction or anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I missed out on so much in my younger days because of how strict and psychotic the household is. I spend many of my days just sitting at the public library hiding and looking for self help. I know deep in my heart that this is no way a 20 something year old should experience life.

I traveled alone for 3 months earlier this year and the experience was beyond amazing. literally the best thing I've done in my life. While it was fun, it was also very challenging. It helped me grow alot as a person and to care for myself even at my sickest moments where I barely had the energy to walk to the doctors. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I came back to my home with my family, I noticed how low the energy was compared to mine... slowly I started falling into depression again and anxiety. I am now on the verge of traveling again with a plan to not come back home and maybe relocate to another state.

571," I posted this on a few other subreddits, but someone suggested this one.

Characters:

Me: me (duh)

I am a 13 year old girl. Pretty light (important for the story)

Neckbeard: NB

An 18 year old Neckbeard that KNOWS IM 13 YEARS OLD!!!!(this is also important)

Neckbeards kind brother: KB

Sorry if this post is confusing, roughly each paragraph is going to be a different thing NB did. I’m writing this at 1 in the morning and I’m tired so bear with me. And I’m going to start with the less extreme things, then move on the illegal things.

This started when I went to visit my grandparents on my mom’s side of the family during summer. It was far so we took a plane to get there and my dad did not come. While we were there; we went to visit my mom’s cousin for two days. We were staying at their house for the entirety of the two days. Moms cousin has two sons. The NB and his kind brother. The brother was very nice. He respected my personal space, he changed clothing every day, he worked two jobs and was over all a great person to be around. On the other hand, there was NB. He wore the exact same clothing the entire time I was there. Which was about three days, and two nights. He had a neckbeard that looked like someone glued pubes onto his face. He smelled bad, and I never saw him take a shower. He was also unemployed. He was creepy. At first, it was “ok”, but after some time he went too far. Throughout the whole time, he was making horrible jokes (and that’s a lot coming from me. I have a horrible sense of humor) about the holocaust, Nazis, Hitler and those subjects. He also would not stop talking about anime. I watched one anime at the time. He would suggest ones, then immediately give me reasons not to.

For example:

NB: You should watch this anime that I saw called \*insert name of anime\*

Me: Ok. Ill check it out.

NB: Wait, you might not like it. There are lots of people getting rapped in it. There are pretty graphic scenes.

He did these multiple times. Another thing was my anime pencil box that I adore. I decided to show it to him and the FIRST this he said was “\*anime character on box\* is hot”. In my head I was like ‘wtf. This is a 15-year-old boy. Dude, you ruined my favorite pencil box.’ He would also talk like this about other anime characters.

He would also constantly brag about how good he was at fighting. He told me about the time that he punched a hole in the wall at school, and that he wanted to ‘beat a kid’s brain out’ I quote. He would also tell me about how he physically fought with his brother and how he wanted to fight with me. He was insisting that he teach me how to fight and I reluctantly agreed. He was teaching me how to trip someone by hitting the back of their knee. While he was showing me how, he had his hands on my shoulder to prevent me from falling, but when I did fall, he moved his hands to my upper arm and waist. I was uncomfortable. I ended up making an excuse that I needed to go to the bathroom and left. He also said that when he gets mad, all he sees is red. To say the least, I was scared of him. He was literally twice my weight, at least a head taller than me, and had a much larger body build that me. This is why I never called him out. I was scared he would get mad and hurt me.

Another thing he would brag about was his HORRIBLE sleeping schedule, even compared to me. He would always say my bed time is sooo early (it’s at 10pm, or 22:00) and that I should stay up with him. He bragged about how he went to bed at 9 in the MORNING and woke up at 2pm or 14:00. DUDE WTF. I was with you eating breakfast. You’re not asleep.

He also told me about how he called me cute if front of his friends, and they called him a pedo(not as a joke) and he was LAUGHING wile telling me this. He also kept on calling me cute for the rest of my stay there which made me really uncomfortable. On the first night there, we were eating dinner at the table, and he looked at my plate (which had a decent amount of food on it) before saying “You don’t eat a lot. No wonder you’re so slim”. I wish I was joking, he actually said that and I was creeped the F\*CK out. For most of these comments I just replied with “oh” and switched the subject to try and hint at him that I was uncomfortable, but did he pick up on these signals? NO! He would also say I could sleep on his shoulder if I wanted to during the car rides (hell no).

I was lying on my bed when their cat jumped next to me. The neckbeard, who was standing there having a one-sided conversation with me, leaned OVER me to pet the cat. One hand was petting the cat, while the other was supporting him up, and one of his knees was placed on the edge of the bed. The hand that was supporting him was placed uncomfortably close, nearly toughing, my pelvis while the knee was on the other side of my pelvis. I was freaking out. I was stuck on the bed with a neckbeard hovering over me.

NB would also follow me everywhere. When we were outside, he would walk next to me, when I was sitting, he would sit next to me. When I went to my bedroom, he would follow me in and stand at the doorway as I lay on the bed and stare at me. When I went to the bathroom, he would stand next to the door!

Later on, NB looked at his phone and laughed. I looked at him and he noticed. He said it was a meme but he did not think I would find it funny. I told him to show me as I have a horrible sense of humor. BIG MISTAKE!! He showed me something about ejaculation and it was gross. Reminder: I am 13 years old at the time. He knows this!

I decide to ignore it and hope it doesn’t happen again. He showed me a few more inappropriate memes but I ignored all of them. But that wasn’t all that he did. He decided to make me listen to a five to ten-second-long HENTAI audio of a girl being raped. I was shook. He then decided to tell me about a group chat that he had with his friends where they sent each other hentai audios and clips. He then proceeded to ASK ME IF I WANT TO JOIN!!! Wtf dude. NO I don’t want to join your hentai group chat. That’s disgusting. After I declined, he then told me about his favorite type of hentai. Girls with tentacles. Its were a girl is captured in a bunch of tentacle like things, and then…the hentai part. NB started to explain to me what tentacles (in hentai) means and how it became a thing. He went into detail.

By this time, our stay was over. All this happened in two days. The last thing he did in person, was when we had to say goodbye, he hugged me really tight and pushed me onto the couch that was behind me, before falling on top of me. I managed to get out from under him quickly. Now you think this is the end, nope. There is more.

My mom gave him my phone number. The first thing he sent me was a meme saying: all you need in life is boobs. I decided to ignore that and sent him a bunch of gif’s from an anime (the same one that was on the pencil box). He replied to one of the gifs of a 15 year old boy crying saying, and I kid you not “I’m going to have sexual thoughts about that” I was grossed out. It’s a gif a kid you pedo!! Why would you say that!!

The last thing he sent me was the worst. He made a bunch of stickers (the texting platform we use allows you to make mini photos that they call stickers) where he took animals and replaced their bodies and heads with a penis. He sent me one of a pig where its entire body was changed. He told me it was his penis. I stopped responding after that. I was afraid to block him because he would probably tell my mom and that would force me to show her everything, and I don’t have the guts to do that. He called me about 10 times after that before giving up. I don’t know what to do now. Should I tell someone? If yes, who?",24Sep2019,2

573,"Aight. This is my first post on Reddit. I have no idea why or what I’m doing. My friend said to reach out on here, and I trust that I’ll get some good advice, even if it might hurt my feelings. 

Let me start from the beginning. I met him at my server job during the summer. He served along side me and was helpful in every way since I was new to the food industry. A mutual friend always said stuff like, “___ should totally take you on a date.” Or “...you gonna ask him on a date or naw?” Stuff like that. So finally being the independent and forward person I am, I asked him on a date. The date was good in my opinion, we bounced off well and the conversation never got awkward. After that I didn’t really think he wanted anything till he texted me saying that he enjoyed getting to know me and such. From the. On we started going on more dates. I finally asking one day over the phone if we were like boyfriend and girlfriend status. Now granted, that sounds childish but I’m 19. I always have( had?) high standards for men. Even though they liked me I always said no because I saw something I didn’t like. I always said I was just picky when it came to men and I ended up with a real clown lol. Any ways we started dating. Really nice but I saw some red flags. Did I say anything? No. I wore rose-colored glasses. He ended up dating his on-again-off-again gf the whole time. The way I found out was through IG when she dm’ed saying that his cheated two times before.  That broke my heart.  I learned quick that I was too trusting and kind, so I got taken advance of by the very guys I said I would never date. 

It’s been almost a month. He reached out the other day to say his side of the story. He said he really changed and wants to be friends again and maybe even more. I’m torn. I really like him. At the same time I know I’m not his first choice and he hurt me. What do I do? If y’all need any more details I’ll make a second post but I’m stressed over these past couple weeks. I know it sounds small and silly but his my first guy I really like, and I see the good in people.",24Sep2019,4

A few months ago, he started becoming pretty close (as a friend) with a female coworker. Currently she’s his only real friend. I know she is no threat and I trust him. On top of that, she was the one that encouraged my boyfriend to reach out to me after we broke up for a brief time, and I have met and hung out with her a couple times. My jealousy mainly stems from the fact that they have one night a week where they go to the bar after work, which of course I wish I had with him! It also brings up the irrational fear of being “replaced” by her, since I can’t be there with him weekly like she can. 

Has anyone gone through these feelings and/or have advice on how I can deal with them? I feel so bad that I get miserable every weekend when I know they’ll go out, it’s really not fair to my boyfriend since he’s just trying to relax and be social after a long weekend of work.",24Sep2019,1
577,"Without getting into details, I fucked up 7 years ago and I abused what was, at the time, my only dog. I'm not looking for hate, validation, comments telling me how awful of a human I am... I know. Believe me, if I caught somebody else doing the things I'd be put away for murder. I absolutely love dogs and was going through a very major depressive episode, but that's no valid excuse for what I did. It ended when I saw him in a certain light that showed how much he still loved me and how my abuse was affecting me pretty badly. I still have him. He's 9 years old now and kept me from killing myself on more than one occasion, and I like to think he doesn't remember anything I did to him.

 Unfortunately I still remember. I've never told a single person what I've done, mostly because I'm terrified of their judgement and just so fucking ashamed of myself. I've been in and out of therapy with various psychologists and social workers for depression and PTSD (old military wounds) but I've never so much as hinted at this guilt.

I need to just tell someone what I did. I need to get it off my chest but I don't want to tell anyone I would ever need to make eye contact with afterwards.

579,"Hi, I posted in r/AITA around a week ago regarding my friends upcoming wedding and some of the unrealistic expectations she has for the bridesmaid/groomsmen, namely regarding our time and money. Essentially, the bridesmaids have already spent $400 on bridesmaid attire. Selecting the dresses took an entire day, getting them fitted and picking them up took another 2 - she conveniently chose a shop 90 minutes away. 

Now, she’s asking that we attend a 4 night weekend trip for her Jack and Jill “weekend”. Essentially, it’s 12 of us total. 4 days in a cabin, at $300 a head, just for the lodging. This does not include food, drinks, or entertainment of any kind. Favoriting that stuff in - I’d say we’re looking at spending $500, minimum. Did I also mention the wedding party guests are covering her and her fiancés stay?

I expressed my reservations to her when she initially brought up the trip, mainly about the cost. She stated that she saw where she was coming from and would keep looking for destinations. 

Lo and behold - 2 weeks later, the group gets a text from her that its booked and that it will be $300, please. 

I was appalled and was wondering how best to approach the situation, when we all received a follow up text stating that the property was actually sold, the trip is off, but she’s looking for an alternative. I’m worried that her next venture will be even more unreasonable. At this point, it’s less about the cost and more about the fact that she’s requesting us to give up 4 nights of our time, 6 weeks before her 3 night wedding extravaganza. We all work full time, except, of course for her. She’s unemployed! In short, she is a bride obsessed with her wedding and she doesn’t care about how she may steamroll while she lays these plans down

Anywho, I’m not sure when she’ll bring up alternative plans but I want to make sure I’m prepared. I want to make sure she can’t trample over the group like last time. How can I make her see she’s being unreasonable?

TL; DR a friend is getting married and wants the wedding party to participate in a 4 night, $500 trip for which the members of the wedding party are paying for the bride and groom. I think it’s unreasonable, and told her so but I don’t think she cares. How can I make her see reason?",24Sep2019,2
580,"So a lot in my life changed today. My boss told me that they're cutting down my work hours since next month because my workplace won't have as many customers as we usually do during tourist season. I also found out that I will only have three work shifts in October which equals about 15 hours. This month I've worked 100 hours and I don't really earn a lot from working 100 hours so 15 hours? It won't give me anything. My boss also told me that from January until March they'll be renovating my workplace and have a much smaller business so I don't think I'll get almost any shifts. I think I'll quit when december is over but I've started applying for new jobs today though so hopefully it will work out.

For my boyfriends birthday next month I had planned an activity that would cost more than a third of my salary.

587,"So currently my sisters friend lives with us because her home situations, her parents are divorced, are not the greatest. A couple months ago she got diagnosed with Lupus which is a pretty serious illness to be diagnosed with at 18. We've noticed as a family that she has slowly become more and more lazy and ungrateful for what we have provided her with (We have given her, her own space, a bed, food, free living, and all other amenities a home comes with). Also, she has started using her Lupus as a defining trait about herself, and as an excuse for everything. One she just used today was that she gets to use our driveway because she has lupus, and one of the most infuriating excuses was that no one could use the bathroom for 45 minutes in the morning because she has Lupus and it takes her forever to get ready, all she does is straighten her hair and go to the bathroom. She also has lately been using Lupus as a reason to why she is failing college. She works a job that runs around 50+ hours a week and she has two college classes on the two nights she doesn't work. Her classes aren't difficult in any way, but she says she doesn't have the time when she blatantly does, but she prefers not to do her work over relaxing or watching tv. Overall, it's getting extremely annoying to hear ""I have Lupus"" every hour of every day. How do we break it to her that she's become extremely ungrateful and that she is using her disease as an excuse, and also as a way to set herself up for failure?",24Sep2019,1
589,"People have told me I have disease because I am autistic. This offends me because autism is a neurological disorder, not a disease. It makes me think that people look down on me for being autistic, especially people who have made no effort to learn anything about ASD.

590,"We were so wrapped up in each other we pretty much just spent all our free time together for 2 years. Drifted apart with most of my friends. I thought I was going to marry this girl and I just loved being around here. I ruined it by being an asshole, criticizing, and having controlling tendencies. I’m in therapy now and I have ocd which played a part in some of the issues due to intense worrying about her and our future. 

The hardest part is that she’s just done after spending everyday together and doing everything together. Yes I was terrible but I wish she sat me down and said what she was feeling so I had a chance to improve. We had so many great times together and we were there for each other at our lowest points. I can’t fathom it’s over 

Now it’s hard hanging out with my friends consistently because I neglected them for a long time. Just all around shitty. 

Also in a new area an hour and a half away from them. I go out with them sometimes but it’s just not consistent and I get really lonely after having someone with me all the time. 

How do I go about meeting new friends? I’m 24 and going back to school in the spring. Do I live there? Will meeting friends in school be weird when I’m older than most of them? 

I’m somewhat attractive and have been filling the void with girls from tinder but I just don’t want a relationship right now and there’s no connection with these girls. I’m not over my ex. Do I stay friends with her even though I still have feelings?

She lives an hour away so it is hard seeing her outside of work but we worked it out with our boss so we work together 80 percent of the time.  I feel that I could make it more than friends but she has a boyfriend living with her. I really like this girl and even on my saddest days being around her makes me happy. Im at the point where I have developed a crush on her and don't know what to do as she has been dating her boyfriend since she was 18. They have their arguments but at the end of the day they seem happy. I don't want to ruin anything. I am keeping my true feelings inside so I don't hurt her because I love her that much. I try to be as helpful as possible wothout overstepping but personally I can't handle how much I want to be with her.

592,"hello reddit. i’ve never used this before, just made an account today. i’m gonna condense my story to as short as i can so it doesn’t sound like i’m rambling,  but i need advice since my family won’t help, my friends claim they try to help, and i’ve never liked the idea of seeing a therapist. so here it is: i had this girlfriend starting in 2015 while i was still in high school. it was an amazing relationship, we knew from the start we were a great match. we spent so much time together and never got sick of each other, i even liked spending time with her parents. as we got closer to the end of our senior year, we knew we weren’t going to the same college. instead of going off to our respective schools trying long distance, we ended it mutually. when i started college (fall of 2017), i knew within the first month that i was still in love with her. i went and visited her soon after that, only for her to tell me she doesn’t feel the same. turns out, it was because she found a new guy. i was devastated. since that moment, every girl i’ve been with seemed so fake and now i can’t seem to make any girl seem interesting. fast forward to today, i transferred schools for my major and now live in the same city as my ex ( i didn’t transfer for her lol). last week we caught up by going to lunch and at the end i told her that i still love her and none of my feelings have gone away since we broke up, i tell her this because she is now single. all she tells me is she doesn’t want to lead me on and that she’s not looking for a relationship right now, which makes sense since she just got out of one. at the end, i ask her if i can kiss her before i leave, and she lets me... at this point i’m very confused. she shows some signs of not being over us, but she’s either too afraid to say it or doesn’t want to get herself caught up in me again. i haven’t talked to her since then and wonder what i should do. i’m in love with this girl and want to marry her one day, how do i figure this out without coming off as pushy or annoying?",24Sep2019,1
593,"So, I'm 2 months into college.  I am a pretty sociable person and have made a lot of friends, but I can't seem to find anyone I really enjoy hanging out with who would also like to hangout with me.

Everybody already seems to have found there friend circle and initially I was really good friends with the boys from this particular dorm. I was so tight with them, I slept on their weird frat-house couch every night and had a lot of fun times. 

However, a new guy moved in with them and spending time with him, he made me realize that these boys weren't the nicest. All they do is drugs and pretty much nothing else, and it's not that nice to hang with them anymore.

I go to an art school, and I know that if I don't take school seriously then I could very well end up with nothing after four years, so I can't be high everyday. 

I befriended this girl, then, who nobody wants to hangout with because she is very dramatic and dumb, creates a fuck ton of issues and gossip. I accepted her company and zoned out with her most of the time, but because of that I don't make any new friends. I have also realized I don't want to spend time with her because it is exhausting to hear about her 20k boyfriends or whatever 100% of the time and she never listens to anything I have to say.

I don't mind being a loner, but I don't want to get into that just because I stopped trying to make friends too soon. Should I just be alone and go with the flow or should I consciously try and make friends?

595,"Hello all,

I've been struggling with substance abuse problems since the age of 18. I'm 23 now and things have gotten much worse in the past few years. It all started at my first job as a server. I was telling a friend how stressful it is for me to interact with all of the customers because I'm a very insecure and socially anxious person. He offered me an Adderall one day before my shift, and that's when my love affair with drugs started. I loved how it took me outside of myself. It made me feel confident, talkative, well-liked. I always got more of a positive response from people when I was high. Everyone seemed to like the high me more than the real me. I'm still working in food service and nothing has changed since then. I always have to have some kind of intoxicant in my system before going to work just to handle socializing with my customers and coworkers. Most of my paycheck goes towards the drugs that help me get through my work day. I can't save any money. I'm basically working just to finance my habit. It's a vicious cycle and I have no idea how to get myself out of it. I want to start treatment and begin attending NA meetings but I'm convinced that I could never work this job while trying to get sober. Should I just quit and totally commit myself to treating my addiction? I'm ready to change and I'm more than willing to put in the effort. My boyfriend is basically supporting both of us right now because of where all of my money goes, but he still doesn't want me to quit. I'm not sure where to go from here, I cannot keep living like this. Thoughts?",24Sep2019,1

597,"Over the past couple of days I've been away with my parents to a beautiful little caravan site in northern England. It was a good time. My parents argued a bunch and not everything went according to plan, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. Almost immediately after coming home to my own flat a few hours ago, I've felt this unexplainable feeling in the gut of my stomach and a never ending need to cry. I have been in this continuous emotional state for 2 hours now and I have no idea what is causing it. I meditated for 30 minutes in the hopes I would be able to root it out, but to no avail. My parents only live a few miles ago so I am tempted to go and spend another night with them since I'm home alone at my flat and that could have something to do with it. But I'm also very conscious of my dependancy on home and my parents. I visit them every weekend without fail and I have found it really difficult to Seperate from home since I moved a year ago. I don't want to return to old bad habits that were present in that place (mainly the laziness). Is it a bad idea to go back there tonight?

598,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my loving boyfriend for 2 years now, however as with every relationship it doesn't come without trials and struggles. The beginning of our relationship was rocky in all honesty, it was a mess. To put it in short and not bore you with the long version the way we met was through his ex girlfriend in which I was best friends with at the time. I never really understood how they were both still friends considering they were both telling me all the time how horrible the breakup was and how toxic the actual relationship was. It was about 5 months into the relationship when I started noticing something odd happening. I had another friend text me and tell me that my boyfriend had been sending my best friend and his ex girlfriend money. Me being the bullheaded, blunt, say it like it is kinda of person didn't hesitate on approaching my bf on this issue. He admitted this to me and clearly got upset when I got upset about it. Come to find out after all of this 6 more months down the line from the money scandal that my suspicions were in fact correct and he had cheated on me with her and to make things worse my now ex best friend had screenshots of him shit talking me behind my back. All of this was now a little over a year ago and we are about to hit our 2 year anniversary. 3 months ago we sat down and had a serious talk because I had noticed he had been acting different again always got defensive when i'd ask him something simple like ""How was your day"" or ""What did you do"" so we sat down and he beat around the bush many many times until he finally admitted what was going on. He admitted to me that he had a serious pornography addiction to the point of he was watching it every single day most times multiple times a day. As with any girl that would be put in this situation I actually laughed. I didn't laugh at him I laughed because I found it funny how he sat there for 2 hours and kept not wanting to tell me. I comforted him as he was once again clearly upset over what he had done and knowing that it hurt me. It didn't really hit me until 3 days after when I started to wonder how many more times was he gonna be dishonest to me like this. Everything since then has seemingly been good however, with all of the times that he's been dishonest to me in the past lately I have been having a really hard time trusting him. I love him to death, but a long distance relationship is all about trust and he's broken it so many times I can't figure out how to let myself full trust him again.

599,"I quit my job yesterday. My first act as an unemployed 23 year old was to make a Reddit account. 

Some back story, I've been employed since 16 got my first job working seasonal at a local GameStop. I moved up the ranks for about 2.5 years and then quit to make more money at Verizon. That only lasted about a year until I moved to Xfinity for about 9 month. Made a ton of money but the environment was cripplingly toxic. Ended up working in a dialysis clinic and getting my medical assistant cert. Was never passionate about medical I just new it would be a respected title and could pay the bills. After about 9 months of grueling work both emotionally and physically I took a full time position as a CMA in outpatient for a hospital. This job lasted just short of year an a half when I found out I would be let go under the new buyers of the hospital due to changing certification standards. Mind you I hated this job so this wasn't a bad thing, I was excited. I immediately hoped on indeed and applied for a position at Super Supplements just to get a job. I do enjoy health and wellness so why not? I'm also getting my NASM Personal training certificate and could use an easy side job. I initially started this job April of this year and at first it was incredibly easy being back in retail. Then due to a series of events it got incredibly difficult. No working registers for 4 months, no support from managers, and co-workers who didn't like me. Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first. I came into work yesterday, and the last week had been horrible. Total store reset, computers crashing, and no communication from management. I'd decided to make the best of it and do the best I could. When I got in the two workers who don't particularly like me started to correct me on tasks that couldn't be completed yesterday due to computers crashing. Telling me it's no excuse.  I just stood there in awe, in all this chaos you have a worker who comes in with a good attitude, does her best given the circumstances, and instead of saying ""Hey! I know it's been hard thanks for doing your best."" You criticize me over something so menial. So, I quit. 

I called my manager explained to him how I have been giving it my all, and it doesn't seem to be enough for these two and despite my coming to you about this on multiple occasions it's not improved, so I'm leaving. I gathered my things told my coworkers I was clocking out and left.

I'm at a point now, where I've never done this before. I've always had something else lined up. It's a bit scary, but I do have some money saved and support from my bf, friends, and family if needed. Still it feels crazy to bet on myself for once and not settle for a job just because it's a job. I want to pursue my passion, which is ultimately to help people live better lives. I don't want to be a personal trainer forever it just seems like a good jumping off point with how much I already incorporate it into my personal life.

All I know is that I want better for myself and I want to help people better themselves as well.

Have any of you done this before? What did you learn? Any advice?",24Sep2019,2

608,"I started University in the UK and along with it, the Freshers' week, since last Wednesday. It's been alright to be honest, people are respectful and sometimes introduce themselves to me. 


However, this weird thing keeps happening in large groups especially. They turn to each other and form a small group, excluding me, deliberately answer my questions quickly then turning to each other, preferring any other person but me, looking at me in a condescending way. 


I am foreign but I have lived in the Uk for the past 4 years so it's not like my English is not good or like I don't use slang words. So many people give me weird looks while I talk and I get mixed signals about their opinions too. One girl stopped me in the club last night telling me how pretty I am, a guy asked for my number, but my flatmates only talk to me when necessary yet create stronger bonds between themselves, guys around my house forget my name and ask me to introduce myself constantly or completely disregard me from parties or conversations. I don't know what I am doing wrong...


Two nights ago a drunk guy told me I look nice and I seem great but, quote,""British guys are cowards and never talk first to girls like you because you are intimidating"". I don't even know what that means???I am Eastern European but I have a baby face and a soft voice. I am always friendly and try to include everyone. But girls, in the same measure as guys, either like me or disregard me completely. 


Don't get me wrong, I don't need everyone to like me.

609,"This is my first time posting so bear with me. For some backstory, I (23F) got married last November. My now ex-husband (26) walked out on me in June. He had lied about some really big things, was either hostile towards me or ignored me altogether, and thanks to one of my best friends, I found out that he had a profile on a dating app less than an hour after telling me he was leaving. (My friend had the screenshots - he even used a photo from our bridal shoot.) He tells me he left because he wasn’t happy, but it’s my personal opinion that he left because he learned how perceptive I am and he was frustrated that he couldn’t lie his way through life with me. That and I have some big health problems, ones he was very familiar with before he ever proposed, but he decided he couldn’t handle them once we were married. 

He served me divorce papers a week and a half after leaving (even tried to interrupt my sister’s wedding to do it) and because his character had finally shown through, I didn’t hesitate to sign after having them reviewed. Our state only requires a 30 day waiting period after filing, so our divorce became final one month ago. It hasn’t even been three months since he left and today I found out through friends that he is in a new relationship (and she’s younger than me, which I only mention to have the naïveté considered). 

I’m considering sending her a message, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea and I’m not sure what parts to tell her if I do. I just don’t want her to go through what I just went through because I KNOW there is no way he is being totally honest with her. My ex is very charming. He doesn’t exactly tell you what he thinks you want to hear - he tells you what he thinks will make you have a better opinion of him.

Hello, please bear with me throughout this long post 

I do not know where to start. Guess i'll just go from when the problem began. I was always an average scorer till high school. Scored around 80 percent all the time. Had the drive to study overnight when exams were there. Then i joined senior high school(11-12th grade), where i started focusing more on studies, ditched all kinds of distractions in those two years. Got good enough grades to be able to join a reputed undergraduate school. 

During that transition to the college, i was having health problems.I consulted a doctor in my hometown regarding that, he just waved my concerns away and said it's nothing serious ,quite rudely in fact. I didn't mind it at the time. Then came the time, where i had to start going to the college.I moved to the new place where the school was.I was really naive and afraid of everything back then. Was really afraid of how i would be able to cope with the new environment and people. I was the opposite of people smart, so pretty much anxious all the time. Since it was my first time being away from my hometown.On top of that, I was quite tired all the time, severe coughing, no energy to do anything. It was quite a hindrance to attend the classes. I consulted the local doctor, even he told me it was nothing to worry about and wrote me up some medicines. I kept going to him for around two months since i wasn't getting any better. Then finally he told me to take a blood test. Turned out i had a major health issue which had to be treated with specific medicines to cure. And it was a contagious disease, so the doctor told me to refrain from going to classes for at least 2 months. 

I was in my room all day in that two month period, i got into all kinds of stuff that kept me distracted. Like browsing and gaming in my mobile.Playing games in my laptop. Bed ridden but still somehow spending time on those things made me less worried about real life. After two months, i had to get back to classes. The horror was, the semester exam was just in a month.And I wasn't prepared for shit, still i tried. Some teachers refused to let me write some of the small tests required to be eligible for the main semester exam despite having a genuine reason.I was shaken, i had no idea why they were acting the way they were.Still i somehow managed to pass in a few subjects. The next semester, i was a depressed mess, i was moping about failing the subjects in the previous semester as it was the first time in my life that i ever failed in a subject.And was thinking about ending my life because of the mess i was in .Fortunately, i didn't.All that aside, I skipped most of the classes. Indulged in the same things i did last semester just so i could forget how shitty my real life was turning out to be. The end result was, i again failed in a few more subjects.

Then came the two month summer break where i could have taken the subjects i haven't cleared and move onto the next year after clearing them and carry few subjects.I had no knowledge of that system. Thanks to my advisor who had no idea that we could carry some backlogs to next year and advised me on how re taking the year is the only go. Only after the summer break did i learn the truth. I tried to go to the college with a new vigor. But the life as a year back student hit me flat in the face. I was a  very conscious person. Insecure to boot. I was pretty lonely in the class,because most of the students have this stigma of looking at year backs as absolute failures and try to distance themselves from us as much as possible. And few teachers made an example of us as failures and made sure to say that out loud in class. That pretty much destroyed whatever i had prepared to face. I skipped classes again. because i was too scared to face all that . Better to indulge in my gaming and internet habits to forget about the real shitty life of me(right?).So i made a habit out of skipping classes.And they had a 85 percent mandatory attendance for exams,so it was a given that i wouldn't be allowed to write most of the tests and thereby ineligible to write the semester exam.

After the year ended.I took up the failed subjects in that summer break of two months. Cleared all the subjects i had taken among the maximum subjects allowed.Moved onto the next year. The same shit happened again. So i had one more year back.And i cleared some of  the subjects in the summer breaks once again.This went on for one more year and one more year back. And i am back to square one once again. In those times, It's not that i never got motivated and didn't get my shit together to start better.I was motivated to do better a few times. It was like that for a week or two. Then the loneliness in the class got the better of me.Or it's the one mean teacher who makes you feel miserable and unworthy for being there. It's really demotivating in that environment. There was this one time, where i was really like, i'll just give my damned best this time no matter how other people treat me. Then i got diagnosed with a kidney stone which made my life miserable just living. That was the time ,i gave up.

It took a few months to feel better again. After experiencing all those things, my mentality has entirely changed. From a guy who wanted to do his best in studies to the one who just wants to pass in the subjects. For some reason, the exams scare me. And i end up procrastinating the whole time while there's an exam the next day.All sorts of negative thoughts run through my mind on the exam day. 'I don't know shit, it's better to not write the exam itself and focus on the next one' . I end up doing the same with other as well. And skip every exam like that. And it just applies to the regular year.Not the summer breaks where i actually understand stuff better and go to classes and students are usually filled with people like me. So i don't feel any negativity there.I am always like' damn, this was actually easy, i don't know why i found it harder in the regular year' for subjects.

Now i am back to square one. Back to the regular year. Unmotivated as ever. Indulge in internet things to distract my mind from the real messed up stuff.sigh.I know it's mostly my fault.Not sure what i am expecting from you people. Just venting it out here i guess. I don't think anyone would read this long passage of boring stuff**. If someone did, i really appreciate it .Thank you :)**

One thing i got good at was being able to talk to anybody outside the classroom. I was really anxious and expecting the worst,every time i was in a conversation. Now i can at least hold a decent conversation when it's really needed. Not afraid of talking to people and being used to live on my own. Now that i think about it , i was a sheltered kid all my life and things changed when i moved here. No wonder i found myself in such a mess.sigh.",24Sep2019,1
611,"*im a single-mom with a 15 month old daughter currently dating my ex-HS sweetheart

Sounds like a mess already, huh?

BACKGROUND:
Me and this guy were HS sweethearts for 3 years (some on and off cuz yanno.. hormones)
We ended on decent terms, we just weren’t on the same page mentally and we grew apart a little. However, we have remained in contact here and there since we split. We’ve always had this love for each other but we both decided to move on and go our separate ways. He went to college and then the military and I stayed in our home town. 
Eventually, life happened and I became a single mom.
Throughout this time, like I said, we have always kept in touch. Sometimes there would be conversations about our feelings but I would always brush it off because I didn’t know if what he was saying was true or if he was just saying it so he could “get lucky” again.
A few months ago, after a lot of soul searching and alone time, we started talking consistently again. (He was stationed in TX and I’m in VA) 
Things started to get a little serious and we both got into our feelings and declared what was truly in our hearts to each other. He hasn’t had a serious girlfriend since we were together. In a way, it was like he was waiting for me... and I was just trying to live my life and he was too don’t get me wrong. In his words he said “no one met his standards”
I’ve always loved him, but I just did it from afar. I never thought we would get back together..
So anyways, long story short, we both have tremendous love for each other. His family loves me, my family loves him...

He came back to VA  for a week recently and we finally saw each other again after years and it was absolutely beautiful. It was everything I’d hoped it would be and more.. it was established that this is what we want..

The only thing that’s kind of hindering our relationship from going further is the fact that I have a daughter. It sounds a little fucked up but he has a right to feel the way he does. He isn’t ready for a kid let alone to become a step dad. And I understand that.. I wasn’t ready to become a mom either, shit just happens..
We both are trying to figure out a way to make this work.. we both want this to work but I also don’t want to force anything. 
He’s the type of person that goes all in or nothing and he doesn’t think he’s fully prepared for the responsibilities that come with being with me.
He is now being stationed in Alaska and he will be there for 3 years.. if I didn’t have a kid, I would be there with him right now, but of course that’s not the case here. I want to move there with him and he wants me there too. But I don’t know how to proceed with him and my daughter. 
What are your thoughts on this?? How should I go about helping him..?
We both are the only people we want to be with.. but I just come with a little extra beautiful package. 
I know he needs time to process everything and I’m giving it to him. But how can I help him?",24Sep2019,2
612,"I need advice and I don't know who to talk to. 

I am currently engaged. I will be getting married in two weeks time and I am truly scared. It seems like my world has been falling apart in the last month and every single problem that's come up has been because of my fiance and his past mistakes. Money is a huge one, family is another. I love him but I keep thinking about how the rest of my life will go if I stay. He loves me and I know that. He has changed so much in the last few years. He used to have some horrible habits and has done a really good job of quiting them but unfortunately, the consequences of those things is what I am suffering with now. 

None of the problems are new to me, so its not like he is hiding anything but I am tired. I have suffered so much at the hands of the person I love the most and sometimes I see how much weight this adds to my shoulders. It doesn't help that I spent the majority of my life being smart and I've got most of my life in order. 

I wish I could add more details but its really not worth it. The problems are dealt with, family sucks, and we have no money. And I guess a lot of people have money issues. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has any advice, or did anyone else have so much happen before a wedding? 

We are having a 10 person wedding and dinner at a restaurant, so money is being very tight there. I just didn't want everyone to assume the money problems were coming from that.",24Sep2019,1
613,"Some background: 
When my husband and I first started dating, I was stripping. He freaked out and wanted me to quit. He was so loving and caring and thoughtful and funny and I was so in love so I quit without giving it a second thought. In return I asked he gave up drinking. 
I got pregnant and our relationship changed. I was hormonal and he was unloving and cold. 
Then we got chlamydia. To this day, he still claims he doesn’t know where it came from and he never cheated, whatever. 
After the baby was born, the tension lifted and we get along much better, but he still isn’t as loving as he used to be. Most of the time he just ignores me to do his own thing. 
He also insists on drinking a few times a month. 
This is when it gets sticky. 
He was supposed to give up drinking since I gave up dancing (and the money that comes with it), but now he’s drinking a few times a month, breaking his end of the promise. 
I try telling him that he’s not keeping his end of the deal and he says “it’s not a big deal, it’s just a few times a month”. But if I were to strip just a few times a month, our relationship would end. I tell him that too and his response is always “break up with me then. Go get naked in front of guys if that’s what you want.”
We are struggling financially, I’m in school and he’s working and we’re raising our 9 month old. 
I’m considering going back to dancing because we are in debt and barely able to pay rent, but waiting until his drinking inevitably picks up then break up with him before starting dancing again, because I don’t want to be the one to break our promise.
I’m tired of being the “bad guy” and trying to “control him” by enforcing our promise.
This weekend, we went to a family party and he was drinking. Afterwards when we were alone I expressed not only how upset I was that he was drinking, but also that he wanted to stay and keep drinking. He told his entire family I forced him to leave and made him the “bad guy.” He also told me he was going to break up with me the next day. I’m getting to the point that I’m almost done fighting with/for him. 
He expresses constantly that he is not living the kind of life he wants to be living and any time we fight he threatens to go sleep at his dad’s house and that he will leave me for good. 
Like I said, I’m almost to the point of just giving up and letting this thing take its course. 
I’m sorry I know this is confusing but I would appreciate any advice at all because I’m honestly so lost idk what to do here.",24Sep2019,1
614,"I will preface by saying I am pretty young and still not the best of drivers. I haven't gotten into an accident yet but have had some real boneheaded moments and close calls, and this one is probably the worst.

So I take a quick trip on the highway for my commute to school. The exit ramp drops off in a weird and busy location and I am almost always spending a couple minutes at the stop sign. Visibility is poor going both ways, with pillars from an overpass blocking a lot of the view of the left side, and a hill blocking a lot of the right side view. I have to cross over to the right lane to get to where I am going. It is usually never a problem, but today I was sitting at the stop for longer than normal, with a long line of cars behind me (which makes me anxious), and I thought a good point to cross was coming up. I quickly glance right, which had cars coming but seemingly much further down the road, then looked left which was clear after waiting for one car, and went. I cross over, and immediately hear a beep and tire screeching. In my rear-view I see a car right on my tail, skidding and turning to the shoulder to avoid hitting me. I felt absolutely awful and kept going slowly to make sure they were okay (it didn't slow the traffic since they had come to a near stop). They were justifiably looking pretty mad, but there didn't seem to be any damage to anything. I then drove normally and saw them turn at the first available opportunity into a gas station. I considered pulling over too to make sure everything was alright but my panic and need to get to class just had me move on. I really do feel terrible about it.

Really now what I am worried about is that he was pulling into the gas station to report me for wreckless/careless driving. I spent all of class doing my best to sneak on my phone and search on google to see what happens in such scenarios and what I could expect. I saw a wide mix, as one does on google, ranging from ""it happens every day don't worry about it"" to ""The cops will likely send a letter and possibly investigate"". I am especially worried since it was in my dad's car as mine is in the shop, and my parents and I aren't on the best terms at the moment, and never have been when it comes to me driving, so if we get a letter saying I was recklessly driving, I am gonna be in for it bigtime. I don't know much about being cut off/cutting people off, but I am inclined to think that this was a more serious case.

Is there anything I can do at this point other than sit and hope? What kind of repercussions come with a warning/citation?

TL;DR- I was sitting at a stop sign on an exit ramp trying to cross over, went when I thought was best, but wound up badly cutting someone off. I can't get it off my brain and I feel terrible and pretty scared.",24Sep2019,1

617,"Hello All. 

I don't know where to begin and this may all be really confusing because of everything I have to say alongside how worried I am but I'll try to be as clear as possible. 

I've had a difficult childhood like most and I hope people can understand I am the child that's hated, I've endured a significant amount of abuse growing up which has impacted my life severely. My parents planned my demise and I still in the process of trying to destroy my life, mum constantly insulted me and my biological family, her sons tormented me and dad pretended everything was fine or he didn't know what was happening to me, at the sametime he took part in other ways. 

I knew at the age of 18 I would need to move out immediately and so I did but I was still a dependent, I lack a significant amount of exposure due to the fact that I was very isolated growing up and I was also living in a new country and knew nothing about their customs. I tried going to college but the state would not assist me with financial aide because of my it declared me a dependent even though I  was not living with my parents, I begged them to help me go to school. At 25 I finally qualified, my second semester I was dropped by the school due to a error they made which I tried to have resolved but they refused to correct and the only way to fix it on my part was to pay the school a sum of money I didn't have. Well I just didn't know what to do and I tried moving one by doing vocational courses, I couldn't go to other colleges because the school refuses to release my transcript. At this point I'm going homeless and or living with strangers, eventually dangerous ones, again I begged ""my family"" to help, they ignored me, one of their sons told me to leave them alone and that I cause the family all this hurt and problems. My dad comes up with a ""solution"" and that he'll only help me if I get a psych evaluation done which I refuse as I'm aware as to what the intention is. 

I ended up pregnant and illegally arrested, while in jail there I got the psych evaluation, I knew this was my families doing so now they are ""helping"" me. I had a job and did everything to stay out of their way, I wasn't doing bad and was a little happy. I was making progress and headed in the right direction. Every single time I left for work or just left the house they, their sons or their friends ""needed"" to enter my room, my job was tipped based to they knew their was cash in there. This is when I start locking my door, I was told I'm not allowed to lock my door, eventually things started going missing. Six months into my job I was fired for no reason and and when I do get jobs people associated with my family show up and I'm fired again, my dad referred I spoke to someone and it turns out this person work for the government in welfare, this is the path they want me on and they know it's a path I would never take, my parents also recommend I go live in a trailer park. 

I spend everyday at home, when I have a interview I have to tell them because I need their help and I'm sure they are relaying what businesses I go to because now I'm never hired even-though I have past experience for the position I've applied to. I've been blacklisted for employment, in the midst of a number of cases. I'm in a really bad situation with noway out because I'm never going to get a job, I've sent my resume to so many places and have reapplied to the same place because it's been over a year.

625,"Hai. So, recently I've been trying to put my characteristics and behaviors on paper as I've been suspecting I might have some sort of mental / personality disorder. I've already been diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa, BED and PDD-NOS. Initially I self-diagnosed Kleptomania but that is drawn from an impulse that might relate to something else. Here's some of the characteristics I've listed (22F btw):

\- Extreme lack of desire for social interaction (PDD-NOS?)  
\- I am very much able to emphatise with others; I decide not to  
\- I often act on impulse, this impulse does not care about law  
\- Urges are often uncontrollable. If I want it one way, it has to be that way and will be on my mind until it goes my way (PDD-NOS?)  
\- I am very capable of having dignified relationships, other than my family I prefer not to have them.  
\- I engage in behaviors that put myself in danger out of boredom. IE going out to the forest at night, walking by coffeeshops (weed shops) at night (drug dealers often hang here)  
\- Recently there's been a crave for mental abuse. I did not understand until now that this is most likely out of boredom. Mentally I am increadibly strong, and I would like to be tested to see what it takes to break me. I like to be challenged.  
\- Most things are games to me in both good and bad ways. For example, there's a hot guy at school who fucked the ugliest, most problematic girl in my class. It'd be a game to try and break them up and get with this guy myself (I'm a dick, I know). On the other hand, most uni assignments are games to me, for which I try to seek the best solution.   
\- After a few months of feeling quite happy, I am starting to feel slightly down. Why? Boredom. I am not challenged mentally in any way, shape or form. I can entertain myself and absolutely do not mind being alone, but this is mentally way too easy for me.  
\- I get on with things asap and I seem to be able to do that faster than a normal person should be. My sister passed away in April this year. I cried a lot, complained about how unfair it was, got a tattoo to honor her, and then moved on. Crying and feeling sad isn't going to bring her back, so I am not willing to spend time on it.   
\- I am starting to actually lose understanding for others. I feel as if my way is the best way and look at others as if they're fools for doing otherwise. Not that I feel like I'm above everybody else, but I feel like I cracked a code to living life happily and laugh as others make life so difficult for themselves, especially when intentional.  
\- Due to my PDD-NOS, I am not an aggressive person in the slightest. However, I have been longing for an appropriate moment to verbally annihilate someone. I do not long to physically attack someone though.

At first I thought Antipersonality Disorder. However, I am not a compulsive liar and I don't trick or play people into getting what I want. Looking at the fact I seem to be losing the ability to understand and emphatise with others, I thought narcissist, but that doesn't seem to fit either. Would love some input.",24Sep2019,2

I said he liked me very much and saw each other almost 4 times a week. After a month, suddenly, he started being very busy and we didn’t saw each other for a week, after that week, he started talking to me like if we just met, I asked him what was wrong and he said that work and college were too complicated I tried to cheer him up and be comprehensive, but he changed, he barely talked to me and I thought I did something, when I asked him again what happened, he said that in that moment he wasn’t ready for a relationship, he had so much stuff going on and I deserved more attention that he could give me. I thought that all he was doing was giving me excuses, but I understood and tried to be there for him as a friend. I got tired when he was available in his social networks and with his friends but with me he was just not around. I stopped replying one of his texts and then we never talked. After a week, I found out he was dating someone else..

I have a boyfriend and we’ve been together 1 and a half years, my mum likes him and calls him part of the family but the past 6 months she’s been getting stricter and stricter. He’s never been allowed to sleep upstairs so we both sleep on the sofa when he’s round, now he can only stay on a Friday and Saturday because of school and work.  (I have 2 younger sisters one aged 6 and one is 13) she then decided he couldn’t stay on the weekends I had work and now she’s cutting down the time he visits me during the week so he has to leave earlier and earlier every night. If it was up to me I’d move out already but she’s treating me like a child, telling me what time I should be getting up and going to bed and controlling my adult relationship. We can’t stay or go round to his much because he has like 4 brothers and they share rooms. 
I’ve tried to approach the situation so many times but she doesn’t seem to understand that we want to see each other, and she’s limiting our time together because we can’t always fit around her schedule because we have our own stuff on. I’ve tried to tell her that she’s treating me similarly to my younger sisters. Am I being over dramatic?

631,"We are not kids but we still go to school, just so there are no misunderstandings.  
My best friend and I started talking to a girl last year because she really seemed like our type. At first it was great but then she started back talking my best friend to me. I turned it down pretty quickly but eventually told my best friend because I felt so bad since she might be back talking her to others too. Might even be back talking me too. I'm big on loyalty and honesty. We kind of got over it and gave her another chance without saying anything.  
Then we did group projects with her. It really became clear just how selfish and lazy she is. Like going to bed at 7-8 pm leaving us with tons of work due at midnight, and taking all of the easy questions. Also leaving us to correct her spelling because she is dyslexic. (She has a program that does this for her but she has told us she can't be bothered to boot it up.)

Yesterday we all went out for dinner with a guy friend. The whole trip to the restaurant I was not mentally present and turns out my best friend wasn't either. For 2 hours she complained about her family, how they back talk each other, how she could barely eat anything at dinners, how she is picky, then she went back to bitching about her grandma etc. It was just all negative. When we finally got our food she complained about the food. Then she said she cannot stand when people wear jogging pants in public and how she would be so ashamed if she did it. My best friend regularly wear those type of pants to school. The friend said ''oh, not you!'' then went on to complain. She has done this too with the type of nail polish I wear and something with my hair. Then she always says ''oh it doesn't count for you!'' but we all know that's a lie... I eventually interrupted her every time she talked during dinner and all it did was lift the mood completely.

Today we could barely look at her. We were so fed up with her negativity and low key insults.

What do we do? We are in the same class and my best friend and her have the same work space. She has no other friends than us. She has admitted to me she would kiss her friends boyfriend if they did the first move. This comment really turned me off. What can we do?

I tried myself to survive college but  now I'm struggling because I am one of the programmer in my thesis  group. I want to learn to program but i can't focus and don't understand  it.

I wanted to shift course  before but I'm always thinking that doing this will extend my college  year and it will cause a lot of money for my parents. My Father is a  technician and he is the only one who has a job in my family. He  doesn't want us to go work unless we finish our study. My Father is the  one who wanted me to get a computer related course and i dont want him  to be disappointed. Being the oldest among our siblings, the pressure  to me were very high because they expected me to be the breadwinner of  the family when my Father retired. I can't tell my parents that i don't like this course and wanted to  shift to the course i really wanted (Anthropology or History). My  Father will stop working this year or maybe next year so none will  support me in my college if i extend in college.

Do i need to tell my parents that i don't want to continue anymore and shift or will stick to the same course and learn how to code 'cause will be graduating soon?

634,"the other night, my boyfriend of almost 2 years and i went out with friends, had a good time, and both got very drunk. however, when we got home he started trying to have sex and i was feeling very tired and kind of sick and tried to push him off and say i didn’t want to. he didn’t listen to or acknowledge me and basically ended up trying to rape me and i had to scream at him and punch him until he finally left me alone. in the morning he didn’t remember any of it and when i told him, he was horrified and cried. he has never been anything but sweet, respectful, and caring before this but every time i look at him i want to cry and my skin crawls. i don’t think i want it to end and he says he will never drink again so there will never be a chance of him hurting me, but i’m still not sure what i want to do. should i break up with him? if i take him back am i just allowing someone to hurt me? and even if i do take him back, how do i trust him again and allow him to touch me?",24Sep2019,1
635,"This is my first post on Reddit ever, I don't know how to start...

There is this girl that was not in love but really obsessed with me, she was my friend but something really messed up is about to fuck not only the friendship but my life. 

We were really close friends, actually, I never realized she liked me or something like that even though my friends would keep on insisting she was. Like 3 weeks ago she offered to me to have a sleepover, I refused kindly but offered, instead, something like a private party with only the 2 of us. She was kind of disappointed but ended up accepting it. 

I went to her house, we played UNO and we listened to music, everything was cool as it was supposed to be. She opened a bottle of wine and we drank a little. We didn't have sex, though she jerked me off and I cummed in my boxer. But the problem started 1 week before that, she called me to tell me she thought she might be pregnant because she didn't menstruate when she should have. I advise her to go for a GCH Test, she did go and it turned out to be a solid negative.

But that's not the problem, she later ""found out"" that could have been a false negative, I knew she lied, but she kept on posting photos going to the hospital because she was feeling ill, she started talking like if there was a problem she must tell me but she doesn't want to because it is all hers now (?). I don't know what is happening, I think it is kind of revenge of her against me due to all the time I didn't see her as a possible girlfriend.

I don't know what to do, it is getting me more worried every day, I can't sleep, I can't concentrate, I can't eat. Can I do something like taking legal action, if I get to know that she has been acting the whole time faking a pregnancy and doing this emotional and psychological manipulation?",24Sep2019,1

Tldr; Pricing for baseball training for 3 kids (10, 9, 5) with either teenage girl or her dad.


Hello all who take the time to respond!


I'm looking for advice on pricing for training for my 3 kids. I work at a church with a wonderful young lady (we will call her Mary because why not) who plays softball and whose dad (who we will call him Joseph) used to play and now coaches her and her siblings. We chose to come to reddit for a fair price because we met through work and felt it would best to get an outside opinion for obvious reasons. Details are as follows:


I have 3 kids. 10M, 9M, and 5F.


They have a limited understanding of the game. We have allowed them (10m and 9m) to try out multiple sports to see what fits so they have played before but only a season here and there. 5f has not played at all.


We are hoping for suggestions on pricing for training with both Mary and Joseph. I was thinking of starting with Mary and ""graduating"" up to Joseph when necessary. Joseph owns a batting cage at his home so we will be training there and/or at a field. We plan for twice a week.


In case it matters, Joseph is a leftie and so is 10m and 5f.


Will take all responses into consideration when coming up with a plan. Thanks for your time!


Edit: Will add in Mary's age once I get it. I'm assuming that will play a role as well.",24Sep2019,1
638,"As the title suggests, I’m considering skipping my last day of work (today) at my part time job to finish homework.  I work 1 full-time and 1 part time job, and recently started a masters program online.  I don’t have time for all three, so I put in a months notice at my part time that I would be leaving.  

Today is my last scheduled day at my part time, but I also have homework I need to finish tonight.  I’d have less than three hours to finish it if I go to my last shift, so it would be a lot easier to not go to work and instead finish the homework.  The homework is worth a considerable amount of my grade.  

I’m not too concerned with burning bridges, as my part time (front desk at gym) has nothing to do with my full time and I likely won’t see those people again.

639,"Over the past week or two I've (23F) been experiencing quite severe anxiety. I am usually fairly level headed and do get stressed at college but I'm able to manage it. I am about to start at grad school and have doubts about doing it - I'm just so anxious and really miss my family and have felt generally upset and very anxious since returning. My ex is also in my friendship group and unavoidable but the relationship and where we stand has been left ambiguous and we still chat but I have no idea where we stand and I feel it is premature to ask since nothing has happened between us recently. This is giving me severe anxiety about having to potentially watch him hook up with other people, even though this is unreasonable of me. 

I would have a back up plan if I dropped out and I'm so afraid that my anxiety (which is currently diagnosed - should I seek a doctor?) is only going to ramp up as time goes on. I plan on doing a month of my grad program then re-evaluating but looking for advice/reassurance/suggestions on the best way to approach the entire situation. I would have to find someone to rent my room, try and get fees back etc etc. I feel out of control and unhappy with my circumstances/stage of life even though I am usually a happy person.

641,"Something really creepy happened today and I’m not sure if I should go to the police. This takes place in NYC. 

I left work and walked to Starbucks with my coworker and gave the barista my name for my drink (this is relevant). After getting our drinks, my coworker went back to work while I walked 5 min away to a cafe to get a pastry. A man walked in right behind me, I didn’t think much of it. I sat down at a table and he got a coffee and asked to sit at my table. Weird since others were open, but ok. 

He wasn’t facing me or talking to me. He was older, in his 50s I would say and wearing sunglasses indoors. He wasn’t on his phone. He was just sitting there, waiting. 

I silently sit there for a half hour then a plate of food is placed in front of my from the waitress. Confused, I get up. He says to me “that’s not yours?” And I say no. He ordered it for me. He then says “you’re xinveigled, right?” At this moment I realize I didn’t have my name on my Starbucks drink, I didn’t say my name in this cafe and I didn’t have any identification on me. 

I run out of the cafe and he follows me. I walk briskly back to work. Now, something that has happened by my building is a young man in his 20s coming up to me twice before asking for my name and I stupidly said it the first time. He asked what the good clubs were in the city since he was new, and I said I don’t go out. He asked if I wasn’t a local where I was from or if I was, then what neighborhood. I didn’t tell him and told him to F off. 

He wound up playing the same act to me a month later and I threatened to call the cops. He told me to relax and walked away. 

Do I file a police report? I don’t know the man from the cafe. I’m in my early 20s and this man had a thick European accent. He isn’t from my company. I have no idea who this man is or how he knows who I am and where I’d be.",24Sep2019,1

643,"So I am a 31yr old Muslim woman. The point of discussion is a 23yr old good friend of mine that I have known for about a year. 

Long story but, after we first met, we hung out a couple times and immediately realized that we both like each other however I have told him multiple times that I did come off a bad relationship last year (guy cheated) and I’m not really ready emotionally to date or be in a relationship with anybody. 

I also have a religious/cultural barrier which means if we were to get into a relationship and marry, since he is not a Muslim man, he would have to convert.

We had a brief history of kissing/making out etc but no sex due to my religion and culture (which he is fine with). 

I like him a lot but I told him I’m just not ready to date, plus my family might arrange for me to possibly (but not likely) meet someone to marry into my culture. If I do happen to be ready to go back into the dating world, I did tell him that he will be the first person I am going to go to. (I opened up to him about this one night) 

We usually hang out every weekend as friends with other friends but it seems he only likes it when just the two of us hangout. He also tells me it’s hard for him because he still has on going feelings for me and sometimes he gets jealous whenever I talk to other guys when they come up to me out at bars and stuff when we’re out with friends. One time we were all out with some other friends and he seen me talking to another guy that approached me at the bar and asked for a dance so he just left because he was upset and jealous but I forgave him because I understood his feelings.

My girlfriend wants to study Physics and will love to also go to any of those universities, as they are the world elite in her subject. I know that she is more than capable of applying for them.   
The problem is that she has anxiety and is so afraid of failing to get accepted, that she is not filing her application and time is closing up. I told her that I would only apply to MIT if she did, as it is way more away from Spain as it is Cambridge. But now I am regretting it, as I feel that I shouldn't cap myself for anyone.

650,"I graduated from college in 2016 knowing immediately I wanted to be a teacher. I began subbing and was to enroll in an elementary teaching program at my university in the beginning of 2017. I bought a car on a used loan for $4500. In the first week of classes, my car broke down and I charged about the same amount in repairs. I had to drop out because it broke my budget.

I decided at the same time that I wanted to be a High School English teacher, and got a second job to pay for pre-requisites and save for the program. I worked myself for two years to exhaustion. 

In October 2018, I had another car repair that cost me $600. I realized that the car I bought was going to sink me so I bought out the car loan, refinanced my debt, and then bought a new car so that I could be protected by a warranty.

I was rejected by my desired credential program in April 2019 and I was distraught. But when I was asked to challenge the admission decision, I realized that my financial situation was broken and that student loans would compact my financial situation. 

I have been looking for new jobs for 4-5 months. My financial situation limits what jobs I can take. My salary requirements are $50-60k. I have only had one job interview that could have met my requirements.

I am full of regrets. I graduated school when I was 23. I didn't anticipate this failure. I could have done so much different. I could have taught overseas for a year, bought a more affordable car. Now I am $14.7k in debt and 18k on a car loan. I am sensitive to all kinds of failures in my life, social and financial. I have worked so hard and now I am on the precipice of bankruptcy. I have suffered so much stress that I have a depressed and gloomy outlook about life.

The only way I see it getting better is if I find a better paying job and to clean up my financial situation. But I have a fat stack of regrets. I haven't travelled, haven't played music professionally, and I am not emotionally stable or fulfilled to have a girlfriend. 

I was thinking about declaring bankruptcy to get out the car loan, and then save and teach abroad in China. But declaring bankruptcy would ruin any financial endeavours of mine.

I am so depressed. I am so unfulfilled. I am becoming more painfully aware of time passing. I am becoming very envious of others, now younger people than me. My two brothers moved out in a short span, and I am still living at home with my Dad who has a live-in girlfriend. I don't see myself moving out ever.",24Sep2019,0
651,"Put it in a spoiler because of privacy, ánd because it's a lot of text.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!So, yesterday, this was the story:!&lt;

&gt;!4 months ago i met a very lovely girl during a musical event. She was a singer, i played the keys, we clicked and started talking. I added her on Facebook, asked for her number last month and we've been talking ever since. She sends hearts and kisses and all feels really nice.!&lt;

&gt;!We went to jamsessions 4 times but never really got to talk alot irl, because of well, loud music, making music, you get the point. But i did develop a small crush on her..!&lt;

&gt;!Now, yesterday i invited her to another jam which she went to and we talked a bit, made some music and i was actually feeling really well and i just couldn't keep my eyes off of her.!&lt;

&gt;!Anyway, she went home and a friend of mine said ""You really like her don't you? She seems to be interested in you as well... Why don't you ask her out for a drink?' So i did.. And an hour later she said ""yeah sure!"" So, i was very happy and felt great.!&lt;

&gt;!Today she messaged me with basically ""Hey, just wanted to make something clear but the drinks are purely as friends if it's considered by me, and i don't think that i'll ever see a relationship or something else between us, i don't see anything grow between us apart from us being friends""!&lt;

&gt;!So i told her that i initiated it as a date, and that i thought that we could maybe see if things could grow a certain way. Wasn't dumb thinking of me, right?!&lt;

&gt;!Anyway, she said that even though we have a massive click she said that we differ too much and that there's something that she feels which makes her know that we would never be relationship material and that she didn't know exactly why that is but that she will find that out if we hang out more.!&lt;

&gt;!So, now i'm sitting here, and i'm like... I'm still going to be friends with her, because she's awesome! But i just can't get over the fact that she said ""I don't see anything grow between us"" and ""I feel something that makes me say that we aren't going to be relationship material"" And well, her hearts and kisses? Those are just because that's the way she talks to good friends..!&lt;

&gt;!Today THIS is the story:!&lt;

&gt;!Talked some more with her and she said that she misses the attraction and that it's always her 1st impression with that that says if she likes someone or doesn't. And she said that her gut feeling about stuff is always right.!&lt;

&gt;!Now i'm the optimistic person in the story for once, and i'm like... Attraction can grow, right? I'm a pretty large guy, i'm 299 at 5'9 but i'm working on it and lose about 4 lbs a week. So, who knows that that 'll help ? And even if it's not based on looks, what if we see eachother more in a normal setting outside and things grow?... You know what i mean?!&lt;

&gt;!She also talked about her gut feeling and that that's always right, but i've seen people who went from, oh i don't like him/her to, we're starting to have feelings in a matter of months.!&lt;

&gt;!Now i'm gonna invest in our friendship, and eventhough she says that nothing probably will ever happen i'm gonna keep my door unlocked and we'll see where life will take us.!&lt;

&gt;!Because 4 years ago i confessed my love to another friend of mine, she said no, and for 2 years after that we were still pretty great friends, so you can't tell how life will go. I'm staying optimistic and again, take it as it comes, and i'm like, things can grow, you might not feel any attraction now, but what if we see eachother more often, right?!&lt;

652,"About a year ago I was out in East Texas assisting my brother in his move from the Bay Area in CA to a town out there. As it was a long road trip I brought my two little dogs with us. After doing a bunch of moving and setting stuff up, I went to feed my dogs, mistakenly in a room where my brothers pit bull was, though it was not getting fed. As it saw the little dogs eating, it went up to my Chihuahua, he growled at the pit, the pit snapped, and savagely attacked him. My brother pulled the pit off almost immediately but the damage was done. I grabbed the chihuahua and saw that the pit had fucked him up pretty bad as his little mouth was hella bleeding. I grabbed the keys to the rental, hopped in and took off into town to see if I could find an emergency vet or anything that could help at about 5am on a Sunday.

I wound up finding a vet that opened at 7am. When they opened they saw him and immediately took him into the back to assess the damage. A bit later they called me in and showed me that his lower maxillary (lower mouth bone of a dog) had been snapped like a twig, at least that's what I inferred seeing him move the bottom of his mouth while he was under the gas (front part of the lower half of the mouth could move separately). They put in a wire to suture it and hold it together so it could heal, and it has for sure. The vet told me I could give it about a month after returning and have it removed by a vet where I live, or I could just leave it in as it's just surgical wire if it doesn't bother him. 

When I got back I gave it the month and called the vet I usually go to so as to see how much it would be to remove. They quoted me over a thousand dollars to take it out. I left it in for a bit longer because honestly I just don't have that kind of money and the initial procedure itself cost me $350; I inquired with another vet and they quoted me about $850 to do it. With these prices, I called the vet in Texas to see what he thought about it and he seemed to think that thought they would have to put him under, those prices were a bit much for what he called ""a simple procedure"" and said, looking at what was done from the notes, they would charge $150 to take it out. When I brought this up to one of the vets, they just said it was cheaper because it was Texas, but they quoted a whole laundry list of expensive items so I don't know if I wholly believe that, though I know cost of doing business is cheaper in an area like that.

I guess I just don't know what to do. I don't think it bothers him too much so I could just leave it in, but it honestly just hurts my heart to think about it and what it must be like to live with a frickin wire under the tongue across the mouth, as well as the little end of it sticking out of a little piercing underneath the mouth. As I'm not made of money though, $850 sounds like a dauntingly high amount, especially when the vet who did it would take it out for $150, and they were super nice and professional, probably more so than any other vet I've dealt with in the Bay Area. I guess I start thinking about the cost of getting out to Texas with the dog, all in all it would probably wind up evening out to be pretty much the same price when all is said and done as trips can be expensive themselves, but I guess I could see my brother that way. I have considered maybe going the pet credit route or putting it on a credit card as I have good credit, but any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

This is a sort of push if you will. 
Here we go. So I (17 m) met this girl (16 f) in my school. I met her a few years back and at first I wasn’t really into her. Then in year 10 I sat next to her in my maths class. This was a turning point. At first I was making it awkward being annoying and stuff, soon I realised I was just being weird. Then I mentioned something that honestly made her attitude change. Her and I used to talk a lot every lesson and joke(sometimes flirtatiously). She honestly made maths way more bearable. It was towards the end of the year in which my feelings really developed. I started to think about her and was crushing. It seemed as though she felt the same. In year 11, I didn’t talk much to her at first ( not sitting next to her anymore and not really seeing her often). After a while I just started talking to her again here and there and just tried to connect again. I gave her some space and didn’t want to distract her as we were approaching GCSEs. I didn’t want to confess as I thought it might distract her. She is honestly so hard working and has a lot of same interests as me. She opted to stay in the sixth form whereas I Went to a college. I really like her and kind of want to tell her how I feel. I last talked to her on results day and we had a 10 min chat admits the chaos. Since the school gives students an email I have a way of contacting her but my email is now gone. 
Would it be weird if I were to contact her and tell her how I feel?

To start off im completely aware these would be two very different conversations. But i don’t practice enough or start conversations enough around my friends. Thus its a lot harder when you’re in a new environment to put yourself out there and get to know a stranger. 

Im one of those people who likes company and is good at not making silence awkward. It could be go read at a coffee shop. Or go sit by a lake. But others seem to have a need to fill the gap or space by conversation or activity. I dont know what to do in those situations. 

When i hangout with someone i know I struggle a lot more to start conversations with them since we have bonded time and answered questions already. This sounds bad but i feel like i know enough.

She would frequently show up to places I always hang out at, and we would never really talk but we both noticed each other, but I started doing better and everyone noticed.

Last Sunday (Sept 15th), she calls me. We talk for a little bit, she tells me that she worries about me and whatever and it was a nice conversation. Since then we've talked on the phone several times and we text all day long, just as friends. 

She drunk calls me Monday night (sept 16) and goes on about how she misses things about our relationship, she's hurt that ill never be hers again, she still loves me, and she didn't want to leave me, but had to do it. We talked it out and everything was cool. She also told me she's been checking on me through a close friend, and several times throughout the past 3 months she's wanted to reach out to me. Even kiss me one night we saw each other at the club.

I spoke to my friend who said that she had her moments, she would cry like I would after we would see each other and what not, and apparently she hasn't been doing so hot either.

Tuesday (sept 17) she calls and says that we shouldn't talk because its a bad idea and one of us is gonna get hurt, I say okay and we stop talking. This got to me hard and I ended up sending her a long message about my feelings and what not. We end up talking again. 

She calls me that same night and tells me that ""She misses a lot of things, but just needs me as her best friend again. She didn't want to give me any false hope, but she doesn't know what the future holds for us"" this hurt but I understood. Everything was cool and we continue to talk as normal.

I get drunk Friday night (Sept 20) and she calls me to talk. We talk about music and stuff, dates we went on since the break up and how they were just boring and dull. out of nowhere, or maybe not I was drunk hard to remember, she just says ""Im not ready for us to try again right now"" I told her that I never expected it and I enjoy talking to her and being her friend, but I still love her so there's always something else there for me. She seemed to ignore it and said we would talk about it another time. We still haven't.

I don't know what to do, I'm sorry this is long but I just need some outside advice, maybe from someone who has been in my position. I love this girl with my whole being and I just don't know how to interpret all these signs and signals, or if I should just stop talking to her right now. If you need anymore information let me know and ill try and get you what you need. I will try my best to heed what y'all have to say, but i'm pretty stubborn haha. Thank you in advance!",24Sep2019,1

667,"Advice/Kind of a rant. I have been at my company for over 7 years. My boss hired his wife to take care of the front office. I work on the back doing the production of our products. At least 3 times a week, she comes back and starts complaining to me about her husband. All of them do not have to do with work, it can be from a fight they had, to thing that happen over the weekend. She is extremely annoying, like super loud. I am a loner type, soft spoken, hate loud noises, if Im at work I like to concentrate on it and do it alone. I havent hired anyone in the time I have been here because of that reason, I dont like putting up with peoples problems or small talk. Her being the bosses wife, I dont want to get mad at her or be rude, how can I stop this? I just want to stop hearing her complain to me and be so freaking loud!

I have gone to the point now that I dont even look at her, I just stay glued to my screen and hope she gets the message, I just nod and say hmm when she talks. I have to wear my headphones when she talks because she gets so loud. It has affected me so much that I now hate coming into work because I dont even want to hear her.

Silently she was about to bite and I said ""Oh what has happaned to your diet."" She started laying it down and crying and saying ""I'm fat"".

670,"So I am a 31yr old Muslim woman. The point of discussion is a 23yr old good friend of mine that I have known for about a year. 

Long story but, after we first met, we hung out a couple times and immediately realized that we both like each other however I have told him multiple times that I did come off a bad relationship last year (guy cheated) and I’m not really ready emotionally to date or be in a relationship with anybody. 

I also have a religious/cultural barrier which means if we were to get into a relationship and marry, since he is not a Muslim man, he would have to convert.

We had a brief history of kissing/making out etc but no sex due to my religion and culture (which he is fine with). 

I like him a lot but I told him I’m just not ready to date, plus my family might arrange for me to possibly (but not likely) meet someone to marry into my culture. If I do happen to be ready to go back into the dating world, I did tell him that he will be the first person I am going to go to. (I opened up to him about this one night) 

We usually hang out every weekend as friends with other friends but it seems he only likes it when just the two of us hangout. He also tells me it’s hard for him because he still has on going feelings for me and sometimes he gets jealous whenever I talk to other guys when they come up to me out at bars and stuff when we’re out with friends. One time we were all out with some other friends and he seen me talking to another guy that approached me at the bar and asked for a dance so he just left because he was upset and jealous but I forgave him because I understood his feelings. 

I would honestly rather be friends with him because if we were to actually date and it never works out, I would lose him forever and he’s a good enough person that I would never want to lose. I told him that as well but his feelings just grow stronger.

Broke up with me a few days ago and I don’t really know how to deal. He suffers depression and so do I, but I thought no matter how hard it was we’d always push through together. He would take care of me on days I couldn’t and care for me with all the love in the world, but I was depressed. I stopped dressing up and was too poor to give gifts, but I’ve never stopped loving him. I would do anything for him. I doubt he knows that. I don’t think he knows how much I love him and would do for him.  I’d support him til the ends of the earth. He could hit me with a million snow balls and I’d still be so happy. I can’t do much but I do what I can. I’m here to send him memes, he has a YouTube channel and every time he posts a video I will put my phone on loop to make him feel he gets views, I support the businesses he does,  I write him letters, I’ve kept everything he’s given me since the start of our relationship in a special box to be sure it doesn’t get crushed. I try to tell him daily how wonderful he is but it’s never going to be enough. I miss him. I want my best friend back. I’ve lost everything and now I’m losing him. I hope he knows I’m here for him. We both have suffered. I just never thought it’d end like this. My house and car are in shambles, and my life is too. He broke up with me out of nowhere. He said that the stress we both have is too much on us and he thinks if our relationship keeps going that we won’t even be friends anymore. He want us to be friends, but he won’t really tell me exactly why we broke up and when I ask he says he’s not ready to say. I’ll wait for him though. He probably doesn’t think that. But I’ll wait for him. Because I love him. He wants to be friends and I’ll try. All I want is to see him happy. If he’s happy without me I’m just glad he’s happy. I hope he finds his happiness. I love him dearly.  I love him so much I’m venting to reddit about it. I guess I hope one day he’ll see I’m here for him and he’s not alone and that I will accept him for who he is always. I’m heart broken, but something doesn’t feel right about getting randomly broken up with over text. I’m devastated. But I still feel the need to smile to be sure he’s okay with everything still I guess. I hope he knows I love him. But yeah I guess that’s that.

Well, my wife's race went well and the following day she went in for her appointment.  Afterwards I asked her how it went and she seemed hesitant to tell me.  After some coaxing, she told me that it wasn’t really a massage for athletes (as I expected).  But it seemed to be an assessment to determine what they could do to help with her body mechanics.  This was also followed by a fairly aggressive sales pitch for further ""treatment"".  This was not what I had in mind when purchasing the session for her.  I had paid $130 up front for this session and now I'm feeling a bit swindled.  I'd like to call them and express my displeasure in what I expected vs. what was performed.

From last year onwards, I've been preparing to study abroad and earlier this year I decided to pursue my future studies in Germany.

GMAT Score of 650. 

Haven't given IELTS as of yet, but I'm confident I'll get at least 7.0 

I've joined a German language institute and hopefully will have a B1 level certificate by January 2020. 

I'm hoping to get into an English taught Masters program. 

I am considering Universities such as: WHU, HHL Leipzig or Frankfurt School of Business (I'm sure there are better universities or in the same ballpark I just know these ones as of now).

I am planning for the 2020 intake, but now I feel like it's not enough and that I should wait 1 more year. I feel like I should get a C1 level certificate in German to help in employment opportunities later on and I could for go a higher GMAT score, but I'd have to join a coaching institute, which I can't afford right now. I just have a bit of hope since my profile passes the bare minimum that one need to apply for a Master program.

678,"So today one of my colleagues was working from home and sent a WhatsApp message about me to a group chat I was in by what I assume was a mistake.

Another colleague even replied (while sat next to me) and the first colleague replied a literal page long message about me which the other colleague replied to again.

It was about my mental health and had some personal details in, which I had only told 2 out of 4 of the other people in the group chat, one being my manager.

Not only was I upset she felt the need to gossip about me in this way, she also sent a message containing what I would consider private/sensitive information about myself to somebody else we work with who I am not close with and wouldn’t have told this information. 

At first I was in disbelief at what I was reading... while sat at my desk surrounded by everyone else in the group chat. I didn’t fully take in what she had said and when I went to read it again an hour later she had deleted the long message but the other 3 were still there, so I’m assuming she knows what she did and everybody else does too. 

She came in on the afternoon and I completely blanked her and made excuses to leave my desk when other people weren’t around so we weren’t left alone. I was noticeably upset for the rest of the day but none of the coworkers in the group chat mentioned it. 

I need advice on how to handle this next. I’m not a very confrontational person and worry that if I bring it up it’s going to seem dramatic - but I am really upset and can’t face going in and sitting with everybody like nothing happened.",24Sep2019,2

we were supposed to be leaving today — however we were lead to believe that both case managers that we have in our current state and the next were handling everything in regards to applications for housing, etc. 

so i spoke with my partner and explained to him that if i go with him we really need to have two separate rooms, of our own. since we aren’t married i would just really prefer if we did not. and honestly? this accident happened in the very beginning of our relationship and it has just grown cold — which i totally get and it’s okay im patient? but we just have not been apart of each other’s intimate lives like that 24/7 as he moved back in with his parents, and me with mine since his accident and i’m just freaked out at the fact that 100% of my life will now have to be shared with him and i will have no space of my own to retire to or have my moments. 

i tried to find places that were 2 bedrooms that were within our budget yet his insurance put us some place where the ONE bedroom is outside of the budget that they have given us. if his mother/sisters or anyone ELSE went with him, would the insurance company expect them to share one room? i do not want to sound entitled and maybe i shouldn’t go but this new situation is giving my anxiety hell. any advice would be greatly appreciated.",24Sep2019,1

I will try to make this short!


I am trying to decide if I should look for a new job or just deal with the one I have.  I've been at this job for 6 months. I liked it at first but now....not so much. It's an office job.


Here's why I don't like it:


-Super high turnover, so you are constantly dealing with teaching new people things. At least 2 people have quit per month since I've been here. It also makes our clients angry because they are constantly being given a new person to work with.

-Because of the bad training, my coworkers don't really know how to do their jobs. I constantly have to help them and correct their mistakes. Also because of bad training, customers are frequently given incorrect information and sent around multiple different people, which makes them angry.

-For whatever reason I have been given a bigger workload than everyone else in my department and also given all the ""difficult"" customers. As a result, I end up really stressed out. Workload is also super high in general. Tasks literally never end, it's actually impossible to get everything done.

-Training did not prepare me. I felt like I was just thrown in to a fire when ""training"" ended. I had to teach myself what to do.

-only 3 sick days per year. 10 days of PTO. When natural disasters happen, they use our PTO to cover it. Same with power outages. You can't take it unpaid either and have to work extra hours to make up the time if you have no PTO during emergencies.

-Cares more about the money than the customer. Regularly calls customers stupid, crazy, idiots etc behind their backs for asking questions that we are paid to answer. MANAGERS do this daily.  Really pushy anti-cancelling tactics too.

- Major ""us vs them"" mentality. Never ever emphathizes with the customer. Blames them for everything behind their backs.

-Extremely clique-y, it's very hard to feel like you ""fit in"". You try, but coworkers will exclude you. 

-Coworkers do not take responsibility for tasks. I end up needing to do almost everything.

-Raises are not given. If you stay in the same dept, you are there at the same level of pay for life.


Mostly though, I am insanely depressed; worse than I've ever been. It's getting really bad and is only getting worse, to the point where I don't want to wake up.


I am thinking of finding a new job but I'm afraid quitting so soon (6 months) will ruin my work history. I need to put it on my resume though because the skills I used will be useful for other jobs. My work history is other wise great; my last 2 jobs I stuck with for 4 years each. I am considering taking a job that is less ""skilled"" just to get out, but unsure if that's a good call. But my mental health is struggling badly.


What would you do in my situation? What do you think?

Thank you.",24Sep2019,1
689,"Long post sorry! So I am in my senior year at my university for undergrad, and they are suddenly changing policies that aren't the most beneficial in my opinion. One of the policies they changed for the whole department for my major, is that professors are no longer allowed to give out study guides. They told us that instead, they will be having a review day. However, none of my professors are actually doing that. So far, all of my professors have said something along the lines of  ""just look at your powerpoints"". The issue is, is that they have 50+ slides for each chapter and we usually go through 3-4 chapters per exam. I also have some pretty bad test anxiety, and having a study guide helped me focus. Without it, my brain kind of goes haywire and I try to study every little thing, and I constantly have a feeling of dread because I am afraid that what I focus on, will not even be on the exam. I know that not every professor, in every program gives study guides, and so I don't want to just seem like I am complaining but it is difficult to be in a program where you practically live by your study guides and then suddenly lose them. This isn't the only thing though. They also took away some extra credit opportunities, and they are changing a lot of paperwork (I am in a human services field). My professors are constantly changing due dates, and its very difficult to actually know what is due when. I have also had issues communicating with the professors because they leave as soon as class is done, and it takes them at least 24 hrs to respond to an email. They also keep their office doors shut and it makes me feel like they don't want to talk to anyone. Is there anyone I could go to, to address these problems? Or do you have any advice for getting around them?

691,"Hi reddit, I want a piece of advice this thing:  
I'm an Italian 18-years old, and in about a year I'll graduate High School, and then decide what to do with my future. When I was 16, I started to evaluate the idea of joining the Military Academy, and graduate as a Military Officer. Now, after thinking of that option for those few years, I think it should be the best action.  
But, there's a problem, the Military is badly seen in Italy, mainly for the following reasons (Of course, I can't speak for every Italian, but this is the common view in my town, and especially my family):  
1) Conscription was a thing in Italy until the 80s, and many in my family had a rather bad experience. (Including my father)  
2) Since after WW2, a big portion of the population did not have a good opinion of the military, and that opinion still lives out to this day.  
3) After Italy's capitulation in WW2, the area where I lived went under nazi occupation until early 1945 (I live in Veneto), and my paternal grandparent owning just a small piece of land, and living off that, they were disturbed by troops many times.  
4) Before Italy's capitulation, my paternal grandfather sarved in the Army too, and went to fight in Russia, and it was rather harsh for him. (By the few info about him during the years, he may have been near Stalingrad, but not sure, as he died before my birth, and my family doesn't know a lot).  
Combining all of those things, my family may not take all of this well, especially my paternal grandmother, which is currently close to 96 years old, and lived personally everything I said.  
I'll surely won't drop my plans to become an Officer in the Army, I just need an advice to tell them this news in the best way possible, considering the situation.  
They asked me many times what are my plans for the future, but I always answered very vaguely, but I think they're already suspect that I have already decided, but won't tell them.

693,"I'll try to be as brief as possible...

My father died when I was 10 and my mother remarried very soon after. She didn't believe me when I spoke up about his inappropriate behaviour toward me, which continued until I was 21 because he shot himself after his brother approached him about it. He miraculously survived that, and over the past twenty years, our relationship has been awkward, but without any residual anger.

My relationship with my mother has always been pretty much nonexistent. We rarely ever speak to or see each other. When I was in the hospital with illness that was nearly fatal, she didn't even call me.

When my stepfather was dying, I heard about it through Facebook because my aunt posted about it. My mother never called to tell me about it. I literally could not be the furthest name on her list of important people to call, as she called all my aunts and uncles and sisters, but didn't even take a moment to send me so much as a text message.

When the end was coming and the doctor told her to call her children, she waited two days before asking someone else to call me to ""touch base"". Not even to ask me to come ... just to let me know what's happening.

So, now I'm feeling like there's no point in going to the funeral. I don't have the money for the trip to begin with, and I don't honestly want to be around the family. I don't see the need to be there to ""honour him"", since he's gone - it doesn't matter to him.

696,"I've been slowly becoming a more and more toxic person, to the point I finally realized I need to clean up my act and admitting the ways I'd been dealing with things haven't been working. I've just been becoming very mean and having little patience. 

A problem I don't know how to solve is I feel ashamed of how I've acted and become. At times I feel like I don't want to work to be better because being better would mean admitting how terrible I've become.

We were suppose to today but they invited there friend because he wanted her to get out of the house.

700,"Hello All! I really hope you can help me on this one. 

I started working with this girl. I met her one day, she was amazing, she was cute, funny, and an awesome person in general. I got her snapchat and began texting her through out the week. I immediately was attracted to her, and this was the first time I had connected with someone like her and had feelings this strong for someone after meeting them for the first time. What I hadn't known was that she had a boyfriend of 8 months. She broke up with him halfway through the week, and when I saw her at work again, we talked a lot and then hung out afterwards. I kissed her, and she was totally ok with it. She kept giving me tons of hugs. There was one longer kiss and two quick ones. 

Now, the issue starts Sunday. She asked to take stuff more slowly and if we could still be friends but wait a while as she had just gone through a breakup. I respected that and told her of course I would respect that. Later, I found out through one of my friends that she had gotten back together with her boyfriend. Of course, I respected this. 

Now. On Monday night (last night). Her boyfriend messaged me on instagram and got mad at me for kissing her. Apparently I had forced it onto her and that they were on a ""break"". I did not force anything first of all, I always make sure stuff is ok before I do it. Second of all, if I had known they were on a break, I would not have kissed her as I am respectful of other peoples relationships. I told him all this and he seemed pretty understanding. He told me he was sad and that if I were to kiss her again, he would not be happy. I promised not to do anything.

I talked to the girl, and she still wanted to be friends, and told me to stop texting the boyfriend, which I did. Today (Tuesday) she blocked my snapchat, but I don't think it was her. The boyfriend also blocked me on instagram. I asked around and apparently the BF is very controlling and keeps the girl away from her friends. I texted her and asked why she unblocked me, and if she doesn't want to talk to me that's ok and I'll understand. She just said ""alright""

I have decided I'm not going to text her or try to talk to her. I want to be friends with her as she is an amazing person, and I don't want things to be awkward at work as I am going to be seeing her every weekend. How should I approach this?",24Sep2019,1
701,"Hey all, thanks for taking the time to read my post, I really need some advice and I'm not really sure where to turn.

I go to a very good school in the Boston area and I'm pursuing my BFA in studio art. This immediately sounds dumb, I know, but the reason I'm pursuing such a major is because it's a good route into the fine art world, which is what I want to do. I adore critical art theory, adore writing lengthy essays, and my professors have always enjoyed my work. I;m aiming to get a PhD and become an art curator - I'm well aware of the workload it requires. I didn't want to do anything else because I'm bad at higher level mathematics and was taught growing up to pursue your dreams veraciously, so I'd prefer not to get advice along the lines of chastising me for that, I've already heard every version of it. I've made my bed and have to sleep in it.

But life threw something into the mix, which was expected of course, but still unfortunate. My family is not wealthy, but was always able to be self-supportive; during school I've had to pick up multiple jobs to support living in the Boston area, and unfortunately that's affected my GPA, but I've still been pretty successful the last few years. Luckily I am not in credit debt, but my funds are dwindling. I took my previous semester off because my father suddenly had host of medical problems: ketoacidosis, a heart attack, late stage cancer diagnosis, and a stroke which left him paralyzed. We had a lot of medical costs, and thankfully we had a GoFundMe that was very helpful, but now my parents might lose the house. He was a master electrician, and I worked with him all the time to support his business (in which he was sole employee) and earn some income during the summers. My mother never went to school, and struggles with alcoholism, and they are both now on food stamps and medicare. I cannot rely on my family as a backup when money gets low, which I rarely did in the first place except in dire need and only on a loan-type basis, and I have little assets to work off of currently. I also have a sister who is horrible with money and often comes to me or my parent for help.

I'm currently taking an economics class which discusses income of creative industry careers, and visual artists get an absolutely minuscule average income due to the ""winner take all"" market there is. I'm quite good at taking pictures and videos, I've won awards and people have bought my work - several Guggenheim fellows have complimented me and I have close relationships with them - but I don't even own my own camera because I had to sell my old one to buy food. If I graduate with just a BFA in art, with the loans I have and the cost of living that exists, I'll probably end up in a labor position (no shade on that, I have my electrician's license) or the service industry, which honestly would destroy me. It's already been extremely difficult getting loan approval, and I can no longer turn to my family when something unexpected comes up. I worry that one wrong turn will leave me stuck at home with my family, undoing all my hard work.

I was in the top of my class in high school, high honors and recognition across the board, and have been working nonstop with little sleep for the past 8 years to get where I am. I'm starting to feel like I went down a path expecting the best and putting in over 100%, and am now stuck in a hole with the worst. There's things like career counseling and financial counseling at my school, which I'm in the process of utilizing.

I don't talk to people about this because they often just treat it like a sob story, when really it's just the truth of the situation; I'm very strong about it and just need advice on how to push through - but no one at my school can relate because they all come from middle or upper-class families and they give me the ""ew he's poor + had bad stuff happen"" treatment (many of my ""friends"" have lost touch after all this has happened, even though it rarely comes up). I still have 2 years of school left, so I'm hoping I can figure out a plan ASAP, but I have this inescapable feeling that everyone else is having a much more positive experience at school, and I'll never be able to get these years back or succeed the way I've wanted to.

tldr; Essentially, I'd like advice from people who have experienced getting a graduate-level degree on an extremely low budget, and advice on what to do when your entire support system bottoms out from under you.

Thank you for any and all responses, I hope you all have a lovely day and I appreciate you taking the time to help.",24Sep2019,2

704,"One year ago, my husband’s mother was diagnosed with psychosis. Under her care she had her then 14 year old who had stopped going to school and who stayed in his room all day playing video games and eating fast food. He got up to 350 lbs. He had stopped going to school half a year before her diagnosis. My husband and I decided to bring him to live with us despite my hesitation due to us already living crowded (2 bedroom small condo with 2 children of our own) and our plates already being full with one child who has health issues. I was truly worried of bringing another child into our home, and I expressed this to my husband at that time. My husband told me that his brother needed him and that if I made him choose between him and his brother, he would choose his brother. I cleared out our son’s room of their belongings and gave my husband the green light. In that time, I have dedicated my time to getting him enrolled back into school and making sure he was doing his best (ended the year with straight A’s), feeding him healthy meals (lost over 100 lbs while working closely with our pediatrician), and making sure he was getting exercise during the day. He has started high school and is doing well. None of this has been easy on myself or my marriage.  At times, I felt like I was the only adult in the home setting guidelines and I was alone in making sure the rules were followed. There were plenty of times where I wanted to throw in the towel. I forced chores, cleanliness, and manners where there were none. I did the best I could. My brother in law did the best he could. I am proud of the work we both accomplished. Their mother is fully recovered now. Isn’t taking medicine for the psychosis and is back to normal. She was able to get on disability and is mostly home all day entertaining guests (she lives at her mother’s home where family drops by unannounced daily). As I sit here today, after a week of inner struggle, I told my husband that I will no longer sacrifice my sanity in my home when his mother is capable of caring for her son. The room he is using is necessary space that we need. Currently, we sleep in one room with our two children. My children are 7 and 3 and I do not feel comfortable with them sharing a room with a teenager. Currently, at his mother’s house, another family is living there with teenagers who haven’t made the best decisions. My husband worries that his brother will make the same mistakes as them. I told him that we are not sending him back to his mother’s home and not communicating with him anymore. I have access to his school records online and can see when he is late/absent. We can address bad choices if they arise. But I am at the point where I need my home back. I need my sanity back. I spoke to my father today who reassured me that I have done all I could and that I have a room in his home if my husband stands to his word of choosing his brother over our marriage. I told my husband he has two weeks to send his brother back to his mother’s home (10 minutes away) or I will leave with our children. Advice on my decision to vocalize this would be great. Thank you.",24Sep2019,4
705,"20F, I moved out of a toxic household and into a friend’s house. I pay rent for a room and I have been doing my best to be a quiet, clean, and reasonable tenant. I’m close to my friend’s parents but it’s their sister (the aunt) who has been giving me trouble.

I can only imagine she despises me because she’s very territorial. She’s an older, retired woman and has been finding every little thing to target towards me. I tend to keep to myself but I will say “Good morning” or “How are you?” And she will always ignore me even if she knows I’m speaking to her. Fine, sure, that’s fine ignore me. So I just don’t say much. 

I wash my clothes at night when no one else does it to make sure I’m not bothering anyone, and she would get up and stop my wash cycle leaving my clothes wet until I found out. 

She talks shit about me with other family members, but is never confrontational with me. It annoys me that she’s using other people to create issues with me than just speaking with me directly. When I’m home she slams the door near me to scare my cats and blasts music towards my door. There is a garage bathroom that she declares is hers, so yeah I respect it and I never use it to shower or anything. The most I did was wash my hands and she complained I wasted her water. (She pays rent too so I don’t know what the issue is.)

I am in a lesbian relationship with my girlfriend and she has been rude to her when she comes over. She hates my cats and constantly antagonizes them. She complains about me a lot to the family but I haven’t done anything and they agree. She antagonizes my cats and complains over every trivial thing. Like my trash takes up space in the trash bin, or my car is in front of their house on the street and she doesn’t like it.

This place is nice and I’m getting a good deal on rent so I can’t just move out. I’m gonna have to stick with it for the time being. It’s exhausting to deal with someone petty and to be targeted. Any advice how I’m suppose to deal with her? I keep to myself and generally mind my own business but lately she has been targeting me over everything.",24Sep2019,2

710,"Just a heads up this may have some bad grammar I’m on mobile.

Hi, so... I’m 17 and ever since my mother lost her job when I was in 3rd grade she has made it her life to “help” me in school and stick her nose into every little thing that happens at my school. She even goes on my school email and sends teachers emails asking questions that make me look like an idiot and and I know that these teachers don’t like being bothered by constant emails. She was a publisher so she was good with writing essays and proofreading them. So as you may have guessed she “helps” me with every single one of my essays and doesn’t let me do them myself or submit anything without her input. She prints out massive packets or quiz questions for me to study every time I have a test or quiz. And if I say that I know the topic very well, I’m the best in my class with the subject (which I have been in most of my classes), and I don’t think I need to review anymore she raises hell and starts WWIII. In these cases she calls my dad to try to have him double team me and pressure me into listening to her because she thinks that I always listen to him and don’t listen to her to spite her. My dad also has a minor drinking problem so if she calls him he comes home in a bad mood when he’s drunk and starts yelling and making comments and then she puts blame on me and acts like the victim. My dad knows that she may actually be crazy or something and is trying to get her to let up on me, give me some space, leave me alone, etc. but that never really works. She drives me to school and is the most nervous driver I’ve ever seen. As a result she waits around my school for me to get out everyday instead of going home and coming back to drive me home.

724,"I’m a junior in college and at the beginning of the year I started working as a keyholder in a store in my local mall. I left my old crappy retail job for this once since the pay was significantly higher. Last semester I was only a part time student due to some mental health issues, so working on top of the few classes I was taking didn’t seem like too much. Over the summer I was working constantly, something I regret now since it kept me from taking the time to work on my depression and anxiety like I should have. Now I’m taking a full course load again, and for the first couple weeks it was fine. I’m guessing that’s because my classes hadn’t really begun in full force yet, because now it seems like I have to ask someone to cover my shift at least once a week so I actually have time to do my homework. I have assignments and projects I need to be working on daily and on the days I work that’s becoming impossible because I’m only scheduled for closing shifts. 

A few weeks ago I specifically told my boss that I had classes on Thursdays and can’t work those days. Despite that I have been scheduled to go to the mall immediately after class and stay until close for the last 3-4 Thursdays, and for the next month. This means my shift is only 4 hours as well, so I don’t get a meal break and by the time I’m back on campus all of the dining halls have closed. I don’t know how to bring this up without seeming like a high maintenance employee because I’ve already requested my hours to be cut. Every single one of my shifts for the last two weeks and for the next four weeks is closing, meaning I’ll be alone in the store on a weeknight when no one is there, but I’m not allowed to bring my computer or phone to work on assignments. I don’t get home till about 10, which means I have to pull all nighters to finish things by the morning. 

Honestly, I think working has contributed to my anxiety and depression over the past month or so because doing one requires me to not fully commit myself to the other. I like my coworkers and I like the pay, but other than that retail is an extremely miserable business to be in. Customers are constantly mean and management only cares about us making sure every customer that walks in the door spends $100, which is mostly impossible because a.) the product isn’t that good, and b.) no one shops there in the first place. Because of my scholarship at school I don’t have to worry about helping pay for tuition or housing, but I was trying to work so I could start building a resume and a savings account. Right now I’m leaning towards quitting for my sanity and for my grades’ sake. I’m friends with most of my coworkers and would miss seeing them, but that’s really the only reason I would want to stay. Retail has nothing to do with what I’d like to do for the rest of my life (not that there’s anything wrong with working retail, it just isn’t for me) and I’d prefer to start gathering more relevant work experience that will hopefully prepare me better for whatever I do post-graduation.

730,"So the title might be a little wrong and all and im srr for that but since i started in a new school. Ive been noticing that this guy from my class is kinda... Always talking more and more to me. He always hears what im talking about and always tries to answear or compliment about the stuff i say. Even if we sit far away he still always litsens to my conversations. He was sometime ago trying to annoy me by mocking my voice and tge way i talked. He was also super happy and started to laugh when we were in the same group for a school project. We dont have alot of stuff in common, and we kinda argue but he always smiles when he talks to me. Latley ive been noticing how much we make eye contact and that we always turn our heads around and always stare for like idk 6 seconds at each other and make eye contact. It happenes alot. We stare awkwardly at each other. Idk if im looking into it too much or if he might find me intresting. But im a real noob when it comes to relationship, in fact ive never even been in one and ive only had a crush on one person. But im a pro at being awkward and i just cant talk to people, i cant keep the convo going. Anyways is this signs of him showing intrest in me and if so how can i get him to like me?",24Sep2019,1
731,"      Quick back story, I've been dating this girl for ten(10) months, we went on a date Sunday and she was pretty distant immediately after I said I wasn't going to homecoming and she ignored me entirely from then up until mid day today(Tuesday), I obviously thought it was because of hoco but we talked today and she said we weren't hanging out/talking enough and it wasn't working out. (we are both very busy and most of the time schedules clash) but she never contacts me first or suggests dates. 

(We have had no problems up until this point at all so I found it odd that she was ready to end it all together) 

She has been talking to all our mutual friends about this since Sunday but only mentioned it to me today. I asked her if she wanted to work things out and have an actual schedule for dates and things or end things now, she said she was unsure, yet has been telling our friends she was going to end things today. I told i wouldn't contact her today and let her to think on it for a day and let me know tomorrow. I see this as her being pretty immature as I am pretty serious when it comes to dating, I'm not here for a playdate I'm here for a healthy working relationship. 

Essentially; she is unhappy because we don't get to hang out and talk as often as she would like, but she also never texts me first or suggests dates or anything.
And I am now unhappy seeing that her first instinct over a small and easily resolveable issue, is to break up.

The main pieces of advice I've been given are, 1: let her answer tomorrow and end it herself 
Or 2: give her the easy way out and end it now from my end.
I am looking for other options or more advice that does not stem from our mutual friend group.",24Sep2019,2

I was 18 at the time, a stupid, shallow kid who didn't know how to appreciate the good things in his life, i didn't realize what I had until I lost it, and i haven't been able to get her out of my head ever since, the regret and shame eat me from the inside every single day.
A few months after we broke up I tried to talk to her again, ask for forgiveness, needless to say, she doesnt wanna know anything about me, and i can't really blame her, so i figured it was just time to try and move on.

I started dating this other girl almost a year ago, see if I could forget about my ex and everything that happened, and my new gf is amazing. I've learned from my mistakes, I've been loyal and I've been trying to be better. 
But i keep thinking about my ex, about how I miss her, about what could have been.
So should I just break up with my current girlfriend and go after my ex? See if there's at least any chance she'll take me back? I don't want to hurt my current gf's feelings and i know she'll be devastated if I leave her, but is it really fair for her to be with an asshole who is thinking about someone else? I thought i could forget my ex and move on and be better and i like to think I've changed, I don't think I'm the same selfish stupid kid i was years ago, i just can't get her out of my head, and I've tried.
I dont know what to do, i dont want to keep hurting people, I'd just like a second chance, i feel so bad for my current gf she's wonderful and her love is true, she doesn't deserve any of this I thought I could move on and be with her, I didnt mean to drag her down with me, I didnt mean to put her in this situation.
Should I just die alone?",24Sep2019,2

She had then accused me of cheating and all of that, when she had no evidence, and once that got proven to her that I did not cheat. She became apologetic, and once again attached to me. Me and her are not really eachothers type in my eyes anymore, and I feel like I was blinded by my feelings when I wanted to get with her, and succeeded in doing so. However.

745,"14F here.  
  
I have a best friend group of me and two guys: one who I'll call Evan (15M), and one who I'll call Xander (14M).  
  
Xander and I go way back, and have been friends on and off since we met at school when we were 6 (about 8 years ago). Evan and I met more recently, almost four years ago (I was 11, he was 12 or 13). Xander and I have both been through a manipulative friendship (with the name person who I won't name) and we both came out differently. Combined with the fact that we have mental issues that make us stubborn, the fear we have of not wanting to be used again makes up both the stubborn leader type. This has lead to fallouts between us, lasting from days to months at a time. We always make up afterwards, but it really puts a strain on my already imperfect mental health.  
  
Evan and I, on the other hand, almost never fight. When we do, we make up almost immediately because it's probably for a stupid reason.  
  
He isn't nearly as stubborn and Xander and I. I'm NOT saying I use him as a doormat, I would never want to inflict that kind of pain on someone after going through it myself. He's just easier to get along with, and our interests are ever so slightly more similar.  
  
We see each other more often because he's on my bus, so we sit next to each other. We also pass each other more often in the hallways due to luck with the paths we have to take to get to our classes (Evan's a sophomore and I'm a freshman, and Xander is also a freshman). Evan has a unique way of thinking (he's naive and sometimes oblivious in social situations) but I've learned to understand how he thinks and how he reacts to things, and I believe it's brought us closer.  
  
Xander and I are the same in many ways, but that's also the death of us. I'd say we're both pretty mature for our age, and more aware of the world around us. We think the same way, but that's what leads to our fallouts. We currently just had a small fight because I asked him to do something I declined to do a month ago on the phone (but did two weeks ago). Nothing big and only requires a few taps, but he brought up how I didn't do it and it turned into a shitshow. I know we'll get past it but whenever we fight like this, even over small things, it hurts big.  
  
I want to know how to overcome this, as all three of us are great friends and I don't want this to keep happening?",24Sep2019,1
746,"Ive made this post many times without getting answers and I am desperate for help. 

My boyfriend is bulimic. He binge eats sweets and spicy foods and will make himself throw them up later. He looks unhealthily thin. He’s tired all the time and lays in front of a heater. He’s usually emotional and gets sad easily. He has cuts on the sides of his mouth and his jaw is often swollen. He complains of a sharp pain in his stomach all the time. His throat and tongue hurt which I assume is from stomach acid. His dentist also said his teeth are unbelievably worn down for his age and told him to stop drinking soda and grinding his teeth. He doesn’t do either of those things. 
Nobody knows he’s bulimic besides me and his mom. His mom is either in denial or chooses not to care. The only reason I know he has this problem is because I asked him about it once when he was feeling very ill and he finally broke down and admitted he has a problem and feels ashamed of himself. Because of that it’s a sensitive topic and we’ve only talked about it a few times since then and haven’t gotten very far. I can tell he’s embarrassed because he acts defensively so I try not to push or force the topic. The times I’ve asked him or questioned him if he’s thrown up he has lied or hidden the truth so I don’t think that’s a good approach. I just don’t know what to do. It’s a sensitive topic and I don’t know how to bring it up without him closing off. 
I know it’s selfish but the truth is this issue is tearing me apart. The downstairs bathroom (he doesn’t think I look in there) looks like a crime scene and I can’t help but go in there and be in awe. There’s vomit splattered everywhere, mouthwash and dirty towels. I do think he has a deep underlying issues surrounding body image that causes him to behave this way but I’m not sure what it is and he hasn’t talked to me about it. He makes comments that makes me think he spends a lot of time thinking about his body. I just don’t know what to do. He leaves the room and night and I get anxiety because I suspect he’s going to purge and I just feel so helpless like there’s nothing I can do to stop or help him. After I’ve noticed he’s thrown up I think about it for a long time afterwards and am very sad. I think my boyfriend has really normalized his habits because he will ask me why I’m sad and in no way correlate it with me knowing he was throwing up (atleast I think). 
His eating habits are very unusual and I can tell he has an unhealthy relationship with food. He binges and eats way too much at a time. He hordes food in his room. If I can’t finish a meal he “has” to eat it  “so it doesn’t go to waste”.
I don’t know what to do. He is unhealthy physically and emotionally, he’s hard to get along with because he’s so irritable and is just overall miserable. My heart breaks for him. But I just don’t know how to be there for him. I’ve tried things in the past that I don’t think have been productive. How can I help my boyfriend with something that is killing him but he can’t even talk about it? Please help all advice is appreciated. I don’t want to lose my boyfriend.

751,"She was so sweet, she had her faults but she was such a loving person. I tried to be too but I had my issues. We were each other’s best friend and unhealthily spent every day together isolating ourselves from other people because we loved being around each other. 

I was an asshole for some parts of the relationship. I want to die for hurting her and ruining it. I grew up with my parents calling each other names and they’d let it roll off their backs and be fine in two minutes. I didn’t realize it hurt her so much. I stopped after she talked to me about it. 

I was also controlling. She was self employed and needed to save $10k for an upcoming expense. I would just never want either of us to spend money and it got out of hand. She worked an hour from where we lived together. She worked everyday but Sunday and when she wanted to see her family on a Sunday I would get rude and suggest to see them when she’s already in the area so she doesn’t have to put miles on the car or risk an accident. 

I have really bad anxiety sometimes that flares up and I always worried about her driving so much. She had to walk on eggshells and I hate that. I was just so focused on the future and making sure we were good I didn’t take the time to make sure we were happy now. 

I lost my best friend and it feels like I’ll never find someone I loved as much as her again. Part of me wonders if she would’ve left anyway because she was saying we were too young for a relationship like that and it felt like we were married.

It was my first serious relationship (lived together for 2 years) and I learned a lot. I’m also in therapy trying to improve my issues. She hasn’t closed the door on trying again in the future but I know I have a long way to go before that’s a possibility.

I’m not gonna hurt myself but man, if this regret stays with me for a while idk what I’m gonna do. Does everyone deal with a bad breakup in their lives? It feels like I’m alone but I know that’s not true. Maybe in ruining something really great though",24Sep2019,5

754,"I am a lead manager at a game company. As such, I just recently filled a headcount for a position that reports to me.  


I have a friend who works in another department who became interested in the position and as such, scheduled internal interviews, tests, etc. Long story short, I felt he was qualified to take the full position, but leadership at the company argued for Associate instead of the full position.   


He accepted the position, but was kind of upset about the bait and switch (as I would have been)...So what I did was produced a 3-6 month promotion roadmap, where if he met certain conditions in a timeline, he would be promoted to the full position in 3-6 months. The agreement was approved by leadership.  


Fast forward to today. He was offered the FULL position that I got rejected for, but on another team in the company. I went to my boss and immedietely submitted the paperwork to have him promoted. I assumed  that because he was being offered that positon on another team, but at the same company, I could also argue to get him promoted on my team.  


I was rejected, and the explanation I was given was ""It's not that simple. It's very complicated, and X team makes a lot more money."" I pushed back and got all the way up to our CFO (who is going to have a discussion with HR to try and push for this promotion).  


Does this honestly make sense to anyone? The friend that I pulled over to my team is strongly considering switching to the new team due to the title upgrade. I don't really blame him, but I went through a ton of shit to pull him over. So I feel like I'm getting screwed here.

758,"I'm 17, almost 18 and come from a middle class family in the US. We aren't by any means poor but we aren't rich either. Just enough income from my dad's retirement money to pay the bills month by month for a decent house and all that.  

Anyway. I've been finding myself extremely stressed lately. Due to a long list of issues that happened between my sophomore and junior years, I haven't had much time to look into any college stuff until now. So now I'm having all these things I haven't done dumped on me at once, then being pressured to hold a job and go to school... I only work 3 or 4 days a week, but I just can't handle it. I've been very emotionally unstable because of the stress lately, and it doesn't help that I feel like I'm not good enough because other people hold 2 jobs, go to school and do other things. 

I know I'm not in a bad place- but I can't help but think that there just is not enough time in any given day to do what I want and need to do and it's making me want to rip my hair out. And I don't NEED this job... Right? 

My dad has had to borrow money from me occasionally because of one bill being late. He pays me back every time, but it makes me feel like they need me to work? I want to help but I just don't know if I can keep this up and still keep my GPA consistent...

Also, my mom's health isn't in the best place- it hasn't been since I was really young. I really want to be successful so she doesn't worry- but I also want to spend time with her while I can... I always overhear potential for her going back to the hospital and it just terrifies me- I've nearly lost her 3 times now...

My logic is that my current boss really likes me... So if we run into financial issues for one reason or another, getting a new job won't be hard at all. 

I just can't shake the feeling that quitting to help my mental health and give myself room to work on my future may be selfish in some way...

Here are some of what my family told me:
1. If I were to get trouble with the law, people are going to dig deep into my medical records and use my results against me.
2. It'll be harder for me to get a job in the future.
3. Being clinically depressed will interfere with getting visas and applying for permanent residency.

So my (22f) bf (24m) ex contacted me. 
I know who she is from what I've heard from other people (not good things) though we've never met, though she has seemed to always know who I am. 
A few months ago she reached out to me on social media, warning me that my bf is a violent, entitled abusive rapist (of several girls) who is only interested in me for my emotional vulnerability and how easily manipulated I am, and that I need to leave him. 
I didn't know what to believe so I just ignored the message and blocked her. This might make me sound bad but I remembered everything I've heard about her and put it to the back of my mind. I mentioned it to my bf, not what she had said but that she contacted me about him, and he didn't want to hear it. 

However, recently my mental health has been very bad. I live with depression and AvPD, and my anxiety has been through the roof to the point I'm on sleep medication now bc I wasn't sleeping. 
I've been going over the messages she sent me repeatedly, and sometimes it's all I can think about. I wonder if he did any of the things she said he did, though I honestly don't think he did. I was raped 2 years ago and while it's a very private matter and something I haven't come to terms with, my bf does know about it and has been nothing but supportive with everything that sexual trauma brings. 

Should I reach out to the ex? Just to explain my side and experiences? 
I really am clueless about what to do, and it's really starting to affect me. 
I go from wanting to ignore it completely, to confronting him about it, to confronting her about it.

I missed my college years not by choice and became homeless. I never had the chance to make friends or learn how to properly speak to women. Since the age of turning 15 I have literally worked my ass off for every piece of education I have in my mind, the very little things I have physically, to cleanse and process my emotions myself, to stay alive and to now being on the verge of what I feel is like I'm going to be very successful in the very near future with the years I have put into my work, in a way, and the countless 24 hours a day routine for the last year straight, and not going out what so ever.

I am not crazy. I'm a man with a goal, and willing enough to force changes upon myself that need to be made but let me tell you that I feel weird that I don't know how to properly meet and make friends, or how to properly speak to a women to properly further the conversation or even understand all of the main concepts that go into interpersonal relationships.

I have worked so hard. The only thing I really do know is my skills, and the fact that inside I feel extremely alone, vulnerable, scared, anxious kinda and unsure of what to do because in reality I have absolutely nothing by my thoughts and future career. Thats it.

I'm scared because I also am petrified to not only approach women, but to speak to them, to let down any of my automatic defenses and to try and sell a good reason why someone, sadly, would ever want someone who's been through so much, rather than just a regular guy.

There is an opening for a graduate software engineer within a different division of my company.

I want to learn more details about that role from people in the company. Ask them if they would consider my application and what would be the best way to apply to the role (internally or typical external application). 

I don't want to ask my managers as I have not told them I am not happy at my current position. It could take up to a year to move somewhere else.

What do you think is the best approach?
Should I contact the HR manager of the role?
I want to have a chat with the senior engineers that will interview for that role but I have no clue who they are.

Did you make similar move? How did you make it happen?

795,"About me: 27, CA, Female, Single

Back in September 2018, I needed a place to crash while I figured out my next living situation, and my best friend generously let me crash with her and her boyfriend in their 2 bedroom. They loved me and encouraged me (practically hounded me) to just stay there because I was an awesome roommate and they'd had a string of bad roommates. It was going alright, but slowly tensions starting building between  myself and the boyfriend. In February 2019 some conflict came to ahead that made me realize things were getting weird, and maybe living with my best friend and her boyfriend was not the best dynamic. It took several months for me to land the right place. I moved into my new place Aug 1 of 2019.

I moved in with two guys who are in a relationship. One is gone for a big chunk of the week for work. The younger doesn't work or go to school, and is supported by the boyfriend. He doesn't have any friends outside the apartment, no car to get around, and spends a good chunk of his day playing video games and doing not much else. When I first moved in, things were going alright. The younger one is high energy, needy, impulsive and dramatic. I saw them as personality quirks. The situation I had been in before seemed so toxic, so these personality quirks were things I really glossed over. Younger roommate would ask me for rides to the grocery store, ask me to hang out, get offended if there were times when I was quiet or hanging out with my other friends. My fatal flaw is that I'm a pushover, a softy with a tendency to want to help and save people. So I always saw the best in him and obliged when I could.

My concerns grew a bit, but I thought they'd be manageable. Yet again, another big conflict came to a head this weekend when younger roommate came out with my friends, was being incredibly clingy and annoying, kept saying embarrassingly stupid things (at one point he put his head in my lap and in front of all my friends yelled ""your pussy smells!""), and wouldn't stop drinking despite being past his limit. I was doing my best to take care of him and keep him in check. He was falling asleep in the middle of a party when I offered to get him an Uber back home. It took some convincing to send him home, but afterwards he has been so angry that he hasn't spoken to me for two days because I was ""making him feel excluded"" and ""triggering his abandonment issues"" despite me babysitting him all night and my friends going out of their way to make him feel included (not to mention, dodging the ridiculous way he casually likes to insult people and ""throw shade""). 

At this point, the apartment is tense and uncomfortable. I've asked him to talk things out, and he has refused, and posted on social media about how he ""misses his old roommate"". The things I thought were quirks now feel like glaring signs of untreated borderline personality disorder. Older roommate is not home much, and when he is, constantly is dodging younger roommate's outbursts. He's a difficult person, and now I'm regretting this decision not even two months into a year lease. I feel so stupid for letting things get this far and always thought I was mature and smart enough to avoid situations like these.

I make about 50k a year, and by pinching pennies, I'd be able to afford a studio in my city. I've wanted nothing more than to have my own place but always wanted to wait until I had a higher salary. Now I find myself anxious these past few days to get the fuck out. I'm thinking of sending a text to older roommate letting him know that younger roommate is still angry at me and giving me silent treatment, not open to talking things out, and that this is uncomfortable for both of us. That if he's open to having someone else fill my place, I'd really like to move out and give them the opportunity to find a better fit. I'm not sure how it'll go down, and not sure what I'll do if he refuses.

This has been such an eye opening (i.e. shitty) year, jumping from place to place. I signed a year lease and that comes with consequences. I understand that and need to accept that there is no easy way out. I'm feeling stuck and at a loss.

799,"On the date of 11 September 2019, I took my vehicle to the dealership because the window had stopped working. I was able to get a diagnosis. My window regulator had snapped and the motor overheated. Prior to taking my vehicle to the dealership, I could hit the driver's window button and still hear the motor running. The window just wouldn't go up or down. It was stuck at about 3/4 of the way up. I returned to my vehicle after they diagnosed the issue to have the window left all the way down inside of the door. Due to the repairs needing parts to be ordered, it wouldn't get fixed immediately. I had to place trash bags over my window when it rained in order to protect the car's interior. I took my vehicle to my mechanic on 21 September 2019 and he told me that the window motor was not returned to the vehicle after the dealership put the door panel back on. After several attempts I was able to finally speak to someone who turned out to be a supervisor of the service department. His attitude and mannerisms were completely unprofessional. I asked several times for the original window motor that the car was brought in with and he told me that he “would have to dig through the dumpster” in order to find the original window motor. He also told me that the reason it wasn’t put back in the car was because when it was removed; springs came loose from it and it fell apart. I then explained that I didn’t feel the window motor should have been removed. I took the vehicle in for a diagnostic test. Not service. No parts should have been removed aside from the door panel to expose the problem area. He then stated “it’s obvious that your objective here is to obtain a free window motor.” Which isn’t the case…if that was the case…why would I be asking for the original back? I just don’t feel it’s right that a part was removed and disposed of without my consent. I didn’t authorize for any parts to be removed or disposed of. I asked them to tell me what the problem was. Even if the part was “inoperable” then I feel they could have left it outside of the vehicle and it could have been brought to my attention when I paid for the service fee to have it diagnosed. I could have been given the option to keep it or to have them dispose of it. I contacted KIA corporate in regards to the way the manager spoke to me and the things he said to me. I was cool, calm, and collected. I never tried to obtain anything for free. I just want this resolved. I feel like I’ve been stolen from.

800,"Hi, last summer my long term boyfriend and I broke up and I moved out of our shared apartment and into my moms apartment. When I moved in she told me to take care of my personal finances but that I otherwise didn’t need to contribute much to the household. 

During the time between then and now, I lost my job of 3 1/2 years, grew distant from friends because I no longer lived close and couldn’t drive, dated a guy who turned out to be insane and upon ending the relationship had to deal with police, lawyers, depression, etc. 

This summer I finally got myself back to a place where I felt like I could function in the workforce and I got myself a full time job as well as a part time job and have been working 6 days a week most weeks earning minimum wage. My mom has not been working for a couple of years now and was living mainly off of sick leave from her job and whatever other supplemental shit she had, but it has run its course and she can no longer collect. She has started the process of collecting her pension but I am told she will not actually receive any money for up to 6 months from now at the most. 

Now she is asking me to pay half of everything in the household. Rent, hydro, internet and home phone, car payments and insurance, food, gas, etc. When I broke down all the bills and put the numbers on paper, and added my own personal expenses to the pile (cell phone, credit card, etc) the amount that I will have to pay per month is more than what I actually earn right now. 

Of course I am keeping my eyes open for full time work that pays more than minimum wage but it seems like I don’t bring enough to the table/am not qualified for/not experienced enough to be eligible for a lot of these higher paying jobs. And I am at a loss. 

We are already unable to afford life right now, and if it’s going to take 6 months for her pension to start coming in what am I supposed to do in the mean time? How can I make this work without spending 24/7 at work? I am really out of my realm here. I feel like I’m normally a logical person but the way I see it I’m going to have to pick up a third job, and spend every minute of my time at work and have zero personal time or personal money to actually live any kind of life that allows me to stay sane.

We don't live in the nicest neighbourhood(hooker ally) but in our gated house since then she has been letting the less desirables from the streets free access . including I saw one...of many use keys  to enter the premises and her home. It wouldn't bother my if they didnt start fights, and scream at all hours of the day. Or if one of them didnt poke their head through my bedroom window in the early hours. My roommate, boyfriend and myself are very uncomfortable with this new scenario, locking and closing blinds, feeling unsafe to go outside (from agression shown by these individuals) 

I was wondering if anyone had maybe delt with this before or what precautions should be taken/ general advise on how to deal with this situation. 

We live in Ontario, Canada

Seems like half the days are doubles and other half are just 8 hours. Anyone know if I will get used to this or will this just get worse? Does anybody have advice on how to manage sleep?

806,"(Sorry for any grammatical mistakes in advance, English is not my first language!)

I’m kind of concerned for my ex-bf... it might be my crazy teenage mind, but it might also be a problem. 

For as long as I’ve known him he’s never liked talking. Throughout our entire relationship he didn’t really talk to me. It’s one thing to not talk about your problems with others, but he just didn’t seem like he wanted to have a conversation. I tried my best to be like “hey, you can talk to me, I am your gf after all!”, but he just brushed me off, so I ended up dropping it because I wasn’t going to force it on him. I talked to his friends, and they all said the same thing: “oh he’s always been like that”. With any other person I would brush it off, and trymy best to understand that some people are different from me. However, while we were dating I had a pretty bad mental breakdown in front of him because of something that was said that triggered a lot of bad memories and I ended up telling him about my past with things like mental illness and self harm. He ended up showing me some large healing cuts on his arm and told me that I wasn’t the only one. Those were not even a month old.

I’ve seen him around school a lot recently, and he doesn’t seem to be hanging out with his normal group of friends, and so that’s made me worry, because what if that’s why he never talks. I’ve gone through some rough shit myself, but I’m not against talking about it, so that makes me wonder: what kind of awful things do you have to go through to not talk to ANYONE about literally anything for the past 5 or so years of your life. 

Now seeing that he might be distancing himself from his friends is really concerning. I lost a friend to suicide last year, and he was just like him. No one knew, because he just simply never talked to anyone. I still care about him, and the thought of losing someone again terrifies me.

So what I’m asking is: is there ANYTHING I can do? It doesn’t feel like it’s my place because of my strained relationship with him, but I want to know that he’s not hurting himself. I just want him to talk to someone! Please help, because I don’t want to make things worse by trying to help in the wrong way.",24Sep2019,1
807,"I lent my friend my Civic with the condition that he pay the notes and eventually refinance under his name (first mistake, I didn’t get anything in writing and I’ll just go ahead and say I made several stupid decisions). I had told him that I was letting the car go, as much as I didn’t want to because it was my grandmother’s, because it was too much of a hassle so he volunteered to take over.

I’ve been too lenient with him, considering it wasn’t even two days since he had the car that he got pulled over. (He calls me telling me “I got pulled over, and they might take the car since I don’t have a license”) Fortunately the Officer didn’t have the car towed, so I told him to be more careful and get his license situation fixed (🤡). 

I gave him a freebie with last months car note because it was due the day after he got the car. But for the last month he hasn’t given me one cent toward the car note. And it’s not like he’s broke, he worked at the same company I do, so I know he had $2400 on his check (he gave me too much info and told me he only pays $300 a month on rent), he’s always getting the car cleaned and buying shit. I wanted to see something, so I told him last week, “hey, could you at least give me $150 and I’ll pay the rest.” It hasn’t happened. 

On top of all that noise, he’s always hitting me up for cash. The first time he borrowed $20 and paid it back. The next time he called me on a Monday asking me for $40 with this sob story that his girlfriend spent all the money going shopping. (He gets paid every Friday). Saturday rolls around and not one mention of paying me back. I don’t feel like getting into it so I tell him not to worry about it. Me being stupid lets this happen again. So that’s $80 I’m missing. Then he calls me again talking about “can I borrow $200”. I say I don’t have that kind of money and he later calls me back telling me he got it from his uncle. 

Last week he tells me “I got a ticket on the car”. I tell him “ok, go online and pay it.” He calls me later asking to borrow $30 because he’s short that much (the ticket was $80) so I get frustrated and tell him I’ll handle it. (I haven’t yet)

I talked to him last night and told him I want us to go down to the bank and refinance so I’m completely done with the car. He then tells me he got fired for coming in late. I told him we’re still going down to the bank. 

I see this isn’t going to turn out very well. I’m not going to keep worrying about paying almost half a grand for something that 1.) I don’t really have any financial obligation towards (it’s my deceased grandmother’s car and it’s still under her name), and 2.) I’m not even using. I missed work last week and I have to pay my car insurance, so I don’t want to try to worry about paying both. I mean, for $800 a month (the amount for both cars) I could have gotten a brand new car.

TLDR: I need to take my car back because it’s (along with my so-called “friendship”) becoming an unnecessary financial drain. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of because I’m grieving, and he thinks I’ll do anything so that I don’t let something of my grandmother’s go.",24Sep2019,1
808,"A few months ago, I was dating a guy for about 5 months but I met him much much earlier. My friends never liked him and would always tell me this but I ignored them and even defended him. I remember after the second time of us hanging out (even though he said he wanted to be “just friends”) he asked if he could kiss me. I was really nervous, being that it was going to be my first kiss. After I reluctantly and nervously accepted, we started dating and things started going downhill from there. Every time we hung out, it was at his house. Things got sexual, very fast. I did consent but however, I did tell him multiple times that I had never done any of this stuff and I was extremely nervous- even scared. It didn’t even seem to phase him. We were only dating for 5 months and we went on a date in public once. He’d always say he’d miss me, yet he wouldn’t even make an effort to see me. We never even hung out at school. I was lucky if he said hi to me when he saw me. It’s almost like he didn’t know me. The only way someone would know that we were dating is if someone saw his Instagram bio. I felt like he was embarrassed of me the entire 5 months... but I just wanted to feel loved. I thought this was what love was, and I’d do anything to have it. The last time I went to his house. We started going at it but I broke down and started crying. He eventually noticed and asked if I’m okay and I lied and said yes. He didn’t give me a hug, support me, nothing. He just asked if I wanted to do more stuff later. Eventually I broke up with him without any explanation and he didn’t even bat an eye. We stopped talking since, but now that the school year has started up again we see each other. If that wasn’t bad enough, even though we are in different grades, we have a class together. I have reoccurring nightmares and daydreams about being sexually abused or raped. I also have just strange dreams involving my ex. Currently we still don’t talk but we make a lot of eye contact in class. I now have a boyfriend of almost 2 months and I love him very much, but I’m still bothered and affected by this. I think the worst part about it is how much the situation affected my overall confidence and still haunts me today. Is there any way to “fix” this? Can I get closure? I’m scared to since my last closure attempt failed. I apologized to him! I only felt worse in the end. I’m doing a lot better now, but I was wondering if anyone had advice or could relate.

My heart breaks going outside and seeing all these amazing looking teenagers and people and I’m just here with a curse bestowed on my face. Even the basic thing of taking pictures I can’t even do. They say find your angle, lighting etc but what do you do when you don’t have an angle? When you whole face is just too ugly for the camera. Every “compliment” I’ve ever gotten were back handed. So I end up retreating by myself because every social interaction is a just anxiety. Then I enter deep depression holes where I don’t talk, look in mirrors, make eye contact, etc. It seems that being ugly is everything that holds me back.

813,"Location A is the place I applied to work. It is relatively close and I can get there easily I'm 30-40 mom, 3.7miles from where I live. 

Location B is the place I've been reassigned to. It is beyond town and, funnily enough, it's where my training took place. It's 9 miles away, 1.2hr travel - and that's off peak, for 9.30am and finish 5.30pm. Whereas the actual shifts are for 7.40am and finish 3.40pm, which is going to be a nightmare. It took me 2 hours to go to my previous job that was roughly 7 miles away peak time, and that was nowhere near city centre. 

I applied to work to the place nearer me, location A. It gives me time with family, shopping, household cleaning, and other commitments. I signed a provisional contract in early August and just finished my training. One of my colleagues on my training that was meant to work at the same place I, received a time table but I was not on it. Yet I was informed that I start at the same time, 1st Oct. 

I check my mailbox and surely enough, there's an email in which it's casually mentioned that I will start working at location B on this day following successful completion of my training. 

Now I am not quite sure what my options are. I cannot commit to work there as it's totally not ideal. 4 hours travel time each day is not what I signed up for at all. 

My day would be waking up at 5 to make it in time, coming home at 6 and going to bed at 8. 

Nowhere in the contract it says that they can relocate me for the needs of the company, nor was I actually asked if I can commit to work at a different location. But, what makes me unsure is that it's a provisional contract and that they, indirectly, notified me of that change. 

But at the same time, they could've done so in the two months time I was waiting to even hear from them. I could've been looking for a different job that I can commit to in the mean time. Or, why would they offer me a position to work at location A where they could potentially be no more need for extra employees?

I liked her a lot we traded numbers over the summer and kept in touch till about the last month. It turns out that last month she started a FetLife account no problem I respect he wishes because she probably didn’t like me anyway.  Now the new semester things are different we get back in touch and she mentions her new hobby cool I think good for her. But it turns out some 55 year old kinkster is her partner and you know their fetish buddies I guess he ties her up, they fuck, take pictures. And in turn she shows them to me because idk she trusts me. Any way more bias time she’s become um closer recently touching me messing with my stuff I think she likes me. So old feelings come up and I can’t get past this dude. I know my own personal problem.

Because of this though he dosent really understand his actions i guess? Id be fine with this but he is starting to get really creepy with the girls in the class including me.  It started off fine at first, hed always say hi to me when he got there and would pat me on the back as praise. But then he started getting more touchy. Hed massage my shoulders and stuff like that. the other day he was behind me in line and i could see him in the mirror sniffing me and playing with my hair and ***kissing my shoulder!!??*** He also tried to tiggle me on my sides. I ***hate*** when people do this. I once elbowed my brother in the ribs for this. It took all my will to not do this to him.

839,"A friend of the family completely cut all ties with us around three years ago, she was really close with my mum and her sister but knew pretty much everyone in my family. When I was from the age of 6 to 14 we would go and visit her and her boyfriend almost every other week, we would have visited her more but she lived around a forty minutes drive away. 

She moved house around six years ago to somewhere much closer but out of the way in the countryside. By this point her life had become rather bleak and stressful due to her mother and one of her brothers dying weeks apart from one another. Apparently she had suffered from severe depression when she was younger but had massively overcome it in her adult years. However, the amalgamation of the recent deaths of her family members and her relationship with her boyfriend turning sour, her mental health had started to rapidly decline. 

We made more of an effort to visit her or invite her to family functions but she grew further apart from us. She split with with her boyfriend of around twelve years not long after and downgraded to a smaller house in the same village as she was now only relieving one income. (Both her and her boyfriend had very well paying jobs). We saw the boyfriend a few times after as he also knew us all we’ll but he moved to another city to live closer to his family.

The last time we saw her was around three years ago, any efforts we made to contact her were useless. She would make up excuses and eventually would stop replying all together. Although we all cared about her we stopped trying to contact her as she clearly didn’t want us to be in her lives anymore.

Nobody really knows why she cut ties with our family but some of her friends we vaguely knew contacted us asking if we still spoke to her as she had stopped talking to them. It seems like she cut everyone out of her life apart from the few family members she has left.

She would babysit me and my cousin a lot when we were little and she was a huge part of my childhood. Memories of her are very painful to me because I know that I won’t ever see her again. My cousin wants nothing to do with her as she took her no longer seeing our family very personally and believes she is selfish. 

I’m 17 now and I’ve bought myself a car with money I made from working construction. I really want to see her again and I’m tempted to drive to her village and see if I can talk to her. I know she still lives there because one of her brothers told my mum a few months ago.

I’ve not told anyone in my family if this plan. Would it be messed up if me if I tried to find her? I just want to know why she stopped talking to my family and to see her again as I miss her. Or should I leave her alone?",24Sep2019,2

I feel like I’m never full or satisfied, and when I am, it doesn’t last longer than an hour then I’m hungry again. I drink a ton of water because I thought it would help but yet, here I am.

About an hour later my mom and I were looking at a house. Her and my dad are divorcing right now and she needs a place to stay. The house was too expensive to rent, they don't allow dogs and it was really gross. She kinda broke down and asked if I would be ok if we moved in with my grandma. My grandma lives about 4 hours away and I would have to start at a new school but again it doesn't bother me much the only big issue is my dad still lives here so I might see him less. I am ok with it because I can go to his house on weekends and in the summer.

None of this is bothering much mainly because I am emotionally unavailable. I just don't feel emotions very much or if I do they seem weaker than they should be. I just needed to vent about it because it is a lot to think about all at once.

Now, with being a biology major with the hopes of going to medical school, I know that this kind of thing can't happen anymore (where I don't study and just get by with the skin on my teeth). I'm currently a sophomore and I ended my freshman year with a 2.9 GPA after vowing to myself I would do better and yet I still ended up not studying for a single test (I did however always complete my homework assignments on time). Now, about a month into my sophomore year I see the same trends popping up again, and i'm fearful of getting the same results as last year. I just can't seem to do what I need to to get the A's I know I have the potential to get. It feels almost like an invisible barrier that I can't cross, to the point where I'd rather watch paint dry than to study for my classes/tests. I've tried speaking to advisors/counselors about this throughout my academic career and they all want to attribute this to laziness and that I ""just need to get down to it."" They all understand that I have the potential just from speaking with me and seeing how articulate I can be when in conversation, so the potential isn't the issue here. But I feel that it might be deeper than that. And I've spent years trying to solve this issue and thinking to myself what it could be, but I always end up with the same result: subpar grades.

I have a tough decision to make. A colleague has been promoted and his position has been offered to me. The thing is that the company os going through a downsizing and the contract being offered to me is a temporary one, seeing that the role might be erased and the tasks divides into to people.
No matter how I perform, at the end of march I may be let go. There's not much way to tell the probability of the role continuing to exist or not.

(The paycheck will increase significantly but it is not my main concern right now).

On the other hand I can remain in intern, with my contract expiring on 12/2020, having more time to develop and a more stable scenario.

853,"So, a little background - I have lived in a condo for about 3.5 years. I live in the middle condo of a row of three that faces west. About two years ago, the neighbors on the north side moved out and a black couple moved in. I am white. 

I didnt have any issues with them until last year when my husband moved in with his dog. Now, we have all sorts of issues with them, all regarding the dog. Basically, they have called the cops on us because we were not picking up the poop from the yard. 

It got resolved in the spring but within the last two weeks, we had a pair of officers knock on our door because of the dog poop. We try to keep up on it, but sometimes forget. It is usually done within a day or two. 

Now onto my question. Last night when I got home from work, I noticed some plants in my yard on my side of their driveway. Well, about an hour ago, I heard something going on and looked out to see they had installed a black fence between my yard and their driveway. I know it was done because of the dog. 

Do they actually have a right to do this without asking me? At one point the lady said that two feet into my yard was her property. I am under the assumption that when you own a condo, you own everything inside the building, not the land. Any help or advice would be appreciated.",24Sep2019,0

It’s a minimum job however and I still have to pay off my student loans which is why I’m still living with my parents.

859,"Context: When I was in high school i was severely depressed and I often went to a specific teacher (Let's call him X). Whenever I had it bad I would always go to X, and X was also the first came out as gay to, so he holds a very special place in my heart, which makes writing this painful.

Because of my depression and upbringing I always found it difficult to fully trust people. X became like a father to me and he's helped me through many hardships. There's a specific incident where he ended up having to report me to the school because it was possible I would hurt myself.

After I graduated I ended up inviting to get coffee, then possibly take him out to a restaurant and stuff like that

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's what happened what I need advice with:

&amp;#x200B;

I regretfully emailed him yesterday with this specifically:

"" Did you ever actually care about me when I came to you with all my problems?  


I sometimes felt like you were somewhat dismissive when it came to this subject and that I was annoying you with all my personal problems.  


Whenever you mentioned being held liable if I were to do something drastic, I thought you were only concerned for your own well-being and you didn't care too much about me.  


I always have mixed interpretations,over think things, and it's difficult for me to fully trust people. I understand that I can be cynical to everyone, even you, despite the amount of time and the extent to which you've known me. While I normally wouldn't uphold you with ill intent, this has been bothering me and I would like to have some closure as soon as possible, regardless of the truth.""

I visited him the next day and he was greatly offended. I had questioned his integrity and basically told him I don't trust him. I threw everything that happened between us over the past 3 years and threw them in his face without realizing it. I had literally put I was cynical and it was difficult for me to trust people. I completely ruined our relationship and I deeply regret it because he's the one person in my life that I was able to trust that much, then I just proved that I didn't. I fucked up. Bad.

I didn't understand that kind of question would have that effect on someone and I want to make amends, he said he forgives me but I doubt it. Things won't be the same between us ever again and I hate myself for it.

To give context too, I graduated in Film and TV, but self taught in the industry I am interning at. Long story short, I want to pursue the latter because younger me didn't know these subjects existed until it was too late.

On my first internshipping day, I found it to be not what I expected. I expressed by concerns and explained that I am self taught and my workflow is not as neat, to which the guy in charge of me seemed to understand, but also probably confused as to how I even made the internship. 
I have been waking up everyday at 4 AM to get to this internship and coming back extremely late. I am also beginning to feel the burden it is having on my wallet.

After chastising myself for being a total blithering nincompoop I tried to forget about it.

Until, my flatmate arrived back from holiday and let me know her bike had been stolen from our flat stairwell. She checked the back door and someone had left it open. 

I then remembered that last night I thought I'd heard keys jangling and her about to come back early. I'd listened to figure out whether it was her entering our flat but thought I'd heard quiet talking and so used this as the main criteria to assume that it was one of our neighbours going in their door.

This would be the best case scenario. 

A worse case scenario - it was the thieves trying to enter my flat with my keys and realising the chain was on the latch then leaving my keys behind.

Worst worst case scenario - someone stealing and copying my keys overnight then putting them back before I realised?

Looking for advice - does anyone know whether this is probable or possible and whether I should take the most paranoid action available of changing my locks?

866,"Like the title says, I’m in my late 20s and live at my mom’s house. I have a job that pays well enough to live on my own and a few investments have paid off to the point where I could afford a decent condo in my town. The condo wouldn’t be anything fancy, but a solid one bedroom with enough space for anything I’d need. I actually was very close to buying the place I have in mind last year, but the possibility that I might have to move out of town for work held me back.

I went away for college and grad school. After that I lived at home for about two years while working. I saved up enough to pay for a specialized masters degree in my field, for which I moved out of the country for a year. When I moved back was when I was looking at condos, so I’ve been here about a year since. I’ve spent about 2-3 years since college at home, at the rest out of the state.

I enjoy living at home because my mom helps take care of my young niece and nephew during the week, so I can help her out by taking care of them (and of course getting to be the fun uncle). Today I got to see lots of family on a random day when if I didn’t live here I’d see them at most maybe once every week or two. In addition to helping with the kids, I also do a lot of the cooking, trash, etc, so I don’t feel like I’m mooching, and my mom and I mostly get along quite well. She’s also getting close to 70, so I think we both have a sense of comfort from having her not live alone.

The house is set up where the basement essentially functions like its own one bedroom condo would. Locks, bedroom with separate bathroom and a couch/tv area, etc. There’s no awkwardness when I have girls over because it’s a large enough house where, unless I told a girl, they would just think I was renting out the basement of a nice house. Really, quite a bit more privacy than the condo I was looking at.

My current plan is to buy the condo (or a substantially similar one) when it’s clear whether or not I’ll be living in town or moving away. The HOA has a 1 year requirement between purchase and renting out, otherwise I probably would’ve already purchased it.

My main reason for thinking of moving out is societal pressure, and the rare occasion when I feel insecure telling a girl I live at home. I have been focusing more on career lately so this hasn’t come up in the year since I’ve been home. Obviously if something were to get more serious I would be moving out pretty much ASAP. Should I move out?

Tl;dr: I moved back to my mom’s house about a year ago after most of the last decade away. I’m enjoying it there and think I help out a lot along with getting to see family, but I feel pressure to move out anyways. Should I?",24Sep2019,2
867," **tldr; Essentially, I'd like advice from people who have experienced getting a graduate-level degree on an extremely low budget, and advice on what to do when your entire support system bottoms out from under you.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hey all, thanks for taking the time to read my post, I really need some advice and I'm not really sure where to turn.

I go to a very good school in the Boston area and I'm pursuing my BFA in studio art. This immediately sounds dumb, I know, but the reason I'm pursuing such a major is because it's a good route into the fine art world, which is what I want to do. I adore critical art theory, adore writing lengthy essays, and my professors have always enjoyed my work. I;m aiming to get a PhD and become an art curator - I'm well aware of the workload it requires. I didn't want to do anything else because I'm bad at higher level mathematics and was taught growing up to pursue your dreams veraciously, so I'd prefer not to get advice along the lines of chastising me for that, I've already heard every version of it. I've made my bed and have to sleep in it.

But life threw something into the mix, which was expected of course, but still unfortunate. My family is not wealthy, but was always able to be self-supportive; during school I've had to pick up multiple jobs to support living in the Boston area, and unfortunately that's affected my GPA, but I've still been pretty successful the last few years. Luckily I am not in credit debt, but my funds are dwindling. I took my previous semester off because my father suddenly had host of medical problems: ketoacidosis, a heart attack, late stage cancer diagnosis, and a stroke which left him paralyzed. We had a lot of medical costs, and thankfully we had a GoFundMe that was very helpful, but now my parents might lose the house. He was a master electrician, and I worked with him all the time to support his business (in which he was sole employee) and earn some income during the summers. My mother never went to school, and struggles with alcoholism, and they are both now on food stamps and medicare. I cannot rely on my family as a backup when money gets low, which I rarely did in the first place except in dire need and only on a loan-type basis, and I have little assets to work off of currently. I also have a sister who is horrible with money and often comes to me or my parent for help.

I'm currently taking an economics class which discusses income of creative industry careers, and visual artists get an absolutely minuscule average income due to the ""winner take all"" market there is. I'm quite good at taking pictures and videos, I've won awards and people have bought my work - several Guggenheim fellows have complimented me and I have close relationships with them - but I don't even own my own camera because I had to sell my old one to buy food. If I graduate with just a BFA in art, with the loans I have and the cost of living that exists, I'll probably end up in a labor position (no shade on that, I have my electrician's license) or the service industry, which honestly would destroy me. It's already been extremely difficult getting loan approval, and I can no longer turn to my family when something unexpected comes up. I worry that one wrong turn will leave me stuck at home with my family, undoing all my hard work.

I was in the top of my class in high school, high honors and recognition across the board, and have been working nonstop with little sleep for the past 8 years to get where I am. I'm starting to feel like I went down a path expecting the best and putting in over 100%, and am now stuck in a hole with the worst. There's things like career counseling and financial counseling at my school, which I'm in the process of utilizing.

I don't talk to people about this because they often just treat it like a sob story, when really it's just the truth of the situation; I'm very strong about it and just need advice on how to push through - but no one at my school can relate because they all come from middle or upper-class families and they give me the ""ew he's poor + had bad stuff happen"" treatment (many of my ""friends"" have lost touch after all this has happened, even though it rarely comes up). I still have 2 years of school left, so I'm hoping I can figure out a plan ASAP, but I have this inescapable feeling that everyone else is having a much more positive experience at school, and I'll never be able to get these years back or succeed the way I've wanted to.

Thank you for any and all responses, I hope you all have a lovely day and I appreciate you taking the time to help.",24Sep2019,1
868,"I’ll try and keep this to bullet points;

- My work ethic, not just with my job, but even just with day to day tasks at home is at an all time low. 
- I have 0 motivation and the effort I put into even small tasks is minimal. 
- I regret my lack of effort afterwards 100% of the time. 
- Even though I’ve enrolled to study become a financial planner after work to give me a proper sense of purpose and direction, my work ethic even on that has totally faltered.
- I just feel like a total lazy piece of shit but I also feel that there’s something else going on mentally that’s just sapping my energy and willpower to put effort into anything 
- my current job pays well, I’m lucky to have it, but there is 0 sense of satisfaction and my boss is a sociopath
- I’m 27, have a fantastic girlfriend, a great house and car and plenty of disposable income. I wonder if I perhaps feel like I’ve peaked too early?
- Don’t feel like I deserve what I have
- Get sudden bursts of energy and motivation but have 0 discipline and am my own worst enemy.
- had to go off work for stress leave earlier this year and had counselling for suicidal tendencies. Suicidal thoughts have come back more recently as I just see myself as being a lazy, degenerate drain on this planet and that I will never improve. Even when I work hard objectively speaking I still don’t feel as if I’ve done as much as I could have. Can’t even focus on my studies even when I do sit down for hours after work because this is where my brain is at all the time just now.

870,"I've been struggling with my classes for the last two semesters. Not just with my grades, but with my mental health as well. I can't focus on my assignments due to my lack of interest and depression in general. I genuinely don't want to be in college and the more I rack up loans, the more my anxiety builds. Which of course reinforces my depression. Now this isn't to say I don't care about my future. But I don't see myself succeeding with a high-paying job and a college degree. That is not the lifestyle I want for myself. I do not come from an affluent background. I was raised in the working class, and all the people I admire in life are factory workers. I don't care about material wealth because I don't believe it'll find me happiness. I want to be self-sufficient, but I don't care if I live in a cheap apartment and not a suburban home.

However, I fear my parents won't see my side. They've struggled through life and want to see my achieve more than they ever could. And I respect that. But I don't want to sacrifice my sanity and perhaps my life just to appease them. I believe I could make a compromise by promising to apply to a trade school. Granted that does mean more loans, but I feel a more hands-on career is what I want in life and what will finally give me happiness.

879,"I recently got my license (hooray). Back when I still had lessons I started of as a panicky mess, but slowly got to the point where I drove confidently and calmly. I passed my exam with flying colors.

Now I already did two big mistakes in my one week of driving alone (first was accidentally driving over a red light, second was scratching another car next to me in the parking lot while pulling out of my space). Also the fact that I have to drive a big car and my instructor not teaching me that many things doesn't really help.

When I'm driving in rural areas or on the highway I still feel relaxed. But driving in even just mildly populated places makes me panicked now. Mentally I'm almost back at point zero.

I want to overcome that and practice more, but I'm just too scared. I don't want to damage something or hurt someone. I can't even look for work, because without driving I'm stuck in my little village.

880,"I'm 25 and feel like I've hit a wall. I have no idea what to do with my life. I hate my job because my boss is a lunatic which has started givving me panic attacks and making me skip work. I quit and they asked me to come back and I was back 4 days before I called off today because my boss spent most of the day yesterday yelling at me for messing up his schedule by trying to follow the contradictory instructions he gave me and yelling about how he was stressed and going to have a nervous breakdown. He is supposedly retiring in November and his son told me to stick it out until then because they want me to keep working there when he's gone but the job doesn't offer insurance or any other benefits. It's my first and only office job and the only non service industry job I have even though I'm 30k im debt for a B.S. in criminal justice. If I quit my boss is going to be mad and not give me a reference. (He is currently running for a political office and the office is insanely busy with the regular work plus the campaign work.)   
  
I only have about $400 saved up and a credit card with a $3000 limit. I live alone and could probably last two months without a job. My car could break down at any moment and years ago I was diagnosed with BPD and at any minute am cycling through wanting to kill myself to wanting to cut my hair to wanting to buy the first plane ticket to Europe and just run away.  
  
I know I should just suck it up and stay at work since I make 15/hr which is $5 than any other job I've had. I'm afraid I'd only be able to get hired at fast food if I quit but my boss is a racist homophobic misogynist with a temper (probably from the adderall he has his doctor friend get him).   
  
I can't tell if I'm just a lazy shit or if I'm justified in hating my job so much. I enjoy the work but I can't even go to the bathroom and relax because my boss monitors when everyone uses the bathroom. (His office is across the hall. I have always had stomach issues and been embarrassed about it and if I take a shit and he isn't in a meeting he comes out and sprays air freshener everywhere and makes a big deal out of it.)

881,"Throwaway account, and I’ll probably ramble.  Sorry if it doesn’t make sense. 

Life is smacking me right in the face this week.  Found out that I’m losing my job when the new company takes over in 2 weeks.  My fuel pump in my car went out yesterday.  Rent is due next week.  Bills are due.  

I hate this.  Just when things look up, life comes back to hit you.  I fought hard.  Got out of a shitty one bedroom apartment at 61st and Peoria 4 months ago.  Things were turning around.  Then, a month ago, I lost my father.  He was the only one that I had.  He didn’t have anything, so I spent what I had to cremate him.  I miss him.  So much.  

I was informed yesterday that my position will be eliminated when the purchase of our company goes through.  No severance offered.  Then, on my way home after work yesterday, my  car dies.  Had to pay to have it towed to the shop.  $550 to replace the fuel pump.  Awesome.   

I’m not asking for anything.  Just getting it out.  I don’t have anyone to vent to.  No family.  No friends close enough to talk to about all this.",24Sep2019,3
882,"Yeah where do I begin. I am 22 years old and currently staying with my boyfriend because I am looking for a job thus can't afford my own apartment. I don't have the best relationship with my dad so hence why I'm living here. He currently has a mutual friend staying over for a few days and he asked a few other people (who I all know except one) to go bowling tomorrow.

Now here are the issues. Due to my personal situation (unemployed, should definitely lose some weight and other things) I am already close to slipping into depression.  I am not exaggerating this, I've been there before and if I really think about it now I think I never really got out, it was just easier to kinda forget about it all.

Due to all of this I think I'm actually developing some sort of social anxiety if I don't already have it. I barely left the house the past few weeks, only if I really have to. The thought of having to travel next weekend makes me sick to my stomach and I've been nervous ever since I learned that someone else wanna gonna stay over for a few days etc.. I used to like going out and meeting friends, having sleepovers... Now I'm terrified.

So tomorrow we are going to go bowling. When my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to come of course I nodded although I really didn't want to... Or I guess I want to because I loved bowling on the past but I am just.. Terrified. If the reasons above aren't enough it doesn't help that the last time I went bowling with him and some friends was literally hell for me.

The last time I was already feeling really self conscious due to people being there who I regard as much better than me in any way possible, plus the girl my boyfriend liked before me. Nothing ever happened between them and she has a boyfriend now and both of them are really nice but I still get this uneasy feeling once in a while, mainly due to my bf ditching me for her at his birthday party once. Guess that still stings. So me already being a nervous wreck I also have this issue where I completely freeze if I perform badly in front of other people, no matter the task. This is mainly due to being bullied for various things in the past.. I know it's stupid and I should be able to laugh but it's just hard for me to shake these things sometimes. The first few rounds went rather well so I was confident, but then I completely butchered one. I tried to not let it got to me but I certainly quited down a bit to keep myself calm and just get through it, trying to stay positive and just improve on the next throw.

And this is where it all went downhill. The next throw was a strike. Should be happy, right? I was until I realized that nobody seemed to care. When I turned around they were all busy talking to each other, including my boyfriend. When anyone else got a strike it was party hard and cheering. I once again tried to not let it get to me and shrugged it off as bad timing, but it didn't actually make me cheer up or get my confidence back. This happened 2 more times. I got 3 strikes and literally nobody cared. If that was the case for everyone I probably would've just swallowed it, but for every other strike it was cheering and what not. I felt left out of discussions, in fact I tried to speak up several times but was simply ignored or not heard, I even tipped my bf on the shoulder to gain his attention, nothing. At some point I just started going to the toilet in between my turns because I literally couldn't hold back tears anymore. It was too much for me to handle at that point. The first 3 times no one even cared I was gone. My bf once asked me what was wrong and I just shrugged it off cause I didn't want to start bawling in front of everyone there and then. He went back to his usual business and I was at the corner sitting alone, not talking to anyone. My performance started dropping to and trust me when I say they saw every ball that went to the gutter. Yay. So my mood just kept on dropping and I felt like leaving then and there. During one turn I legit twisted my ankle cause I was so out of focus on more concerned with not crying that I didn't watch my step properly. Nobody noticed me limping for another 10 minutes or so... Ive never felt more out of place and alone while being surrounded by so many people.

This was a few months ago and I thought Id just be over it cause it was just a really sucky night to begin with, but the moment my bf and friend declared we'd go bowling tomorrow my stomach dropped. I barely ate anything today and now I'm here on my phone, crying to myself while the 2 are asleep and trying to figure out what the hell I am supposed to do.

I know I should go. I should get out of the house, I should try to replace the bad memories with a good one. There'll be different people except my bf so it might just work out well... But I literally wanna throw up at the mere thought of going tomorrow. What do I do?
I can't talk to my boyfriend because our friend is here and I don't wanna start some drama that is probably not even worth crying over. I can't not go because then my bf will be feeling guilty for leaving me alone and I don't wanna ruin his night... 

Any ideas on how to approach this?",24Sep2019,1
883,"I wanna to move out, but if I were to bring it up to my mom that I wanna do so she'll flip because ""I'm not ready yet."" 

I'm 19 years old, I don't have a job, or a license, because my parents hate teaching me how to drive because I ""scare them."" And my mom uses me for free daycare so when I try to get a job its ""you need to watch your brother though!""

So I don't know what to do. Heck, my parents have implied that it would be better for me to loose my legs then to move away from the house. 

I live in a very questionable household, I'm in constant anxiety since my mom's husband does drugs very often and it leads to arguing and screaming.. And sometimes even worse things. 


I found a place, where I can move to and they'll be happy to teach me how to drive.. Help me get a job, and even try to raise my confidence. I know I can trust these people, the problem is.. I feel horrible.

But if I told her this, she would just say I'm ""overreacting"" and its ""not a big deal"" or I'm being ""melodramatic""

I want to leave. But if I do, my mom would call me non-stop, her husband would scream at me and spam text me whenever he's high, and it wouldn't end well. 

I could leave, and change my number. But I would need to leave my family.. My brother.. My mom.

884,"I’ll try to get straight to the point. I’ve been thinking about my old friends from elementary school a lot and I tried to contact one of them two years ago, but that didn’t work out very well. Now, I want to see if I can reconnect with two other people I knew.

The first friend: A girl in my grade, she was my “enemy” at first and we always fought, but then we decided to be friends. We got along so well after that, and eventually she became my first kiss with a fellow girl. I’ll be honest, I miss how she made me feel back then, she made me realize that people can be attracted to the same sex. 

At the same time though, I want to see if we can be just friends because I know it would be better that way, and I think we were great friends. That is, if she even wants to talk to me again. Basically I want to be her friend and keep romance out of it entirely, and I doubt she’d feel the same whether I wanted to pursue her or not. 


The second friend: A girl three grades above me. We met when I started kindergarten. She was by herself and I smiled at her, and after that we would hang out any chance we got. Before school, during recess, and after school. Even during lunch, we had hand signals we would use to make plans for when we’d meet again. 

Out of everyone I knew there, I think she was truly my closest friend and I miss her a lot. The problem is, she’s got everything going for her and I don’t want to ruin that. I think some of her classmates would pick on her, and now she seems to be doing way better than any of them. I just don’t know if she’d want to talk to me either, even though I tried my best to be there for her and never harmed her. 

I feel like I should just move on and leave them alone, but I also feel like I’m being insecure and irrational. For reference, I’m almost 16 now. What if I message them and they don’t reply? Or what if I just sit in their friend list and they never speak to me? Even if they did want to talk to me, what should I say?

885,"I posted this in r/relationshipadvice but am posting here as well

Okay so from what I can gather my friend went to a party and allegedly took advantage of this girl who is a year younger than us. There are two of my not as good friends who say they saw him being forceful with her, even though she was drunk and he was relatively sober because he had to drive. 

He is being very defensive to anyone who talks to him about it, which I guess I kind of understandable but like, the level of defensiveness is insane. He insists that she is just trying to make an excuse to get back with her ex and that she came onto him first - he did send me a text while he was at the party about how this girl was trying to kiss him and then he disappeared for a while before texting me again and saying he felt really guilty about making out with her because he doesn't even like her (he actually has a thing for me, which is now really scaring me). It makes me think maybe he felt guilty for something else??

As well as all this, he has a history of this happening from when he was 14, but I don't know all the details. 

The supposed victim has one parent who is a police officer, and it was being said that she was going to report the incident but apparently she didn't, according to my friend who has been accused, which he heard from the victims ex.

I can't decide if this is something that really happened or if it's just incredibly bad much for him, does anyone have any insight or thoughts about this?

So we started talking as friends at the end of April, and before I start the story I think you guys should know her backstory. She had only two relationships and the first one her boyfriend got somebody else pregnant and the second one cheated on her. Now here is me, the actual good guy who is willing to repair all the damage that was placed upon her. We met online, I had surgery and my appendix had just got taken out and I was in so much pain and my own siblings did not even come to see me. Then I got a message on social media and it was her, she introduced herself and we started to text and then facetime and then we became friends. She was there through every step of the way so I did catch feelings for her. I wanted to ask her to be my girlfriend until she told me her backstory and I noticed the first time we had actually met she was really jumpy and nervous and scared so the next day I decided to take some steps back and find out a way for her to feel comfortable with me. I did not get mad that she wasn't fully comfortable with me because everyone reacts to pain differently. I wanted to know what could I do to fully gain her trust as a boyfriend so we can start moving on with our relationship, I understand that relationships are not easy it always has bad times but I also know that bad times don't last forever. Next month we have so much planned for the month for the spooky seasons so I want her to know that I have no intention of hurting her, please help.

890,"I don't remember much from when I was pretty little so both of these memories are strange in their preservation. The first, around the time I was four I remember a night where ate dinner with my family and then vomiting by myself in the middle of the night. I remember when I was younger finding this strange as I was certain it wasn't the food and I wasn't sick. I couldn't remember what made me throw-up. Things associated with that night have always brought me anxiety and I assumed it was to do with the vomiting itself, but nothing that I remember is particularly traumatic. 

Another night I remember waking up and the clothing on the lower part of my body had been removed. I had no history of sleepwalking or performing actions in my sleep. I was really confused because I know I had been dressed when I went to bed. I shrugged it off, got some more clothes on and headed back to sleep.

But maybe they didn’t put their all into me.

And now they are slowly falling away.

My best friend of six years was the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I still believe this to be true. I will cherish the experiences and memories I’ve shared with them forever. 

Both of us managed to get out of a very toxic friendship which only strengthened our relationship. They were the sibling I never had. 

I became more kind and gentle than I thought possible. I’d gotten happier. I owed it all to them. My self esteem finally reached a high point. I believed in myself like never before.

But now that’s falling away too.

They found other people. Other people that I assume make them happier than I did. People who used to be rude to us and still are to me. People who I believed never cared. They started ditching me to hangout with them. They actively avoid my very person unless I’m the only one there. A week ago, I asked them a question and they turned away to start another conversation. 

Never had I seen such indifference from them. Never have I felt more rejected than that moment. The moment I realized their disinterest my blood turned to ice. 

I felt numb. 
I still do.

894,"A bit of context: I am a young guy who goes to highschool. I am liked by my classmates, and I am part of a couple of friend groups and social circles. However, I've never really been able to create close friendships or relationships with girls.

Last Friday, I went to a big party with a bunch of people from my highschool. I got a pretty high and I had a really good time talking to this girl who I've never talked to before. I want to become better friends with her, but when I see her at school I freeze up and ignore her. 

It's kind of stupid, but if anyone could give me a bit of advice on how to talk to her without coming off as creepy or needy that would be great.",24Sep2019,1
895,"I have a friend who is experiencing now some of the same troubles I had a couple of years ago with our major's (music education) advisor and main teacher. I have seen other students go through this kind of thing as well and I feel very strongly that there is a pattern of behavior here and despite multiple discussions with our department chair nothing seems to change.  I am asking for advice on how to handle this situation and hopefully make my department a better place for students to come. 

A college professor is refusing to sign a drop add form for a non required class and is instead suggesting dropping activities such as church, jobs, clubs, and skipping the work for other classes to make more time. The professor was told multiple times that she did not have the time for this class but would love to sit in but not be officially enrolled. Strong-armed my friend into taking the class and has been refusing to remove the class from her schedule for the past week. This professor continually verbally abuses students in one on one settings (in my case she presented her recommendation as the only thing that would get me a job, and then said she would never be able to give me a favorable one) and singles out individuals in her classes to berate. The department chair is aware and agreed to sign off on the drop add, but sees the abuse given towards the students as bad people skills and a result of the professor working in high schools too long.  Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? If not, is going over our chair head to the dean going to stir too much trouble? We are both seniors who just want to graduate but have also seen this behavior repeated enough to make students drop their major or transfer completely.  She is up for tenure this year and I worry that it will get worse if she receives it.",24Sep2019,1
896,"I work at a restaurant in Norway and the chef, who is also the owner, he is an asshole. He drinks at work and uses drugs and then acts like a total fucker. He keeps bothering me and keeps asking me to go on a date even though I've told him several times I have a boyfriend. This one time he took a picture of me and started showing it to people saying ""She's my future wife"". I was really bothered with this so I told him to stop doing that and back off. The problem is he doesn't take me seriously.

The problem is I really need this job right now and can't quit. And if I report him he can make me quit and make my remaining days at work like hell because he is an asshole and petty.",24Sep2019,1

898,"So I just started this new job with someone that I somewhat consider a friend. We went to highschool briefly and he's cool to game with. He kind of helped me get this job, it's in telecom.

From my first day on the job, he was a dick. He constantly calls me a dumbass when I do something he told me to do but not in the way he had in his mind (I'm not a mind reader and I've never had a job like this before), accuses me of asking dumb questions all the time, does insanely fucked up things like the other day, I watched him take a piece of a puzzle from an unfinished puzzle in this retirement home we're doing a project on. 

I can take all that, but today, we got on a scissor lift together. I don't think I was technically supposed to be on it because I was supposed to be the ""spotter"" and I'm not certified in scissor lifts or whatever. Anyway, as soon as we got to... death height, he started purposefully rocking the bucket side to side. I had to yell at him to stop and he'd do it again 5 minutes later and then be like ""I thought you weren't afraid of heights"" which I'm not.

I like the job and, I can't afford to lose it. And I'm afraid reporting it could get me fired since I wasn't supposed to be on the lift. What should I do? Is there anything I can do beyond just asking to not work with him anymore for the other reasons mentioned?",24Sep2019,2
899,"Last night by 2am I kidnapped a brown mouse while it was rummaging through my room bin. It had made my window curtain its abode, and for months my attempts at poisoning it were futile. I took the mouse outside to the general trash and shut it there, thinking my room will now be mouse free. 

It is now 12am, Wednesday.

Two minutes ago I saw a tiny mouse in the same location I trapped the brown one, and 5 minutes ago There was another slightly larger one crawling over my curtains.

What have I done?! I just realised that she came to my room to scavenge for her children. I had noticed the past few times I saw it that it was getting scrawnier, and took that as a good sign of less edibles in the environment. Throwing her in the bin, a small part of me hoped she could get all the food she wanted,at least until the binman shows up.

What should I do? Catching these animals is no easy task. I'm very much inclined to just place poisons again, maybe she hasn't taught them how to choose.",24Sep2019,1

901,"Ok so I’m an 18 years old confused dumbass who happened to fall deeply in love with a friend of mine. This girl is really sweet and clever and I honestly would do anything for her. The problem is, I need to ask her out ! I have no ideas on how to proceed. Knowing the fact that we both usually push our emotions aside, it won’t be possible for me to start randomly holding her hand without having her freaking out (honestly I’d have the same reaction) so I’m looking for a more subtle way, that would allow both of us to stay calm (because yeah I also suck at talking about feelings) and the fact that I’m also a girl complicates things quite a lot lmao

Honestly any advice, commentary or suggestion would be really helpful !

902,"Title says most of it.

I'm currently back to living with my grandmother who is sick and has had a bad hoarding issue for my whole life. When I first moved out it was bad but between being moved out and moved back in it seemed to man manifested into a huge neck beard nest problem. It's affected the whole house. The living room is full of garbage, kitchen has garbage, the room I need to move in is full of shit, laundry piled up etc.

I'm not sure how this had happened but I have my theories. 

I myself am not the cleanest but can't live like this and have decided to help clean as much as I can. the problem is that she doesn't want the help or have even began taking any garbage (she calls it 'recyling')or any of the donations to the thrift store. I know she's sick and can't so I want to do it myself. Im just one person though 

Does anyone have advice on how to begin to clean up as a single person? I want to make an ad on Craiglist to pay someone to just pick it up and drop it off for me but I have no experience in this.

Any advice is helpful. Thank you!",24Sep2019,1
903,"Let’s call my friend Mike, his girlfriend Alice, and Alice’s ex Josh. They’re all in high school. 
Josh was abusive to Alice in their relationship (I don’t think physically) and has nudes of her. When he found out Alice was dating Mike he sent her nudes to Alice’s mom. 

Alice’s mom is a piece of work and told Alice she deserved it and grounded her.  Alice went to the school counselor about the harassment but Alice’s mom told her not to talk about the nudes. The counselor told Josh he couldn’t go near Alice and changed their schedules so they couldn’t interact at school. 

A while later Josh comes up to Mike and tells him that if Alice doesn’t stop talking about him he’ll send more nudes to her mom and people at school. 
Josh is just going to use the nudes as a weapon and no matter what they do he’s probably going to send them around. 

If the authority’s got involved this could be resolved but Alice’s mom is against that. Advice? Alice is a highly anxious person and this has all been a lot on her.",24Sep2019,3
904,"okay, so basically, lately ive been having extreme anxiety over this one piece of homework to the point where i feel i am not physically able to do it. 

i have this one piece of english homework that should be easy and should take about 20 minutes to do, but just a one second look at it for me and i am just hit with a wave of anxiety and i dont know why. i avoided doing this homework in the first place because i hate doing research but now all i want to do is even just start it. 

the part that is confusing to me, though, is this strange kind of anxiety i get about it, which i only began to experience 2-3 weeks ago. to describe it the best i can, its like my whole body goes kind of rigid and then i have this urge to hit myself and i have to lie on my left arm or stay completely still and distract myself for the feeling to stop. 

in the past i have had trouble doing homework because of feelings of anxiety but never to this extent. its gotten so bad i have resorted to asking my friends to do it for me because i just physically cant. it was due in today so i just told her (my teacher) i didnt know we had to write it down and i will send it to her in an email tonight. well its been tonight and i havent started it let alone handed it in, so i plan on sending it in (if i even have it by then) in the morning and mentioning in the email that i didnt realise it hadn't sent last night. 

please if anyone has experience with this or knows how to deal with it let me know!",24Sep2019,1

I am not capable of speaking to her it seems: I don't notice when she has a problem, i don't know how to approach her after a fight, i don't improve it seems.


She felt like I don't care about what she is doing (course/study), because i didn't ask. On top, she feels like she is talking to a ""wall"".

906,"My boyfriend and I just moved in together and we both have adult male dogs. Mine is a Intact Male Husky/Lab mix (Calvin), and his is a Neutered Lab/Pit mix (Jack). They’re both about 3 years old. They don’t just hate each other to where they can’t be in the same room, but they can’t play with each other. Calvin is used to being around a 2 year old female lab (Sunny). They would play fight all the time. They never even played with toys, just each other. Jack lived with a big Cane Corso that bullied him and when they did fight, it was way tougher than any play fighting that Calvin and Sunny did. At first, when Jack would attack Calvin to “play” (??), Calvin just kinda got defensive. But now, because of Jack’s aggressiveness, Calvin gets aggressive back. It’s to the point when we have to rip them apart and they still try to lunge at each other while we’re holding them. I’ve even been bit trying to break them up. They’re both sweet dogs, they just can’t seem to handle being around each other while they’re excited.",24Sep2019,1

908,"We stopped being friends because she was hanging out and dating my rapist. I told her I didn't feel comfortable around him and she made no effort whatsoever to hangout with me afterwards. I'm still so upset that she left me for him. It's none of my business who she dates but I warned her about him. He's a pedophile, 18 dating a 13 year old.

We had an argument when I told her she hasn't hung out with me and I caught her in a lie, afterwards she went on to say very mean things to me that have affected me mentally and physically. I used to be great at English, math and science but since our fall out I've been failing my classes and lost interest in everything. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. Like maybe she was right, maybe I am a shitty person who nobody will ever love, after all I couldn't keep the one friend I had.

909,"It happened again. It’s happened before and history is repeating itself. I thought they’d be there forever. I trusted them. I loved them with my entire being. I wanted the best for them in life. I’m happy that they are happy. I have my all to them.

But maybe they didn’t put their all into me.

And now they are slowly falling away.

My best friend of six years was the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I still believe this to be true. I will cherish the experiences and memories I’ve shared with them forever. 

Both of us managed to get out of a very toxic friendship which only strengthened our relationship. They were the sibling I never had. 

I became more kind and gentle than I thought possible. I’d gotten happier. I owed it all to them. My self esteem finally reached a high point. I believed in myself like never before.

But now that’s falling away too.

They found other people. Other people that I assume make them happier than I did. People who used to be rude to us and still are to me. People who I believed never cared. They started ditching me to hangout with them. They actively avoid my very person unless I’m the only one there. A week ago, I asked them a question and they turned away to start another conversation. 

Never had I seen such indifference from them. Never have I felt more rejected than that moment. The moment I realized their disinterest my blood turned to ice. 

I felt numb. 
I still do. 

The self-hate has returned.

I’m not sure I can return from it this time. 
I don’t know what to do.
I don’t have anyone to talk to. 
I know I need help but I don’t know where to go from here. 

How do I tell them I’m feeling isolated? How do I become their friend again? Should I even try? How do I regain my ability to trust? How do I stop this from happening again?",24Sep2019,1
912,"Have a Samsung TV, and Xfinity. I went to apps, then Prime Video. I clicked the “Free Prime trial” button, and next thing I knew it said “You’re all set!” and now the TV has free Prime. But it never asked me to make a username or log in. 

I’ve called amazon and checked every single possible email address and phone number, I’ve checked the app on the tv, I’ve checked the TV settings. None of them has an active Prime trial or membership. 

I now have a Prime trial and have NO WAY of finding out the account info in order to cancel it, so this is going to be running for infinity years. The only remaining solution is to check my credit card bills after a month, but this was a used TV so it could be some past owner who gets charged.
