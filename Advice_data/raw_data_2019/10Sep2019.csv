0,"So I guess my (26m) main question is: is it healthy to just hang it up after years of constant rejection? I have a lot of friends and have never really struggled to make new ones. My close friends tell me I'm a good person, I was a chef for a good while, play several instruments and sing, am employed full time with a decent income, and in pretty good shape. You're never exactly who you want to be, but I feel like I'm on the right path to being me. Only thing is, I've not been in a loving or lasting relationship for close to 5 years now. 

I try to spark something up when I meet an interesting woman, but it never pans out. The crazy thing is most of the time when I ask a girl out for a drink or whatever I almost always get a yes that is inevitably flaked out on. It makes me feel like women are afraid to say no to me. It makes it harder and harder to ask anyone because I feel like I'm probably just making them uncomfortable. Needless to say it's definitely messed with my confidence and self image and I don't know if it's really worth it to keep trying. I feel incredibly lonely and wonder if it's because I am so focused on trying to find some company with no success. Everyone says not to worry, that someone will come along who you never expect. I just don't know anymore if that's actually true or just a comforting platitude. 

So is it a healthier alternative to just try not to focus on it anymore or are you supposed to just keep playing the odds with your fingers crossed?",10Sep2019,1

Recently tho, I have lost my motivation due to really stressful calls and just right down being treated like shit by some of my patient and other staff that I work with from other hospitals. I have decided to turn to another career path, hopefully one where I can find my motivation again. I cant just leave my job since I have Bill's to pay, and I make 14/he, so anything above will be a nice pay increase. Thing is, I have no idea where to go from here.

13,"I recently discovered my passion is making music and helping others grow. When I make music it just feels amazing. And the idea of utilizing music to help people feels even better.

I created a YouTube channel where I plan on prpvoding music for sleep, meditation and concentration. And I also want to later down the road add guided meditations, yoga videos and music performances. A mix of things I'm skilled at/passionate about.

I have everything perfectly planned out and I know the root of my procrastination is my fear of failure or harsh criticism. 

I have started a lot of small businesses/ideas in the past and have failed to commit to them multiple times because they didn't feel right or I was afraid of failure.

But I know this is the one idea that fits perfectly for me and feels right. I know that I can make the channel happen. Yet for some reason every day that passes I don't create (or do very little). I get overwhelmed and then distract myself.

22,"Hey guys! Im fairly new to reddit so my apologies if I make any noob mistakes :/

So to start off, I am in my second year of college. I have been producing electronic music on and off since I was in 7th grade, and the reason for that is because back in 2011-2013, it wasn't really the ""cool"" thing to be doing when I would be open about it. I got picked on and let people's opinions dictate my life. One of the biggest things I do regret. 

These days, I wake up and go to sleep crying because of how bad I want this and how far I dream, simply because of my love and passion for music. I spend 6+ hours a day studying marketing tactics and promotion to help my brand in the future, while also perfecting my craft to the fullest extent that I can. But lately certain things have been on my mind constantly, and it's things that nobody around me in real life can relate to or talk about with me. 

I have a very low self esteem. I tend to always say I am my own worst enemy. I struggle with depression, and I spend every day of my current life hating where I am and what I am doing. I attend a shitty community college in a state ranked nearly dead last in education and I have a shitty minimum wage job. I never was the best student, so naturally all my life my parents have been on top of me about grades, and were never nice about it either. They have a work hard, get a degree and be set for life type of ethic, which I understand why, coming from a time period where that was the normal. My family is not too open about discussing feelings or such things like that either. I grew up with nobody to talk to. 

Lately, I have been losing many friends, realizing that I was almost always the only one who put in effort anyway. I had a girlfriend that I would tell everything to, but distance from colleges separated us and things didn't work out. We tried to be friends but the situation got so toxic that we had to stop communication, on a mutual level. 

So here I am, with nobody to really talk or vent to. I have been consumed with my inner thoughts destroying me, so much that it hurts my work ethic and it is now starting to get in the way of doing the one thing I love, which is creating music. My head is so cloudy that I cannot shake it off, and my chest constantly feels numb and heavy from the inner sadness that takes over my whole self. 

I came here to get various minds of advice. School is such a distraction to me, and I wish I could just work full time and pursue my dreams, but I know my parents would be very upset with me if I even MENTIONED that. I am not the biggest extrovert, and I am not into regular college kid things such as partying or meeting new people at bars and such. I always enjoyed smoking and creating more than drinking and getting into drama/trouble. If anyone wants to pitch in some food for thought, about anything I mentioned, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you guys.

We hanged around people who aren't afraid of their sexuality, we have friends who hug or kiss bestfriend. We have a friend, whom is bisexual, who constantly hits on my boyfriend and they grab eachother asses and crack jokes. With that being said, talking about sex openly with cool people who understand was something normal to us.


So here comes the dilemma... His co-work is a very cool person, she's very straight forward and me and my boyfriend both respect her. She's open and directed and we always wanted to have her back because my boyfriend,  being so naive, always let people walk all over him. She was there to stick up for him when everyone else at work puts him down. My boyfriend would never want to make her uncomfortable, she was a good friend.

Going back to the mistake he did to cause the sexual harassment allegation. Both him and the coworker were chatting after work. The subject of relationships came up and then it led to body types. I'm a small girl and my chest... well, is small. My boyfriend would never change anything about me but he was just curious on how it was like to have a bigger set. He asked his coworker about it because she had a bigger chest. He ask her stuff like if her breast got in the way or made her back hurt because he's always heard that stuff can happened. Throughout the whole conversation my boyfriend kept confirming if she was okay with this conversation and she said yes it's fine. My boyfriend being curious, he ask if he'd be able to understand that weight of her type of chest. (Basically asking to feel how heavy they are) He asked if she was okay with that, and she said she reassured him that it was fine but wouldnt do that because she has a boyfriend. Though out the whole conversation he kept saying to her ""I'm sorry, is this all okay?"" And she kept reassuring him, even telling him that he is his own person and he can do whatever he wants. He understood but felt weird about the subject and it was dropped and it was never talked about again.


Dont get me wrong, he was stupid for ever thinking that was an okay topic to talk about. Even if most of our friends think openly and positive about their bodies, he shouldn't have said what he said. Even he tell me he regret says it and hope I can still look at him the same.

And I do understand him, I'd be curious too about how heavy bigger chest can be but he made the mistake on asking a coworker about it. He has no sexual desire to that friend. He said he was just curious on the weight and that even a prosthetic chest would be fine too. 

Now he's devastated about it, he does regret bringing that topic up but he's upset that his coworker didnt comfront him and told him want he did was wrong. She just went to their boss and now we dont know what will happen.

We tried texting her and asking her if she would want to talk about it. Then my boyfriend boss messaged him and ask him to stop trying to contact her. I guess she told the boss about us trying to reach her.

We dont know what to do. He fucked up and it feels like we're stuck..",10Sep2019,0
38,"Earlier this year I broke up with my girlfriend on March and it has been months since Iv bothered to get on the dating scene again. I‚Äôm nerdy guy and I‚Äôm working hard at my job and school so I can work in the tech field.

I have talked to a few girls but I never felt that I had the same connection that I had with my ex. My ex gf was a nerdy girl too so we had a lot of things in common and always had a good time. Now I don‚Äôt feel the same with other girls. 

I feel that I got too comfortable being alone and talking to my guy friends that I don‚Äôt feel like trying to make the move on getting a girl. I developed an attitude where it‚Äôs up to the girl to like me and I‚Äôll see things from there if she wants to go on a date.

39,"TL;DR: the last paragraph sums it up pretty quickly :/

Hi, I am a sophomore in high school and my parents have been divorced since I was 10. It was not a bad divorce at all, they made a point not to fight in front of us, they were very smart about it and put us kids first always.

So bam, my parents are divorced. My dad has a girlfriend (who I love!) and my mom has a boyfriend. I really like her boyfriend too! But today a text popped up on her phone where her boyfriend said that ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt sure what caused this need for space...‚Äù and then it ended. Yes, I looked at her messages. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have, but come on what would you have done??

So basically my mom wants a break from her boyfriend and this makes me extremely sad. I really really want her to be happy, and things were going so well and I loved it. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so sad. And I don‚Äôt know how to be happy
If my mom isn‚Äôt happy. I just want everything to be the way it was a few days ago.

Does anyone have any advice for me or words to make me feel better? Thank you :(",10Sep2019,1

I heard yelling and went outside for a second to hear better and it sounded like someone hit someone else. I think the lady left in her car, but the guy was still outside of my apartment on his phone. He later went inside. I called 911 while this was all happening and answered all their questions. The dispatcher said they would send the police as soon as they could, but it's been over 30 minutes and they haven't sent anybody. I'm really concerned for that lady, the dog, and also myself.

42,"He was encouraging and hinting I should get an abortion.... never gonna happen. Its not what I felt was right, extinguishing  a life was not my answer and I never thought he‚Äôd be that way. I told him I couldn‚Äôt he said he could loose everything his practice his license everything if I kept the baby. We had been seeing each other for over 2 years.  But with him being so set on me having an abortion I had to get out of that relationship I chose my child over him. His negative was to overwhelming for me. I know he could lose his license to practice and his doctors office that he owns. I let it go for awhile, and tried to move forward. I‚Äôm 22 weeks pregnant and I‚Äôm resentful and I feel that he got off too easily, I feel stupid for just jetting without telling him how he made me feel.

43,"A few months ago my partner of 8 years cheated on me and left me for his employee. We had a house, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and have a two year old. I was a stay at home mom and had no job and a joint account with him. Fast forward through the homeless struggle for the past few months and now I have a job, am living with my parents, and will have enough money to get my own place soon. My ex told me he is going to rehome one of our dogs because she has too much energy and he works too much. I told him I would take her and figure out the details later but everyone I speak to about this is telling me to just rehome her.. they say this because I am now a single mom, working full time and going to school full time (I am also in therapy once a week working on unresolved trauma so every aspect of my life is quite hectic).. she is a 4 year old golden retriever with a massive amount of energy and the place I'm on a waiting list for will not even have a backyard. Am I selfish to try to make this work? Because I am overwhelmed thinking about everything, but we've had her since she was a puppy, I cant stand to lose her too. What should I do?",10Sep2019,1
44,"So this is going to be a long one. To start off with I'm gay. The vast majority of my friends know but my parents don't. Over the past year I've started falling in love, not love love yet but for lack of a better word love, with my best friend of 16 years. These feelings used to come and go. Like some times I'd feel it and other times I wouldn't.

He's straight, but to be honest I feel like I get mixed signals sometimes. It's hard to explain what those are 'cause it's the little things like body language, something he'd say, or do. I got up the courage one night to tell him I was struggling with how I feel towards him. He understands, he took it really well, he turned me down, and wants to help me through it. However, now that I've told him these feelings of love haven't gone away but intensified.

It's been a little over a month since I've told him. He's trying to be there for me. Like he'll ask what he needs to do to help. All I asked was don't talk about girls around me, keep physical contact to a minimum, and don't change clothes around me (We do physical activities a lot so often times we got to change shirts afterwards). But I feel like he's not really doing that much. I try not to take it too hard when he talks about girls and who he likes. I just don't react when, for lack of a better description, tickles my sides or knee and I look away when he changes.¬†

Yet just the other day he was telling me about how he had sex with this random girl who played at the venue he works at. That absolutely destroyed me. He didn't understand why I took it so hard because it meant nothing to him, but it hurt me so bad and still does. 

I still get mixed signals from time to time. I'm not sure if it's just me being hopeful or if they really are mixed signals. For example we were out drinking a little and on our way home we got to talking about all this. He told me ""do whatever you need to do to get over it. Don't think about it. Just do it. '' My go to whenever I hear something this is to say ""What if I kiss you. Like full blown make out. Tongue and all.""¬† Usually that gets them to drop it. His response is. ""I'd tell you I'm not into that, but if it helps you should do it."" I didn't do it, I just wasn't expecting that answer. It makes me feel like he wants to but he is scared to try to be with me.¬†

I have no one else to talk to about this. I usually talk to my best friend because he's always there for me and talks to me about things like this. I go to him all the time with issues surrounding my sexuality. But it's hard since I'd be talking to him about him. He says that's ok and do your best but I still hold back everything I want to say.¬†

We've been talking and we still want to be friends with each other. This doesn't bug him, or make him uncomfortable, or anything of that stuff. Yet to me this is basically a friendship killer because all the negativity that comes with it, but I don't want that. I want to stay best friends, I don't want to lose him. He says he's different than everyone else and this won't end our friendship like it did with other guys I've felt this way for. He tells me there is nothing I could do that would make him not want to stay friends. 

This is a rundown of everything that has been going on recently, at least the key points, and it has sent me into a really bad depression. My drinking/ alcoholism kicked back in, I feel sad all the time, very few things that make me happy, I feel empty... I just don't know what to do. I want to stop feeling so depressed. Since we still want to be friends I don't want to cut him out of my life, but I feel like I need to. But then that will make people ask questions and it's not something I'm super open with yet.

 No one else knows who it is I have these feeling for but I've told a few friends a little bit of what's going on. I desperately need advice. I feel like I need space, but then I'll be alone. I have no one else I'm even that remotely close to where I can talk to them about my life and that'll be there for me. Yet at the same time I hurt almost ever day. Some days aren't as bad as other but it's one of the worst feeling I've ever felt. All I want to do is be with him and see where it goes. Like most people get to do. We both care for each other a lot and neither of us want our friendship to end.",10Sep2019,3

56,"(This is on mobile sorry for any errors in my spelling or typos. And I know stuff like this is brought up often in this sub but I wasn‚Äôt sure where else to ask. Anyways) 

I‚Äôve been seeing this girl for about five months (though we met six months ago through one of my coworkers), the problem with this relationship is that whenever i‚Äôve tried to ask her to go out 90% of the time she had some reason or excuse as too why she couldn‚Äôt even for the first date. After the first date she first off said she wanted me to be her boyfriend, which I declined and said that I wanted to wait a little while, (Which right now we are officially boyfriend and girlfriend )then said that she wanted to plan out the second one. Which I was on board for, she claimed she wanted to go out the week after our first one. Which never happened. It took about a month before I said screw it and I planned the second date myself, which same as the first she had a few reasons/excuses as to why she couldn‚Äôt which wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal to me. If she had bothered to reschedule. Anyways during the date she told me how she had put in this place to  get a second job. Which of course she got hired onto, now up to this point she has been going to college, has a had a job, and she is going to college. At the same time so adding another job kinda took up her schedule. And spite her saying once again that she wanted to plan out the third date, she didn‚Äôt. (Honestly she had some time before the second job) about a few weeks later I got a text from her showing me a picture of her in a hospital bed with a needle in her arm. (Another thing I skipped she had claimed how she wanted us to be like best friends/partners). I asked her why she was there? What hospital she was staying at? I waited three days, (I did lightly text her just to check up but she hardly responded, which she was in the hospital so i‚Äôm not mad at that whatsoever, just wanted to put that) . it took me writing a paragraph too her basically saying. How we are supposed to be partners, how she said we should have each others backs. After that I got a text from her saying she is sorry, that she was in the hospital because supposedly she had a tumor in her head. And that she had passed out at work because she accidentally hit it. And it was followed up by three pictures of her in the hospital. With us texting a little more talking about how we are going to tell things to each other more often. Anyways things are ok for a little while. Though by this time I am a little frustrated because of all the hours she is working, that and days (plural) would go by where she wouldn‚Äôt respond to a text. Until I brought up that we should take a break (This was on memorial day) because I wanted to take a step back and see if this is worth it and I wanted to get a look at myself. Too see if i‚Äôm overreacting or if I should really be concerned.  Again I typed out a short paragraph. Then again she said how sorry she is, that she loves me, she has been going through a depression, then said how her dad was saying that she is worthless, and that she is currently taking anti-depressants to get better. (Something I didn‚Äôt put but early on she did tell me how her childhood was horrible, so that and what her dad was saying to her set her to be depressed) with all that I decided not to take the break. After this she began to text me more frequently and said she quit her second job. Which sometime after that I asked her if she wanted to go out and do something (At this point it had been about a month and a half since we had done anything together, well aside from the occasional work visit.) again she said she couldn‚Äôt because she has a internship. At a hospital. A week or two has passed and i‚Äôm reconsidering the whole break thing. I wanna know two things, one am I being selfish, overreacting or/and being insensitive. And what should do about myself or this relationship? Do we need a break? To break up? Or am I being a jerk.

I don't even know how to kick this off

I'm a 26 m and I feel like my family has done nothing but made my life hell. My dad has always been a bully to us kids and I'm sick of it. I've got more memories of getting the shit kicked out of me than good ones. And everytime i reflect on what I did to deserve it, I always come up blank. I've moved halfway across the states just to get away from them. I mostly blame my dad because he munipulate the rest of the family to be afraid of him or they just say he won't change. I think he just enjoys the control. I was home for three years after leaving home for 5. And every year we almost got into a fist fight because he was being an asshole and I wasn't having it. It finally took a fight about my niece for him to tell my mom that I need to get the fuck out. So I did. But I didn't give him my address. Just told him who I was gonna be staying with. Well he looked up my friends and says he has their address. I know he does because he used to work for a company that is able to do that. It pissed my friends off because he has no right to know that kind of information. It's gotten so bad that I want to change my name and start a new life. I just don't want to leave the rest of my family to his power hungry bullshit. I fear the next time I talk to him that I'll have to explain to him that what he is doing is pushing us kids away. But I don't think he'll listen to me and just want to fight. I just don't know what else to do. I love my family but he is making our lives hell for no reason.

61,"This is gonna be a pretty long story, because the events that have built up to where I am have been going on for almost 4 years at this point.

I have had a close group of friends for a couple of years now, and it has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I became close with these 3 people around the beginning of my Junior year of High school, and we have been almost inseparable since. Coming from a history of being ignored by just about everyone I know, as well as bullying and borderline hazing my freshman and sophomore years, I considered that group the most important thing to me for a long time.

All four of us ended up going to the same University for various reasons, as well as one of the girls boyfriend, who is a sophomore and also one of the people who used to bully/haze me. After they started dating, we made up pretty well, and have gotten along well in the limited interaction we've had from him being in college.

Once we moved in, things went well for a while, we all got along, and I was having the time of my life. One night they all go to a party without me, at someone's house we had already been to once. They lied about the whole thing, and did a really poor job of it. The next day when I saw them again I was ready to explode, and the boyfriend talked to me one on one, and we made up, and then I went and talked to each of them about it and they all apologized and said it won't happen again.

After the whole incident I became extremely paranoid,  partially because I was afraid of being left again, and partially because I have had trust issues for a long time at this point, and I got really bad about looking at their locations on Snapchats map. I realize now and even realized at that point that this was unhealthy, and it led to a moment of pretty bad hostility between myself and two of them after they told me they wanted to stay in and then went out together. I apologized about this immediately because I realized it was really overdone and unnecessary, and I felt really bad about it. That night I spent a lot of time reflecting, and worked together a long apology, because I genuinely felt bad.

I went to text one of them that I wanted to talk the next morning about it, and that I felt bad, but before I texted I looked at snapchats map again, and they were all back at the other guys house, and they hadn't told me... Again. I texted the one guy who I hadn't offended earlier, and vented to him for a long time about it, because I was naturally upset that they all did the exact thing they said they wouldn't do again.

I still went through with apologizing the next day, and we talked through it again, and they all (except for the boyfriend) apologized, again. Then later on the boyfriend texts me and says they are all going back over to the house again, and I'm not invited, again, for a different reason this time. He then proceeded to yell at me about the day before, and we did not make up from that. 

After that, I was naturally pretty upset, because despite the fact that my actual friends had all apologized twice now, they agreed to go with him again, and I was left back in my dorm alone.

The next day our school had a football game, and we did all go to this together, even though it was really tense, and I felt left out of all the conversation because all they talked about was the night before, which I was not involved in. After the game, the boyfriend and his girlfriend agree to go to the guys house, again, and invite the other two, one of who didn't go because her boyfriend was over from another school, and the other who stayed behind because he genuinely felt bad for me. This still upset me, and I honestly got way to aggressive when I called them out for still not inviting me, even though everyone else wasn't going, I said that wasn't the point and called them out for being fully willing to go hang out without me again.

Two days later, and one by one each of them has prevented me from seeing them on Snapchat (except for the guy who stayed behind with me) and I just don't trust them to actually do anything with them anymore. I've talked to everyone except for the boyfriend about it, he refuses to say a word to me at all at this point, and we are all on good terms. I'm terrified all the time that I'm going to be left in my dorm again, and I don't have enough homework to do to distract myself. The fact that I've been in my dorm upset every time they've left me has gotten me to the point where I don't feel comfortable in my room anymore, and just being in here makes me upset, I don't trust my friends, and I don't know if I could live with losing them. I'm stressed out to the point where I cannot function normally in my room, and I have talked to everyone I can think of about it, and nobody knows what I should do. Any kind of advice would be useful to me at this point, because I'm tired of not being able to sleep or trust anyone about anything.

I don't know if it's relevant but I have spent time with everyone except for the boyfriend since the football game, and things are still great when we spend time together, which would make it even worse if I lost them, because we all still get along as long as he isn't around.",10Sep2019,1

I want to change my life style and lose weight. I just want to be healthy and don‚Äôt want an complications once I grow up (too expensive). Another reason is I want to wear nice clothes that are easy to find and be able to do fun stuff without getting tired. Such as: hiking, running, sports, and etc. I want to change my lifestyle. I also need to fix my sleeping schedule.

Lately I‚Äôve been very exhausted too.


Currently, I‚Äôm a full time HS student with some college classes and work 2 part time jobs. 

So here‚Äôs what my schedule is like: 

Monday-Friday:

School: 7:30AM-2:50 PM 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Monday-Thursday:

1st Work: 3PM-5PM
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Winter Season is similar but without Musical.

Instead I have ;

Speech: Twice a week and Saturdays are comp. day

One Act: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday (3-4PM)

Art and Choir is also still going on.


I have a very tight schedule. Any tips or advices I can use? I still want to change myself. I need a healthier version of me. So please. Any advice will do.",10Sep2019,1

I've run into a few red flags (i dont wanna specify them) and theres excuses for each one that make sense but also dont in some ways and I'm not quite sure what to believe because I have no way of proving otherwise. So I just continue to just convince myself everything is fine and just keep not wanting to face the truth. I'm afraid of finding out the other person is a liar. I'm absolutely terrified because I always figured ""dont ask questions you dont want to know the answer to"" and I really dont wanna know the answer to the question of whether the other person has been lying to me or not. It's too difficult to face and I love them with every fiber in my being. They have no idea how much I love them and dont want to lose them.

68,"So if you look at my post history you'll see im considering moving into a house with my friends. Today after college classes finished I went to check out the house itself. Right now my friends brother is cleaning it out and will then remodel it to update some stuff to it. This lady was apparently a hoarder which I have no doubt of as there were newspapers from 1974 scattered on the floor and three year expired soda in the fridge and original Pringle cans (from the 70's I kid you not.) Lots of antiques as well. 

As we went to the upstairs level we checked out the bathroom there and it seemed messy, but normal for the most part until I looked at the door. This lady had finger painted 9 crosses on each side of the bathroom door. 3 across on the top, middle and bottom. It weirded me out so badly because none of the other doors was like this. I told our friend about it and that I might cleanse the house because that means the old woman who formerly lived there might have thought she was being haunted or something and I do not like taking chances seeing as though I tend to attract some freaky paranormal stuff for some reason. She thinks it might be because the lady was a devote Catholic, she also has the date the house was blessed written in chalk right above the front entrance but it wasn't even legible. Now I can tell you I've met devote Catholics before, plenty and I've NEVER seen their doors in their homes with painted crosses on them. But I'm wondering if I'm just overreacting as this lady was a hoarder and was maybe mentally ill?",10Sep2019,1

72,"I'm a 19 year old male feeling very lost in life. I'm a 2nd year undergraduate at one of the top universities in the US, but I feel like I have no friends, no social life, and a big lack of direction. I have hopes and dreams of joining the US intelligence community after college, but prior experiences during freshman year preclude me from these applications, and I have no backup plan. I failed a class in freshman year which dropped my GPA significantly, immediately shutting down the possibility of postgraduate opportunities I had once been working so hard to obtain and some of the dreams I had before coming to college. I'm surrounded by smart and brilliant people who are diligently working on their careers, but after coming back to school this Fall ready to turn things around, I failed to get into any classes I'm interested in and I feel like I'm wasting tuition money getting a degree taking classes I'm not interested in.

I peaked in high school and while living abroad (graduated high school at 16, skipped senior year, and left on a scholarship to study and start a company that didn't work out), and feel like the 3 years since (one living abroad, and the rest of the time spent at school) has been aimless. I have drifted apart from my family since leaving at 16, who I used to be very close with. They about some of my destructive behaviors and have lost trust and hope in me, like they used to. I also have significant regrets about attending the school that I do now, I passed up two full-ride merit scholarships to other (less) prestigious schools, but declined in favor of the prestige of my current school. I wish I had instead taken one of those offers, and used that financial independence to pursue other hobbies and goals of mine. I'm now working a minimum wage job to pay basic expenses.

I don't work out, don't have a friend circle (I spend most of my time with my girlfriend), have a lot of acne, and because of this don't feel confident in my physique or appearance. I don't play sports and don't really have any hobbies (the hobbies I would like to pursue are either really expensive or illegal and dangerous i.e. my parents disapprove).

TLDR: I feel like I've lost my work ethic, my resolve to dream big and be ambitious, but most importantly to work hard to achieve goals like I used to. My advice is how to find direction again and get back on my feet. I can't remember the last time I felt hopeful and energized for the future was.",10Sep2019,1

I know that I may sound like a baby saying this, but it's really starting to affect me.

For example, I ran for Class Secretary, spent many many hours making flyers and handouts for my campaign. Then when election day came, this popular student (who did absolutely no campaigning) won the job of secretary.

I knew that I should have kept my hopes low, but I put so much effort into the campaign, that I was somewhat confident that I could win. When I lost, I felt deviated and defeated.

74,"So several years ago I started learning to play guitar and it went fairly well, but between health issues that made playing painful, stress, and moving I ended up stopping. Now its been 3+ years since I stopped and I want to start learning again. The pain is no longer an issue, I'm older and better at handling stress and I just started a job that more or less has been great and will get better once I know more about the job/company.

The only issue is I don't want to invest time and money into lessons if I can't handle it. I'm now at the point that I want to learn, but between forgetting everything and not having much other than my guitars to learn I don't know where to start again. I've also had issues with public attention and while I want to learn how to play the idea of playing in front of people scares me, but I still want to do it.

I'm a huge fan of Gregory Alan Isakov, Mumford and Sons(especially hopeless wanderer), Gaslight Anthem, and most music that would pop up on their pandora playlists.

I'm not wanting handouts or freebies, I just want advice and opinions on what I should do. If anyone has ran into this and overcome it I'd really like to know how you did so. Many thanks ahead of time to anyone who takes that time to read this post.",10Sep2019,1

but anyways!!! to keep it short n simple there‚Äôs just been so much going on in my life for the past 5+ years. 
now that i‚Äôm older and out of high school, i feel like maybe i should give a therapist another try. 
what‚Äôs mainly feeding this thought is the fact that i‚Äôm so alone and barely have any friends and people that i‚Äôm close with. i have so much struggle and pain with no one to go to, so all these different feelings build up and it‚Äôs a cluster of an unexplainable feeling i‚Äôve been dealing with for so long. i‚Äôm very independent y‚Äôall, i don‚Äôt rely on ppl for happiness and such but i‚Äôm sure some of u can relate,, it feels good to know someone cares and is there to listen and help out, idk. 
i‚Äôm always helping people and going out of my way to make others happy and show them that someone cares and is there for them. but god forbid anyone do the same for me. 
idk why. i know that i‚Äôm vulnerable to being manipulated and caring too much and shit,,,, but hEy right now im not gonna get too much off into a tangent, gotta cut down to the point now. 

i want to give a therapist another go. 
except this isn‚Äôt easy to rly do...... 
if i tell my parents i want to see a therapist again, my dad will laugh at me and my mom is so unstable and i don‚Äôt want her to have a breakdown. i‚Äôm only 19 so i‚Äôm still livin at home, going to college and unemployed. we use the same insurance obviously so if i see a therapist there‚Äôs gonna be some type of cost + insurance coverage. and if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know yet, therapy sure ain‚Äôt affordable!! love that. 
and yes, i‚Äôve tried seeing if my college campus has some type of mental health assistance program or counselor but they don‚Äôt bc the ‚Äúgovernment wont fund them‚Äù??? sounds like a bit of an issue don‚Äôt y‚Äôall think??? 

i wish it were easy to speak to a professional to help me cope and understand all this shit in my head. idk how i‚Äôm going to see a therapist or if i‚Äôm even going to ever get help??? 
idk what to do or where to go. 

i honestly feel so helpless and this feeling never goes away. my journal is great all i have is my journal which does relieve some tensbut there‚Äôs more to it. it doesn‚Äôt help me understand my own head and how i can not feel this way anymore. i want to be happy. i want to love myself. i know i can work for it and find ways to be happy. but i can‚Äôt explain it, i just wish i had an understanding to everything and want to give a therapist another go. i feel so helpless and just miserable all the time. i don‚Äôt know what to do so if you guys have any advice let me know. any methods i can do on my own? do i just ask my dad and in hopes he doesn‚Äôt degrade me for wanting to see a therapist again? 
it‚Äôs also expensive so that‚Äôs rly the biggest issue which is out of all of our control hsjsjdjdjkdksk
IDK this is such a messy cluster post i‚Äôm sO sorry. idk what to do and been thinking bout this for a couple months now.

85,"Long story short, I had a rather rough undergraduate experience. I failed out after my first semester, retook some classes at a tech school, and transferred to a new 4 year college my sophmore year. I took the new school as a fresh start, a chance to do better. While I did do better, I still struggled. I was a Psychology major. During your junior year, you apply to officially be in the program. Because of failing my first semester, and still somewhat struggling in school, I knew I wouldn't get into the program, so I changed my major. I ended up changing my major to Women Studies. I don't know why I chose that major, I think it was because I had some friends that were women's studies majors, and I didn't know what I wanted to do, so instead of go undecided, I picked women's studies on a whim. I completed the program and was about to graduate. I even walked in the graduation ceremony. I felt so lost and I had no idea what I was going to do, so during the winter interim, I went and added English studies. I did a lot of soul searching and realized I wanted to be a high school English teacher. My high school English teacher helped me the most when preparing for college. I loved all the content we learned and I excelled at that subject. Because of my poor cumulative gpa, my plan was to retake some classes, while taking my English courses. Once I raise my GPA enough, I would apply to be in the Education program. Things didn't go as planned, so I changed my plan so I would graduate with English studies and then get my Master of Arts in Teaching with licensure. I found a program that would accept my gpa (which was better since I did so well in my English courses but still not amazing). I applied and was conditionally accepted, but I had to take 3 courses that I need to br officially accepted into the program. I had a really hard time finding affordable courses, do I decided to pursue other options. 

I really admired my HR department at work, so I decided to job shadow and ask questions. I loved what I saw when I job shadowed and all my questions were answered. I really wanted to get into HR, so I found a MA in Human Resource Management. I applied and was accepted into program. I love my classes but I still feel something missing when I see my teacher friends and with the start of the school year. I can't help but wish I was doing that. 

So, I don't know what to do. I do really like HR and my courses. I don't think it was a mistake getting my Masters in HR. I really like it and I am learning alot. I can't shake this feeling though. I don't know if I should consider finding the courses I needed to take, complete those and go into the program or stay in the progam I am. The other part I am stuck with is the MA in Teaching program, I am required to do student teaching for 18 weeks, and have some clinical experience in a classroom. Student teaching is basically a full time job in itself, so that means I can't work my job now. I have bills and student loans to pay, so I can't not have an income and my fiance doesn't make enough to pay for both of our bills and such. I don't know what to do. I really love HR, but I can't shake this feeling about being a teacher. I don't know what to do.",10Sep2019,1

I used to work 2 jobs, but my parents quit both of them for me by calling my employers and telling them that I quit, without notice. They then proceeded to steal my money, both cash and in the bank.

But today I was joking around and said to my friend at the table (were in 8th grade) ""So how's the wife?"" to which he responded""Good. How about your's?"" and I said ""Imaginary."" Then the girl said ""I'm not Imaginary."" And I just kinda made an awkward :o face. Later that same period my other friend that also sits at the table asked me if I played sports. The girl replied ""No, he's too busy playing with me."" We've never hung out before out of school. I feel like she's into me, which I'm happy if she is because I like her too, but I'm not sure if she's just playing around and I'd embarrass myself if I asked her out and it might ruin our friendship.

92,"I just received 120 dollars(birthday) . Instead of going out and blowing it on some stupid stuff, this time I decided to grow it.

93,"a lil intro explanation here: 
there are a lot of things in my head. most of which i can barely put into words. i have a journal to write in here and there to relieve some pressure off my mind,
but anyways!!! to keep it short n simple there‚Äôs just been so much going on in my life for the past 5+ years. i used to see a therapist often in high school and didn‚Äôt like it, but now that i‚Äôm older and out of high school, i feel like maybe i should give a therapist another try. 

what‚Äôs mainly feeding this thought recently is the fact that my feeling of loneliness has gotten to the point where it‚Äôs consuming me more than ever before. i barely have anyone i‚Äôm close with, let alone a friend. 
because of that, i find all my thoughts build up. yes my journal can help me get some thought out but you know, sometimes it would be nice to have someone to sit down with and know somebody cares. (i‚Äôm very independent y‚Äôall, i don‚Äôt rely on ppl for happiness and such but i‚Äôm sure some of u can relate,, it feels good to know someone cares and is there to listen and help out, idk)

but yeah, i want to give a therapist another go. they could help me cope and understand my head and what i can do and in all honesty, i just want to have someone listen. (lmao since it‚Äôs their job and i honestly have no one else)
but seeing a therapist isn‚Äôt easy to do atm...... 
if i tell my parents i want to see a therapist again, my dad will be the judgmental guy he is laugh/mimic me and my mom is so unstable and i don‚Äôt want her to have a breakdown. (don‚Äôt get me wrong i love my parents to death but no ones perfect including myself lol) 
i‚Äôm only 19 so i‚Äôm still livin at home, going to college and unemployed. we use the same insurance obviously so if i see a therapist there‚Äôs gonna be some type of cost + insurance coverage. and if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know yet, therapy sure ain‚Äôt affordable!! love that. 
and yes, i‚Äôve tried seeing if my college campus has some type of mental health assistance program or counselor but they don‚Äôt bc the ‚Äúgovernment wont fund them‚Äù??? sounds like a bit of an issue don‚Äôt y‚Äôall think??? 

i just wish it were easy to speak to a professional to help me cope and understand all this shit in my head. idk how i‚Äôm going to see a therapist or if i‚Äôm ever going to get help i feel i need??? 
idk what to do or where to go. 

i feel so helpless on top of everything. i don‚Äôt know what to do so if you guys have any advice let me know. do i just ask my dad and hope he doesn‚Äôt degrade me for wanting to see a therapist again? i do wanna keep it lowkey. 
it‚Äôs also expensive so i can‚Äôt control that obviously.
IDK this is such a messy cluster post i‚Äôm sO sorry.
anyways thanks for taking the time to read &amp; possibly reply!!! much appreciation.",10Sep2019,1
94,"11 years ago I was nearly expelled from high school. Every few months I have a nightmare where I revert back to being a teenager and relive part of the six month long experience of being placed in an alternative school(this the best way I can describe where I was without going into too much detail) and having my parents and the school system argue over my fate.

The dreams are a little different every time. The setting changes slightly, or the part of the process I'm going through changes, but the context is always very apparent to me regardless. Once I start the dream I understand where I am and what is happening, almost by instinct.

There is a the pervasive feeling of powerlessness, and loss of control that is foreign to me now. In the present day reality I'm 5'10 , 220 lb powerlifter. In the dreams I feel very small. I would descibe it as being the size of a 12 year-old. 

I've been out of high school for almost a decade a graduated from college 4 years ago. I have a good job where I have a lot of autonomy and responsibility. 

In short,my life is totally different, but I still have these dreams.

TL;DR:

Is it normal to have nightmares about something that happened 11 years ago or it indicative of a bigger issue?",10Sep2019,1

I know there is a God. I took a Christian apologetics course. I‚Äôm just so surrounded by articles making strong arguments for theism and for atheism. For Pro-Afterlife and Nihilism.  I‚Äôve come to a fork in the road. I want to keep my faith. I honestly do. Should I take a break from my religion to ease my mind? Or will doing studies for arguments for my beliefs help me.

103,"Basically I‚Äôd caught this girl (that I already know and talk casually to) turning around and looking as if she was searching for someone at the back in class a few times (where I sit, whereas she sits in the middle). The next day we were talking then she asked me ‚Äúwhy do you sit at the back?‚Äù...I took that as a hint that she wanted me to sit closer to her which I did the following exam. Was I right to do that or did I throw myself onto her and came on a bit too strong? Anyways I sat closer to her the next time and after the exam she made a point not to leave immediately like she does every time and revised the exam with me. I just wanted to know what her question indicated that‚Äôs all. What do you guys think? I just want to know if her question indicated that she wanted me to sit closer to her. Would really appreciate some answers.


She also regularly looks at me when I‚Äôm not looking and always gives a wide smile every time I talk to her, also keeps the conversation going by asking questions etc but I don‚Äôt really believe in those ‚Äòsigns‚Äô.

Anyways, do you think she really wanted me to sit by her or just asked me that to cheat off me? I asked that somewhere and someone said that she was being nice just because she wanted me to do her a favor and copy my answers in the exam. The thing is, at the time I didn‚Äôt think of that possibility at all as she‚Äôs really, really shy and honestly when we sat closer to each other I was the one who always initiated the cheating, then she‚Äôd follow. Also, one of the things that happened that made rule out that possibility was that once before an exam started, she glanced at me a few times (my friend notified me of this) before coming over from the back to say hi with a wide smile...then left with her friend to sit at the back. This incident right there is why I didn‚Äôt think she was using me to cheat...I mean if she did then why would she leave with her friend to sit at the back (I was sat in the middle)? She just came over and greeted me then went with her friend. Not to mention that most of the glances/looks were outside the class...but still idk. What do you guys think?",10Sep2019,1
104,"I have a LOT of food allergies, some of them life-threatening, and some of them worsen an auto-immune disease I have(eosinophilic esophagitis). I've just started college, and I have been severely struggling to get enough food. I really need some advice on how to actually be able to eat so I don't starve and/or fail all my classes.
So my entire list of foods I avoid are: soy, dairy, peanuts, eggs, gluten, bananas, nectarines, peas, lentils, carrots, sweet potato, avocados, chick peas, kiwi and mammal meat(like beef and pork etc). It makes it extremely difficult for me to find safe food.
I planned ahead, and right after I confirmed my admission to the university, I got in contact with their disabilities center, around last February. We talked about some accommodations I wanted, like being near the most allergy-friendly dining hall, and on the same floor as a kitchen so I could make my own food. I'm in the building with the dining hall, but I'm multiple hallways and numerous flights of stairs away from the kitchen, which isn't very clean and just screams ""cross-contamination"". I'd have to clean the kitchen and pans and everything before I'd feel even slightly comfortable cooking.
The dietician provided me a special app to order my own safe food. I can eat a whopping six or seven things, bringing my total meal count to 3: oatmeal, chicken with rice and chicken with zucchini noodles. I don't mind the lack of options as much as I mind the fact that I won't get enough nutrients.
I'm extremely frustrated and at loss for what to do. I'm mainly eating small things in my room and skipping meals, eating maybe one a day in the dining halls. I talked to my disabilities specialist person, and her suggestions were to try to move dorms or move off campus, which I don't want to do. My social life is already suffering because I can't eat in the dining halls and I don't want to be even more isolated than I already am. I just really don't know what to do.

It‚Äôs currently 03:02 and my mum and the mother son is awake and I thought I heard him being really mean to my mum so after some time I finally worked up the courage to go confront him but I found them in bed next to each other and the man was smoking, I don‚Äôt know if I was just a normal cigarette or if it was drugs because it was in a plain white thingy, anyway he‚Äôs just acting really violent and it‚Äôs bringing back memories or my mum ex, I don‚Äôt like it here and I just wanna be with dad but that would break my mother‚Äôs heart and she‚Äôs been through enough, I don‚Äôt want to hurt her,

Should I talk about it to my friend at school and ask her if I could go to her house after school but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to leave my mum alone because I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs mentally well and she just needs someone‚Äôs guidance 

Should I tell my sister who is staying at her friends? But I don‚Äôt want to worry her, am I being to immature? 

My best option to me right now is to move back to Yorkshire and to Yorkshire school and make my mum move into my nana‚Äôs because she had two spare bedrooms, but I should have also mentioned this, my mum has a bar in a little village and my nana lives in Preston and that‚Äôs really far away.

I just moved from Georgia (the state) away from the best house, friends, school, and teachers. I loved them. I thought it would be the same over in the city.

108,"Context:

I just graduated college and was dating a girl a few years younger. We broke up near the end of my last semester due to differing life goals, my lack of ambition, and her self admitted lack of self esteem. After that semester she went to intern across the country not knowing anyone there.

 I know she struggles with depression and anxiety so I stayed in contact for a while over the summer which she told me really helped her out in terms of staying sane. Now she's back at school and I recently moved 2 hours away for work (we were bad at long distance before so I know even if we were together it probably wouldn't work out). 

Now that she's back she's starting to date someone (a friend of hers from our time dating that I told her was probably gonna swoop in if we ever broke up). I know that it's her right to do that. 

Now about me, my job requires a shit load of travel, and I already have problems with work life balance, I tend to be lazy in my free time, so it will be even harder to make friends outside of work as well as find a sense of normalcy in my day to day life. This has lead me to a sense of dread, perhaps depression idk, about me not having any friends here, nobody I can talk to, no way to make friends, etc. I guess I just hoped that she would kind of return the favor, so to speak, after I was there for her this summer. I really don't want to believe that I'm just doing this because I want to get back together but sometimes I question my own motives and get confused. I have addressed that confusion with her as well. 

 I'm still in contact with my ex and we've discussed the all of this including the fact that we aren't going to be getting back together, especially not anytime soon, but for two years we only really had each other through a lot of shit.

115,"Some backstory:

My partner and I lived in Phoenix, AZ up until last year. We weren‚Äôt making big bucks but we were getting by without any issues. We had a supportive and diverse group of friends, as well as networking connections in the arts community. We had a 1 bed apartment in the inner arts district of the city. After growing up there, and dealing with the political climate as well as the actual climate of the state, we wanted to explore our living options elsewhere. 

We ended up moving to San Francisco in May of last year, 2018. Our plan initially was to gain residency status for education purposes, so that we could attend the city college as part of its reduced-tuition program. 

The first 6 months were a breeze. We learned what parts of the city/culture we loved. We explored and found areas and restaurants and the general stuff of the city that we enjoyed. We found a beautiful studio apartment with a garden. It was a period of lots of new experiences and wonder of the new environment we were in. 

The following six+ months have proven a bit more difficult, both emotionally and financially. We moved here with a bit of a nest egg, but by this point it had been drained by the exorbitant cost of living in the city. My partner has become totally disenfranchised in their position at work. They feel trapped due to the inability to find good work in their field that pays what they make now. I have only been able to find work in the service industry, and although I am not ashamed, i have had so few opportunities for growth in the places I‚Äôve worked it‚Äôs become disheartening in the least. 

We enrolled in college classes this fall, only to discover the costs were going to be significantly more than we were able to budget for. Our fin-aid options were very limited, and we had to make the hard decision to put our financial stability first and  drop our schedules. 

We are both now at a crossroads, where we are unsure whether we should stay here and seek out whatever it is we‚Äôre looking for in a place to live and grow or go back to Phoenix for the same reasons. 

Our financial status has not improved. Our opportunities have been mostly the same. We are definitely lonelier now and feel more isolated because of the costs of going out. And we aren‚Äôt sure what do. 

Should we consider moving back to Phoenix with a fresh slate? Or do we stick it out in San Francisco and keep building on what we have?",10Sep2019,1

118,"(TL;DR at end, sorry for the wall of text)

My family has a history of addiction and mental health issues. For almost my entire life I've consumed coffee to basically function and get by in life. I literally do not feel like I can function without it sometimes.

This presumed addiction got worse when I got a job at 16. It was at a cafe chain where we were allowed free coffee (and depending on management, we were able to make ourselves lattes and other espresso type drinks). I dont work this job currently, but I would consume at least coffee with sweetener every shift, sometimes multiple and sometimes multiple iced or hot lattes (I'd say a maximum of 3 drinks if I was really needing the boost.)

 I preform awfully in social settings from anxiety related issues and can only break through that barrier by consuming some sort of caffeine. Tea and energy drinks dont give me the same buzz as coffee or espresso shots can, and I genuinely just like the taste of it. 

The worst part is the crash. I would feel fine through the day and extremely motivated, but once I go to bed and wake up the next morning, I'd experience the worse type of depression for about the same amount of time as I was on the caffeine high. I mean, I can at least manage my usual slumps and take care of myself properly, but with these ones theres a crushing weight in my body keeping me from starting my day again until I either ride it out or consume another dose.

My gynocologist even asked me about how much coffee I consume, and part of me thinks she was wrong to say that the amount I have is normal. Maybe I didnt convey to her how much I'm actually reliant on it, but I honestly feel like I have a problem. 



Should I slowly wean off the bean, or stop cold turkey? Are the sweeteners I add to it the real problem? Should I try seeing how I react to black coffee for a little while? Should I try sticking to caffeinated tea? 



I know theres worse things out there to be addicted to, and I'm thankful enough not to be dealing with something arguably worse, but personally for me I dont want to have to rely on a substance just to get through my daily life. I'm at the point where I need coffee to hold conversations with people and be social without suffering from an attack. It's not worth the possibility of future health problems and depressive slumps, but I'd hate to miss out on my life. 



TD;LR, I'm extremely reliant on consuming coffee to get through daily life. Should I stop drinking it completely? Should I slowly cut consumption? Alternatives?",10Sep2019,1

124,"I have a super hard time being separated from my loved ones for too long. I can still function, but not up to standard, and I don't feel great. I can be physically away from my loved ones for a long time, but not being able to contact them is super difficult. I am fine being a counselor at camp because I know when I get to see them again. I can do vacations because I have a set time of arriving back home. I seem to do fine when I have plans with the people I care about, but when they don't text me first for a long time (which it seems it everyone) or when they don't text me back for a long time (even worse) I start to get really anxious and somehow always convince myself they hate me or got bored or something negative that I must have done. I've heard it a thousand times that ""people are busy"" and""life happens"" but it never makes sense to me because if I have the time to scroll through memes or update a status, I should have time to write a 10 sec message back. Right? Doesn't everyone? I'm getting really bad paranoia and I feel like I'm losing all of my friends slowly to something I can't figure out. I almost never reveal this issue to other people. This has been difficult to deal with throughout my life, I've been ghosted by a best friend, ditched by a whole clique, you name it. I would never say a mean thing to anyone, I would never get revenge, ... I put all I have into being a genuine, kind, and providing person but people keeping forgetting me...

127,"It's a long story how we got into contact but I basically met this guy online and we started talkin. And he was cool and I like him and it was clear he liked me and we became friends. He showed me a pic of what he looked like and something about it seemed off, like this person just pulled it from Google images or something. However I just ignored it. 

Eventually he introduced me to someone he claimed was his sister. The sister shared me plenty of photos and she seemed totally legit. I then started noticing funny signs such as the brother encouraging me to talk to his sister instead of him. Also I video chatted with the sister a couple occasions but never worh the brother because ""he was uncomfortable with it"" 

After this I was certain that the brother is fake and that it was the sister who introduced herself to me for real because she actually started to like me.

I then shared my skepticism to the brother and after about 15 minutes of silence (browsing the internet for fake pictures) he sends a fake picture which I find on the internet and send it back to him. Eventually he finally gives up the game and admits it was just the sister all along

I know the right thing would be do just block this person but I sorta liked her as a good friend so I just decided to forgive her.

Sadly she didnt quit lying about things. She would be constantly making up little statements to make herself seem like a cooler person. For instance she shared me a pencil drawing of a design for a school compition and then complained to me that the school disqualified her from unoriginality when she claimed it was her idea. I went online and found the same exact design used from some college in Alaska. Also another lie she made up was that she can play the drums, which after asking a couple questions to her I can guarantee she knows nothing about them. However I've never confronted her about that.

Recently though she made up a big lie about her going on vacation. Me and her live very far apart from each other so we have never met in person. She said that she was coming to my area for vacation, conveniently on the day I was leaving for vacation. She said she would be driving 16 hours in a car in one day to my city. That made me very suspicious. When she stopped halfway along the trip I asked her to send pics of the town she was in. She sends a pic in the winter time stupidly, when the trees had no leaves accidentally which was obviously from the internet. I ask her about it and she said it was an ugly town so she wanted to find professional looking photos. Then 2 hours before her destination she decided to stop and book a hotel. The next morning she said she has arrived in the city. This is the morning I leave for vacation. However my route goes through where she said she is staying. So I ask for her address so I can stop by, and she keeps ignoring me and changing the topic so now I'm certain shes lying.

A couple days later I confront her about it and after arguing for about 45 minutes over text and vid call (she takes forever to give up and admit defeat) she finally confesses that she made up the whole thing and she never left in the first place. What bothers me is that she has no reason to do this but claims its cause ""shes boring and wanted to sound interesting to me"", and talks about herself like shes the victim and I should feel sorry for her when I've been lied to for a lot of my time I've known her.

However I didnt block her after this. And i straight up told her one more lie and I'll never talk to you again. I have problems letting her go because i think back to just random conversations I've had with her and shes a cool person but I dont know if I'm doing the right thing or what I should do in the future if she lies again. 

The reason I'm writing this post is because I think I may have caught her in another lie where she said she was from one town when in reality she lives in another town 20 minutes away. I dont know if I should ask her about this or if I should just let it slide as maybe shes uncomfortable with telling me exactly where she lives. I just need some advice about what to do regarding this situation, and if I end up blocking all contact with her how should I do it so I dont get fake accounts of her trying to befriend me again on social media.

129,"Hey guys hope you had an awesome Monday. 

I started a new school last week Thursday and don‚Äôt know anyone here. I had to transfer because of various reasons from my smaller private old school and don‚Äôt have any friends here. It‚Äôs senior year which makes everything even harder. It‚Äôs a public school with 1400 kids. 

How do I make new friends? I‚Äôm not the greatest at approaching people and a lot of the kids in this school are hot popular jocks. My new school is basically a stereotypical America public high school. I don‚Äôt want to be made fun of but I‚Äôm also tired of eating lunch by myself in an empty classroom. 

It‚Äôs senior year so the last year to have fun with peers before shit get tough and I don‚Äôt want to go through the milestones (grad, spirit week, Halloween, senior prank etc) without friends to celebrate them with. 

I‚Äôm sad because I have had trouble in the past with people just abusing my friendship and not putting in the effort I put into that friendship. For whatever reason all of the friendships that I‚Äôve ever had have never been very close friendships. I am the only one who initiates hangouts or conversations with the friends and I know for a fact that if I stopped making the first move I would never speak to anybody outside of my family again because people just don‚Äôt care about me as much as I care about them. I have gone to therapy and gotten counselling about this issue because it has hurt me so deeply but in the end I realized that it was it my fault and then I just need to continue looking for those true true friends but as a teenager it‚Äôs been really tough on me emotionally. People just don‚Äôt like me or care enough about me as I do for them and I‚Äôm trying to come to terms with that.

I‚Äôm an extrovert and while I do enjoy my own company, I am a very social person so not having people my age to talk to is damaging.

150,"I graduated 3 years ago and did a certificate in Hospitality because young me thought ""oh who needs to study when you can just serve customers all day while making friends and keeping fit, right?"". Well long story short, 2 years after hospitality, I kind of realised I'm not about that life and that it's been taking a huge toll on my health. Mum, being a baby boomer, has always tried instilling into me that ""if you don't do uni, you have no professional ambitions or goals in your life."" She's not crazy by any means, she's just a baby boomer.

While somewhat taking mum's propaganda and through self-curiosity, I have looked into study pathways and have narrowed it down to bio-medical science to hopefully become a neurologist, but recently, I have had a lot of stuff going through my mind: such as questioning myself, who I am and what I might want to do. Feeling a bit depressed, but not hopeless. The reason I want to do Bio-med is so I can progress into a career where I can find out more about my health and perhaps help those with similar issues (I have Multiple Sclerosis). While that seems like a motivator, I'm not exactly sure if I'm 100% motivated to do it or any study through uni just because I have good morals. I don't feel like I have to rush to uni and get a nice degree behind my name, I just want to learn. Humans are pretty much built to learn, but if it means putting myself in thousands of dollars worth of debt, then I'm going to feel even worse and more puzzled than I do now.

I guess what I should ask is, what questions should I be asking myself regarding education and my professional development? At the moment, I'm looking for jobs out of hospitality, but as I said before, I want to put myself in an educational environment just so I'm taking something in so I can feel good.

160,"A little bit of background on my situation. I have been dating this girl for 10 months. We will call her Z. I started working at a new job this summer, during which I lived there for 3 weeks. My first day, I met another girl (call her S) and we hit it off. I was a little unhappy in my relationship with Z, as we are pretty different people. I dont know if it was the prospect of a new girl or something, but whatever it was, it caused me to break up with Z over text (shitty I know.) However, she told me that we were just going to go on break. I said okay and left it at that. My phone died and I didnt have a charger with me.

Flash forward a week and S and I hook up. At this point, I dont feel like I'm in a relationship with Z, but it was never officially ended. S was the second person I've ever had sex with, my first being Z (I was hers also).

After coming back from my summer job, I started missing Z, but attributed it to the fact that I spent the better half of a year with her. Meanwhile, i was trying to pursue a relationship with S.

Flash forward 2 weeks after I got home from camp and Z and I have been trying to get back together. I finally realized what a dumbass I've been, and completely cut off S.

I told Z everything. Except for the fact that I had sex with S while I was still at my job. She thinks it was after I got back.


Bringing this story back to the present, Z and I are dating again. I have no idea why she took me back, but I'm not complaining. She says I hurt her a lot, and refuses to do anything past 2nd base. She says it will be a long time before I can even see her naked. 

This is coming from a girl who would gladly have sex multiple times a day, every day, before I fucked things up.

This is necessary information, not because I'm trying to make her change her mind and have sex with me, but so that you guys can see how badly I hurt her.



If anyone has any advice on how to remedy this situation and/or gain her trust back, please respond.

161,"Hey reddit, need advice on dealing with a situation i got myself into. I'm confused and need second opinion so I recently turned to reddit, this is my first post and its gonna be a long one (2min read), here it goes:

Theres this coworker of mine, B, who I like for a time now. I'm 25m shes 28f.
When I go to work, I usually get to my workplace, get it done and go home, talk to few people, only the ones I identify myself with the most or the ones I really have to talk to.
B has this (best?)friend, let's call him H, who ALWAYS walks with her to work, sits next to her and ALWAYS walks her out. I know she's single but have no clue of her past relationships.
Inside the work place, there aren't many chances to talk with B but when there are, we connect pretty good.

9 months ago, her friend was on holidays for a week so I started walking her to her car. We leave at midnight so we hang out a few minutes then we each go our way.
Thursday I ask if she would like to go out with me sometime. She says that ""we got time"". Fine, see ya next week.
H returns and I still try to hang around when we all leave but it's just a total c*ckblock and I get nothing done. Still, B always smiles, listens, sometimes even gets nervous around me.

What I really want is to hang around more with her so, a few weeks later, I get another chance to walk her to her car, I ask if she thought about us going out and she says she's sorry but it isn't a good time for her.
After that, things changed, I started feeling out of my place when she's with H, we hanged out less and less and things went back to what it looked like when we were just coworkers.

That lasted until a couple months ago, H was on leave for a time and B was coming to work by herself again. At this time, I'm back to going home alone but, one day, when she's leaving, comes to me and asks if I'm almost done so that we could leave.
She did it again a few more times, I did it to her a few times too, we hang out for longer and, one night, I ask if I can get her number. She tells me she doesn't usually give it but that I could have her fb to talk with her. Cool.
Not really though, H comes back to work and things got back to what they were before.

I texted her but I'm guessing B doesnt have the app installed on her main phone, since she only texted back almost 2 weeks later. We haven't talked much in person either, there are days we don't talk at all and I end up feeling that I'm on her hook.

162,"He's never seen me actually be sad. I guess im not that suicidal, but I always just wish I were dead and sometimes around twice a week I'll just stare at a wall and cry because I don't want to have to breathe another breath or walk another step. And I'll hear my heartbeat because I'm hanging upside down in my room and I want my heartbeat to just stop. But I also don't want to commit suicide. Instead I want to be killed. I want to just somehow go to the hospital and get them to kill me and donate my viable organs to people who deserve and want to live. Sometimes when I'm sad I'll tell my bf, but I always have a smile on my face because he makes me so happy that I try not to or don't think about suicide. I'm always laughing and joking about suicide which is probably why he doesn't believe I'm suicidal and I don't know how to not joke about my sucidal thoughts. And now that I know he doesn't believe I'm suicidal, I just want to die more so I don't have to deal with this pointlessness where my favourite person in the world doesn't believe me. Maybe I'm just faking this and pretending I'm suicidal. Maybe I've tricked my mind into thinking I'm suicidal, or maybe I'm driving myself crazy. I wanna cut again. But maybe that's for attention too! I feel like I'm an attention seeker and a crap person now and these thoughts just go on and on and on...what do I do?

When people say something to me like ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day?‚Äù or just any comment in general, it takes me at least 3 seconds before I can process what they‚Äôre saying and think of a reply. My hearing is also really bad and there is not a single conversation that goes by without me saying ‚Äúhuh?!‚Äù or something of the sort. I was going to add some other point on this post but I forgot that too. 

Could this be a result of sleep deprivation? For the past 2 years I‚Äôve been getting 5-7 hours of sleep at night just to finish homework and have some free time to myself. The last time I had a solid 8 hours of sleep was on the weekend; the last time I‚Äôve had 9 or more hours of sleep was probably a few months or even 4 years ago. What triggers me though, is that my friend sleeps WAYY less than me and her memory and hearing is still 20x better than mine. Do you think this is a serious problem or just a sleep issue?

I talked to a friend of mine about it (who wasn't there) and he says it is wrong and she should get in trouble but I don't see why, I talked to another person and they said this was out of line and should be reported If she was actually doing anything then I would agree.

178,"So my (20f) boyfriend (21m) and I have been together 1.5 years. Prior to dating, he was my best friend for two years. I‚Äôm talking he‚Äôs the guy who picked me up when I called after I was dumped by my ex at 2am. 

He does absolutely everything for me. I don‚Äôt have my license so he drove me in rush hour traffic to my full time summer internship every day this past summer. I go to college two hours away and he‚Äôll go out of his way to come down and visit me. When I told him I was committed to weight loss he did his best to do the same, and we each both lost over 30lbs. If I ever say I want anything (like food) he‚Äôll immediately get it for me without a second thought or a complaint. He‚Äôs really great and supportive and he‚Äôs just my absolute best friend.

About two weeks ago I was assigned to a two person homework assignment one of my classes. Got a random guy (21m) in my class as my partner. No big deal, we hung out a few times and worked on it. We got along pretty well but I‚Äôve had many relationships like that where we stopped talking as soon as it‚Äôs over. So when we submitted it, I thought that‚Äôd be the end. But he stayed at my place for about another hour and we just talked about life. It was cool since I don‚Äôt have many friends, especially at college. The other day he asked to hang out after class and I said sure. 

Nothing exceptional happened while we hung out, but I did kinda open up about my family. I‚Äôm pretty introverted so idk why I did that. When I talk I don‚Äôt make much eye contact, but every time I looked at him he was staring so intensely at me with these sparkly blue ass eyes (I‚Äôve always been into brown eyes so this is weird to me). And idk how else to explain it besides saying I felt butterflies in my stomach? That isn‚Äôt normal for me at all because I am beyond the point of comfortable with my boyfriend, and I always just feel neutral around him. 

I kind of think the guy might be interested in me but I can‚Äôt tell. I‚Äôve never mentioned my boyfriend so idk if he thinks I‚Äôm single or not (I wasn‚Äôt intentionally not telling him I have a boyfriend bc of the feelings, I just don‚Äôt want to be the girl who brings up her boyfriend when no one asked). He goes out of his way to text/snap/see me which is unusual bc I‚Äôm really not the kind of person anyone would want to go out of their way to be friends with. 

I guess I‚Äôm just confused. The guy really isn‚Äôt my usual type look-wise, but he‚Äôs not unattractive. I‚Äôm pretty attracted to my boyfriend when he looks a certain way - which I know is awful - but I‚Äôm just not attracted to him when he has short hair/a clean face (as of yesterday he now has both). I feel awful typing that, but I genuinely don‚Äôt find really short hair and clean faces attractive (which he knows). 

I love my boyfriend and I don‚Äôt plan on breaking up with him. I‚Äôm so grateful for our relationship and all that he does for me. However, it‚Äôs just not exciting with him. I feel like I‚Äôm just hanging out with a friend when we‚Äôre together. I know long distance has a role bc it really does suck, and I highly doubt I‚Äôd be feeling weird about anyone else if he was at school with me. I spent an entire class after the hang out thinking about the other guy - not in a sexual way, not in an ‚ÄúI want to be with him‚Äù way, just an ‚Äúidk why but he‚Äôs on my mind‚Äù way. 

I feel like such a shitty girlfriend. He‚Äôs so loyal and devoted to me and here I am talking to and hanging out with a guy that‚Äôs giving me butterfly-like feelings. I don‚Äôt really have that many experiences with relationships, and I‚Äôm young so I know there‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know about feelings.

So my questions are, am I a shitty person? Are these feelings normal? Do my nervous feelings mean I like this other guy? Or is there another explanation? 

Either way, I don‚Äôt plan on dumping my bf. I‚Äôm just wondering if I should cut this guy off; he‚Äôs really great and seems like fun, but I can‚Äôt jeopardize my relationship. Any advice would be so appreciated. Thank you",10Sep2019,3

183,"I noticed it early this morning. I woke up about an hour and a half before my alarm--pretty normal, I do that sometimes--and rolled over to go back to sleep. When I started hearing this ringing.

It's very faint, high pitched. Sort of beeeep (for about one second or do), silence for a few seconds, beeeep, silence, constantly. But the weird part is that . . . Sometimes it's like it stops for a few moments? Or maybe I tune it out briefly? I noticed that when I rolled onto my left side this morning, I stopped hearing it. Which was fucking weird. I managed to sleep a bit more but I don't like lying on my left side so when I inevitably turned over, there was the beeping again.

I'm lying in bed at night right now trying to sleep but I'm having a hard time because. Of. That. Incessant. Beeping.

I'm pretty sure it's not a ringing in my ears, unless I'm literally starting to have audio hallucinations or something. It's not a smoke detector, it's much too faint. This morning I actually wondered if it could be someone's morning alarm going off in another apartment, but since it's still going tonight I doubt it. I didn't think about it during the day since I haven't been around--class and work and such--but now that it's nighttime quiet and I'm trying to wind down, there it is again.

It's not my laptop, I shut it down. I don't have any other electronics in my room except for a tiny little digital clock on my bedside table and my phone, and I don't think it's those. I don't know if it could be the coffee maker? The thermostat? The stove even? It's definitely turned off, I would notice if heat was coming from it all the time. There aren't any other appliances in my apartment I don't think, we don't have a CO detector or anything like that. Could it be a light bulb? But all the lights are off.

I'm going fucking crazy guys. The sound is so faint I can't follow it to a source, but it's constant and shrill enough to bother the hell out of me. Ear plugs are a no go because I can't risk sleeping through my alarm, I'm prone to doing that.",10Sep2019,4

The title might be a little confusing, but it‚Äôs the only way I can think to word the situation. 

Ever since I was a little kid, I‚Äôve always felt the need to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ‚Äúlegendary.‚Äù This is fairly normal for children to want, and like most kids, I lied about stories of things I‚Äôve done.

However, I never really grew out of it and kept it going to now, my early 20‚Äôs. I routinely lie about my sexual partners, bar stories, funny encounters, etc. I‚Äôve never been caught in a lie, so I never had a bad experience with it. 

Now, I look back on my life and there‚Äôs certain portions of my past that I cannot differentiate from the truth anymore because I‚Äôve lived the lie for too long? My first kiss? multiple choice. Breaking my foot in 5th grade? I can‚Äôt remember if that actually happened or not.

Now, about 6 years ago, I suspected something was going on between them. I found sex texts between the two of them. They both denied it. I left my husband.

This isn't my first semester in the program, and I've never felt this down or drained anywhere near this early in a term before. Honestly, I can kind of feel myself starting to spiral downward, and I've gotten to the point where I just want to drop my classes and be done with this crap and pursue something I'd actually like to do with my life. Plus, seeing all of these statistics about how it's highly likely I won't make as much as my parents (even before inflation-adjusting), and how long student debt can hold you down, I'm getting to the point where I wonder if college is worth it after you've been through hell and back to get your degree.

For the longest I‚Äôve pretty much dedicated my life to my 3 main hobbies learning foreign languages, dance, and music. These are the things I love the most, but I know making a career out of them will be difficult, if not, impossible. I just don‚Äôt see myself ever getting as excited or enamored with anything the way I am with these 3 things. I‚Äôve always wanted to pursue them on a professional level, but I know my single mom wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay for any lessons so I have pretty much been self-teaching since I was around 11 or 12. Now however, I‚Äôve actually mustered up the courage to go for it, about a year after I graduated high school with my diploma and associates degree in Liberal Arts. I wanted to specialize in music, but I didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with my mom‚Äôs reaction to my field of choice. In the past before I had any skill at foreign languages she would make sort of disparaging remarks about my hobby that would leave me feeling less confident in my ability, but now that I‚Äôve attained a pretty good level in about 4-5 languages she constantly praises me to others. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be the same if she found out I was making music and dancing instead of getting a ‚Äúreal job.‚Äù She‚Äôs sort of expressed discontent with the idea of me doing dance in the past because ‚Äúboys don‚Äôt dance‚Äù or something to that effect. As a result I just don‚Äôt feel confident enough to go all out in my pursuit of my passions.

201,"So here is my dilemma and I need some advice.

I lost my job in March while I was still pregnant but I was quickly hired in April.  I disclosed that I was pregnant during my interview so they knew what they were getting into before hiring me.  About 4 months into the job, I started to get burned out.  I was leaving the house roughly at 9am and not getting back until 8pm.  The traffic to this job is awful (1hr-1/1/2hr each way)  Also the job was not what I had expected either.

Now that I just started maternity leave (8 weeks Short term disability-80% pay), I am considering not going back to work afterwards but I also feel extremely guilty to do this to my manager and coworkers.  
  
I am not sure how I should handle this.  I can't imagine leaving my baby for 11 hours each day since he was born under weight but also quitting my job makes me seem like a really horrible employee (and seem like I was using the company for their benefits).

8:52 PM (2 minutes ago)**üì∑****üì∑**to meüì∑

I‚Äôm sort of a floater around here and this is my first post. I got some really bad news today concerning my college career.

I have been at a community college in California for the past 3 years, and I applied to get my degree in this coming December, 2019. I am getting an AA-T (aa for transfer), and then (hopefully) transferring to Texas State in fall 2020, a year from now.

My counselor told me I had all the credits I need to get my degree, but today my application for my degree was denied. I was told I am 2 credits short and now I have to take another online class next spring even though this was supposed to be my last semester. I will be granted my degree at the end of spring 2020.

Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky, I applied a month ago to several colleges in Texas, and on my application I put down that I graduate with an AA this December and they are requesting my final transcripts at the end of this fall semester.¬†

Will they not accept me now that I won‚Äôt get my degree until May 2020 even though I applied for fall 2020? I am worried that they will think I falsified information on my application or rescind their offer if I get accepted since now I have to complete one more semester and since the information was incorrect on my application (even though I had no idea I was 2 credits short!)

Thanks in advance, I‚Äôve been freaking out all day and trying to replan my entire life. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I really need to get accepted into college as I already have plans to move to Texas in January.",10Sep2019,1

216,"I usually don‚Äôt post stuff like this, but I need a bit of solid advice. I‚Äôll preface it by saying I don‚Äôt want to abandon my dad - I know he‚Äôs a good person at heart. Not only that, but he‚Äôs my only parent. But the way I see it, he may be a ticking time bomb.

I‚Äôm 19 years old. Throughout my dads life, he has struggled with addictions. Namely alcohol and a multitude of prescription pills. I was always taken care of, regardless of whatever addiction he was battling at that particular time. And while it doesn‚Äôt excuse the behavior, it goes to show that he still has a heart.

That being said, things have... changed. He feels like he‚Äôs at rock bottom, despite finding himself in similar situations before. He got into a relationship that was pretty much toxic from the start. Not in the traditional way - moreso that his partner was enabling this behavior by paying the majority of the rent. The relationship has ended, and not amicably. It went downhill after he got a DUI. Less than a month after this incident, he was charged with domestic abuse for yelling at his partner in the household, and he now faces both of these charges on top of his lengthy criminal record.

He‚Äôs super lonely. We ended up beinging in a roomate into the house to help with the loneliness (and expenses since my dad may not have a job soon due to losing his license. He drives for a living). I figured that this ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù would help my dad realize its time to cut out alcohol and pills and weed etc. But I found out through the roomate (who supplied him with the prostitutes phone number) that he banged a $30 prostitute and smoked DMT (also provided by the roomate). That being said I don‚Äôt think the roomate is enabling this behavior, because believe it or not the roomate has tried to remove all of the alcohol out of the house. I think the roomate thought he was doing my dad a favor with the prostitute hookup - he even gave my dad a little extra $$$ upfront to move in out of sympathy for the unfortunate situation he‚Äôs in.

Additionally, my dad still drinks and drives. He drove to my grandmothers house (where I was, because I was avoiding him temporarily) stupid drum, crying his eyes out begging me to come back to the house to be with him. He‚Äôs scared of jail, lonely, and admittedly depressed. Tomorrow he has his court date for the DUI and I‚Äôm honestly hoping he gets some jail time. He doesn‚Äôt know this though.

Everything about the situation has just astounded me entirely. I mean, who even pays $30 for a hooker? Not trying to rationalize the behavior, but I mean that seams really dirty. Apparently the roomate has cartel connections and that‚Äôs how he was able to get the hooker for so cheap. Which is also scary, even though he seems like a really genuine guy, honestly. I wanna run from the situation, but I don‚Äôt wanna abandon my dad either. I know he‚Äôs depressed and I know he soon won‚Äôt have anywhere to go, as we‚Äôre likely losing the house. I‚Äôll be fine at my grandmothers. 

How should I handle this?


TL;DR Dad is waiting for court date and doing everything wrong and breaking even more laws. Is scared of jail, has no hope and is depressed.",10Sep2019,2

220,"So a few months ago I was an idiot and adopted a kitten on a whim. Well, now it‚Äôs time for him to get neutered and I can‚Äôt afford it. I took him to my usual vet and they gave me a quote of $350. There‚Äôs just no way I can come up with that amount of money anytime soon. So I called the humane society which I adopted him from and they gave me a couple of places to get him neutered for ~$70. This I can actually afford. I looked up one of the places the humane society recommended and I was reading some of the reviews. I‚Äôll point out that a majority of the reviews were positive but there were some horror stories that really worry me. Basically, there were stories of people taking their pets there and coming to pick them up only to find them drenched completely in their own urine. Even worse there were the stories of the vets there giving pets incorrect shots and stuff. But worst of all there were several reviews from people who took their pets there and their pets ended up dying or being lost. 

The second place seemed more promising. All the reviews were positive. However, I called to make an appointment and it‚Äôs been over a week and they haven‚Äôt called me back. I called them again and still haven‚Äôt received a call back. I‚Äôm already past the deadline to get my kitten neutered so I need to get it done ASAP. I absolutely do not want to risk his life by taking him to the place with all the terrible reviews but really I‚Äôm just not sure what else to do.

I was driving home from work and all of a sudden I thought of him and I realized ‚ÄúF*ck! I like him!‚Äù.

222,"Ok, so about 6 months ago I hired my dad because he‚Äôd been out of work for 2 years and was starting to be unable to take care of my diabetic mother. So basically everything is going fine, I let him set his own salary and he‚Äôs covering it in sales so no problems. He then finds out that I‚Äôm in talks to take over/buy out the company from my boss who‚Äôs thinking about retiring. Now my father used to be an entrepreneur so he‚Äôs chomping at the bit at an opportunity... even though it‚Äôs mine and he works for my company (not the boss‚Äôs). I tell home to chill and he does. Fast forward 2 months and I text my dad to vent after a hard day. I‚Äôm like damn, this guy is stupid, maybe I‚Äôll just say fuck it and replicate his business instead of buying it... SO, my dad takes this info and sends me multiple texts/emails that basically say ‚Äúyou obviously don‚Äôt have this under control. I‚Äôm calling a meeting to take over and force talks with your boss so that I can take over.‚Äù Like WTF? He literally gave me an ultimatum and said ‚Äúeither you get them under control or I will. If you want to fire me it‚Äôs fine just give me notice.‚Äù 

WTF am I supposed to do with that? Fire my dad and put my mom in the poorhouse? I can‚Äôt let him literally look crazy by going over my head to my boss and trying to take over transition talks... that would ruin me. What do I do with this?!?! He‚Äôs acting old and senile and crazy. (Also, I‚Äôd never actually let my mom go to the poorhouse, she always has a place and money with me) but my father can‚Äôt take care of her.

I‚Äôve NEVER had a problem with my dad before and we‚Äôve ALWAYS taken care of each other. This is so out of the blue. And of course, my boss would laugh at me and ask why my crazy father is doing this or even trying to talk to them. It would probably cost me millions. This whole situation is just SOOOOO weird.

224,"This is going to be very long and possible confusing. Ask anything for clarity.

Some few months ago I(17f) was on Omegle and came across this guy(16). He was very nice and became friends. For a while, we talked on twitch and coordinated video calls on Omegle until I convinced him to get Discord to make things easier. Keep in mind that he hangs a shirt over his nose (covering his lower face) because he said he was 'shy' so I really don' know what he looks like (I have been able to composed a list of detail about him, main fact being he lives in Ireland and me the USA). He revealed his voice twice, and only for a little. We usually video'd and typed to each other at the same time. Recently, we started getting flirty. It got to the point wear I sent a few pictures of my stomach area, and one with slight under boob. Not straight up nudes. Trusting him, I said he could do what he wanted with them (save, nothing, whatever). He told me he never did stuff like that and seems very headstrong about that (note this for later). I learned you could delete discord messages, so I deleted the more provocative photos but left one or two mid-section ones. At this point I should also share that he has a pretty good idea of where I live. City. Name. School. (I know how fucking stupid I am for sharing this info with anyone I don't meet directly).

Fast forward to last night. He asked me for pictures. I said no, I was feeling depressive and wasn't in the mood. He became aggravated after I explained that I thought he was being disrespectful to me by asking for pictures every time we talked. He went aggro and started threatening me by saying he was going to share my photos to my school, tell them my name, ruin my life if I did not send genital photos.

I was so fucking paranoid at first. I thought ""How is this happening? I just started Uni and I'm about to be destroyed cause there's no way I'm sending genital pictures"". Then I tried to think rationally. Days before he very strongly told me that he never saves photos like what I sent. Then I thought that I need to confirm he has these photos before I do anything. I got to work.

I was able to stall him for 40 minutes. I found a good excuse as to why I couldn't take the photos just yet. In this time I went back through our messages, deleted every single photo I'd ever sent (the provocative ones, school photos, selfies, etc), and altered chat messages to give false answers to questions he asked me in order to throw him off if he decided to look back at them (important note is that he seemed to have a weak memory, but was able to remember some specific things about me which is why fixing my answers was a worthwhile task). While doing this on my computer, I messaged on my phone. I sent carefully worded questions so that I could find out just how much info he remembered about me. I asked him to send to photos in order for me to reference them for the 'new' photos since I knew he liked how the 1st looked. He didn't send. I said ""I'm going to ask questions about you so I can confirm it's you since I'm paranoid"". He complied. I compiled and confirmed a list of details about him in case. I confirmed things he knew about me. Name, city, school. HOWEVER, I am 99.9% sure I was able to convince him that I go to another uni that has an extremely similar name to mine. That way if he ever did decide to contact the school w/ name and a photo, it'd be the wrong one.

After 40 minutes, he got angry saying he was going to send bomb threats to my school. I tried to keep cool. By asking for details about my photos I was able to confirm he couldn't tell me the symbol on my shirt that was visible in the photos (only shirt color[grey], bed sheet color[white]) Nothing too concerning, those are easy colors to remember.

I call his bluff. He continues to threaten me for a couple messages, but then completely flips and starts apologizing. After talking he says he had taken coke. Drank. That that was the reason for him threatening me. I talk a little more with him. Saying he's fucked up, he can't do shit like that. Then he starts casually asking me for nudes, to help him cum. At this point it's 3am. I'm anxiety is still skyrocketing even though I'm convinced I'm safe. I have class tomorrow. I close my phone and computer.

This is where I am at right now. I want to block him, maybe even delete my account. However, my paranoia is telling me that if I cut contact with him I'll no longer have him in range and in view. I'm rationalizing not blocking him the same way if you saw a radical person in the street you'd keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't do anything threatening to you. I don't know if me doing that is the right move. This is what I need advice on. Please help me. All day I have been on edge, paranoid, and crying. I can't tell anyone about this in my life.",10Sep2019,1

Il admit there was a short period where I kept it to small talk because I had the feelings and it was weird but one day I noticed her looking bored/upset and I told her this and she says ‚Äòis that the only reason you‚Äôre talking to me?‚Äô And then I felt bad and decided to talk to her like normal again.

So his doctor had him take a nightly medication called clonodin (not sure if that's spelled correctly) and it helped, but overtime there were physical issues that came up and at 12 he was removed from them.

Now the doctors want to give him antidepressants. He tried them and slept during the day and at night, 2-3 hours at a time. His grades began to fail last year. They took him off of that and gave him a new antidepressant. It doesn't work. He's going to the doctor now about every two months to change prescriptions. Currently, he isn't being prescribed anything.

There are personality changes that concern me. He has always been a jovial, happy kid, loved going to school, had a comic book he helped his clique at school with, etc. He used to have a full social life. Now he hates school. He's lost his best friend for reasons he won't tell me. He stays in his room, on a screen, up until 3,4 am. 

Of course I remember being a teenager and I remember how confusing and scary the changes of puberty can be. However he has a strong family history of mental illness on his fathers side, and on my side, who knows? 

I have been to two doctors this summer, one specializing in mental health. The mental health doctor believes he shouldn't be medicated. His family practitioner keeps tossing antidepressants at him. 

I refuse to see something terrible happen to my son. I am aware of what can happen when a teenager with a changing chemistry is tossed from antidepressant to antidepressant. I want him to live a full, exciting, and well rounded life. I want him to be happy, but he isn't. 

I'm sorry for this wall of text, I am asking advice from any health care providers who have dealt with this. I am asking advice from anyone who has gone through this. Please, help my baby.

TL;DR, Teenaged son barely sleeps, has taken several corrective medications but they make situation worse. Need help understanding what to do so that he can have a good life.",10Sep2019,3

236,"Hey guys I‚Äôm just here to rant about my life because I have nowhere else to go and am feelings bad. It‚Äôll basically be a story of my life post. Probably a really long post.

I‚Äôm been feeling like real shit lately and I‚Äôve been thinking about my life and how bad it‚Äôs been is certain aspects. 

So I live in the USA and my parents are immigrants so they have that mindset of how they worked so hard to get where they are etc. and I respect that but they also don‚Äôt believe in a bunch of American values and are not understanding at all.

So my family consists of my parents and 2 brothers, 1 older and 1 younger.  I‚Äôm currently 17, senior in high school. Growing up my parents weren‚Äôt ever really loving. My father is basically emotionless and any rare attempt at affection throughout my whole lifetime has come across as feeling fake or forced. He‚Äôs pretty stubborn and grumpy throughout the day and would also get mad at my brothers and I for random shit and take his frustration out on us. Normally the frustration was verbal, but if we did something really ‚Äúbad‚Äù in their eyes the ol‚Äô belt or thorn stick or fly swatter would come out. This mainly happened throughout my childhood and once I hit about 14 I became much more rebellious and unable to put up with their shit. During my childhood my father was an alcoholic (not so much anymore) and would frequently get drunk. He was a really shitty drunk cause he would be very hard to get into bed so almost every night we would stay up trying to put him to bed. Even if he did, he‚Äôd wake up and wander around during the night waking us up. When I was younger he was a lot more aggressive when he was drunk; I remember a certain instance when he threw my mom into a piano. Anyways that‚Äôs my dad. My mom is a bit more understanding but has the same mindset as my father. I literally don‚Äôt have a single memory of sharing feelings/being comforted by my mother or father. My mother always sided with my father on everything and was more of a bystander. She just allowed my dad to get drunk and sobbed whenever he did (I can understand why, but I felt she could have done more). 

During my early childhood I was pretty chill with both my brothers. The thing is that my older brother always bullied me and then I thought that behavior was right so I did the same to my younger brother. Eventually, they both decided to gang up on me. I was constantly harassed and felt left out at my home and always felt lonely because I had no one to go to or trust. Today, I‚Äôm chill with my brothers, but their connection with each other is MUCH more apparent and stronger than their connection with me.

Let‚Äôs go on to middle school, a fucking disaster. I absolutely hated middle school. I was young and stupid and I couldn‚Äôt make any friends to save my life. I don‚Äôt remember a single time my parents let me/dropped me off to hang with anyone I considered a friend either. I tried to be nice to people but I was the only colored kid in the grade so people generally stayed away from me. I remember that I was a little bit perverted for my age, only verbally which probably drifted some people away as well. I had a couple decent friends that I made towards the end of my 5th grade and then transferred to a new school for 6th grade. Before I transferred, a bunch of people, including my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù told me that they were faking being my friend the whole time because they felt bad for me. This blew up in my face out of nowhere, and I transferred schools feeling devastated knowing that my whole middle school experience was basically a facade.

Transferring to a new school where friendships and groups that were already established obviously led to me just being an outsider. The same situation happened in middle school. I was outcasted by my grade and some people made jokes about my race, which I went along with because it was the only way I could laugh along with others. The rest of middle school/junior high was a solo ride, never left the house during the school year or summer to hang out with anybody. 

Onto high school, where I was really hoping things would get better. It didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a senior in highschool now and it‚Äôs all been the same. The only difference is that it makes a little bit more sense now why people don‚Äôt like me. Freshman year I was pretty innocent and chill, just didn‚Äôt get around to making many friends because I have 0 social skills. Probably about mid-sophomore year is when it hit me hard. I was pissed, sad, annoyed, confused etc. on why the fuck no one liked me or wanted to talk to me. All I wanted to do was make a couple of good friends but no one gave me a chance and I just felt alone. That was the year that I realized how much BS I‚Äôve actually gone through and what I‚Äôve done to deserve it. This may be hard to believe, but even though I grew up with the childhood I had, I was still a very nice person. I tried to be kind to everyone and wanted to help others in every way that I could: emotionally, physically, with hw etc. Understanding the type of person I was made me super mad on why this was all happening. All i wanted was to be there for people and for people to be there for me. Sophomore year I realized this wasn‚Äôt gonna be the case. I developed a pretty bad RBF and steered clear from everyone. I went from being isolated by everyone around me to isolating myself from everyone. I spent that year and completely along due to my own faults. Junior year had a spark of hope for me. I enrolled in a class that would put me with the same classmates for the whole year. In school I was acquaintances with a lot of people. I saw people at school at that was the end of it. Anyways, I knew a decent amount of people that were also enrolling in this class so I was a bit hype to have people to talk to. The thing is, I got fucked over. This class was split into 2 different home rooms because of the amount of students that enrolled. With my luck, I got into the class where I didn‚Äôt know anybody, and everyone else knew each other. So I was stuck again, alone for a year with people that didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. 

The spark of hope that came from Junior year was a group of people I met. I became acquaintances with some of them because I knew them from the other class I was talking about above and we all had the same lunch. I was excited because these people were like me, they were Asians and minority‚Äôs and gamers so I thought I could fit in. The same thing happened though, I would ask to hang out and they‚Äôd ignore me. They‚Äôd make plans infront of me and stuff like that. It just added to the pain I was feeling. 

Now I‚Äôm a senior and it‚Äôs a bit better. I actually just met some people that are way more inviting and now that I have a car it‚Äôs easier to hang out with people. All this time I‚Äôve felt so lonely so I hope this can last a little bit, but I know some of them are going away for college. 

I also want to get somethings clear. My parents were absolutely terrible emotionally (which makes some sense now that I understand where they came from, the culture etc.) but they did well for my financially. I don‚Äôt want to sound like a spoiled brat because what people and my parents have done for me I do respect and appreciate. There‚Äôs also a lot in this post that I didn‚Äôt get to because there‚Äôs so much but all of this is a lot worse than I‚Äôve typed out. I‚Äôm just lost and don‚Äôt wanna continue living tbh. I don‚Äôt see the point in it. I‚Äôve went from an innocent selfless kid to a guy who couldn‚Äôt care less if his family died. I‚Äôve changed for the worse and my life‚Äôs circumstances brings out the worse side of my way more than the nice side of me. I still have the same selflessness from when I was a kid but I never have the opportunity to show people that I care because I can never get that close with anyone. It doesn‚Äôt help that I don‚Äôt trust anybody or have anyone that I‚Äôm good enough friends with to share my feelings with. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward with my life. The way I want to act and be contradicts the way life is thrown at me. I want to be there for others but I can‚Äôt get close enough with anybody. Idk I‚Äôm just randomly typing now. S

238,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is very unorganized, i need to get everything off my chest and with doing so i got pretty emotional mid way.
19, Male. No, i‚Äôm not talking about ending my life, i just have been extremely lost ever since i graduated high school. as of now, it seems that reddit is closest friend I have.

To start, I have adhd, and parents who never took action on it when i was younger. Went to college for a year, realized i wasn‚Äôt ready and am now planning on going next year. I‚Äôve spent most of my days in front of a screen playing games with my online friend who i‚Äôve known for 6 years now. So over the years it‚Äôs been hard to juggle between him and my real life friends. Now since my graduation, I lost contact with all my real life friends. reasons were being one moving away to go to college, one who stays home all day kinda like me, and the last who i broke ties with because he was getting a bit dramatic, but was most certainly the closest (his name will be James)

A large struggle has been getting a job and sticking with it. Though i recently did just get a job, it was due to my parents taking away my computer. The only friend i had left was because of that computer. I have nothing to fill my days now. Nobody to talk to. I don‚Äôt have a future goal to look forward to other than just to make money. Like i‚Äôve always been a super outgoing guy in highschool, i just never reached out to make plans with new people. James always made the plans for everybody, he brought in new people, people who i thought i‚Äôd be great friends with but instead James always ended up having some sort of ‚Äúbeef‚Äù with them and for some reason i always seemed to stick to his side. (didn‚Äôt engage in the beef, just stayed close with James after it all) 

It sucks having no friends because idk what to do with my days. I got into working out to boost my confidence, i‚Äôm not playing games anymore so i‚Äôm not rotting my brain away, and i‚Äôm trying to eat healthier. My parents brought up these ideas and i agreed with them but nothing is helping me at all. I‚Äôm not going to college so i‚Äôm not around people at all, and even when i was attending, i was so fucking miserable about having no friends that it was so hard to try and talk to people, everybody seemed so much more mature than i was. I am a super outgoing person but did what‚Äôs wrong with me. The games i played with my online friend were all pretty social, it was no problem finding people to talk to on there, idk why it‚Äôs so hard to do it now...

I had one girlfriend after highschool, best one i‚Äôve ever had, i learned a lot from it but also lost a half of me from the break up.

So i sit here in my room with my free time. 

I‚Äôve never once not had a friend all my life. and really looking back at it, they all came to me. I miss school so much, i miss being around people, i miss the friends i used to have. i don‚Äôt know what to do with my self anymore..

I don‚Äôt know who to blame, i don‚Äôt know if i can really even blame anybody.

Reading through this, i know it‚Äôs hard to give any advice to this other than ‚Äúpeople with come around eventually‚Äù and ‚Äújust stick in there‚Äù but i‚Äôm just so tired of being alone every day.",10Sep2019,2

241,"Hi. It‚Äôs 1 AM. I‚Äôm a sophomore in college majoring in computer science. I think I have depression. Like high functioning, been happening a long time depression.

I notice I‚Äôve stopped caring about pretty much everything except the things that would affect how others perceive me. I feel as though I‚Äôm living for others instead of for myself. For example, I go to class and try to get decent grades so that my professors/family aren‚Äôt disappointed or upset with me. I am doing what I‚Äôm doing because it‚Äôs what people are ‚Äúsupposed to do‚Äù. Not because that is what I want.

255,"At my workplace, I spoke to my boss a few weeks ago to tell him I wanted to quit because I didn't feel safe where I worked. He asked me what was wrong, and I didn't want to go into detail about it, but it felt as if he pressured me into telling him.
I felt very vulnerable and told him because I was followed by two different homeless people around the area on two separate occasions. One of the people even asked me if they could follow me, and I politely said no, but they did it anyway and it made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. The homeless people around are sometimes not of sound mind, so I got really scared, but made it back to work okay.

256,"(Sorry in advance for the lengthy post!) 

I started a part time retail job over a year ago to help make some money while I‚Äôm doing a degree. When I first got hired I thought it was a great gig. Convenient location, I liked the products (nice to have discount on them lol), and most of all I worked with some cool people. 

It was great during the first 2-3 months. Turns out I was a good salesperson, and this made the job always interesting as I talked to countless people every shift. I also got good hours so the pay checks definitely made me wanna continue working there. 

Then after these few months I began to go through a pretty lengthy episode of severe anxiety (panic disorder and agoraphobia).  This part is pretty lengthy to explain but essentially every minute working felt like torture. I was experiencing constant anxiety and very frequent panic attacks. I didn‚Äôt wanna stop working at this store but I also couldn‚Äôt function properly at all. So I asked to get extra small breaks to leave the store during bad panic attacks. 

At first the managers were cool with this, but eventually grew extremely resentful of me. Managers would constantly question my anxiety and tell me to just ‚Äúpush through it‚Äù, which really pissed me off. They didn‚Äôt get how fucked what I was going through felt, and the physical tole it was taking on my body. Managers would also yell at me if I walked to the back of the store just to take a second away from the hectic store environment. During this period they also cut my hours from 20-25/week to 5/week. 

I‚Äôm not going to lie, I understand that I was a LOT to handle during this period of time. But the managers didn‚Äôt seem to give a fuck that I was experiencing serious mental health issues, they just pegged it as me not trying hard enough. This is the reason I began to initially resent them 

Anyways I did intensive therapy this winter for a couple of months and I slowly got back to functioning properly. I stopped taking extra breaks, began being able to talk to customers properly again, etc etc. 

It took about 3 months to start getting my hours back to normal. But after I got better from my anxiety they just started pegging me as a slacker. This pissed me off a lot because a lot of my coworkers who didn‚Äôt do jack shit during their shifts were treated super well, while I was actually working quite well for the most part and they made me their scapegoat. 

Anyways fast forward to now; I get good hours, I get along with my coworkers, and I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm a much better worker than I used to be (which isn‚Äôt really that true lol, I‚Äôve always been decent). But if I literally make one mistake they start acting like a slacker again. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt shake the image, even though I know I‚Äôm a hard worker. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt wanna leave because I have a lot of security in terms of hours and honesty I don‚Äôt need even more change in my life than I‚Äôve been experiencing lately. But every time I work I feel condescended and cant help but remember how they‚Äôve treated me all this time.

258,"Ok here is a quick story on how I learned my sister is a bitch who can‚Äôt accept her being wrong. So basically I had a trip to see my mother who I haven‚Äôt seen in a year who I love dearly love. During the ride to my mothers house I said Get out so I can have more leg room. Apparently not saying please was so much and she couldn‚Äôt bear it so she got mad, ruined the car trip and the night. She then goes on to literally ruin the whole weekend by making sure I never have fun. My mother is not stable so I was hoping my sister would be able to be a support for me. Instead somehow my sister was the unstable one. Every time I was gonna haven fun she just ripped it away. After being unable to go to Yosemite we go to the river. The whole time she makes sure everyone goes to the spot that I can‚Äôt swim to cause ima shit swimmer. I thought maybe 5 min....10?15?20! Fucking 20 damn minutes of me just sitting in sand unable to leave cause I was babysitting the damn dog. Everyone was tired after that. Every day I had no fun cause she would ruin. Then she acted like it was my moms fault. When we talked about she just went on about how generous and kind she was. Refused to even mention an apology for being a fucking cunt. Remember all this because I didn‚Äôt say please at the start of the trip. How the hell do I deal with this?!",10Sep2019,0

263,"My ex and I were together for 10+ years, pretty much our entire adult life together.  During that time, we didn‚Äôt have any kids or get married but we did have a lot of pets.  Punky was the first dog we got together.  I found her at a shelter a couple hours away after seeing her but wasn‚Äôt sure so because she was so.. muscular and huge.. so I left home and by the time I got home I felt so bad about it that I had to drive back and get her.  I saw my very first dog who had died a few years earlier in her and I had to get her.

Anyway, cut to a few years later.  Things get rocky.  I sense the rockiness and try to do what I can to improve myself to hopefully make her want to stay.  It doesn‚Äôt work.  She leaves me.  I tell her she can have whatever, but the one thing she cannot have is Punky.  

She accepts that, but wants to be able to see Punky once in a while. I agree, but emphasize that Punky is *my* dog and that if I want to move away with her thousands of miles away, there isn‚Äôt shit my ex can do about it - her seeing punky is because I‚Äôm being nice, not because it‚Äôs her right.  She doesn‚Äôt quite agree but we leave it there.  I let her take Punky once every 1-2 mos for about a week at a time.  It‚Äôs fine for 5-6 times up until this most recent time.

A couple of weeks ago, she texted me saying she missed punky and wanted to take her for a bit.  I said okay and asked when she would be back.  She said 3-4 days.  A few days later she came and got Punky.  A week later I texted her and asked when she was bringing punky back.  I got no answer.  Waited a day.  Texted her again.  Still no answer.  Waited another day.   Started texting her every 4-8 hours, just saying ‚Äú?‚Äù.  Still no response.  I finally called her this morning.  No answer.  

I was freaking out at that point but didn‚Äôt want to do anything that would result in me not getting Punky back.  So I texted her and said ‚Äúokay well I‚Äôm coming into town anyway so I‚Äôll just stop by and pick her up.‚Äù

She responds immediately, saying she is ‚Äúhaving a really bad day‚Äù (at 10am) and will bring punky by ‚Äúlater in the week.‚Äù  Normally, I just let my ex come and pick up and drop her off when she does take Punky.  

I was pretty incensed at how she had just so clearly revealed she was simply ignoring all of my worried text messages and calls so I drove on and waited til I got to her parents‚Äô house (she‚Äôs staying there since our breakup) to nonchalantly text ‚Äúno worries, I‚Äôm already here,‚Äù at which point I knocked on her parents‚Äô door for the first time since our breakup and had an awkward convo with her mom before promptly taking punky home.

I don‚Äôt ever want to knock on their door again, and even more so I never want to be in that position again, wondering where my dog is and if I‚Äôll ever get her back.  

Is there any way I can keep things amicable and ensure that she cannot take my dog away from me but still be able to see my dog, at least some way to have recourse against her if she decides to not give Punky back?  Or is it not even worth it and I should just tell her no?

We are still bound up enough that she could do things to hurt me and I could do things to hurt her.  I don‚Äôt want it to come to that.

I do feel very bad about telling her no.  But I do not want to lose my dog to her if she, for example, decides I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot taking good enough care‚Äù of Punky by whatever standard she comes up with and that it‚Äôs, therefore, ‚Äúright‚Äù for her to keep Punky from me.  What am I gonna tell the police next time if she gets it in her head to call them, telling them her ‚Äúcrazy ex boyfriend‚Äù is there at her door trying to ‚Äústeal‚Äù ‚Äúher‚Äù dog?",10Sep2019,1
266,"TLDR: My brother has a toddler that is in CYFD custody and he‚Äôs not acknowledging the situation whatsoever. What can I do, if anything?

Sorry about the wall of text or if this is all over the place but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this and could really use some perspective so thanks in advance for reading. 

So last week I received a letter in the mail from CYFD (Children Youth and Families) saying that it was urgent that they get into contact with my brother (25 M) regarding a child that is believed to be his. I am not the only one that got the letter. They also sent one to my grandmother and my dad. Apparently, the mother of the baby is on drugs and isn‚Äôt claiming responsibility for her either and just left her at the hospital after she was born. 

I don‚Äôt see or talk to my brother very often. He‚Äôs quite the hermit and hardly talks to anyone and it‚Äôs hard to have a conversation with him. He also has a bad temper. Seeing as the child is 2 years old and he hasn‚Äôt mentioned it to anyone, I‚Äôm assuming he just thinks no one knows about this and it‚Äôs going to get swept under the rug. 

My brother still lives with my mom, doesn‚Äôt work, and has a warrant for unpaid child support for his first child that he has with a different girl that he hardly takes care of. My mom pretty much has his son all the time, feeds him, buys him clothes, etc. because my brother just doesn‚Äôt do it. 

So I guess it doesn‚Äôt really surprise me that he‚Äôs not taking responsibility for this new baby. I guess what I want to know is what should I do now? What can I do, if anything? It breaks my heart knowing that I possibly have a niece that is in state custody. As I said, I hardly talk to my brother and we don‚Äôt have a close relationship so I don‚Äôt feel  like I can just bring this up with him, but I feel like I should? Should I even get involved? Any advice would be appreciated.",10Sep2019,1

He said he's broke and has no money, I told him I'm not one of those girls that only likes rich guys. I'll pay for our movie tickets if you want because I really like you. He said no thanks.

268,"Alright so im gonna start off by saying, I go with the flow. I don't really go out of my way in life - I kinda let things present themselves to me, and I respond to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So this year i've made a new friend. We will call him Jim. Jim and we really click. We both have alot of common hobbies, like the same games, and find similar things funny(not all but a handful of things). Even though we really get along well, he has some really nasty personality traits. For example, hes kinda a bully, and really talks shit about people. Alot. Its kinda toxic.

Anyways. He meets a girl. We will call her Jill. When he started dated Jill, he told me endless stories of how she was such an amazing, cool and great person. And all the great things about her. She seemed like a dope quality person, and was happy for Jim. I am always happy to see my friends happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well fast forward 3ish months. They have an odd amount of arguments, headbutting about things, and in turn disagreements regularly(id say more than the avg couple). Every time they have one, he comes to me about it for advice and just to vent. One thing he commonly vents about is how she never makes time to talk to him or see him, as shes a programmer and works her own schedule on her own. But. He has the tendency to over hype things in regards to everything in his life, so as a good friend I listen and give him advice on what hes telling me. But deep down I take alot of it with a grain of salt. About around this 3 month span, he realizes his GF and I have a great amount of things in common and we would make great friends. 

So he gives us both of us, the others social media account and we kinda just start responding to our IG stories, Snap stories, etc. Nothing weird or flirty. For example, Ill post a snap about borderlands and shes obsessed with it. And we will just end up chatting about that. But thats where things start changing. At first we started only responding to our public posts. But that evolved into eachother sending private messages to the other about common interests. And these chats become really common, until they reach the point of us exchanging phone numbers and we start talking every day, all day long.

And it doesnt stop. It then grows into eachother having really deep conversations about life goals, where we are in life, what we want in relationships, what we want in life, and other deep shit about  life. She vents to me about her current relationship. Even breaks down and crys her heart out to me(on multiple occasions). I should state here that STILL nothing is romantic. Nothing is flirty. Its just relating to another human on a strong level. Over the course of a month the friendship continues to grow. Honestly to a point where shes passing my friendship with her BF.  We start gaming together, skyping, along with txting all day every day. There's periods where we have 6-7hour skype calls. Shes become the most active, reoccuring thing in my life. There's not a soul I speak to more , and most importantly theres no one I have this deep of a connection with or resonate with in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason im posting this tonight, I have noticed im starting to develop feelings for her. And every bone in my body is aching as I know this isn't right. I've been cheated on before from a close friend of mine, I know how fucked up homewrecking is in relationships. 

What started out as something good, has now become something else. I dont know whats right. I don't foresee my feelings going away at anytime, and most importantly I care a lot about Jill. I don't have anyone like this in my life and i've never clicked this well with someone before. And its not even sexual. I don't think about wanting to make sexual advances or anything life that. I just see this as being someone I can be with for a very, very long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question im wanting advice on is - what do I do in this situation. Or what would you do. Should I just keep my mouth shut and bite my tongue and keep both friends? Slowly stop talking to Jill? Express my feelings to Jill?(I don't think this is fair to her nor Jim, and I don't think this is a good idea). 

IDK. Like I stated before, I go with the flow. And thats exactly how i've gotten to this situation. And its how I plan on proceeding from tonight. I don't plan on changing anything or making a move, or expressing my feelings, or stopping my interactions with anyone. I plan on letting the course of things just continue and see where they go.

But I would like the advice of others on what THEY would do in my shoes.

So for about 7 years I took her under my wing taught her how to treat people be positive generous and caring basically what I wish my parents taught me when I was her age( we are 8 years apart) I fed her clothed her and would attend her important school meetings in place of our mom I gave her all I could give. But now she‚Äôs a young adult and our relationship went from a very close one to a distant cold one where recently the only time we talk is to exchange insults she‚Äôs become very materialistic and is constantly talking about money more than a normal person I mean she was talking about stealing from someone she knew.

So there was this guy I met at work almost 6 months ago. He was charming and handsome and very charismatic. We went on a few dates, there was some things about him that I didn‚Äôt like, such as certain mannerisms but I though hey, we all do weird things so I‚Äôll give him a shot. 
To start off, his penis was actually too small to have sex so, we tried once but never again and he never came anyways. This is relevant because the very last time we FaceTimed.. he was high and randomly shouted at me, being dramatic about how I said I was pregnant.. I never said anything at all... so I thought he was crazy but let him down nicely and told him we should part ways. 
He has been sending me crazy messages, he showed up at my job after he quit hiding underneath my car... he stalks my Instagram page even though I have him blocked on numerous accounts. He tags my friends in my tagged pictures making fun of any guy in the picture.. his messages that he sends me makes no sense and he comes up with names and events that never happened... like he thinks I stalk HIM, and follow him and have a secret crush on him. 
Although I tell him all the time to stop sending me messages... I don‚Äôt understand how someone can‚Äôt take no for an answer and even more than that.. a blocked number. He is so persistent and he scares me with his persistence. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do? 
I recently received several messages from 2 totally random numbers and I can‚Äôt verify if it‚Äôs him or not... 

tldr; Hot guy at work was hot, then turned stalker-ish. I nicely ended things with him, had to block him number once.. but continued to text me on 6 separate phone numbers and 4 different Instagram accounts. How do I handle the situation?",10Sep2019,1

I'm (21F) working at a retail job that I love but some parts are driving me nuts. I've worked at my job for almost 2 years and have gained a promotion to a keyholder position (basically it means I can open and close the store by myself and is technically a ""entry level management position"") and have been working in that position for the last 6 months. Before that I was going to college for cosmetology but ended up flunking out halfway through because my mental health was in absolute shambles. Luckily I still live with my parents and they still pay for my phone bill and car insurance. Before anyone asks yes I pay rent every month but I'm incredibly greatful that the rough months they will let me slide by like $100 

So what drives me nuts about my current job:

‚Ä¢ I only make about $8.50/hr
‚Ä¢ I am only scheduled to work 5-15 hours a week
‚Ä¢ I get called in unexpectedly like 1-3 each week
‚Ä¢ I don't have any sort of benefits of any sort
‚Ä¢ I only ever make over $500 a month if it's holidays or I     get my taxes back


I'm planning to move out possibly this time next year and I've got a basic outline of a plan but I'm kinda unsure if I should stay at my current job and get a second job or just quit and find a new job that's full time with benefits. Lately I've been applying to everything in my area but the only places that are really hiring are fast food or manufacturing. I've never worked manufacturing (mostly because I'm a 90lb woman who struggles to lift 30lbs and I don't think that's the best industry for me) but I've worked a fast food job as my second job but I had to quit because it got to the point where I was being written up over scheduling issues that I had no control over. I'm also debating on whether or not I should just go back to school and finish my cosmetology license certification and get into a shitload of debt in the process. 

Someone please give me any sort of advice. I feel lost and very depressed over not making any sort of decent money and not being able to do anything.

I don't want this to look like a pity party. I had terrible depression, anxiety, and OCD from middle school upward. I graduated in June of 2018 from high school with a 1.8 GPA. My house was in and out of foreclosure for most of high school. In my first semester of community college, I had to withdraw from my classes because I got quite a debilitating and highly contagious sickness around early November. I could prove this with notes from my doctor and was willing to do anything to keep my grades up. However, I go to a community college and was told by my professors it would be best if I just withdrew from my classes that semester. My uncle, who I loved so much passed away of cancer just a week after and my then-boyfriend left me. I gained weight, and due to the debilitating sickness I had, wasn't able to leave my house for over two months.

Finally, the spring semester came around, and I was significantly unprepared. My body was so exhausted that I had a hard time getting out of bed. That's not even including how the depression, OCD, and anxiety annihilated my mind &amp; sanity. I got back with my ex-boyfriend, who proceeded to emotionally abuse me until he finally dumped me (again). He then claimed that I raped him (even though we are both virgins) and told everyone lies about my family and I. This made my depression plummet as low as it could go. I failed my psychology class and got a D in US History. I also withdrew from my other two classes. I didn't leave my house for over a month out of sheer humiliation and heartbreak.

Back to the present, I am finally on medication for my mental illnesses. I left behind many toxic friends, the toxic ex, and made a few better friends who uplift me. For the first time in a long time, I feel like a motivated, productive member of society. I'm getting fantastic grades in my classes, and just recently got a job.

Now here is the advice I desperately need. My dream schools are Smith, Wellesley, Mount Holyoke, NYU, and Boston College. Smith and Wellesley are probably my top two. I know I'm capable of succeeding in these schools, as my SAT score is 1410. I know I'm an intelligent person; I've just been dealt a bad hand. My community college is SEVERELY lacking in activities and extracurriculars. The only things I could put down on my college application at this time are from high school. I was the captain of my color guard squadron and volunteered at a food pantry/homeless shelter most days of the week while also working various part-time jobs. I would hope to major in political science. At this point, I feel like even getting into UConn would be a fucking miracle. Is there any advice anyone can give me if you have been in my situation or know anyone who has?",10Sep2019,1
281,"Alrighty bois, first thing if I seem a bit too upbeat about this; it‚Äôs just the way I‚Äôve dealt with this my whole life. 
I‚Äôll try to format this so you don‚Äôt have to read the whole thing so it will be in segments.

*What led up to this point*
Since I was in Pre-K I had issues, things like stomach pain and getting sick easy. This was looked over as just me missing my mom and wanting to go home. Few years of that and about half way into elementary school a doctor believed me. (unlike the others who just gave a doctors note for school and nothing else) after some tests they found out that I had some autoimmunity issue, the hypothesis was an severe type of sjogrens and some rheumatoid arthritis. So they put me on Methotrexate and that made me even more skinny, so they had to put me on a steroid to make me gain fat again by it making me want to eat tons. After a couple of years of that it really took its toll on me so they took me off and I was skinny again. Then they put me on weekly infusions, I had to go to Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital in Houston once a week to get an hour infusion, IIRC they made me ill but also well. And then some endoscopy and colonoscopy‚Äôs with some samples of my insides, they kept looking a way to help. I was supposed to go into remission but I didn‚Äôt. Then around middle school we (my family and I) had to focus on the legal aspect because I was missing too much school. I was maybe there like 25% of the time. But the school even with the lab results didn‚Äôt believe I was sick so we had to go to court, talk to the DA, try to explain then to back to school that same day. At this point some days I was waking up and couldn‚Äôt move, just so much pain and fatigue. But with the threats from the school my parents had to force me to go, I remember being unable to sleep all night then hearing my moms alarm noise down the hall and dreading it, knowing what was to come. Even now, like 10 years later if I hear that alarm from any phone it gives me dread. Being forced to get up even though I was in so much pain, being threatened by the school deputy, anyway. Sorry for rambling but I needed to get that out. But then because we had to focus on that, we couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital and ended up spending again, a few years out of the system. 

*Recently*
~10 months ago I finally got into the system again to get help, new doctor but they started thinking Marfans too. So they gave us a DNA kit and a ultra sound of my aortic root, as it was quite enlarged. But they only had two points of data. When I was 12 and then 16. So it could of grown slowly or quickly, so they said I couldn‚Äôt lift anything above 20 lbs, and take it extremely easy and come back in 6 months to see the growth. And because of this they couldn‚Äôt do any medication because of possible side effects, so they wanted to know exactly what it was. 

*The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù* 
That was about 10 months ago. The first month of leaving I didn‚Äôt really take the whole 20 lbs limit seriously; because it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs hospital, maybe that was for a little kid but not a 16 yearold right? Well I was helping lift furniture for my mom at work, 500lbs stuff, and one day at home I went into the attic to set a trap and I was so faint. I had to go to bed and my heart was racing, pounding, I felt confused, and ever since then i haven‚Äôt been the same. For reference a ‚Äúgood day‚Äù is being able to go to H-E-B with my dad. That‚Äôs about the best physical activity I can muster to do on a good day. Walk a bit down some isles. A normal day is having one stay in bed for half the day, coming downstairs, eating, and playing video games. A bad day is not being able to leave the bed at all. My worst day was not being able to move, at all. Couldn‚Äôt get my phone to call for help, couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom just down the hall, I was trapped. About at 6pm my dad opened my door and said food was ready, but I didn‚Äôt have the strength to say help loud enough. About at 8pm my brother came to check on me and I don‚Äôt know what I would of been like without him that day, he helped get me food and water. Something I didn‚Äôt have the whole day, I ended up spending around 22 hours in bed. Most of it with no food or water, all of it without being able to go to the restroom.

282,"My roommate and coworker (restaurant industry) got a DWI in May, his THIRD........
The car he was driving was totaled and he hit someone else - he has 0 recollection of any of it 
He was driving without a license at the time too (it‚Äôs been suspended for quite some time, like 3+ years I think) 
He didn‚Äôt have a car so they gave him a handheld breathalyzer device 
Since then, he bought a car (with illegal dark tint) 
And has been going out drinking and driving with no license almost every night. 
He skipped his breathalyzer all Sunday evening, which is 2 separate blows
And then he had to have skipped all today as well since he has been drinking

His family has had multiple sit downs with him about the drinking and he is ignorant and placing zero blame upon himself. He claims he was drugged the night he got the new DWI. He says ‚Äúif only I had left 10 minutes earlier and this wouldn‚Äôt have happened‚Äù. Nothing is his fault and he doesn‚Äôt have any problems. 


I worry every time he leaves the house that some innocent bystander will get hurt. 
He left Sunday morning at 12pm and didn‚Äôt come home until Monday morning at 9 am. Then left the house again today at 1pm and hasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs 1am Tuesday. 
I‚Äôm thinking about finding a new roommate. I didn‚Äôt know of his drinking problem before he moved in and the new DWI occurred while we were living together. Overall the drinking situation has escalated. My boyfriend is around frequently but when he isn‚Äôt he likes that I live with XXXXX. My roommate leaves me alone and does his own thing.  He‚Äôs harmless to me but the constant stress of his actions are weighting heavily on me.  It‚Äôs only a matter of time until someone gets hurt. 


Any and all advice is wanted - I‚Äôve got thick skin too so you won‚Äôt hurt my feelings
Also - is there a way I can contact the judge or someone involved in the case without him knowing???? Everything he is doing is illegal and I cannot stand it.  
If it helps understand the situation I am female &amp; 25.

283,"Hello, im gonna cut right to the chase and if you are someone that‚Äôs just gonna chalk this up to ‚Äúahh another teenager trying to get attention‚Äù that‚Äôs fine and I understand but personally I would say it‚Äôs more than that, it started somewhere around January when I broke up with my ex, it was a really messy breakup her sending me pictures of her cheating and death threats and just lots of terrible things, since then I really haven‚Äôt felt emotion, I‚Äôve just felt neutral, and I was okay with that for a while, but now I‚Äôve been starting to get extremely angry or have really vivid violent thoughts and then I‚Äôll snap back to reality. I‚Äôve been with other people since the breakup but I didn‚Äôt love them or really feel any attachment to them, I usually would end up sleeping with them and then breaking their heart and just moving on to the next one. That mind sound horrible to some and I understand if I seem like a dick for it but I can‚Äôt stay with someone who I couldn‚Äôt feel love for, but anyways It‚Äôs hard to give sympathy for other or even love for parents or family members. Back to the violent thoughts, I have caught myself imagining hurting those around me in terrible ways then coming back to reality. It‚Äôs a weird thing cause when I think about hurting someone it doesn‚Äôt seem crazily outlandish, in my head it seems perfectly in the realm of possibility to brutally hurt someone for absolutely no reason. I usually catch myself staring at someone in public and imagining hurting them or robbing them. I would talk to my friends about something like this but I have 1 friend who is like a brother to me and I don‚Äôt wanna ruin a friendship telling him something like this. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm afraid one day I‚Äôm gonna hurt someone cause the violent thoughts seem so real it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs reality. This is the first time I‚Äôve really approached the problem. Do I have a mental illness? I‚Äôve been called a sociopath by a lot of people I have talked to or dated. Or am I just bottling up my emotions ?",10Sep2019,1
284,"This is a long long time overdue, but I want to know if I‚Äôm crazy thinking this way. I feel like sex is a beautiful thing and should really be shared with someone you care about. 

My girlfriend apparently did not share the same value and it literally drives me crazy. She has had sex with 4 people in her life. (1 being me, 1 being her ex bf, and the other 2 being one night stand flings). 

I don‚Äôt get bothered nearly as much that she has sex with her ex boyfriend as this would be hypocritical of me because I have had sex with 2 people, both being serious girlfriends. 

She does apologize and says she regrets it but I just get angrier and more upset when we talk about it. 

I get stuck in these thought loops and get so angry that she did that even though no matter how mad I get or how much I think about it nothing can change the past, obviously. Am I crazy to be upset/angry that she had those flings with these guys I used to go to high school with? I feel confident in myself so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm comparing myself to them or am threatened in anyway, but multiple days have been ruined because I cannot shake the thought of her causally having sex with other people before me. It feels like a curse to know what she did and I just want to know if anyone has the same problem and/or if I‚Äôm completely blowing this out of proportion and I just have my own problem here.  I know sex is natural human nature and no matter who I find these days is most likely not going to be a virgin (like i said I‚Äôm fine with that) but it is the fact that she had meaningless sex at a party that really, really bothers me. 

Also for some reason, the fact that they didn‚Äôt use a condom bothers me even more to the point where I cringe in anger even thinking about it. Do you think that having sex without a condom is more meaningful/personal? I brought up this aspect to a friend and they said ‚Äúsex is sex whether you use a condom or not‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt get on board with that. I feel like the feeling of having sex without a condom is soooooooooo different from with and obviously more pleasurable so I just wanted to see if I was blowing this aspect out of proportion either.

285,"So for example, my very close friends, partner, basically the main people in my life know me, and I don't lie, like literally I never lie, and they know this. But when it comes to people I'm associated with, they don't believe me on things, even though I've never lied and there's no reason to disbelieve me.

286,"Last Thursday i was in a study group for my sign language class. I was kind of messing around and so were two of the other three members. Eventually as we tried to get a little more serious the other member felt it was her turn to mess around (her words). I didn‚Äôt have a problem with that because I didn‚Äôt actually need to study anything and just wanted to hang out with all these people who seemed to actually enjoy my company. 

The problem really started when we found the chalk. I hate chalk, it‚Äôs sticky, dirty, and when it‚Äôs on me I can‚Äôt feel my skin. Very uncomfortable. I mention this and i guess she didn‚Äôt realize how serious I was about my dislike of chalk because, long story short, she got it all over me. I went and washed it off and after a bit of group work she ended up getting chalk dust all over my things, including my phone and the watch I had taken off to sign easier. She disagrees, but I know this is the order it happened in because I tried to save my watch before it got chalk on it and put it on while my arm was still wet (also kind of uncomfortable). Later I texted her and tried my best to nicely tell her it was annoying and we have no use for the chalk so we shouldn‚Äôt touch it. Her response was ‚ÄúMkay‚Äù which would have been fine, if I didn‚Äôt know her to write long messages otherwise. I felt disrespected. 

We had class again today and another member of our group who wasn‚Äôt there asked what had happened when we were hanging out. We told them and the chalk story came up. I, having been very upset and not having had a good weekend (funeral and some past relationship hardships) decide to explain the story, pretty much as I‚Äôve written it here. The whole time the girl was trying to interrupt me about it, but I was upset so I continued. When I was done explaining it she said some stuff about not knowing how much I hated chalk (even though I told her several times). There was a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but...‚Äù which honestly didn‚Äôt matter to me. I didn‚Äôt want an apology, I just wanted to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt do it again which seemed to be impossible for her to say. We joked around as a group, but I think she felt targeted by everything I said after that. Ex: I made a joke at my own expense, someone said ‚Äúpeople can‚Äôt bully you if you bully yourself.‚Äù  I disagreed, saying something like ‚Äúpeople are jerks, they‚Äôll bully you no matter what.‚Äù She turns and asks who is bullying me with a concerned look. By the end of class I‚Äôm pretty sure she thought I hated her. 

So that‚Äôs all background, here‚Äôs the bad part. We were trying to help another person in the group with something (I just want to go home. I know nothing, idk why all these hs girls are asking a 20 year old to walk around with them). It falls through and I say I‚Äôm parked in the music parking lot, which is in the other direction. The girl gets really nice suddenly and asks if I know the code to the practice rooms. I‚Äôm a music major so I technically have access, but don‚Äôt use it (drummer) so I don‚Äôt know it off hand. I say this and she gets even nicer trying to get me to go get the code. I call her out on the fact that she‚Äôs being super nice because she wants something, and say that I‚Äôm a nice person and I don‚Äôt want her to be nice to me because she thinks I‚Äôm upset and wants something. I literally only want to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again and I don‚Äôt even care if she‚Äôs sorry as long as she respects my wishes.  She agrees and then says something about thinking we were joking around as a group and that I wouldn‚Äôt hate chalk as much as I do. Unfortunately my natural response to the phrase ‚ÄúI thought...‚Äù is ‚Äúleave the thinking to the professionals.‚Äù It‚Äôs meant to be funny and will come out without me even thinking of someone says that they think something. I instantly saw her face drop and I knew I had messed up. She was clearly hurt by it and although I didn‚Äôt see her cry I‚Äôm afraid she cried after I walked away. I didn‚Äôt know what to say in the moment so there was a short end to the conversation where she said she didn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs goal in that conversation was. I felt horrible and went and got the code to the practice room right away. I sent it to her with an apology explaining that I didn‚Äôt mean to offend her and that I was sorry, along with the reason I said that and a little bit about how I‚Äôve been having a hard time and everything is difficult right now. I took full responsibility for my mistake and said o just wanted to try and be the friends she thought we were before (I‚Äôm weird about friendships that way). I know she‚Äôs seen the message, but she hasn‚Äôt responded. I realize I messed up, and I‚Äôm still a little upset about what she did, but I want to do something because I feel like an apology isn‚Äôt enough considering how much I clearly hurt her. 

Tl;DR: girl disrespects me but we more or less figure it out. I say something right after that clearly hurts her feelings and have apologized but I want to do more because I feel like it‚Äôs not enough.",10Sep2019,2

Driver also says that when she woke up the next morning she was wearing a different pair of pants. Driver believes she was sexually assaulted by Blondie and has told all of our friends.

Well B and C are in an open relationship. C was cool with A and B fucking until C tried to fuck A and was turned down. Pretty soon C felt like A and B were spending way tooo much time together. Like they were literally fucking every time C was at work/not at home. 

So C told B she‚Äôs cool with their open relationship, but not cool with him fucking A anymore. 

A and B still hangout but B is asking A to share more details about her life. Her backstory, hardships and shit like that. 

B is starting to grab A‚Äôs thigh in car drives together and is constantly pursuing A. 

My opinion? He‚Äôs starting to seek those traits he missing in his current relationship, with A. And I think he‚Äôs starting to form an emotional connection. 

A doesn‚Äôt think so bc well B is still in a relationship with C. But I think someone is just bound to catch feelings.

But B isn‚Äôt fucking anyone.  He doesn‚Äôt want to and is persistently pursuing A. 

A doesn‚Äôt have a reddit. So I‚Äôm posting this for her. Let A know your thoughts.

296,"So for starters, I‚Äôm 17 years old, and a few months away from graduating. I have a part time job and I‚Äôm working on paying off my car. I guess I‚Äôm slowly working my way to financial independence and I‚Äôm a hairs breadth away from being an official grown up. Well, at least from a legal perspective.

From my parents‚Äô point of view, I‚Äôm still apparently incapable of having any sense of judgement or making ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù decisions. Some examples of this are their tracking of my location at ALL times even though I‚Äôve been a prime example of what an ideal, well behaved child should be. Never once came home late past curfew, have never once not told my parents where I‚Äôm going or where I will be. They also feel the incessant need to meet every single person I associate or spend time with if I‚Äôm around them outside of school, demand to be in contact with their parents, and even after I‚Äôve known them for very long amounts of time (literal years since elementary school) still display very little trust in my friends, my judgement in friends, and my overall character. Not only is the tiresome, but outright degrading as I‚Äôve never given them a reason to doubt me. Their sentiment regarding anyone that isn‚Äôt them has also taken a toll on any romantic interests I might have as they have completely banned any potential relationships from happening.

To make matters worse, they have also removed the door to ‚Äúmy‚Äù bathroom that they also insist on using even though there are TWO other FULLY functional bathrooms in our very large house because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know why I spend so much time locked up in there and don‚Äôt know what I could be doing‚Äù. 

Their disregard for my need for privacy and respect is only the tip of the iceberg compared to other things that they‚Äôve done that I won‚Äôt disclose here.

How do I realistically move out by the time or around the time I graduate in May of next year without putting myself in a worse situation?

297,"Using a throwaway as my main account is easily identifiable.

I recently got promoted from an entry level job to a supervisory role. It sounded great. I was optimistic. I thought I was qualified. My boss obviously agreed. I was ready.

Well, things were rocky before I even started because my boss was out, but when they came back I was told I handled it perfectly for not having the role yet. But ever since then, it's been downhill. I supervise 5 positions, and 4 are empty. 2 people resigned, one put in a transfer, and the other is my replacement.

I can't help but think it's because of me. I know one left because she was passed over for the role despite being there longer than me. I feel like the others left when I was announced because they think I'm incapable.

Now I have to cover 4 roles, while recruiting them, and learning my new job, which is a whole new world and I'm not understanding it. I don't feel like I've been trained enough. I feel like I have all this on my shoulders when I just started. If I was an external hire, things would be different.

Because everything I have, has never come from him but given to me as a gift from either my mom or my moms side of the family.

I have no idea which sub this would be appropriate in maybe I should post it in that subreddit for his branch but I don‚Äôt want to risk identification of him. Here‚Äôs one for you. 


A guy from my high school who was a great guy ended up going to an academy and has been an officer for a while now. In fact I know this guy a lot better than I want to let on because I feel fucked up that I‚Äôm posting this... but anyways.
I was trying to find out more about him as he deactivated Instagram/fb a little bit ago, because I‚Äôm interested in becoming an officer. In fact he‚Äôs an inspiration of mine to a degree. So by searching basic keywords that anyone with common sense who knew him would type in to find info about him, I found this shit. So really I‚Äôm probably not the first to do some light creeping and find it. But I hope I am. It was on the 3rd page of results.

I thought I was fucking hallucinating because this guy has had quite a few GF‚Äôs now, babes. Either way he‚Äôs the last kind of guy to post explicit pics and post on reddit of all places... hence the lack of social media and general difficulties in finding information on him. And they are explicit. I‚Äôd like to think if this is legit, then I wouldn‚Äôt have found it so easily and he would be much smarter. Even got his Snapchat on there which is actually his Snapchat. 


Or I‚Äôm just crazy and he‚Äôs gone gay, but I‚Äôll have to message a trusted person on this one who knows him.  If someone purposely did this to make him look unprofessional, they deserve punishment. As in identification and charges. 

As someone who understands and appreciates the strict behavioral policies of the army, and how high of a standard officers are held to, this is just not encouraging due to the fact that I think it‚Äôs a nasty trick.

Well, I haven‚Äôt seen my dad in 15 years because he lives in another country but we‚Äôve kept contact mainly for financial support. And last month, my siblings and I finally got the chance to see him. It was okay, honestly. Very awkward. My mom didn‚Äôt see him because she has her reasons.

Everything was going well from that point on until last week. My mom was always on her phone mainly because of social media. Something was different with her since I noticed she was very giggly whenever someone would message her. I think she didn‚Äôt notice that I was observing her actions. 

The thing is, I‚Äôm a very curious person. Also, I rarely had inklings about things around me, but most of the time my guesses were right.

My dad and I kept contact after meeting to ‚Äúmake up for the lost time.‚Äù At first I guessed it was just curiosity whenever he‚Äôd ask what my mom was doing. I didn‚Äôt think it would be a big deal until my mom asked about him too. She had a minor ‚Äòslip-up‚Äô one time when she told me to tell my dad that she was already asleep.

I know I may have invaded her privacy, but I was just using her phone when I saw my dad‚Äôs name in her notifications. It turns out they were talking again.

I mean it would be okay, I‚Äôd be glad because maybe they‚Äôve finally talked things out. But that wasn‚Äôt the case. They were flirting. And god knows what else. I couldn‚Äôt stomach what I read/saw.

314,"This is my 4th year in college. I should be a year away from graduating but I have 2 more years left due to failed classes. I can‚Äôt seem to motivate myself to actually do well in school. It has been this way for a long time even in middle/high school. Somehow I got through high school with a decent GPA and managed to get through my first 2 years of college with only a couple failed classes. All of my failed classes were due to me not going to class and consequently falling so far behind that I had to drop the class. I completely loathe going to school but it is something I know I need/have to do in order to succeed. It has never not been an option for me to not finish school and it is something that I want to be able to say that I‚Äôve accomplished in my life.

I work at Target and I usually have 25/30 hour weeks as of late. I resell things on the side to try to make extra money but I feel like that commands a lot of my time. Unfortunately selling things is pretty much the only thing that interests me and mostly the only thing that makes me happy/distracts me from being worried about my classes that I‚Äôm neglecting. I decided to stop buying/selling any more items for the time being. The worst part about going to class is that it takes me an hour (sometimes an hour and a half) to get to class. 

I just want to be able to control my grades and my education. I know I‚Äôm not stupid, I‚Äôve made it this far by putting in minimal effort. However I can‚Äôt seem to gain the motivation or will to go to my classes. I always seem to start the semester off by not going to the first classes which immediately puts me behind. Sometimes I will even drive to campus and sit in my car instead of going to class so my parents do not get upset with me. Now that the semester has started, groups have already been established for the final projects in the classes and in 2 of the classes I‚Äôm taking I feel SOL because I don‚Äôt have a group and everyone else has already selected groups and submitted them. This makes me even less motivated to go to the class when there are group work days and I don‚Äôt have a group. 4 weeks into the semester and I‚Äôm already completely overwhelmed and I have no idea how to go about fixing my situation. I just want to wake up and have the energy/will to go to class but I just don‚Äôt have the drive to get up and walk in the door to class to get my work done. I have no idea how to combat what feels like an extreme laziness and pure lack of motivation when it comes to my schoolwork.

316,"Wanted to talk more about my story but wasn‚Äôt able to express myself. 

So a backstory
I was best friends with my ex for couple of years. We dated for about 5 months but he was super insecure and very immature. It‚Äôs a long story. He knew I had exes and fwb that were close to my family. And couldn‚Äôt let that go. He was 18 when we dated and just turned 19 when the breakup was happening. 

So anyways We weren‚Äôt going well before the official breakup happened. His family hated me cause I was older. 
About 3 days before we had a minor dispute. Basically I had him block a female friend but he saw I was snapping a male friend. The male friend was for work purposes ONLY. And that got the BIG fight started. In the fight he called me awful name. 

Then I finally broke up with him

But my ex kept begging me. He made fake accounts to reach me. He told me how depressed he was. How he has nobody. How his family had been sick and he is in a dark place. And for not to leave his side. He was guilt tripping me to no end.

He even reached my car at one point to talk to me. I did open the car door for him but still I was scared. 

I blocked and blocked him. He made even more fake accounts.  He called 60 times the day of the breakup to reach me. It got so bad that I threatened a restraining order. This went on for almost two weeks. I did tell him ‚Äúmaybe down the line we can be friends but he needs to give me space‚Äù 

I remember one night he called me and I picked up. I told him I was moving on and he started crying like crazy. I told him he needs to give me time that I can talk to him. He‚Äôd give me a day then start again. 

I finally unblocked him to make it stop. I just wanted things to end. But that opened more room for him to want me. Kept on texting and texting and begging. 

I had enough so I texted him how abusive he was and how horrible he was to me. He kept trying to respond. 

So I rubbed it in his face how I‚Äôm sleeping with my male friend. I did go into about 2 paragraphs worth. I was just so done. I was tired of the abuse. 


A week after that he emailed me more names. All the names you can think of. Then told me ‚ÄúI have to move on. Sorry‚Äù and I hadn‚Äôt heard from him since. 

Then about 2 weeks after that I liked a post of his mom‚Äôs bake shop. His family didn‚Äôt like me. I got blocked right after that from his family. It didn‚Äôt really bother me. But found it weird that his family had issues. 

TLDR: was I wrong to rub it in his face? Considering how psycho he got",10Sep2019,0

I've been doing this since sophomore year of high school. I stopped taking the bus and started getting rides to school and arriving an hour or more early just to hang out almost by myself in the building before it got chaotic as more students flooded in.

325,"When I was in my final year of high school, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me and told me that she had always seen me as a just a friend throughout our entire relationship. We were good friends for a while before we started dating but we had a really strong connection, one that I feel like I haven't been able to recreate with any other girl.  I was truly in love with this girl and it broke my heart that she had only seen me as a friend. A few weeks later, she began dating my best friend at the time (we no longer talk since I sort of dropped him as a friend after that). 

I know this was about 7 years ago, but I feel like it has affected my friendships and my romantic relationships since then and I'm not sure what to do about it. I started dating someone else pretty much right after the breakup as well. I honestly didn't have any strong feelings for this girl but I figured it would be a good distraction that would help me get over my ex. I dragged that relationship on for about a year and a half, and even after I finally broke up with her, I continued to talk to her and meetup with her (mainly just for sex). I knew that she had strong feelings for me and I was taking advantage of that to fulfill my sexual fantasies. After about a year of that, I finally decided to move on and stop fucking with her (with a few exceptions here and there). Fast forward about two years to when I was 22, I had gotten into a pretty bad state of depression and anxiety. I felt as though I had no one that truly cared about me and I hated my school/program of study. I started taking antidepressants which numbed things for a bit. Soon after I met this other girl through a friend who seemed ok at first but we didn't really hit it off. Honestly I just thought she was super hot and I wanted to get with her. I noticed some red flags from the beginning but chose to ignore them and rushed into a relationship with her (when again, I did not have any emotional feelings for her). This relationship ended up being etremely toxic from the start - she was extremely jealous of any female friends I had and even insisted that I dropped them by giving me an ultimatum. I resisted at first as a part of me knew that this wasn't normal, but eventually I gave in. I lost alot of friends over the next couple years, and even the friendships that I didn't completely drop suffered. Throughout the relationship she basically didn't trust me at all and I felt as though she was emotionally abusive (constantly found reasons to make me feel in the wrong and ridiculed me). She had apparently been in love with me, and maybe she really was in her own messed up kind of way. However, I began to objectify her and used the plenty of sex that we were having to justify dealing with the toxicity of the relationship. Eventually, it got to a point where it was just too much to deal with and we broke up (about a year ago). For about another year after that, I continued to talk to her and take advantage of her so called love for me in order to keep the sex going. We went back and forth getting back together and breaking up. The cycle continued until recently where both of us got to a really low point. I still think about contacting her all the time and fantasize about her. It's preventing me from moving on and potentially meeting someone else that might be good for me. Sometimes I feel like I'm not able to have emotional feelings for a girl again (maybe it's a sort of defense mechanism resulting from my high school relationship), and I have an issue of objectifying girls in general before even getting to know them. I really want to move on and develop meaningful relationships but I'm not sure what kind of changes I need to make in order to get to that point again.

For the past few years, I have been constantly questioning my friendships and have been unsure about who my genuine friends are. As a result, I have been pushing people away and finding it difficult to maintain any friendships or form any new meaningful ones. I used to be a very easygoing person that had no problem at all making new friends. Now I feel as though I've lost my sense of humour and I take alot of things too personally. I lost alot of confidence in myself and even went through a period of an identity crisis. Now I've began to accept that I'm not the same person that I was in high school and that my experiences have changed me. However, I want to avoid any future toxic relationships and I want to feel like I have meaningful friendships again. 

I know that I probably rambled on alot and I apologize if this post isn't very concise but I wanted to express as much as I could. I would really appreciate any advice on how to improve my situation. If you'd like me to clarify any specific details or other life circumstances I'd be happy to do so.",10Sep2019,1

328,"I've been in love before. I'd like to say that it was ""love at first sight"", but do we even believe in that mumbojumbo? Travis. His name was Travis. What got me was how beautiful he was besides the tattoos &amp; piercings. Him, himself was ... beautiful. From how he carried himself, to his smile, to everything. He..was perfect. We were so happy for nearly a year &amp; then the fights started happening. I got tired of being the doormat that he stepped on whenever he got angry. Travis wasn't so perfect. He was a broken man with anger issues. I was there for him, loved him inside &amp; out. Because when things were good, they were good. We didn't even care to be around other people, we loved each other. We were each other's bestfriends. We'd kiss, we'd make love, we'd be silly around one another, and hold one another when sad. He was my best friend. He was my love. He has issues, as did I but...I started to stop loving him when he broke me. He broke me slowly. 
He broke me with his words. Then he broke me with his games. Then he broke me when he used my past trauma against me as a weapon.
Travis wasn't perfect, y'know? I stayed with him because I loved him. Despite me taking hit after hit, he was starting to change for the better. I broke that barrier he once had for the protection of his heart.
It's funny, because...although Travis broke me, I broke him as well. 
The love we once had for one another was gone. Instead of loving to speak to each other, hold each other, and being there for one another, we couldn't stand to be around each other. We'd..get irritated over the smallest things. We'd argue everyday. We ended up hating each other by playing all these foolish games.
But if I'm completely honest, I think we did all of those terrible things because we were terrified of losing one another. To everyone, we were the perfect couple. The couple everyone wanted to be. They could see the love we had for each other. But, I knew I lost feelings for him way before I left.
I changed. I was no longer the woman he once fell in love with. That soft, kind, considerate, loving person he once knew was broken. Gone. I became his enemy. I became a neglectful, careless, petty, angry person.
I just wanted to hurt him like he'd hurt me over and over. And I knew how. I knew how to hurt him. And that was by leaving him &amp; ignoring him. That was by shutting him out entirely &amp; showing no love. By being....cold.

I think I'll always love Travis. We were definitely toxic for each other, but...I don't think you can ever stop loving someone that you once loved. I'm not IN love with him, but I will definitely always have love for him. 

I'm over him. We had our time. We grew up. But I always wonder...
Will I ever have love like that again?

Will I have someone I can't wait to see, someone that I miss, someone that I yearn for, someone that is my best friend, someone who has my back and picks me always, will I have that? 

Will I ever have love like that again? Love that was once so sweet? 

Because I've dated since Travis, but it's never like the love I had for Travis. I just keep running into these guys that have flaws but are overall good people. I just didn't love them. 

Thing is, I wanted better after I left Travis. For myself. After I had my closure with him, I self reflected &amp; gained self esteem &amp; love for myself. I could never have a man or anyone treat me like how Travis once did. That was abuse. That was...traumatic.

337,"After my mentally ill brother died two years ago, two estranged nieces came back into my life. He wouldn't let me see them during their teen years and obviously devalued me to them so they stayed away.  In fact, his two sons will have nothing to do with me.   


They're now adults with kids of their own. The first year, I hosted a Christmas party and got them all presents, including the 7 grandnieces and nephews. We had a great time. One of these nieces told me repeatedly how much she loved me, how sorry she was for everything, and how much she wanted to be part of my life.  


But after Christmas, that niece became cold and distant, blocked me on social networking and lost interest in having a relationship with me. She contacted me once for money, and I helped her. But after that, she again cut me out of her life. It broke my heart.  


The other niece apparently wants to limit our relationship to Facebook as she  refuses invitations to get together except at Christmas. Even then, she doesn't bring all of the kids. I've never even met two of her kids. I was hoping to develop relationships with them, be a real family, but I realize that that will never happen.   


Last year, I got them all Christmas presents again even though they weren't part of my life.  And now, I'm wondering what to do this year. I've already started picking up gifts for them, but I'm asking myself if this is a good idea. The kids never see me, don't know who I am, and never express any gratitude for the gifts.  What's more, it's expensive to buy gifts for so many people. I really wish I'd never started doing this. I guess, on some level, I feel obligated to get them gifts now.  


What do you think? Should I send them Christmas gifts this year?",10Sep2019,1

339,"This is probably something most people would ask their dad about but he's away so here I am. To make a long story short:

I met a girl (call her S) and got a pretty big crush on her.

I never made a move in the beginning because she was off and on dating another guy (call him Z) and because I was too scared if she said no it'd be awkward at school.

However, a few weeks ago some stuff happened and I thought fuck it, I'll ask her out. But before I could do that she basically dropped off the face of the Earth.

Barely texting me, hanging out in other groups, and talking to Z alot more (and being flirty with him). I thought ok well clearly she's back with Z so I need to get over my feelings or it might end up being weird. 

To do this I start distancing myself to give me time to get over her and figure out some other stuff. Although she's already pretty distant so I didn't change much, apart from not having brief conversations with her occasionally at school.

she texted me asking if she did something wrong cuz I haven't been talking to her. I responded nah you're fine. She responded with 'are you sure? Because I miss our convos'. I'm not really sure how to respond because a part of me wants to say 'well you started talking to me less so I'm not going to try and make the effort when it doesn't even feel like you want to talk to me' but I feel like that's too harsh. 

Anything I can say?",10Sep2019,1
340,"I can just wake up and she is blackout drunk and alseep untill 3 PM . she has a problem with drinking in the morning and also now that I am older , she has started to do it a lot more for some reason . We have moved to a really nice place in a really nice house and we are an okay family so i don't understand what she is drinking her life away for . When she isn't drunk in the morning , she will 100% get drunk that night . So half my life is seeing her drunk which isn't nice . When she is sober , she is the best mom in the world . I can eat whatever i want , i can buy whatever i want , i can do whatever i want . I think that she is nice to me when she is sober to make up for when she is drunk .

she is a bit verbally abusive aswell , for example : when she was drunk one morning and i was scared she wanted to take a picture of me to show to dad for some reason and she kept shouting at me ""LOOK HAPPY! LOOK HAPPY."" 

&amp;#x200B;

341,"(TLDR is the title)

My tutor runs a teaching center, and is probably the most famous &amp; popular teaching center in my town. Students come as early as 3 hours to book good seats in her class, as it is ALWAYS packed full (like 200 students a class). I go to her for maths, accounting &amp; finance classes. Anything that has numbers is my downfall. 

Deep down, she's a pretty compassionate person but outwardly she literally gives no f\*cks about excuses. She will not sugar coat her words and hand it to you as it is. The first time I met her with my dad, she f\*cked me up in front of my dad, calling me a spoiled brat for not doing well in school - thinking that I can rely on my daddy for 'help'. I'm not sure if that woke me up? It just made me scared of her haha. 

To put it simply, I'm an idiot. My learning curve is slow. My academic results are average, it took a lot of struggling &amp; studying hard to even pass exams. I couldn't read until I was 8, I pretty much failed first grade. I had to extend 3 extra semesters in my degree because I failed a couple of subjects. Yes, I'm an idiot. I know I am, therefore I always ask for help when I don't know. I always thought - if you don't know, ask. Better than not knowing, doing it all wrong and causing more trouble.

When I went to consult her about something, she implied I was entitled &amp; expected people to spoon feed me information &amp; hold my hand because I don't use my brain to think. When I can google, I google, youtube, &amp; research what I can. But there are some things academically you kind need a real person to ask &amp; explain. (Like maths/accounts etc) 

I apply this principle at work, I got a job where I had ZERO knowledge of. ZERO. I applied for a different position but was given another to wait for a vacancy for the one I want. My boss knew this - she promised I would be taught by senior staff. They taught me the basics and I was left on my own. I somehow survived. One such senior, on the outside, he seemed like he knew what he was doing. In reality though, he didn't. He basically bullsh\*tted his way through work, even when he knew he didn't know, he'd wing it. My boss chewed him out for this, and he left soon after. My department was still cleaning up after his 'mess' months after he left. 

Therefore I've pretty much stuck to the believe that - *If you don't know, ask*. Plus, I'm a visual learner, I have to watch, then I learn. You know sometimes you get past year exam papers that come with answers? Everyone tells me to 'Do the questions without looking, then check if you're wrong.' If I did that, all my answers would be wrong, I have to follow the answers as I do, then I get an idea of how to do it. I'm also the type that has to write things down before I forget, the type that has to verbally discuss something to get my thoughts in order; essentially I'm a mess.

So, after being told that I'm entitled and should not keep asking questions - 'just figure it out yourself'. 

I don't know . . .what to do? I've done this all my 25 years of living, to be suddenly told my method of learning is wrong, I feel lost. (I see the irony in asking for help..again. I'm sorry about this)",10Sep2019,1

I isolated myself because I needed time to focus on myself because I was a trainwreck around others. And now, I just....stay away from everyone entirely. I moved out so I can hang out with people now. I can....have friends. I can...go on dates. I can do normal things that people my age do. And...I find it hard. Maybe because I'm scared. I'm scared that people will look down upon me because I'm not where I am in life. Or because of my weight gain. Or...because... I just don't feel pretty as I used to. But um.. I'm afraid. lol.
I'm afraid of going out there and being rejected. Or made a mockery of. 
It's been 3 years since I've actually hung out with friends. Months since I've had an actual friend. And I've never been out on a date.

I know I have to push myself into getting out of this ..position of isolation but... It's hard.

I don't even know how to be around people. I don't really know what to talk about. I don't have much going on for me ( I'm trying to change that), I'm..unhappy a lot. I don't have much memories or experience with anything.
I just feel awkward . Like genuinely awkward.

Girls my age have girl groups that they're in. Similarities. I just feel like an outcast. lol.
It's weird because I used to be extremely social. I used to make friends, and now that's become so hard.

I feel fragile too. Like...if my feelings are hurt or if I'm betrayed, my mental health will be at risk. I don't want to go back into that position in 2018, where my mental health was at an all time low. Y'know? I'm scared because I know how hard it was to repair myself after taking that many hits.

348,"I don't hate it but I don't love it and most days I don't even like it.  There are so many annoying, power tripping people who make it miserable, both coworkers and customers.  I am a cashier and I do grocery once a week.  I've been there 6 years.  Grocery is mostly nice but they keep trying to call me to cash when I'm too busy in my own department and the store managers take the cashier manager's side.  Lots of other bullshit as well like saying that they are allowed to make me work overtime (paid but still... being voluntold).  I tried to transfer to floral and the manager said she would look into it then several months later that she has too many people so no.  Then later she asks if I still want to transfer and I say yes and then she doesn't get back to me and hires several new people.  I feel like I'm lying on the ground on the street as people step on me and all the bystanders just watch indifferently.

 I'm just not sure how to get out because I feel like my department manager in grocery would be screwed if I left because she trained me to cover her duties on vacation and it would be hard to find a replacement.  

If I could get out I'd need a reference and my grocery manager would do it probably but the cash managers - I don't know if any of them would - my main manager doesn't like me, or really anyone.

I'm thinking maybe I could get a part time job alongside this job or try to work from home or find something else entirely.  Mostly something more enjoyable than being a cashier (I'm sick of it) - I value that over the wage (as long as it's above minimum and representative of hours worked).

For the last two years I've been living with one of my best friends and 90% of the time it's GREAT like those sleepovers with endless giggling great. Until it's not. He has a drinking problem for sure, and when he drinks it's really bad. He has threatened to kill himself on more than one occasion. It's always when he's drunk and he'll get really belligerent and crazy, almost always blaming me somehow. Well tonight I've had enough. We went out to the bars and he comes home saying that I always make everything about myself, that I never let him vent, I told him that if I did do that I didn't realize and that he should communicate that to me. He held a knife to his wrist and threatened to kill himself once again. I begged him to seek professional help and stop drinking which he has yet to do. Of course he refuses telling me how it's all because I'm a bad friend and don't care about him. I'm at my wits end. I can only be blamed for someone's suicidal thoughts so much. I've tried to cater to him but I just can't do this anymore, I'm not a therapist I can't put up with this. I don't want to live with him anymore after tonight.

364,"Hi everyone. Recently I'm feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and it's making daily life difficult. I've always had low level anxiety, but over the last few weeks it's really interfered with daily life. It seems to be based around social expectations and relationships.

For instance: When preparing to join my boyfriend and his family on their vacation (they're all lovely) I couldn't eat anything for days or sleep properly as I was so nervous. The thing is - there is no real reason for this - and I cover it up and don't think people really notice. The day before flying, I went to the bank to sort out some cash, but when the cash machine ate ¬£30 I almost had a complete breakdown in the bank and started crying uncontrollably. Looking back, this was bizarre behaviour for me. Professionally, I'm used to dealing with highly stressful situations and I travel extensively - and I never feel like I'm about to break down.

Most recently, I had a milestone birthday and invited three different friend groups. Only about half could make it as they're all over the country. The night before, I slept about three hours because I had such bad anxiety about it. I can't even really place why. I couldn't really enjoy it as I was so overly stressed about whether people were having fun or whether they were judging me because not everyone who was invited was there. 

One of my friends has an upcoming birthday this weekend. She made the effort to come to mine, but I have been called into work and I can't make hers. I feel such overwhelming guilt about this that I'm finding it difficult to even get ready for the day. I'm sure that it'll damage our relationship or she'll be angry and disappointed.

Is this a good idea? I feel like I am already running out of time age wise because I would be almost 21 when starting engineering.

He is a sonar technician on a US Naval Submarine,  (Please bear with me about my vagueness surrounding exact dates and times as I can not violate OPSEC)  and is only given one extended vacation per year following his underway. 

Seeing as this is our first year dating and his family lives out of state, I have not met his relatives in person. We thought this would be a good opportunity to make that connection. 

It‚Äôs worth mentioning I live in Washington State, I am 24 years old and have only have traveled to Portland &amp; California once for a wedding as a child. Other than that, I‚Äôve never had the chance to travel. 

Now to elaborate about my job. 

I am currently a temporary contractor for a third party company who‚Äôs biggest client is very prominent e-commerce company. I work in their mail center shipping and delivering packages to employees of the e-commerce company. I‚Äôm on a 3 month temp-to-hire contract, and this coming October will be the 3 month mark. 

The only real complaints I have are the pay, and the lack of flexibility surrounding time off. 

I‚Äôve also considered searching for a new job closer to his base  (we currently live a ferry ride or 2 hours drive around apart ) as that would potentially solve the vacation problem and the distance problem at once. 

The advice I need is, would it be impulsive or ill advised of me to consider leaving this job to invest in my personal life/ relationship?",10Sep2019,1

Or the one I really want to do, take a year ‚Äúoff‚Äù to try to follow a career in professional CSGO (don‚Äôt laugh please), I really think if I put my all into it I might have a shot to at least make it somewhere, but this I‚Äôm way to scared of telling my parents I have this passion, but also I‚Äôm scared of ending up in a job I don‚Äôt like and/or never knowing what could have been...",10Sep2019,1

379,"AITA here? Feel free to let me know because I genuinely don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll try to keep it short and sweet, my boyfriend never pays for anything of mine, he didn‚Äôt even on the first date. We always split the bill or I pick it up if he‚Äôs broke. I‚Äôm always buying him little gifts here and there to try and make him happy, and I don‚Äôt expect anything in return, but a surprise back would be nice every once in awhile. I also let him borrow money and he never pays me back, or only pays me back a partial amount. He does treat me like a queen and let‚Äôs me borrow things without asking for them back. The thing is, I‚Äôm a pharmacy school student, broke from tuition and never having time to work, and he‚Äôs not in any type of school and works retail full time, lives with his mom and doesn‚Äôt pay any bills. He spends a large portion of his money on weed and so he never has a lot saved up. Occasionally I‚Äôll smoke some of it without paying him back for it, which he thinks evens it out. So I guess what I‚Äôm trying to ask here is that is it okay that he never occasionally buys me gas, a coffee, dinner, etc., and I‚Äôm just too focused on the Monetary things and should appreciate him more, or do you all think I‚Äôm being reasonable and that if you cared about someone you‚Äôd put back a little money to spend on them like I do, because sometimes paying for your significant others things is a way to show you care.

381,"Sometime in 1992, my mom (24) and her boyfriend at the time turned my grandma and papa's garage into a studio apartment for themselves, my brother (1), and my sister (4).

It had a wood-framed king-sized waterbed, a wood dresser w/glass top, 2 matching nightstands with lamps, a wood entertainment cabinet that had a big black tube TV w/analog cable channels, a private-lined cord phone hanging on the wall, seafoam green carpeting, a wood-frame living room chair w/footstool, a kitchen with Pergo flooring, white cabinets w/metal handles, a full-sized white fridge, white &amp; black plug-in gas stove burner, sink, &amp; round glass table w/wood legs &amp; cushioned wood-frame kitchen chairs, 3 white wood ceiling fans in 3 corners, and white walls/ceiling.

In July 2000, my mom, brother, and sister moved away, with my dad (36) following them soon after. My grandma and papa started renting the studio out as a bed &amp; breakfast, and people would go to the beach or go hunting then come and walk with dirty feet on the carpet, ruining it. They stopped doing that when we moved back to our hometown in June 2008 when I was 6 and starting 1st grade, we stayed in there for about 3 months before we found a place of our own.

The studio was still operational until one day in early 2009, the waterbed sprung a leak, so my grandma and papa had to haul it out to the dump. After that, the dresser, chair, nightstands, lamps, TV, entertainment cabinet, cord phone, plug-in burner, and kitchen table/chairs were all sold, the cable service was taken out, and they stopped paying the bill on the phone line. Soon, my grandma and papa started using the room to store boxes and piles of all kinds of junk, never cleaning or even opening up the room at all.

I've thought about maybe one-day cleaning and fixing this studio up. But the thing is, everyone in my family looks back on it as looking ugly and outdated. I don't see why, I thought it looked fine enough before, what's tacky about what I described? I wanna make this studio into something that recaptures the coolness of what it once was, but in a way where it'll be a cool pad in 2019 and beyond.",10Sep2019,1

He talks about how 9/5 is slavery (Infront of people literally working 9/5 and love their job) and all his responses are him being sarcastic and smartass when he is completely not pressed on verbal confrontations.

387,"I hope this is the right place to post my question. If I need to move it please let me know and I will. My question is: Should I call CPS on a friend whose life has been off the rails for years now. I know this sounds harsh but that's why this is going to be a bit of a long story because I want to get the best advice possible for the current situation. Just for reference, everyone mentioned in this post (including myself) are well into our mid 20's by this time, so it's not like we are dealing with teenage bad decisions anymore. Okay with all that out of the way let me go back a little bit:   


 Jenny is super smart, sweet, funny, and got into college on a nearly full-ride scholarship based on several medical field scholarships ( I don't know much about the medical field so sorry if that's vague). Sure, Jenny had her problems (especially in the self-esteem and anxiety departments) but she was being very brave and had started seeking help through therapy and her drive to become a nurse was stronger than ever. Then about two years into college, her father died unexpectedly.

This hit Jenny hard, and as expected this is the point where things started going downhill for her. We all tried to be there for her, but nothing seemed to help, she dropped out of school, shut out all of her friends, even stopped going to therapy. No amount of reaching out, encouragement, or visits seemed to help. In the end, she went to go live with her mother, sister, and brother and kept in irregular contact with us.  Things didn't get really bad until out of the blue she publicly announced , through individual phone calls, that she was ""denouncing"" her family because they were unsupportive and refused to let her live with them anymore and asked any of her friends that ""still cared"" to take her in for a week or two. Jenny basically made it sound like they had kicked her out on the street corner and left her on her own.  After some having some conversations it turns out Jenny chose to leave once she AND her boyfriend were caught stealing from the family ( they had been for a year now apparently) for drug/pocket money. Jenny's family ( all three of them) had begged her stay if she left her boyfriend, agreed to get back into therapy and get a job to help repay all the money she had stolen. Jenny refused to meet these conditions and left, but chose to play the victim to get any support she could out of those who didn't know the truth.

Now, this brings us to the present.  For the past two years, Jenny has been hopping all along the west coast with her ""fiance"" (the same guy who helped steal from her own family and cheats on her constantly), sometimes living in his dad's attic, or with one of her estranged aunts, apparent they have even spent nights squatting in an emergency room. She is very open about their drug use and has tons of ""friends"" who seem to think they are all in a ""gang"" (if these guys ever met a real gang they would be toast.) Jenny only calls me and my husband to say how stupid it is that she can't keep a job for long, or when she needs something like a ride to a strange house, a few bucks ""if I can spare them"", or a place to stay ( by now I have two young kids and there is no way I would let her through the door anymore). Well, about five months ago Jenny announced that she was pregnant with her twins ( fathered by the same scummy guy), that her mother doesn't know and no one can tell her ""Because my babies don't need that negative energy"".  

This is where I am stuck, I have not had much contact with Jenny at all ( in efforts to keep my own family safe) and to be honest at this moment I do not know where she stands in life. I only have this information from her random phone calls, and posts that she makes to air all her laundry to her friends' list. All I know for sure is that all stable members of her family have been cut out, she has a history of drug use and unstable living situations, her babies father enables and encourages her bad habits, she has admitted its hard for her to keep a job and I am overall very afraid for those babies. It's not that I want her kids taken from her that is the last thing I would ever want, but maybe parenting classes, and some resources will help her be the best mother she could be and give those children the best possible life they can have. I open it to the advice of the internet because from what's left of our circle of friends I have been told that maybe it's not the best Idea to call CPS even to just have them check-in. What should I do? I feel like it's wrong of me to know all this and just hope things will be okay now. I know she is still a good person on the inside, she just needs help to get back there.",10Sep2019,1
390,"My girlfriend, since December, has had this ""girl"" (we really don't know if its a girl) add her on snapchat and ask her for nudes, saying that she's into girls.

All he/she wants to date my girlfriend and have her nudes, nothing else.

402,"My partner and I smoke weed. My partner has smoked it for years, decades even. I've smoked it regularly since we've been together, dabbled in it as a teen but I'm definitely a stoner now as an adult. 

Both of us, in recent weeks, months, years, have talked about giving it up. I'm all for it. I don't think we can justify the finance of it, and it makes us both really lazy. It's nice to have once in a while, but we end up blazing most of the weekend, and never get anything done. 

Every week he has said we'll quit starting Monday, and when the weed is gone, he's in a panic to get more. Even if we can't afford it. 

It used to piss me off no end when growing up I had friends who always claimed they had no money, but always had weed... now we are those people, and its really frustrating because we genuinely have no life as it is, and any money we have going on ends up getting spent on weed and tobacco. 

We are not financially safe enough to smoke up money like this. 

So here's what I'm having problems with:

There are loads of really good reasons for us to give it up. Money, health, being the main two. He's had a collapsed lung twice in the past, and in recent months has had bad chest pains which he thought could be precluding another collapse. He's used weed as a crutch for so long, to damped his emotions for the things he was going through - which have now come to a close, and he tells me he wants to quit but doesn't.

We are BOTH addicted to smoking, I don't deny I have my own part to play, but nothing I seem to say or do makes him actually try to quit. 

He then starts getting shitty with me, for trying to be firm and saying ""No, we agreed to this, and we can't justify it."" I don't think it's acceptable to have a fully grown adult man throw a tantrum at me, because he can't have the weed he's been telling me for so long he wants to give up. 

He doesn't want to go to the doctor to get help to quit smoking because he is worried that his cannabis use will go onto his medical record, and would exclude him from certain jobs if his records were to be checked. He won't go and see a therapist because he doesn't think they help... 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm fed up of feeling like the bad guy for trying to uphold something important, fed up of being treated like the bad guy for saying no.",10Sep2019,4

But at this moment, I'm fucking stupid and ugly, he would rather me go and kill myself.

No. I had checked my bank account when I first paid them back to see how much money I had left, which was like $250. A couple hours later I decided to check again only to find a $1 was missing. I mean, yeah, it's just a dollar, but it annoyed me a little that I knew I didn't spend anything, so I checked my transactions and surprise, Dave took it. Turns out I was in a membership I never signed up for. I canceled that and deleted the app, because if the app would randomly take a dollar, who knows how long until it took more? So, I checked my account again and noticed that I was now at $260. I was confused. No one sent money at all and I didn't put any money in my account, but I shrugged it off, Dave probably felt bad and gave me money. Now, I wouldn't be worried, but today it happened again.

410,My ex really hurt me through the years and when I say hurt it got to the point I tried to end my own life and had a major mental breakdown it took me 2 years to get back to myself.  I thought i was doing well not seeing him for over 2 years then bam out of nowhere he was 6 people behind me in a queue I hope he didn‚Äôt see me but joining a queue I‚Äôm sure he could see clearly that I was next in line. When I seen him he was staring at his phone. I feel so embarrassed at the fact that he knew about my breakdown and I feel ashamed that I let that man have that power over me. So I walked as fast as I could out of there not looking In his direction. This has really set me back all I could do today was feel numb. Any advice would be appreciated.,10Sep2019,6

412,"Hi,

When I was 12-13 years old, I became obsessed with film. It was an all-consuming, hair-on-fire passion. Outside of school-work and sporting activities, my life was dominated by watching films, reading about films, writing about films, and thinking about film craft. I dreamt of being a filmmaker, and at 18, I attended a film school in London. While there, I felt an immense amount of pressure to succeed and, being a beginner with a toxic need to be perfect before I'd even started learning, I became overwhelmed with fear that I was destined to humiliate myself by producing low-quality work. I took to drugs, my mental health declined and I left film school. 

Around the time I left, I received an inheritance, which was really a curse in disguise. I used it to perpetuate my hiding and my drug-use and didn't start working until I was 23. I took up a job as a support worker after volunteering for a couple of charities. I felt incompetent at work, but I persisted for 18 months before deciding I had to re-establish my connection to film. I studied video/film editing from home, which led to a couple of internships and some other related work experience. 

At this point, I'd developed pretty severe anxiety and my confidence had fallen lower than ever, despite trying to pursue something meaningful to me. My fear of humiliation and sense of inadequacy came to the fore in full force, which led to the terrible decision to back out of my film-career pursuit. I started doing affiliate marketing. It was nothing but a way of ""doing work"" that enabled me to avoid working with others and facing my anxiety. I was so unhappy I had to quit, and since then, I've bummed around doing very much part-time work (removals, bar work, a sales job I left after two weeks). 

Now I'm back at home with my family and I'm so ashamed about it. 

Being here, I have the opportunity to focus on editing again and correct the mistake of running away from it in the past, as Film is still the subject  I love most. But I'm not sure I can handle telling everyone I'm living with my parents for much longer, and by not working, I'm in some sense making my anxiety worse by not confronting it. 

I'm struggling to gain clarity on this situation. I'm not sure whether to stay here for 6 months and give everything towards building the skills to work in visual media; or to move out, get another job, and muster the strength amidst the emotional chaos of working a day-job to build towards a career in film, television or online visual media. 

What do you think? Any insights you have relating to my story would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you.",10Sep2019,2
413,"My parents are moving to Nova Scotia, my dads already there and my mom is moving as soon as our current house sells, so I‚Äôm moving out. I‚Äôm glad about moving out and was planning to after high school anyways, but with the added stress of time being a significant factor of whether or not I can even consider a house I know to expect limited options.

I found a really nice little place, and while viewing I asked how first and last months rent will be payed, and the landlord said last months rent on the day of signing the lease, and first months on the day of moving in, October first. She took her time responding and now wants the full $2700 of both months rent in one go, within the next couple days. I just started an electrical apprenticeship and don‚Äôt have a lot of money to add on to what I had saved for rent, tools and commuting have been expensive to start out. 

I‚Äôll be moving in with my friend, both of us we‚Äôre ready to split for the initial rent payment on signing the lease, but doubling up means we can‚Äôt afford it, and I actually need a place before this house sells or I‚Äôll have to quit my job and move to Nova Scotia. 

Is there anything I can do to other come up with the money in a very short amount of time without taking a loan? Or things I could say that would maybe convince her to go back on our original agreement? This is the only place that‚Äôs actually gone through with anything out of the many I‚Äôve messaged.

For Uni they gave us a secondary brief that we had to collect data from a park near mez I live in a very boring, snobby town, nothing happens, the most change youll see is rain, and thats it.

I left this secondary brief to focus on the primary ones, and I left it so much I completely forgot about it, 4 months data collection, didnt have to be everyday just every week maybe a day or two for a few mins, and I completely ignored it for comodity and lack of commitment.

Got high grades on everything this 1st year, but now the first project on the 2nd is using that data to create a piece ( Graphic design btw )

And now I have to come up with fakeish data worth 5 months data, because I start end of September.

Ive got no idea how to even collect data even If I started right now, I know I need to start now but I need a kick in the ass on where to start.

419,"I'm only 19 years old, so I fully understand that I'm young and have so much time to sort this life shit out. 

I have been pretty down recently, mainly due to my job. After 6th form I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. At the last second I accepted a 4 year engineering apprenticeship at a spring factory for some reason, I don't know what I expected I just didn't know what else to do. Its just a boring factory job, and I'm going to college with a load of people years younger than me and not to be big headed they just aren't as smart as me. Makes me feel like I'm back in high school at my current age. 

I just feel like I have fucked up so bad, I don't particularly want to be doing this as a job or career and I feel like I have so much wasted potential, I could be doing so much more. I look around at my friends and they're all at uni, having a great time doing what they're passionate about. People say don't compare yourself with other people, but that reality is not so far away, and it just feels like that's what I should be doing. 

I would happily quit this job in a heatbeat, but the problem I had before arises again. I have no clue what I want to do with my life, I could go to uni but I have no idea what I would study, I will have wasted a year of my life in this apprenticeship for nothing and all that uni debt doesn't seem too appealing anyway.

My current plan seems to be just finish the apprenticeship then run away to find something.. Better? But I'm really not sure I can make it that long, I'll be 22 by the time it'll be finished. 

This is just a bit of a ramble, I'm not really sure what I want from any replies but it's just nice to put this out there.

On the way home from work I caught a flat tire and I was waiting safely on the side of the highway with my car off and keys out of the ignition for roadside assistance for a tow truck. While waiting I was taking a nap because I was tired and about 15 minutes after calling roadside, a cop pulled over and asked what I was doing. He saw me taking a nap but I was alert when he pulled over behind me. When he got to my car I tried to take a drink of my Gatorade or water that I had and he denied me from drinking, he said idk if there's anything inside of them, the water bottle was closed but he still denied me from drinking and my mouth was as dry as the Sahara desert and I was barely able to talk but I still explained the situation and he asked me if I wanted to do a field sobriety test, I said no because I work a physically demanding job and my body is always sore and has muscle strains so I didn't want that to be used against me, I'm scared of field sobriety tests even when I'm sober because ive seen so many cases where sober people got arrested from a field sobriety test. After I said no to the test he immediatelyg handcuffed me and placed me under arrest and read me my rights. I told him I'm not answering anymore questions and I wanted a lawyer, he denied me a lawyer because he said they weren't gonna question me anymore but they still continued to question me at the station. When we got to the police continued to question me at the station. When we got to the station they asked me if I wanted to do a breathalyzer voluntarily and I said yes please, I wanted to do one hoping it would prove my innocence and release me. So I took the test twice and both times the test came back with 0.0 alcohol in my system because I don't drink but these cops still charged me with dui because they thought I might've taken something else when I didn't, I was just tired and dehydrated. I want to get a private lawyer but I only work part time overnight and idk if I'll be able to afford one so I might have to get a public defender. What do you guys think I should do about the laywer situation and can I sue after the case is over if I win? Any other tips and advice are appreciated",10Sep2019,3
453,"When I was 6, I was introduced to Dragon Ball, it was an excellent show that I still watch to this day. It had everything, great animation, awesome battles, and more. That was my first introduction to Animation. I then stopped watching it for about 5 years, but then discovered Naruto, and since then I have really been hooked, with my favorite series of all times being One Piece. The creator of One Piece is one of my biggest inspirations. And I want to be like him. I am currently 16, about to be 17 in December, and for about 4 years now, my dream has been going to Japan, and creating a series that others can enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been developing my story for about 7 years in total, but until about 4 years ago, I have not been developing it seriously. I have the skill, I have the compassion, but what I am very much worried about is...my race of all things. I am an African American in Missouri, and as most of you can tell, mostly Japanese people work in Shounen Jump (the company I want to get into). They had a few Korean People here and there, but nobody like me. I have searched far and wide to see if I even have a chance to be in Shounen, but...nothing. I decided to go directly to the source and ask the people directly by...stealthy getting there emails. They where nice, and told me that people like me are allowed, but just because people like me are allowed, im worried about how society would react. Japan isnt a very racist country, but it is pretty anti foreigner.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may ask, why cant I just go to a western publisher? Well, the answer to that is because these publishers never get you as popular as Shounen Jump could, and I want my story to stand strong next to the other great series that the world has grown to love.

454,"This is sort of a rant as well. The account is a throwaway so people in my life don't see.

I recently finished education, so I'm looking for a job. But i want a job in a creative field (I won't specify what for anonymity) so I looked at internships, work experience, assistants, literally signing up to basically lick the floor clean just to get my foot in the door. My parents contacted people, I contacted people, my friends send me job links but I've had no luck. It's been almost half a year.

The worst part is I applied for this one job, literally my dream job, and it's aimed at recent graduates. It was far away but I was willing to leave home for a year to do this. But then it turns out my friend applied too and it's basically confirmed that they got it. And while I'm happy they got a job, I'm so jealous and feel horrible about it. I'm honestly so sick of applying for job after job after job and being turned down, and now this is like the cherry on the cake. I haven't felt this heartbroken in a long time, and its stupid, because its just a job.

I've applied to loads of things similar but I have so little faith. I feel so worthless.

I have no idea what I do now? Like is my CV the problem? Am I the problem? I don't have the most experience but I also have what i'd consider the average amount for someone my age. I went to a great university. And everyone tells me the same thing: jobs aren't hiring this time of year, every graduate is going for every job, there'll be one for me soon etc etc it just makes me feel AWFUL. 

The past few months have ruined my self esteem. I feel untalented, worthless, and this has gotten so bad that I start to criticise every single part of myself - even how I look, always thinking ""I'm not good enough"" if I look at social media and see people succeeding. What's worse is every single one of my friends has a job now or is doing a Masters, so I'm just the odd one out being a massive failure.

I don't know how much longer I can live this way. Even the most basic retail jobs aren't hiring me even though I have retail and customer experience. 

I'm not really sure what to do next. I applied to more things today but I just have so little faith in myself. So I guess I just want advice, and if anyone has creative jobs, I guess I just want ideas for what to do next. Even if I give up on my dream I don't have a ""normal"" job as a backup because they don't want me either.",10Sep2019,1

Anyway. I started this new school yesterday and it was already a disaster. I got lost and was late, made to wait ten minutes outside which made me feel targeted and shamed. It was my first proper day and it felt terrible after that. I was alone for lunch as my friend had lessons and because I forgot my pass I wasn‚Äôt able to do any work so I sat in the courtyard alone reading my textbook. My next class was just as bad, I felt isolated in my table to a pint where the teacher basically forced the others to speak with me. It felt like I was imposing on them and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything after that. That night I stayed up until 10 doing my homework and then woke up through the night panicking.

Today, I woke up feeling sick. I‚Äôve only eaten an apple all day, which was this morning. I almost threw up and my legs wobbled all the time. It was only a little better today, I finished early and ran home, trying not to cry.

I already told my mum and dad, as I broke down just yesterday.  My tutor spoke to me today, telling me that if I wanted to go elsewhere or return to my old school, they wouldn‚Äôt stop me.

465,"6 years ago me and her met as part of an exchange programme in a European country, she is from the US and I'm from mainland Europe.

We have always kept in touch, and I visited her once. There has always been something special between us which we both acknowledge, but because you have to move on with life our contact was fairly limited for certain periods due to her, and once me, being in a relationship. Nevertheless we have both always felt we would be in a relationship if we lived closer together.

After planning a trip, we spent a full week together for the first time last week, and everything just felt so right. We now also know that we are compatible in a sexual way too.    

But now there is an ocean inbetween us again. We have carefully started talking about whether there was a future for us, and decided we could start considering  about me moving to the US. We are not expecting each other to move, but because (extended) family life is the most important thing to her it seems like this would be the only option: I am somewhat less bound, despite having an amazing relationship with my parents.

The advice I need is how to figure out whether I'm being rational or not: I love this woman so, so much, but I am actually doing well for myself here in Europe , after a lot of university degrees I am now starting to make progress career-wise and in October I will know whether I can start a PhD (50% chance). I love my family too, and my hobbies. Yet at the moment we are both gutted about not being able to hold each other, I'm crying a lot which I rarely do and nothing else in life but her and our relationship seem to have any meaning. But I realise that this might be because we were just together, in such an intense way, for a week, and these feelings will gradually become milder. Then again I wonder whether we should let things quiet down and go our own way, I might miss out on the love of my life.

In short, I am completely overwhelmed by strong emotions of love and sadness, rendering me unable to think clearly. I know we should probably postpone serious thought about this until the worst of the shock is over, but I cannot find a way to think of anything else. This could be detrimental as I have an important interview next week, but then again due to these strong feelings I don't care about a potential future without her anyways.

470,"Hello Reddit

Throwaway account here because it makes me feel safer to express myself about my 'problem'. Not really sure where to go so I figured I'd try general /r/advice and you'll point me somewhere more specific if necessary.

I understand that the thing I would like to ask advice about is a first-world-problem, but it's been bothering me enough for the past couple of months that I don't want to keep sweeping it under the rug because there are people out there with worse problems. I feel that shouldn't invalidate my own 'problem'.

The situation:

Since the start of my career I've worked up to 3 jobs simultaneously, at least 6 days a week and invested every cent and moment of spare time into generating passive income. This past year and a half things have taken off and I'm starting to make a high amount consistently each month. To the point where I've now been earning 3 to 4 times my monthly net income of my day-job which is already a high paying job. I still work my full-time job in addition to this passive income so I make about 5 to 6 times what I made previous years. I live rather frugally and all my income/savings go back into generating more passive income. I'm not rich in a go-buy-a-Ferrari-like-it's-candy kind of way, but I could pay off a house in full if I wanted to while I'm still young and keep growing my net worth considerably each month.

Recently started thinking about scaling down the full-time job or maybe even quitting my day-job altogether and just live off the passive income (and still have enough left over to keep saving). And in addition to that up my standard of living. For myself, I feel like I've earned this. I've worked hard since I've had my first student job at 15 years old and always set the goal for myself to at some point in time be in the position I'm in now. I feel incredibly fortunate to be where I am now in my early 30s. My money is starting to make money, and since this year I organized my day-job in a way that I have the freedom to work as little or much as I want (It can be project-based. I can set my own schedule for example: work for 6 months, take however long I want off if I wanted to, and do another project after that or something like that. For now I still work full-time). Obviously this raises a lot of questions, ideas and new goals/dreams.

And this last thing is where I get stuck. I would like to talk about my situation/dreams/goals/accomplishments with my family and friends, but am fearful of some reactions, jealousy, misunderstanding...

Most of my family (even close family like my mom and brothers) and friends know me as someone who lives on a rather tight budget, doesn't live in a flashy apartment, always talks about 'having to work' or at times stated that I didn't want or couldn't spend money on a certain thing (because I really didn't have liquid money at the time or thought I was better off 'reinvesting' it in my main goal). I travel often or buy myself something for my hobbies, but in general they don't think I'm rich at all and probably even think I'm struggling from time to time.

I've tried asking friends about what they'd do if they had a lot of free time, money and no worries. But I feel there's a giant disconnect because they've never thought about it because it's not in their cards immediately and they have more important things to think/worry about. So the answers are very generic and shallow, or they don't like talking about it because it's fiction and distant dreams for them while I'm sitting here actually looking for their advice, input, and how to deal with my questions.

My 'issues':

\- I struggle with the fact that I don't feel like I can be proud of my work and accomplishments without fear of looking/sounding like a giant douchebag to friends and family who are struggling more.  
\- I've never really talked all that much about all that I do exactly or how much time/effort I've spent on making money and am afraid that the shock-effect won't be beneficial to my relationships.  
\- I'm worried about my family/friends looking at me differently/have certain expectations going forward if they'd know, or that they'll feel they've been lied to.  
\- At the same time I feel like I'll never be allowed to be in a tough spot anymore or talk/complain about certain things.  
\- I feel alone and think it would help to find some extra new friends that are in the same financial situation as me so they can relate better and have/had similar experiences. But where would I find people that are newly rich or new high earners or early retirees?

All insights or personal thoughts/experiences welcomed.  
Thanks in advance.",10Sep2019,1
471,"I'll just cut to the chase. My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) are very sexually active, and we're very comfortable with each other. We always talk things out, and are very honest with each other.

474,"To start this off I‚Äôll be talking about how I got my car and my plans. I currently own a car that was given to us by our family friends as they were moving out. I use this car as a daily driver and do carpool in the mornings. I enjoy my car but as an enthusiast I‚Äôve been looking at other cars to buy, but it is kind of hard to own more than one car here where I live (Okinawa) due to restrictions of one car per person. The car is in descent condition and might last a year. In about a year when my family is moving we plan on passing my car onto our other family friends as we got it as a gift and they were friends with them too. For those wondering it is a 2004 Mazda Demio sport
The advice part here has to do with my want for a new car. When I say new I don‚Äôt mean new from a dealership I just mean a different car. Most used cars here go for about 1 to 4 thousand no matter what brand or model it is (unless it‚Äôs from a dealer or it‚Äôs actually worth much more). I‚Äôve been looking at getting a Mazda Miata which sells for around 2-3k or a skyline at the same price point. The issue is that we planned on giving my car to our family friends which if I bought a new one I would pass that on and I have to carpool in the morning so Miata is out of question. My parents aren‚Äôt enthusiasts and are usually the ones who believe the  best cars are the ones with the best MPG and most practically (which is agreeable for daily driving). So if I asked about selling my car for around 1.5 to 2k and buying a new one they would wonder why and would probably say a quick no. I usually explain to my parents why I buy things and convince them that i am making a good purchase and they‚Äôre fine with it, but this is quite a different level. The most likely situation is that I keep my car for a year and then when we move we give the car to our friends. If my car stops working for some reason  it‚Äôs usually cheaper here to just buy a new one, which may actually be the case with the noises it has been making, however our friends who owned it also had this.

TL:DR I‚Äôm not sure if I should sell my current car so I can buy a new one, but then have to ask parents about it or just wait until it possibly breaks or it lasts and we pass it on?",10Sep2019,1

479,"So i started at this restaurant as a server assistant for a month now.  The pay is decent but nothing compared to how much the servers make.

480,"Sooo i made a really dumb mistake. 

I will refer to my girlfriend as ""Elizabeth"".

I got a random text from Elizabeth's snapchat. She was asking for our videos together, y'know. The kind of videos you don't want to share with anyone else and want to keep to yourselves. I didn't think much of it. We have together forever a year and a request like this didn't surprise me at all. I sent over the videos. 10 minutes later, Elizabeth's mother texts me and tells me that Elizabeth is sleeping at the moment. I didn't think much of it but I assumed that Elizabeth was actually awake and that her mother did not realize it yet. Later that day I ask Elizabeth about asking for the videos. She has no idea, and told me that it wasn't her. Now, I asked her again because I felt something was off about the way she asked for the videos. I wasn't paying close attention because I just woke up and was rushing to get to work on time. After re-reading the conversation. I missed some major red flags. Elizabeth never uses caps when texting, this person, did. Kaylen never uses certain words. This person used words kaylen would never use. The more and more I re-read, the more and more I realized how improvised the responses were.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, someone, has our private videos..

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to identify the person as best I could. But she had a list of about 8 people that could have had access to her account. (i know i know, bad idea, didn't know the list was so large.) I requested her data from snapchat and was able to view the different logins and devices used to log in. I found the device that logged in, it was an Android. A Moto E5 Play, running Mushroom. The Moto E5 Play is not really up there when it comes to phones. So im assuming someone used the phone just for this purpose. I've also tracked the location of the IP address that was logged when the user logged in. But I'm assuming the IP was changed because it came back to being halfway across the country in Miami. Which I'm assuming is where a server is located for a VPN service or something similar.

I'm out of ideas. Another important fact, is that we are still both minors, 17 to be exact. I know I know, a stupid teenage mistake. Just need to figure out if theirs anything else I could do.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation? Another big question of mine, if I were to contact local police, do you think it would have any effect? Or would it be a dead-end?

481,"I'm almost 21, and in uni currently, far away from my hometown. Here I've met a girl with whom I shared classes, and we clicked from the first conversation we had, and went on to be each other's first gf,bf. This was the first serious relationship we've both been in. Everything seemed so perfect and easy with her, and I felt lucky because I thought I have finally met my soulmate. The year that it lasted was like a dream come true in the beginning but my neglectful asshole narc personality prevailed, and after hurting her (and by this, her family) again,and again, I decided that this can't go on any longer because I did not want to hurt her any longer, (or it was because of cowardice and the inability to take care of another human being) we broke up last winter. We tried to be friends for a while, but I seriously couldn't go on like this as I was still in love with her, and with the possibility of getting together again is totally wiped out, after each fun little moment we had, I came home feeling completely awful (this too,was awfully insensitive and selfish too in hindsight.) Nowadays we are still in the same classes, but no longer on talking terms, we literally don't even look at each other any more. My social skills are lacking and my personality doesn't really align with my classmates, so I don't really have anyone to talk to here. My real problem however, is, that I can't seem to be in proximity with her without feeling my heart sinking all the time. I feel like I really miss her, but the damage has been done, and I feel like trying to be friends with her wouldn't solve anything, and would only be a temporal remedy before I go back to feeling like shit again. She's always on my mind, and literally every single thing she does, I overthink it and think that she wants to open to me, but after this does not happen, I go back to feeling sad and let down. Now I know that the way I think is insanely selfish, and childish. I am working hard on improving my personality, but when I look at her, I can't help but feel complete sadness. Changing unis, classes etc. sadly is impossible for me, and I feel like this whole mess is taking a great toll on my mental health, and shifting my views to be sad and pessimistic all the time. What could I even do about this whole situation? Sorry for any grammatical errors by the way. Thank you in advance.",10Sep2019,1

Well a few days ago a few people were having a discussion about gender/sex and saying that it was absolutely ridiculous that there are so many different genders/sexes now and that there is only two, male and female, and scientists say that blah blah, there was more but that's basically the point.  


The person whose desk is next to me looked at me and we both kind of said ""that's not really a conversation for here is it"" and I said ""She has no idea if there is anyone here that would be offended by that, why is she talking so loudly and even talking about this at work.""  


My dilemma is, should I do something about this? I originally thought about printing out an article and leaving it near their desk, but I don't think they'd read it or be open to learning and I just think it would be viewed as really passive aggressive. I don't know if I should go to HR instead and say something about it, I would really want it to be anonymous though, but maybe it's not my place to say? I'm a cis female and so maybe I should leave it but then I think being a good ally means not just leaving things like this to people who are affected by it personally.

http://www.columbianeurology.org/neurology/staywell/document.php?id=36854

Untreated, this can lead to serious brain development problems and pressure on the brain.

The surgery used to 'correct' this was fronto orbital advancement, which involved titanium plates being screwed into my skull from the inside to assist skull growth. Apart from being bullied about the scars that run from one ear to the other, I never payed much more attention to the outcome of the surgery. I always put it off as nothing at the time, but I got crazy headaches all throughout my childhood.

Now that I am 19, I'm becoming more critical of myself and what I feel. I haven't really stopped getting headaches, I just have constantly put it down to stress or not enough water. I went skydiving at 16 it felt like my skull was literally splitting. Occasionally on planes my head will have a similar but not as intense splitting pain. My head is alsomuch noticeably smaller than everyone around me, and there are dents along the scarline of where the surgery joined my skull. In particularly one section intrudes a fair bit, this is also the spot that hur most regularly.

Essentially not long after Barry passed earlier this year I was cleaning through his old belongings when I came across an unkempt book; The title read ""How We Beat The Bandits"" and the subtext which was just as intriguing read ""The syndicate tells how we beat the bandits in Australia, Las Vegas, Monte Carlo, London."" written by a ""C.J Mckenzie"" whose person I couldn't find any info on, no family not even a page on him. Long story short it turns out Keith and Barry as well as his friends were able to come up with a way to rig those one armed slot machines that are in casino's and took the world by storm and conversed with the Mafia and apparently Frank Sinatra himself in the states; It was back in the 60's. The problem is though that the book has a lot of pages ripped out so after searching online the only source of the book I could find was an archive that showed where the book was located in a few university's libraries (where I was told I would have to be a student to access the book) and one research library where there is no way I'd be able to book an appointment with and on top of that it's almost a whole state away.

Do I:

1) Continue full-time at uni and go part-time into studying at TAFE, while continuing part-time at my job

2) Continue full-time at uni, attempt to get a part-time apprenticeship so I'd be learning and getting paid, and if I got the apprenticeship, quit my job

3) (If I applied and succeeded in a full-time apprenticeship) quit uni and maybe keep up my part-time job

This is an Intro to Economic Institutions class. Professor and state are very republican. Professor is an older man, probably late fifties. Professor commonly makes political remarks in class stating his opinions without calling them his opinions or biases.

 Professor asks class if anyone likes Elizabeth Warren, no hands were raised (I think this is due to Professor's comments about her in previous classes). 
After a little while, Student A raises her hand. She is the only one to do so.
P: Why do you like Elizabeth Warren?
A: I like what she stands for and that she's a woman, you know, woman power.
P: Okay. Well, what about Bernie Sanders? Do we have any Bernie fans?
No hands are raised. He has previously said worse things about Bernie. 
Again, Student A raises her hand hesitantly.
P: You like Bernie?
A: Yeah, not as much as I used to, but I still like him.
Professor talks more about government control and socialism. Student A is curious about how the government interferes. Professor asks Student A how to help climate change. Student A said something about limiting driving certain cars. Professor said that's the government interfering. Student A is confused, still. 
Student B enthusiastically raises hand and rebuttles loudly saying in Germany, people driving VW's would be pulled over and their car ""pulled"", saying that's the government. Student B said this in an argumentative manner. Many students then start clapping and Professor shouts ""Sing it, sister!"". Student C, who is seated in front of Student A, turns around and tells Student A that she has a valid argument (and other things, but that was the only thing I could hear), as the class response and professor's response was obviously demeaning and inconsiderate. Professor continues lecture without further explaining to Student A.
After a while, I notice Student A shifting in her seat and getting uncomfortable. Student A stands up and goes to exit the classroom, with red eyes and her head down. I stand up, walk over to her as she is walking, and tell Student A that I'm on her side and her point is valid and I give her a hug.
 Professor says ""Aww, don't leave!"". Student A responds ""Well, I'm not learning,"" Professor responds (can't remember what he said, nothing very important). Student A returns to her seat. Professor continues lecture.
 At the end of the lecture, Professor walks over and crouches down next to Student A's chair. Professor, Student A (crying), and Student C talk while the class is filing out. I stand up and stand behind my chair, letting people pass to leave.
 After most people have left, I walk over to the group and crouch down behind the chair next to Student A. Professor talks about how nothing is wrong with Elizabeth Warren, she's a scholar. During this time, Student A is crying and Professor is mainly making eye contact with me. I interject saying ""I don't think it's about that. It's more about how the class reacted and the teacher reacted. It was very unprofessional and disrespectful. The classroom should be a safe space and that was not a safe space to be,"" Student A repeats ""very unprofessional"" after I said that line. Professor starts standing up, very hostile, and backing away saying ""Don't even start with that crap. The classroom is not a safe space. If you're looking for a safe space this is not the class for you, you shouldn't be taking this class"" Professor repeated in different ways that this isn't the right class for me. I sat there for a moment in shock at what he had just said. I could feel my emotions overwhelming me (knowing I was about to cry) and got up and left to the bathroom where I proceeded to cry.

515,"My parents(57) and my brother(38) are great sometimes. They like to do stuff, they are always offering to babysit or help out, they show up to stuff, and they‚Äôll give you anything you ask for, and they love my children and are always wanting to do activities with them and teach them things. However, they have some very strange and unhealthy (borderline toxic) behaviors as well. I‚Äôm not sure if they have always been this way and I didn‚Äôt notice until I became an adult or if it evolved into this overtime while I was distracted by being a mom, wife, student, and starting my career. I need help identifying these behaviors as well as advice on how to handle them since they are starting to effect my mental well-being. I‚Äôll start with what bothers me the most and then I‚Äôll just randomly add other things that stick out in my mind over the past couple of years.


Also want to add that I live in a very small town and my house is close to all of my family‚Äôs houses. My brother and my parents are next door neighbors. We all live within 5 minutes of each other. 


1. Talk negatively about me in front my children.  They don‚Äôt say it TO them but in front of them. My family is very gossipy, I grew up around gossip my whole life, it‚Äôs like a pastime for them. My kids are 8 and 11. This isn‚Äôt done often (that I am aware of) but it happened yesterday. My son (who looks up to both me and the person who was saying this stuff) came home and asked me why they were saying bad stuff about me and that is what pushed me to seek advice from reddit. 


2. My family constantly thinks they need to know where I‚Äôm at, what I‚Äôm doing, who I‚Äôm with, when I‚Äôm going, when I‚Äôll be back, who is at my house, who‚Äôs car was that, where did I get that, what time stuff is, what kids are at my house, etc..  to the point where if I‚Äôm doing something private and I‚Äôm asked about it I will just lie. I don‚Äôt just volunteer this information, it just comes up in different ways (they will see my car gone from my house, a video or photo posted on social media, when I ask them to babysit, or by just mentioning it in casual conversation). I actually try to avoid letting them know these details because they will always ask me to do them a favor or run an errand for them (they are don‚Äôt like leaving the house). 


3. If they find out later that I have done anything it will be Why didn‚Äôt I tell them, why didn‚Äôt I invite them? They want me (my kids) around all the time and want to be involved in every thing. If we do something as a family without informing or inviting them then I hear we are  ‚Äúweird for not telling anyone, weird for not inviting anyone‚Äù. I get passive-aggressive messages about not being invited a lot of times while I‚Äôm still at the event (example: an Easter egg hunt.. after seeing a photo of my kids on social media ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you tell anyone, we would‚Äôve came‚Äù.) I am made to feel guilty about not including everyone. Halloween is always an issue here.. for some reason they expect us to do everything with them on Halloween. If we take our kids to trick or treat at a few of their dad‚Äôs family members houses then I get messages the whole time ‚Äúhurry up, where are you, we are waiting on you‚Äù. 


They will also ask about whatever activity we did in a weird way with weird tone ‚ÄúI see YALL went to [activity]‚Äù with emphasis on yall.. sometimes will add things like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been wanting to go to that.‚Äù If we ever do anything together one time it then become expected for us to do it together every single time, they find it offensive if they aren‚Äôt involved the next time. A lot of times when invited to places they won‚Äôt go though. They prefer to do stuff on their terms, so when we do invite them they will try to plan every detail (where to eat, which directions to take, what time to arrive and leave). Idk if they just want me to feel guilty about us going off or they really wanted to go and are truly offended they didn‚Äôt get an invitation. Daughter wants to have a hotel sleepover with friends ‚Äúwell can I come I‚Äôm family, no one else has to be invited but I do‚Äù. Ask my kid‚Äôs friends all about who their family is so they can find out if they know them or not, they will talk about this forever, even going as far as trying to see where they live and looking up criminal records. 


4. They call me weird and judge me for not being exactly like them. If I like something you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs weird. Talk a way you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs weird. Don‚Äôt do something with my family that meets your standards, it‚Äôs weird. Especially stuff like hiring an exterminator, a babysitter, a house cleaner, etc.. Have an indoor dog, I‚Äôm weird. Constant judgement if things are done differently. However, I have noticed that a lot of times they will end up doing the same things that they call me weird for. Example: I wanted an indoor dog my entire life but wasn‚Äôt allowed to, moved out and got an indoor dog. After hearing about how horrible it is to have an indoor dog time after time after time (they think dogs should have free range like a farm dog) now guess who decided to get two indoor dogs? My parents. They also believe kids should have mostly free range. Want to go on a vacation ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too far away, I like this place instead‚Äù. Want to leave the country ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get kidnapped‚Äù want to take a cruise ‚Äúoh those things are dangerous‚Äù. 


6. They like me to send details and photos of things. Go on vacation they want daily photos and details of our daily itinerary. Want to know who my kids teachers are (they mail them their teacher‚Äôs name before school starts) so they can look them up on social media and see if they know them or find out who is in their class with them (We as their parents don‚Äôt even do this, I find it strange). They want to see kids on first day of school (pics or in person), want me to bring them over after the first day of school so they can hear all the details in person, want to know details of kids school events so they can attend.‚Äù


7. They were against me seeking any independence and this worsened after I had my children. I moved out and started working right out of high school (they didn‚Äôt want me to move out but didn‚Äôt make a huge deal about it) and shortly after my SO and I had our children. When my daughter was born they wanted me to move back home. They brought it up constantly and even made me feel extremely guilty for moving out. I was alone a lot since we had one vehicle and my SO worked all the time so I could stay home with our daughter. I felt so guilty that I would spend most of my time at my parents house. I was in a very vulnerable place. The birth was very traumatic and my daughter had health problems. Looking back I probably should have sought therapy and medical advice but I didn‚Äôt. This went on for months and caused a lot of issues in my relationship. Eventually my SO agreed that we could move into my parents house if I agreed to get a college degree while living there, so that is what we did. I finish college and immediately line up an apartment. We have outgrown the room we are staying in, I have recovered emotionally and feel ready to take on the world with my new found independence. I feel like this is when things worsened and my family‚Äôs nosiness and desire to be overly involved in my/my kids‚Äô life really went into overdrive. They tried to guilt me into not moving out but I was more than ready ‚Äúyou need to just stay here and live, you‚Äôre crazy if you want to move out, you can save money here.‚Äù This is in 2013 when everyone and their uncle is now on social media and has a smartphone. 


8. A few more examples that I wanted to add..


When it‚Äôs time for my kid‚Äôs bus to arrive my mom will message me a reminder. I tell her over and over to stop, it‚Äôs annoying. I have never once not picked my child up from any event on time, including from the bus stop. Ever! But my mom feels the need to remind me at least 2-3 times a week what time it is so I don‚Äôt forget. I have told her to stop. I have told her it‚Äôs disrespectful. She says she doesn‚Äôt care about what I think she only  cares about my kids being picked up on time. (Might I add we often walked home from the bus stop alone as kids, had quite a few rules to follow, received routine displays, etc..). On Friday‚Äôs their dad picks them up from the bus stop. She found this out and has now started sending him messages reminding him not to forget to pick up his kids, sometimes while he is at work. 


When we lived with my parents when I was in college my mom would mute their tv if my SO and I were in our room talking or if we were talking to our kids about anything with a more serious tone. 



My dad found out we were having our half mile long driveway re-gravelled (I had asked him who he uses and he proceeded to ask me when they were doing it. I thought it was just normal casual conversation. He said he would try to be off work when they come. I told him that wasn‚Äôt necessary as my SO was paying for it and was fully capable of telling them where he wanted it poured). He got off work and showed up at my house during that time slot to tell them where to pour it (I was not there, my SO told them where he wanted it over the phone when he ordered it). My SO then asked me to never tell them again when we are getting stuff like that done. He said my dad told them something different than what he actually wanted and it cost him $800. We were home before it was complete and when the gravel dude finished up  my dad then proceeded to ask him to take a load to my brother‚Äôs house and paid him cash to cover my brother‚Äôs driveway. My brother is 8 years older than me and has no children. 


My brother (and sometimes his wife) goes to my parents house every single day. They tell each other their every move, my parents will message him and tell him when and what they have for dinner so he can come eat. They pay for things for him that they don‚Äôt pay for for my sister and I (birthday money, vacation money, paying for lunch out to eat). If my mom and I go to dinner together she will message my brother and ask him what he wants and then bring him something home to go from the restaurant.


The last straw that lead me to making this post: I keep a little boy on Monday evening while his mom works. My parents keep him on Tuesdays. The mom is my childhood friend who a single mom who lives about 30 minutes away. She is poor and she struggles a lot and he‚Äôs a sweet little boy and I am happy to help out. To keep her from having to drive all the way over here I just drop him off at my parents for her on Tuesday morning (he stays the night with me). He comes every single Monday. Yesterday my mom asked if she could pick my kids up from the bus stop because she was watching her friend‚Äôs daughter that day and they all go to school together. I say yes because I know my kids will be excited to go play with her. The little boy I keep comes over arrives at my house a few hours later. He wants a mohawk, I spoke his hair all cute like a Mohawk and post it on snap chat (his mom is always looking at my Snapchat). Someone sees his photo on Snapchat and so my parents and siblings know he is at my house. They proceed to talk about how weird I am for keeping him at my house instead of bringing him to their house to socialize and play with other kids. This is said in front of my children, my son comes home and tells me about it and asks why they were talking badly about me and why it wasn‚Äôt okay for the little boy to be at home with me. All I told him was I like spending time with just [little boy] sometimes just like I like spending time with just you sometimes. He seemed satisfied with that answer.


Since graduating college and beginning our careers I have grown up, became a fully functioning independent adult. My SO and I have a great relationship, steady well paying jobs, we own our on house, we travel, our kids make good grades. I am able to work part-time and life has just been really good. So much so that we are considering having a third child. We have a few bumps along the way but just normal things. However, it seems the more independent  we become the more these issues with my family arise. I want to be able to confront and address their behavior but I‚Äôm finding it quite difficult to do so when I can‚Äôt identify exactly what they are doing since it‚Äôs often disguised as ‚Äúcaring‚Äù or ‚Äújust wanting to be involved‚Äù.

517,"I'm trying to gauge  whether I need to work on this or not. Often times in personal relationships and friendships when I get upset or angry with people I hold onto that feeling and don't address it immediately, I like to ask for some space and take time to figure out how I feel, a day or two typically does it for me. I do this to avoid over reacting towards people and I worry about pushing people away if I act angry towards people as I don't have lots of people in my life as it is anyways. Any thoughts on this? I typically find myself to be a good communicater however when it come to negative emotions I feel i need space and I don't know if this is healthy or not. 
I HATE when people blow up at each other I don't yell at people and I think it's unfair to let your emotions blow up and take said emotions out on other people.

519,"To give a bit of background, I wasted the last four years moving and following my family around (because I had no say in what we did, but it's a different can of worms) and never quite got to build up a resume or get any real work experience. I thought I was out of options until a few months ago, when I decided to sign up for Job Corps and see where that would take me. I was able to earn a GED (dropped out) and get a handful of clerical certifications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), and when I finished I was promised a job and all sorts of wonderful aid to help me get situated and move up in life. Except none of that happened. Here I am almost three months later, jobless and with next to no leads, being forced to move out some time in the near future because the head of the household is moving into a retirement home. The two other people I live with, my brother and uncle, are both irresponsible and untrustworthy with money handling, and I doubt trusting them to do anything would turn out well for me. 

On the job side of side of things, I simply am unable to find work regardless of where I apply. Initially I tried the area of work I wanted, office administration or some other clerical position. No dice on finding anything where I live (Rhode Island, and without a car so I can't travel much further than public transport would take me), so I tried applying to retail stores. Supermarkets, clothing stores, etc.; the only emails I ever receive back are the usual ""thanks for reaching out to us, but at this time we've picked another candidate for this position."" I've gone as far away from my ideal goal as to apply to warehouses and factories, and yet still they either don't reply or reply to tell me they don't want to hire me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I have no real work experience and need a job *now.* Family is not an option, I don't have friends, and I don't have anything to sell. &gt;!I'm also not in the best mental state as you could no doubt imagine. I was driven near suicide a handful of times in the past because of similar situations, and it's freaking me out right this moment.!&lt;

520,"He refers too himself as an Anarcho-capitalist. He seems to heavily look down upon any authority figures especially police officers.
Constantly argues his viewpoints with others and likes too state ""The Nazi's are Left-wings"".
Use too heavily discuss conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, Sandyhook and most recently something about SSRI's(xanax?) or whatever it is used by the government to mind control weak individuals too start mass-shooting sprees.

521," Hey!

I(M25) think that not having a beautiful face is what make me not attractive to a woman. I had many girlfriends in my past but later I started to hate my facial features so much that it makes me so depressed. I slept with 10 different women and my last relationship (One year ago) last 4 years because she broke up with me and it is probably because I was broken and not attractive to her anymore. Even if I had good relationships with woman I've always been complexed and worried about my face and I think it is the source of all my problems (Anxiety, Depression, Low-Esteem).

What I don't understand is that some people told me in my life that I was very very attractive and some made fun of me because of my facial features and this has hurt me a lot. What's crazy is that with good lighting like in a bathroom or with a flash in a dark room I can actually look **really** attractive. I am going to the navy and i will focus to become to the best version of myself and stop putting energy on women even if i really want to get laid and to have a girlfriend. 

I would love to find a woman again who likes me for who I am and not carrying at my facial flaws and my height. I am 5.7 feet and I weigh about 150lbs(All muscles and no fat) but even if I have an incredible fine body I think it is not enough to have a girlfriend. On tinder, I am doing well because I can make myself very attractive with good lightning but in real life it is different and I can't do anything about it. So I decided to stop being someone else and I deleted Tinder for good.

When I walk in the street and I look at myself in a shop window I can feel so depressed. I was so close to being attractive but my prominent brow ridge, my laugh lines, and my shaved head disadvantage me a lot. Do you have any tips to help me deal with my situation? Do you think it is possible to be attracted by someone even if he has ugly facial features?

Thank you for your time!

522,"Some background info:

My roof received some damage from hurricane dorian. 
My house was bought as new construction built in 2015.
Located in North Charleston, South Carolina.
The roof has a 25 year warranty 
Sold as rated for 140mph winds
The highest the city saw was 60-70 mph winds. Others in the community have had inspections discover faulty craftsmanship. 

The problem is the builder is refusing to repair the roof as it is an ‚Äúact of nature‚Äù and therefore not covered under the warranty. I would not have purchased a home in a hurricane area if I had known that the roof would not stand up to the probable hurricane force winds.

527,"So this has been an issue for a while. I work in retail at a mens store and I regularly get harassed, sexually explicit comments and asked out by older men.

528,"For transparency sake, I‚Äôm (F/21) quitting in 3 months because this job has completely broken me and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. But I need some validation that this job is as shitty as I think it is. I have been working with this company for a little over a year. I got hired on as a marketing assistant. In my department, it was me, the marketing coordinator, and the marketing director. So just us 3. 
I realized when I took the job what being an assistant entailed. But they really squeezed everything they could out of this title. 
Not only was I doing the work the rest of my department didn‚Äôt feel like/was too lazy/ busy work. But I would do chores for the CEO of the company. Literally order furniture for his apartment. Get him clothes. Go get his lunch. (Mind you. He has an executive assistant. The EA is also the receptionist. Anytime she isn‚Äôt available/calls in sick/takes her lunch. Guess who covers for her? Including siting in the lobby to answer phones and buzz people in. Answer: me)
About 6 months into working here they hire two other assistants. One for the production team. The other for sales. 
Flash forward 3 months after that, the sales assistant is fired. 
I am called into my boss‚Äôs office and told I have a ‚Äúnew opportunity ‚Äú
I‚Äôll take over for the sales assistant. On top of continuing my title as marketing assistant. They called it a ‚Äúwonderful chance to grow‚Äù 
So. I‚Äôve been doing this for about 3-ish months now. Working practically 2 jobs. Mind you, the sales assistant, while he was working here, got paid the same amount I‚Äôve been getting paid for a year. So, naturally, if I am taking on all of (yes, all of) his responsibilities, I deserve a pay increase. Right?
Flash forward to this month. My boss has left the company (yesterday was the first day of him not being here) and the ceo called me and my coworker in the department to tell us ‚Äúyou guys can prove to me that you can go up one position each (I.e coordinator becomes director. I become coordinator) then that‚Äôs awesome. And we might possibly give you a raise when that happens)
MIGHT? Give us a raise if we‚Äôre literally being promoted? 
There‚Äôs so much more. On top of me being bullied for being the youngest in the office. Teased by the other assistants. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôm quitting at the end of the year. But when I talk to my dad (who, not only is he partners with my company. But he is a VP at his company. So higher up exec) he says I‚Äôm wrong. They don‚Äôt have to care about me or give me more money and I better do whatever they say. 
I‚Äôm stuck.  I‚Äôm upset. I come home crying most nights from work. It‚Äôs affecting my friendships and my relationship with my boyfriend. I‚Äôm broken. 

TLDR; company fired a coworker. I was told to pick up where fired coworker left off but also keep doing what I have been doing. No raise. No salary adjustment. Not even talk of it. I‚Äôm frustrated and overwhelmed. My (executive) dad thinks I‚Äôm dead wrong.",10Sep2019,2

534,"I live in an apartment complex managed by a company.  A few days ago the water pressure went from high/normal flow to really low/weak.  The maintenance guy came out and said he fixed the filter and cleaned it out and all that but the flow is still very weak.  It's to the point that it takes me almost 20-30 minutes to shower where it used to just take maybe 5 minutes max due to how strong the stream was. 

The guy keeps saying there's nothing wrong with the pressure flow and implying that I'm making this all up when both my wife and I agree that the water pressure has been significantly lower - and she rarely ever cares about all this stuff.  I wish I had taken a video of the before but who would think to do that given that I've never had this issue before. 

Should I call around for an independent plumbing company to give a second opinion?  If they do find something wrong, should I put it in writing to the office? I don't want to appear too aggressive since I have a very pleasant experience living here and don't want to get on management's bad side.

Now around here, for people who became pregnant earlier, neighbors also got together to throw a baby shower to the expectant mom on their own, where they would cook food as per the liking of the soon to be mom. 
 Now our close neighbor has asked us earlier if she wants a separate baby shower or combine with the baby shower her mom is throwing. The second option does not make sense as we have said earlier that my mother-in-law wants to host the entire event including the food. Now she is basically throwing the ball in my wife‚Äôs court and asking her if my wife wants to have the baby shower at our place or her place. She also mentioned that if she does not host the baby shower, she will host another festive party. Previously she asked us if we can book a venue for the baby shower she was planning to host. We feel she is not interested but still somehow wanting to show us/the world that she is interested. 
   We are polite in nature and are now in a spot on how to tackle this. We have lots of neighbors interested in a baby shower for her wife but since the above neighbor is the closest, everyone is assuming that she is taking care of it. We have mentioned to her that do not sacrifice the other party planning for her baby shower and the response we got was that then can she basically make the baby shower my mother in law is throwing to a potluck , which we do not want, basically she wants to interfere with our event and then claim that she threw the baby shower.  We have no problems if she does not throw a baby shower but we are totally frustrated on how to deal with this. Should we tell her that what she is saying ( host the baby shower she is hosting at our house) is weird and we feel that she is thinking of this as a burden and not doing anything out of joy. She sometimes gives her home cooked food to have showing that she cares, but this on the other hand.

So I work with a group of people that have fairly strong personalities, one could say a group of extroverts. Admittedly, I am more of an introvert and I do suffer from mild/medium social anxiety. This might sound silly but tonight when I was doing a patient handover over the phone this colleague starts to stick her phone in my face and starts recording me and everyone starts laughing. It defiantly felt like I was the butt of their joke and although I‚Äôm not certain I‚Äôm sure the video got sent to their group chat. Anyway, in reaction to her recording me I told her to ‚Äòfuck off‚Äô in a light voice which of course the nurse I was handing over to on the phone would of heard. I of course apologised to the nurse on the phone profusely and left the room as I couldn‚Äôt focus on my patient handover. 

Should I confront this colleague?

I was thinking about messaging her and asking what the reason was for recording me like that and also letting her know that the situation flared up my social anxiety.

Would this be wise?",10Sep2019,1
555,"I‚Äôve debated separating/divorcing my husband at different points for years now. I‚Äôm feeling so worn down and generally unhappy with life, but find when I‚Äôm apart from him (and our daughter who is becoming so much like him) I‚Äôm so much happier. 

I feed off the energy and personalities of those around me, and I‚Äôm finding his highly aggressive reactions to anything in life that upsets him may be at least in part the reason I‚Äôve changed so much from the person I used to be. I don‚Äôt even recognize myself emotionally anymore. I‚Äôm crying all the time, quick to temper, and hold this terrible emotional lump in my chest that aches all too often. There are a lot of things beyond our relationship, yes, but I‚Äôm feeling like this is the biggest trigger for depression and upset in my life. 

He clearly has an anger management issue. There has been more than one occasion where he has scared the crap out of my by being outwardly aggressive (physically and verbally) when I say, do, or look in a way that upsets him. For instance, last night I was brushing my teeth and he was chiding me on how my teeth are going to fall out because of the shock of flossing them (flossing is something I‚Äôm not great at keeping up on). I made a face when he said this, not a word, and his reaction was to blow up verbally, slam our bedroom door, and yell at me when I tried to talk to him about it. I should not need to apologize for having an expression of hurt and upset on my face when he pokes insults at me. ‚ÄúIt was a joke. You knew this is my sense of humour. We just think very differently about everything. We don‚Äôt work.‚Äù And on and on, blaming me for getting hurt at his slice at me. He would have kept on yelling at me had I not started whispering and telling him I refuse to have any more screaming in my house. Our daughter is having some very difficult issues responding to others with patience and kindness (she punched a kid in the face last week, and threw a big scene refusing to let the teacher talk to me about it when I picked up). Her behaviors are becoming harder and harder to manage and respond to myself without feeling completely done trying, and I see so much parallel in the way that he treats me and the way that she treats me and others. 

I‚Äôve had a really hard time managing mentally lately. I‚Äôve tried counselors (not covered by health care, so that was ridiculed and guilted for spending the money on it) doctors, naturopathic doctors, hoping I can fix myself. I had a breakdown on Saturday and Sunday and just wept and hurt all day. I told him how hard I am struggling (over text - I was out of town with our daughter) and that I‚Äôm not okay. When I got home, not only had not a single thing at home been taken care of on his free day at home (there were plenty of things in plain sight that needed to be taken care of), but no hug, no touch of any sort, no kind words, just the same as always. 

I‚Äôm feeling very unloved and unwanted. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I fantasize about running far far away and starting fresh with someone who will support me and make me a better person, instead of drag me down and leave me stuck in a family of aggression and unkindness. I know it‚Äôs ruining my daughter, too, but I don‚Äôt know if I have the mental strength to try to fix it. I feel so done. 

How do I get him to change his aggression? How do I get him to realize I‚Äôm dying inside and I need him to help. I want someone to show any sort of love to me. I feel so alone.",10Sep2019,1
556,"Guys I need some advice, I am an anxious wreck. 

So, I live with my boyfriend and his mother. We'll call them Ben and Mary. I was recently in Mary's brothers girlfriends house. We'll call her Emma. This is messy guys I really hope you can follow. Emma told me that Mary doesn't like Ben's cousins girlfriend. We'll call that couple Ross and Rachel okay. So Emma tells me that Mary dislikes Rachel. Which is crazy because a, she's only met her a handful of times, and b, she's fucking lovely. Then it dawns on me. About a year ago, Ross cheated on Rachel, Rachel found out and dumped Ross. Ross then told the entire family that Rachel was controlling and that he dumped her. That's why Mary doesn't like her, she thinks she's controlling. So I tell Emma what actually went down. The following week most of the family are together for a fundraiser quiz. Emma decides to tell Rachel this whole story. Rachel told Ross obviously and then Ross gave out to my Ben. Now the whole family is gossiping and bitching about it. There's a lot of hate directed at me for telling Emma, and a lot of hate directed at Emma for telling Rachel. But here's the thing, this fucking family is a bunch of gossiping two faced cunts. Sorry, this is fresh and I'm mad as hell. And they are. So me and Mary are home alone, and Mary's mum comes to visit. We'll call her nanny, as everyone in the family does. Well I politely make pots of tea and coffee and set out milk, sugar, mugs etc. I chat for a while then go to the bedroom I share with Mary's son. I have the door open, and it's a small bungalow so I can hear them talking away loudly in the sitting room. Then they start whispering. But not quiet enough and I can still hear them. They bitch about this whole above situation. Giving out shit that I told Emma and that Emma told Rachel, and that I basically got Ross mad at Ben because I told Emma. I'm sat here in the bedroom silently for the past 4 hours afraid to cough let alone go get food or go to the bathroom. I've been doing my best not to cry and not to panic but holy fuck am I upset and panicked. I'm literally distraught. I feel so little and picked on. I feel absolutely alone. It doesn't help that I lost my job recently and my partner works so I'm here either alone or with Mary day in day out. I just want to cry and be swallowed by the floor. I've been looking at moving out options but with no money it's just not viable. I'm just so upset that these two women who I consider family have bitched about me within earshot. Fucking hell at least do it when I'm not around!! 

We're due to go to a work BBQ in three days and because Ben and Ross work together the four of us will be there. Oh, and Emma's partner, Ben and ross' uncle works with them too so Emma and he will also be there. I'm fucking terrified and dreading it whereas yesterday I was so excited. 

I actually don't even know what my query is other than what the fuck am I going to do? I feel so lost and isolated at the moment anyway and now I feel ganged up on and hated. 

Mary's just come down to tell me I'm very quiet and I could have come down to join them in the sitting room. Oh go fuck yourself.

I'm a very horny dude and we're both in out late 20s only 4 years married. In 2019 we've only had sex 9 times... Yes, I counted. And that is driving me NUTS! Sex is pretty good (for me at least) when we have it and I have no reason to think she's not satisfied because she always orgasms before I do. But I don't know, maybe she's just good at faking it? I mean, I'm open to acknowledge that I suck at bed if that was the case.

I've tried everything, talk to her about how sex is an important part of a healthy marriage and whatnot. She says she's simply not in the mood for it and is tired everyday from taking care of the kids but she says she will try to work on it... so far, it hasn't changed. Last time we spoke she said that we could do it every saturday because I don't work on sundays and can help her out with the kids and she won't be too exhausted. We did it on ONE saturday and she caught a cold the next saturday, then her period showed up... for three weeks... So yeah, not much improvement.

It's just that I've been this way ever since. I only have a few memories from childhood and they're like very short, more like ""summarized"" memories. As for him, I don't really sure how to go with this, but he used to tell me that he and his brother are good at making stories up just for fun, tells these stories then telling them at the end that it's not true. They all laugh at the end. It's just good, clean fun.

There are stories that he'll tell me sometimes that I don't really remember happening and sometimes it hurts him. The recent one happened today. He tells me that we've watched this movie that he really liked and that I didn't like it and didn't pay attention. I remember an instance that we tried watching this movie.

He said we watched the movie again, this time it was at night. According to him, I wasn't really paying attention and sort of slept in the middle of it. He said he felt bad about it because before watching that movie, he watched with me a movie I really liked even though he's not really interested in it. But I honestly don't remember this happening.

Sometimes he tells me things that happened that I usually don't remember happening and it really upsets me. It might be that I'm just really forgetful or he's just making it all up. I don't know.

I have experience in sales and was a top performer before life got rockier than I knew how to handle and threw me through a spiraling depression cycle for a few years.

In comes a new person who joins and we all have fun with. Me and this person clicked. (They prefer remaining non-binary online so I'll stick with they/them out of respect.) And when I say clicked, I don't mean ""Oh I'm so in love"" I mean, almost instant sibling-like status between the two of us. I loved them so much, and I thought they felt the same. We called, texted, rp'd so much together that it was seriously just like having an online sibling. It was great.

And then, it wasn't so great. I'm not really sure what changed, but my depression with my living situation got worse and worse, and suddenly this great friendship/sibling love turns almost sour. I take a break from the forum for a little bit to try and get myself together, and I come back and it's like... Everyone hates me. I don't know what happened. It's possible it was my fault, I said/did something to upset everyone, but I don't know what it was. And my friendship was just sort of gone. At this point I was the admin of the forum and I couldn't handle the stress, and my ""friend"" messaged me after almost two months of silence and starts talking to me like nothing happened. Then asks to have the forum back despite having previously left awhile before this. I just turned the reigns over and gave up. I was so defeated, I didn't understand what had happened, and no one was cluing me in.

Now the problem. Ever since then, I haven't been able to write. It's not just a block, it's panic. I go to write anything in the realm of fantasy or rp or anything, and I panic, and my brain just goes blank. I don't know what to do. I'm going to therapy but it's not helping with this situation at all. I figured it was a long shot but... Does anyone have any advice? Tips or tricks? Anything?",10Sep2019,1

582,We dated. We‚Äôre suppose to get married. He had cheated ( been on tinder but never had sex with anyone else) and I forgave him and we tried to make it work but ultimately he dumped me for not trusting enough. Went through emotional hell. I moved away and became a better person emotionally and even moved on. We began a friendship again and all was well since we understood each other so well. He was happy I moved on and I was as well. I moved back and saw him again and it ended with us sleeping together again. We were both single and didn‚Äôt mean much to either of us. But now he‚Äôs seeing someone and wants to continue sleeping together because she‚Äôs not as good as me. He says he wants me in his life more then her but as a friend because I‚Äôm so caring and wants to continue having sex with me.  A part of me is just like if I‚Äôm better at sex and your best friend isn‚Äôt the clear choice me? She also has talked down about me so part of me does it out of spite. I still have love for him and the attraction to him is far greater then anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. I know I should leave him but he draws me in every time. Should I expose him?

583,"So me(24f) and my ex(24m) broke up 3 years ago cos I realised that as much as we loved each other we were dragging each other down. He now live in our home town and I live 2h away in the capital city. 
 
We started talking again about a month ago (maybe more) and two weeks ago we met for drinks and there was an instant connection as if we were never apart. We met up yesterday again, we walked and talk well past midnight, and he even sent me messages thinking for the night and that he had alot of fun. 

Now my problem is I know my feeling for him and I can feel his feels for me but he broke up with a girl 3 months cos she was (his words not mine) a manipulative, possessive and passive aggressive person but he still stays in contact with her. Basically considers her to be his best friend + someone to have sex with sometimes. 

Now I am not a fan of that situation but I do trust him. I don't know if I should make my ""move"" cos technically they are not together but I can't deny that I have a bad  feeling that shit will go down if I do.",10Sep2019,1

I haven‚Äôt talked to this friend in over a year. Last night she commented some concerning stuff on a post I made on FB, so I messaged her to see if she was okay.

She is not okay. She told me she has been suffering from undiagnosed syphilis for years. She told me she thought that it was gonorrhea. She told me she suffered a concussion 8 months ago that was never treated. She told me her family conspired to move her to another state and trap her there. She told me she can‚Äôt hear herself think. She told me that there used to be voices inside her head, but now they‚Äôre all on the outside. She told me it‚Äôs a conspiracy from the halfway house. She told me she went blind in one eye while on the phone with me.

The conversation was hard to follow at times for me. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the untreated syphilis, the untreated concussion, or her years of meth use that‚Äôs causing this. I‚Äôm just not sure what I can do to help. Obviously she‚Äôs extremely paranoid. It doesn‚Äôt sound like she has a support system.

609,"So a brief history; 

 I am 27 , found a job after leaving school at 22 and have kept the job since . I started out as a control panel wiring technician for 1 year , and was promoted to testing control panels for 2 years , and then promoted to assistant super visor for the latest 2 years. My salaries went from 13k to 18k to 21k respectively (euros)

&amp;#x200B;

The person that took my place in testing  was not as technical as I am , and was paid less than me , 16k.  Since he was a family man he needed more money , and he asked for 2k more. This request was declined. He was considered dispensable  because unfortunately for him , in that period , a new technician , who was rather technical , joined the team , and the boss decided that he was suitable to replace him. This technician also started with 16k.  And now has the position in testing.

5 months have passed , this new worker (still in probation period) is now testing and learning. He is from an eastern European country and not in the EU. It is difficult for such person to obtain permits in my country . A particular law states that for every child the immigrant has , he must have a couple of thousands income to maintain them. What happened now is that this guys wife is pregnant , with twins.  So obviously what happened next was to ask for more money. particularly my salary , 21k.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this guy is in probation period and can legally leave the job on the spot , therefore without any notice , he put my boss and HR in a corner , and since he told them he is ready with another job , they accepted within the day.

Something they told him was to keep his mouth shut , but in a way or another this news, complete with numbers arrived to my ears.  I had to wait for a week , since the HR was on holiday . During this week I spoke to a lot of friends , family , co workers , my supervisor  , and they ALL were on my side and said that this situation was ridiculous. They told me to get what is mine or leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like to threaten, but in the meeting I had with the director of the company and the HR i made it clear that i was offended and ready to leave. what i worked for in 5 years was surpassed by someone still in probation and who i was teaching.  He might be technical in electronics and in programming , but I have 5 years more experience in our product and systems than him. And I am his go-to person when he is stuck in the process. Basically i am the one who knows his job by heart and his problem solver.

I have reached no results with this meeting what so ever, apart for being angry at them , because they are the only 2 people i have found who basically are  against me.  They said that they want to focus on how much profit they are making before giving raises. Even though they gave him what he asked for within the day.

Apart from being this, I program the systems , take care of a team of 7 people , I am the supervisor's reliever, answer calls from the maintenance department when they have technical issues and train the new employees , whatever their position is. 

I do other stuff  which i am not required to, such as accepting to train Italian workers who don't speak English because i am fluent in that language. I offer assistance to workers from different departments who i am not required to help. I use my personal phone regularly for work related discussions on chats and phone calls without ever asking for refunding. And other miscellaneous thingS.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically , for those people who TL;DR , I am offended that a new worker who is still in probation  , who I am teaching , has equaled me in salary , after 5 years experience and knowing his job inside out

&amp;#x200B;

I think the time for me to resign has come.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If  the HR ever asks me what I want to stay , I will ask for :

\- 28k minimum

\- New contract

\- New position title.

610,"I bought a ring from pompeii3 online through walmart and the ring I ordered wasnt even close to the one I got (wrong size, wrong design).

The more I look into this the more scamy it seems. I left negative reviews on both the walmart online I purchased through as well as the pompeii site itself and they appeared for a second and then were removed.


I am not going to have a ring in time unless I get it in person. And I mostly wanted to find out if this is really a scam or just poor communication between the walmart site and pompeii3's site.

For which my comment would be ""Ofcourse I know that it would benefit me immensly but going to learn something with a 'nothing to loose attitude' makes me learn things faster. Afterall we both want that I should learn this skill. It's just how my mind works, so I'm hacking it"".

These conversations happened quite often about different things and in different scenerios. But after a while she broke up with me. And she told me that the major reason is that I'm negative, while the new guy is quite positive and lively.

613,"Hi Reddit, first time posting on this sub so forgive me for any formatting mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been good friends with a group of 6 people, all of whom I love to death, for about 3-4 years now. However, over the years I've seen my own personal demons pop up more and more whenever we're interacting. You see, I've always had a bit of a problem with maintaining relationships in a healthy manner (I'm pretty severely autistic) and when I get overwhelmed by whatever relationship, be it platonic or romantic, I tend to freak out and leave. 

Lately, I've been panicking more and more about little subtle changes in my friends' behavior towards me: they come off as a bit short, or they straight up ignore me. I'm mentally ill and I know how taxing this is on them, so a few weeks back I decided to cut ties in order to put a bit of relief on them. They didn't take this well, even got angry with me for worrying them, so I reluctantly joined the group again. Now I'm in the exact same situation as a few weeks ago: I want to leave, honestly I'd much rather just ghost them at this point because I don't want to be a bother anymore, but I'm afraid they won't take that well once again. 

They're the only people that I have, yet I'm pushing them away and I desperately want to isolate myself. I've talked with them about this to the point they're sick of it. What do I do?",10Sep2019,1

615,"I‚Äôve been with my partner for almost 4 years. I love him, deep down I know I love him... but I‚Äôve been having doubts. He does have mental illness that I don‚Äôt feel he does anything about. We get into petty arguments over what I chose to make for dinner, if a certain pair of pants weren‚Äôt washed or how much time I spend on my phone/social media. He also puts me down about things rather than building me up; example, I made a comment about cleaning up my office to get back into my crafts and he said he didn‚Äôt know why I would do that if I‚Äôm going to make one craft and then give up again. When I make comments about getting healthy again, he doubts my commitment. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that, like many people, my weight and health has been a constant struggle but I‚Äôve always supported him in his many many ventures; even the ones I knew wouldn‚Äôt pan out like opening an online store or starting his own business with no money or any number of half baked plans. When things are good, they are good and we enjoy spending time together and going to different sporting events or events around town. But I still feel doubt about our relationship and I don‚Äôt always feel valued. When I think about making the leap and leaving I get scared, I feel anxious, and I don‚Äôt even know what I would say as to why because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not happy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt feel like enough and I know he would ask what am I unhappy about and I would have a hard time expressing it... I sometimes even doubt my own unhappiness and think it‚Äôs just my depression or anxiety getting the best of me. I also consider the time we have spent and how close I‚Äôve become to his family. I know it would break his parents hearts, his siblings hearts and his young nieces. I know none of them have anything to do with our relationship but it‚Äôs still hard and a lot to consider.

616,"TLDR: My family is offering a home rent free if my bf and I become the live-in property managers and rent the place on Airbnb. Any thoughts?

Long story short, my family owns a currently empty home and they want me and my boyfriend to move in. They want to fix up the house and rent rooms via Airbnb and VRBO. They want a family member to live on the property to maintain it. They have offered it up rent free as long as we manage the renters, clean up the home, do maintenance as needed, take care of yardwork, and pay utilities.  

If we do this, we're immediately saving $1200 a month in rent. My commute to work would shorten by 10 minutes, and when there are no renters we would have a 2k square foot house all to ourselves. We'd have a yard, a garage, a private bathroom and living room. It seems like a no brainer but I have some concerns and my bf is immediately veto-ing it. 

First and foremost he doesn't want to share space with strangers, which is understandable. We don't know who these renters really are and he's concerned about the security of what would be our home if people are in and out. He also doesn't want to share kitchen space and laundry space with renters. We would also have to leave the quiet neighborhood we love to move a town over to a very busy street. The utilities would definitely be higher as the house is old and huge compared to our apartment. Neither of us are handy so I'm concerned about us performing ""maintenance"" on this home. It would lengthen his commute from &lt;5 minutes to 20. 

All this considered, I'm still more inclined to say yes but he is not. I'm really looking for some outside advice to get a fresh perspective so anything constructive is welcome!",10Sep2019,1

I'm a 35 year old shy loser. Here's the thing. At work they were hiring people to fill 3 positions. All of those positions have been filled with women. But the thing is, all those women are my type. They're tall, slim and long hair anyway. I am super shy around women that are my type. They tried to communicate with me. They smiled at me they asked how my morning was going etc etc. But me like an asshole ignored them. Again, I'm shy and I have a fear of talking to women. I didn't do it on purpose. Fear took over me. I also have low self esteem issues. One of the ladies got in the elevator with me one day and she was just cold. I can't blame her since I'm the one at fault.

624,"Throw away for obvious reasons. I could really use some help.

So this past year has been extremely rough for me. Little over a month before New Years I broke up with my 2 year long girlfriend who I was still in love with. We took distance but were still very close friends.  During new years our mutual friends were there but she wasn't. During the party, it got to a point where this one Girl (lets call her Nat) was telling me a bunch of things about my EX. how she was hooking up with random people I knew and ‚ÄúSluting around.‚Äù this was a little past midnite and went on for a while. At this point we stopped drinking but we were all still a bit drunk. 3 of us were up still, Nat, my best friend dan, and me. It got to a point where I felt overwhelmed and cried in another room. Now I know what Nat was saying was a lie but at the time I fully believed her. I also checked with dan not long after what Nat was saying. After this we went to sleep on my friends floor around 3. In the room there were 5 of us in the room, Nat, Dan, a girl named fin, and I on the floor. And two on the coach. I woke up a little past 9, i know this because dan already walked home. I was lonely and cuddly so I moved over to cuddle fin. We have cuddled and have done sexually stuff before so i thought it would be ok. She kinda moved so I backed off and layed on my own again. Maybe a min later I decided to try to cuddle Nat, who i have also cuddled and done sexual things with in the past. I big spooned her and kinda started to doze off again. Then nat took my hand and put it into her bra. So I started to play with her and then whispered in her year if this was ok she said yes. She kinda half turns and we made out and I moved my hand down her body into her pants. I asked again if this was ok she said ‚Äúmmmmhhhm‚Äù in like a quiet moan as she shook her head yes. So this continued and she played with me a little until the gu on the coach moved in his sleep so we quickly backed off.  I texted her shortly after ‚Äúis it ok if we still just cuddle?‚Äù Nat said ‚ÄúNah people would find it weird.‚Äù I said ‚Äúkk gn.‚Äù and went back to sleep. In the morning there was nothing weird. 

Fast forward to March after a spring break, stuff happened with me and my ex that continued to make my lifelong depression worst. I started to cut for the first time in years and was very unhealthy.  It got to a point where my college friends asked my friends from home to come up and talk to me. When my friends came up they told me how Nat and one other college friend wanted to like ambush intervention me and like ‚Äúhold me down so I don't run.‚Äù wich my home friends said was so dumb and talked to me on their own. Their were 5 of them and we  pieced together a lot of problems in my social life rn could lead to Nat miscommunicating and straight out lying to different people about countless rumors and such. She was acting like it was a highschool.  I got a lot better and they went off to talk to Nat and my college friends before driving me to a store. When they talked to Nat my one blunt friend ben straight out told kristana she has to stop lying about a bunch of shit (I don't remember the exact words for this but something along these lines) and that it really hurts my mental state to have rumors and false facts be told to me. 
When I walked back to my dorm I talked to my one roommate who was out of the loop greg about Nat and the situation. He started to tell me something about my ex(who i just invited over) about seeing this one guy.(the ex thing is a very long story) I got kinda pissed and told my ex to go for a walk with me instead since I didn't want anyone to ezdrop. On the walk i got a little suicidle so my ex called my roommate to come and get us. I told her ill jus sit and talk to her so she told my roommate nevermind. That night there was this Frat party on campus everyone went to, including Nat. they were all drinking and together. My roommate Greg went on to tell nat everything i told him. Then apparintly thats when she accused me of sexual assault on New years.
I didn't learn this till the next day. My friend sid texted me accusing me. I was taken to the hospital for hurting myself by the school. The next week I am told that she told the school. I am aloud to go to class but got a commute until I can prove I am not a harm to myself that friday by seeing the school  psychologist.  That Thursday I am told that her old roommate sara who I hooked up with all the way back in september accused me of sexual assault. So until it is figured out i am not aloud to attend class. The psychologist recommended an IOP program to go to for the depression anxiety and self harm. I attend this for two months starting at 5 hours a day for five days until lowering to 3 hours and then graduating. Threw this i told my side to the school.  The school finally gets back to me in August that they did not find the charges factual.

During the summer I lost a lot of friends. It was extremely difficult to have people not believe me. The thing is tho I understand. Before this i was the person to say ‚Äúalways believe the victim.‚Äù I also made sure that what Nat was saying was untrue. I went threw the facts and learned that the entire time she stayed still and pretended she was asleep. I know 100% that is a lie so I stopped doubting myself.

I thought it was all over in my past until last week my towns police called me asking for me to come in for questioning due to a new years instadent. I was in awe. Stumbled a little on words and asked how could i help. He asked if I could come down to the station in my hometown some time soon. And said if it was a rush he would have picked me up. I said id need to take the train home and he said hell call me next Tuesday (today) to figure out when im available. He didn't say much on the phone but did mention That he talked to a few people and wants to figure out the truth that ‚Äúit lies in between my story and Her (Nat) story.‚Äù he also mentioned that I have an alcohol problem (which I don't). 

This is where im at, I don't know what to do. I want to be corapative as possible but i read online that being open could just put you in a hole. That it's more complicated than saying everything on your side. Im lowkey freaking out. Ik his could ruin my life and make it hell. I just want this to end. Idk if i can even afford a lawyer.

629,"Hi,

The answer is probably obvious but would appreciate advice.

I live in a major metropolitan city and I'm living in someone's house with another tenant. I'm male and she's female. The owner sleeps upstairs and we sleep downstairs. There are three rooms, all next to each other, with thin walls. Until recently the middle room that divided us was empty.

The owner recently brought in another male tenant. Yesterday, around 1 AM, he began acting belligerently in the common area outside of the bedrooms and started shouting about the people he would kill and people that had wronged him in the past. I immediately contacted the ""proxy"" landlord and sent recordings of what was happening. The drunk roommate did not sleep but went in and out of his room, slamming the door and screaming the entire while. This continued until dawn broke. I went into the common area and heard the roommate listening to oldies on the radio from his room. The female tenant heard me leaving my room and came out and told me that the other guy had tried to force himself into her room during the night. I told her to contact the ""proxy"" landlord and note that specifically occurred, then I made sure we left together so she wouldn't be left alone in the house.

Currently we're in limbo but I'm not quite sure what to do in this situation. I'm in my early 30s and the other male tenant is in his 40s but I'm unsure if I should directly confront him when I return home tonight or leave it to the landlord to handle, though I'm also unsure what we should do if it isn't handled by the landlord or owner. Any advice? Thank you.",10Sep2019,1

Anyways, inspite of being from different teams, we always lunch together and hang out together. I used to like B but never told her because she already had a boyfriend. The thing is B and me fight a lot.  Most of it are trivial things but miscommunication and misunderstandings are the main cause. We end up quarreling and stop talking for some time. In the end things generally return to normal. However, this last week I was on leave. When I rejoined on Monday, both B and C wouldn't talk to me. We had lunch together but I felt left out ad the three of them went about their conversation as if I wasn't there. Next day B confronted me and put the whole blame on me for acting weirdly. Apparently B was angry because I didn't respond to a text some days back while I was on leave. C also took the opportunity to avoid me.

I am totally sick of this behavior from B. These meaningless friction is taking a toll on me. Its worse because C always takes her side and they always end up convincing A as well that it's my fault for fighting with B. What should I do?

632,"So first of all, yes that title seems stupid, but it's really gotten to a point where I think I'm stupid or something, since I can't hide anything I do, even if I try so hard, I always have a hard time lying if someone confronts me. I am a 15 yr old boy from Germany and I've had an interesting story with hiding stuff, especially from my parents. I used to be able to hide almost everything without anyone noticing. I was like a master of lies, which wasn't/isn't a good thing, but it kinda worked. I had a few problems with mental health and got into a clinic to ""cure"" my depression. It was about 4 months of treatment. Before that, as I said, I was really good at hiding stuff and did lots of things I knew my parents wouldn't allow me. But after this treatment, I got so bad at doing all of that. I can't lie anymore and always have to be honest, even if I don't want to. So lately my mother found out I was smoking, because I showed her my lovely new Zippo. It was stupid of me, but she asked what I ordered and I wasn't able to lie. Obviously she got really angry and before you say anything, yes I know it's bad and I shouldn't do it, but well... You do stupid stuff as a Teenager... I could've just said ""I bought it because it looks nice"" or ""I like the tricks you can do with it"" and she probably would've left me alone. But as she asked, if I bought for smoking I couldn't lie. And it didn't even slip out, I just said that fully aware. How can I change this? This was just one example... But I do this a lot.

636,"Hello!

This may be a long winded post but there is a lot of information to get through.

So let me begin by describing my location I live in Quebec where after high school you must take part in a two year program called CEGEP. This is an intermediate stage between high school and university. I‚Äôm currently studying a communications/cinema program given my interest in previous experience in the field.

Also given my specific situation I receive a sum of $675 from a local organization who essentially pays me to go to school. This check is meant to pay for books supplies etc. On top of that I also work a part-time job in which I paid $17 an hour for a maximum of 15 hours a week.

My problem is that I suffer from anxiety and depression and my school/work responsibilities often bleed into my normal life and cause incredible amounts of stress. I am also going through a bit of an existential crisis realizing that my cinema degree may not be as valuable as I had originally thought it to be. So I‚Äôm thinking that my next move would be to drop out and find professional experience so that I can get a jumpstart on my career.

I‚Äôm currently feeling lost in aimless in my current position. I don‚Äôt feel that my work is valued or useful and that I‚Äôm rather just getting paid because I‚Äôm a student. I‚Äôm at an age now where I need to start thinking seriously about my options and I don‚Äôt think that college is going to push my career any further than it already is.

The thing is I know college is supposed to be this massive opportunity and a necessary step to join the workforce. But I simply don‚Äôt have the energy or passion to continue going to school. I moved out when I was 17 and I‚Äôm currently living in my apartment. I already skipped the majority of my classes and I don‚Äôt see myself going to any of them in the near future. So to avoid disappointing myself, my family and my community, I want to stop wasting time.

I‚Äôve already begun to apply to jobs that appeal more to my passions and can help me move forward with my specific career path. But of course my friends have already begun to convince me that I need to stay in school and finish my degree. I‚Äôm simply thinking that a cinema degree isn‚Äôt as valuable as any other and I‚Äôm basically wasting valuable years of my life. To be honest I live a very unhealthy lifestyle and I don‚Äôt see myself getting very far. That‚Äôs a very sad position to take as an 18-year-old man but it‚Äôs the reality of the situation. So I just want to make the most of life before it‚Äôs too late.

So I would appreciate any and all advice you can provide me. I know beggars can‚Äôt be choosers but I would really appreciate if you could skip the ‚Äú College is the most important period of your life‚Äù spiel. I‚Äôve heard it 1000 times :/

638,"I don‚Äôt even know if this is the place to post I just need help or to be pointed in the right direction.

Throwaway for very obvious reasons. A few years ago, someone hunted me down like a dog and stalked me for 6 months. 

Law Enforcement really dropped the ball. I had never felt more alone in my life than I did during that time.

They ignored me begging, never followed up etc and despite having pages of text, social media and phone call harassment, threats, attempting to get restraining orders, moving to another place, filing multiple police reports and dozens of calls and trips to the police station, he didn‚Äôt stop. 

The months of torture, threats to rape and kill me the harassment came to an end when he kicked my door in and I shot him in self defense.
He would play games like stop eating to drag out his court date and a year after the shooting he was finally sentenced, and given some credit for time served. 
He completed 4 years of the sentence, played nice and they paroled him. 

He contacted me yesterday. I actually don‚Äôt think this is the first time, I had started receiving blocked phone calls at 2 am a few days after his release from jail but had no way to prove it was him, I was afraid to reach out because of I did, it would confirm for him that he had found me. Well, he found me.

I tried calling the parole office and they said they released him from supervision less than a week ago. He was in jail for 4 years and waited less than a week before finding me despite having no social media.

They then gave me some BS about the only thing they can do is send me some pictures to give to my local law enforcement and pass around at work if I feel in danger.

I am freaking out because this feels like the same lack of help I received the first time. 

If this man kills me because this isn‚Äôt being taken seriously I pray that this doesn‚Äôt get buried.

I'm a 30 yo guy with a 9-5 job. How do I plan my time so I can achieve the several aims I have had for a while now? I probably have my expectations all wrong and I'd appreciate any advice I can get from y'all.


1. Learn Spanish. I have been using online apps and have now reached a stage where I can read simple children's stories and work out what is going on. 


2. Get fit. I'm just 10 pounds over my ideal weight, but its all collected on my belly. I do weighted squats (40 pounds not counting the barbell) now and again but nothing more. I've been on IF for nearly a year or so and have hit a plateau


3. Write a book: I've begun and have 2-3 chapters down but I haven't really worked out the ending yet. I dont mind this being a short length novel. The objective is to get it out on Amazon.


4. Learn to code. I've begun learning python online and I've got a good grip on things. I've been able to write the snake game by myself. I want to learn django/flask next



My focus is to finish stuff. I've been sitting on these ideas for a long time and not been able to focus on any one much. Should I just do one at a time? Or do a few at a time? I usually have a few nights a week that I can devote to my stuff and right now they're just wasted watching youtube videos or browsing reddit. 


How do I plan this out?",10Sep2019,1
641,"Hey Reddit how's it going?

Did you guys have a problem in school where you can't remember things you learned? Like I can't remember anything from highschool or elementary in terms of geography. I can't even seem to remember stuff I did in a previous semester and the thing is....

I need to.

I study and study and it's not even in a cramming sort of way, and then I literally cannot tell you what I learned about matrices in linear algebra that just ended last month. It's as if the material I learned just disappears from my brain. It makes me so frustrated and upset because I'm starting to believe I might have brain damage or be mentally retarded. I'm a computer science student in my junior year and yeah I'm a junior but I can never, never remember a thing that I learned in any class in any semester. It's not like I don't take notes and it's not like I don't go to class I am present and doing the work. But I'll explain another thing that's even worse than not remembering stuff from a previous semester. I can't even read a definition and tell you what I just read. Someone could explain something to me, but then I would have no idea wth they just said. 

If you explained something to me for two hours I still wouldn't flippin get it. My boyfriend claims there aren't different ways to learn and that the whole concept is bullshit.

I don't believe him and I think he's wrong. At the same time, my comprehension skills have always been extremely, and I mean extremely, dead low. On the SAT it was honestly laughable what I got in that section of the exam.

It seems I read stuff and interpret it in an incorrect way but how is that possible when I just read the damned definition or the story? Do people have a hard time reading and understanding stuff? Do any of you have advice on how to conquer this issue? It seems I can remember how to play every song I've ever learned on the piano even if I haven't played in years, and every detail that happened in animes I've watched, and all the champions in league of legends and how to build them, but I can't remember anything IMPORTANT. Is it because I don't care for it or I dislike it? But even if that is the case, I still should be able to retain SOMETHING. Is there a way to actually LEARN? I feel like if you forget what you've learned you never really learned it but I'm not sure how true that is. I feel like an idiot. I feel so dumb in comparison to everyone around me. I don't know how to proceed with this issue if there really is no different way of learning. I feel useless and like no one will ever hire me because u can't regurgitate definitions or facts. In computer science they expect you to know a whole lot of things but I can't even remember what an abstract function is. Any advice....",10Sep2019,1

Now looking into the future, I realized I don't have anything special for my cv at all. The only upside is that I'm from my uni, but I'm not even a good student, really just did enough to make it this far.
I feel like I wasted a big part of my life chasing the wrong thing, doing the wrong thing. I either gave my time to her, or did something that wasn't going to help my future.
My ex currently has a summa standing in the top university of the country. She's beautiful and kind(alot of guys hit on her) , I fucked up, and I'm losing my biggest treasure. I feel small and don't know what to do about it.

I recently found out that my closest friend (M17) throughout my high school journey is planning to switch classes (we originally had the same schedule, he's planning to drop AP classes and now he's being dismissed a period later than mine after he decides to take a extra class). I'm worried on top of my mind that we're gonna lose our bond and we'll no longer be as close as before. I heard that ""friends come and go""especially during the end of HS but I really don't want him to go...I can't imagine it...

There's also the fact that I won't see any more of these faces anymore next year. My school is a fairly small school (it's only half of the school's floor!). Everyone knows and supports each other and it's practically a community here. The thought of not being there next year with the teachers i know and the students I'm familiar with  scares me.

Then there college- does it mark the end of my teenager years?? I have to get a job to sustain myself, I have to make sure I study extra hard for my classes, and I let go of a place that I grew up in.

There's so many decisions and changes happening so far and I'm worried I'll be left behind all alone, I still remember my first day of freshman year and the fact that I'm here now is mind boggling! I feel so pressured into making this year the 'best year of my life's but it's so early  this year to feel this way, but I'm still stressed out.... 

How can ease all of this? I feel so lost right now

My math teacher allows us to skip ahead but ive already finished all the available work and checked it getting it all right. English was always my best subject but I dont enjoy going to the class for it. With online school for those 2 subjects I feel like I can work better but I am still making my decision.

657,"I'm currently 23 and I haven't been to university yet, but that's my next life goal. I was sick for years so I didn't have a chance. 

I need to do my pre university exams which will take 2 years and then uni will be 3-4 years. 

I'll be 30 years old when all this is complete. 

The issue is that I feel really lonely at the moment. I don't mean having friends and so on, but I'm really craving intimacy, affection, love etc. 

I've never dated before, never had sex, never kissed a girl, never held hands. 

I've been told I'm a good looking guy by other women and I get clear signs of interest such as women constantly staring at me, grabbing my forearm, stroking their hair whilst looking at me right in the eyes and so on. 

I was just at the library today and this woman wouldn't stop staring at me. When I looked up from my notes I noticed her staring at me right in my eyes and smiling. She wouldn't stop so I just looked down at my notes again. 

What's depressing about all this attention is that due to my goal of going to university and trying to get the highest grades possible. It's going to take a lot of work which I'm not shy of, but it leaves no room to do others things. I'm also really into playing sports and going to the gym. That's not something I'm going to compromise over dating. I need my fitness. 

I spoke about this on Reddit months ago and I was told to not date and focus on my academics which is good advice. 

My academics are priority number 1. Nothing will replace that and second to that is my fitness. 

I just don't have the time to date and even if I did the emotional toll of breaking up and so on is not something I've experienced before. I don't know what affect it's going to have on me, but I imagine it's going to affect my academics. 

This will all take 7 years to get my academics complete and it may not even stop there because I could have a very demanding job that leaves no time to do anything. 

Being at least 30 years old or more with no history of a love life whatsoever. It's going to be an interesting future.

I usually hangout in this one area with a bunch of friends as a collective group and just play games. Last semester, this one guy, let‚Äôs call him Harry (20M fake name). Him and I were really close and shared a lot of things together. At the college we always hung out, and it felt special. 
People would tease us and said Harry liked me (in a crush way) but he hasn‚Äôt said anything about that until now. Yesterday he said he had the choice to move and had been debating it for about a week. We talked out the pros and cons, and he said the only reason why he would stay is because of me... Harry wanted to go out with me. 
I decided to tell him the truth, saying that 1. I‚Äôm in no place to be dating (trying to balance life and make peace with past events) and 2. That I value our friendship and wouldn‚Äôt want to risk it. A day passes and everything is normal until he starts hanging out with a new girl (18F) in our circle and seems to completely ignore me and treat her kinda how he treated me. I don‚Äôt know how to feel.
My question is, how do I deal with this? I understand that he got rejected by me, and it may be silly to see that things would just go back to the way they were. However things did for a little until the other girl showed up. Am I being replaced? Should I try and reach out to him?

677,"In College, 3rd week. I've made a ton of friends. In my hometown, I was used to being super close to all of my friends that were girls. I loved being able to be accepted as, ""I ain't trying to fuck with you, I legit just want to be your friend."" I'm Bi-Ace (Which for those of you who don't know, it means that I like guys and girls, and am not seeking a sexual relationship. I happen to like guys more, and this always made me more comfortable around girls.) 

Some of the friends, at least two of them, I feel would be cool with having me around as a ""gay best friend"". By that, I mean someone who literally wants to hang out as friends and not as a guy trying to get with a girl. I just don't know how to approach that topic of ""Hey, I want to spend time with you, but like outside of normal group-friend time, but not as a dating thing. I don't like you, well I do, but as a friend. I'm bi, but I like guys more than girls, and while I still find girls, I don't want to be dating you, and it's not that you're not attractive, you are, but.."" \*ranting continues for 3 essay-lengths.\*

The level of closeness I was able to reach with my home friends took three years before I got there but that was because I only came out to them after three years. We would have been a lot closer before then.

I offer to help or go with the girls in the friend group whenever they ask for someone, and they usually are cool with it. I just would like them to know that I would love to be -friends- who are comfortable around each other. Treating me like a ""gay best friend"" in short.

This resulted in me and others who supported me within the society, filing a complaint to the university about the individuals responsible.

These proceedings were started in January and have only now concluded. Both cases were not taken to trial due to conflicting evidence. And no parties were found guilty. Now I'm faced with a situation where I found no justice and my name has been smeared throughout the society. 

The evidence I used to clear my name to the university and be found innocent includes screenshots of messages between me and the accusing girl. The night which the accusation took place, things did happen, but nothing non-consentual. 

Examples of the evidence include:
1. screenshots of her telling me how she discussed the situation with her mother and her mother said that I shouldn't ""feel awkward or worried"" about what happened.
2. screenshots of her making jokes about the night the alleged SA occurred
3.screenshots of a conversation during the breakdown of our friendship ( that occurred 3 months later) in which she stated that us not being friends had nothing to do with that night. 

I've discussed this situation with my sister, mother, father, female best friend and girlfriend. And they all think I should just leave it now, as it's been so long and people won't be thinking about it anymore.

692,"Looking for some unbiased advice.

I've been working at a startup for 2 years, for a very wealthy MARRIED individual who's given me a really awesome opportunity. Love the job, the work potential, no qualms from a work standpoint.

Long story short, he's a well-known man at a few local establishments at which a number of my friends work/serve at. Over the past year, I've heard from people I know as well as seen screenshots of some very inappropriate messaging and behaviour from my boss to girls that I know (creepy comments about their appearance, even indirectly proposing sexual advances, etc). As I said before, he's married so it's not only creepy but its inappropriate and unfaithful to his wife, and it bothers me to be associated with him when I hear about it. 

He's only become wealthy in the last 5-7 years (and only been married for 5 years) and I think the amount of money he's accumulated so quickly has kind of changed him.

To complicate matters, I've invested a large sum of money with him, which is coming up for renewal/assessment in about a month. To liquidate my investment would also essentially terminate my employment with him as well (essentially I've partnered with him in a joint venture to which I am getting paid a salary also).

 What I would like to do is have a discussion with him about this in a way that encourages him to cut out his inappropriate behavior. Truthfully, I'm worried that if I do that, it may cost me my job as well as put my investment at risk also.

I guess I'm wondering if the Reddit community can help me determine whether I should:

A) Liquidate my investment, quit my job and disassociate completely

B) Have a conversation stating my concerns in hopes that his behaviour will change and that I can continue on worry-free in my work and my investment

C) Another option I haven't considered?

I greatly appreciate the advice in advance!",10Sep2019,2

694,"I will start by pointing out that I have a great deal of experience in my role, and have been in my particular industry for over 12 years. I have also ran my own business in the sector on two separate occasions, and I was hired FOR my experience and my abilities.

My boss is really cool, she really encourages me to be independent and autonomous, and I have no real issue with the way she manages ME, but the way she manages others is starting to become a problem for me in my day to day.

We have project managers, and these happen to all be newly graduated young adults from university, my place of work is all about giving young people an opportunity and throwing them in at the deep end, so to speak. I think this is great, really forward thinking and empowering for the younger, less experienced members of the team, however I have a real problem with the two that I work with on a day to day basis.

They both seem to have little to no idea of my level of experience. I have told them time and time again that they don't need to over emphasise the basics to me, but they just won't show me any trust. I get the feeling they confuse their project management roles, with managing me, and it has turned into really irritating and counter productive micro management.

Neither of them understand what I do for a living, nor have they ever done it, yet they find it upon themselves to set me 'fake briefs' for the sake of it when we have rare moments of down time, and they are really incredibly condescending tasks, and they don't take resistance to them well. One particular confrontation, I asked her ""What is the point in me doing this, what can possibly be achieved?"" and she responded ""It will demonstrate to me, your ability to follow a brief"". I was infuriated, and embarrassed. She is 15 years my junior, and left university just last year. Why would she think I need to prove myself to HER?...and how could she possibly know how to judge my performance?

How do I approach this? I don't want to come across as an egotistical idiot who has an issue with authority, because I don't, but it is completely outside of their remit to even try and assert authority, and it is becoming tiresome. Their project management could do with some improvements (I have done this myself in previous roles) but they seem overly confident when in reality it is THEM that are learning.

697,"I've been wanting to change my name for a few years now, My moms side of the family is the family I feel i'm truly apart of, and I'm no doubt going to adopt my mothers maiden name, North. My fathers side of the family I have a few quarrels with, enough to not want to be heavily apart of their family, such as some racism pasts and not particularly feeling any connection with them except my grandmother who's the sweetest thing. I mostly want to change my name against my father himself, who has basically checked out of raising me. Not in the went to get a pack of smokes and never came back way, but in the drinking his way through all of my life way. He has drunk himself into worsening his diabetes, inducing four chronic illnesses upon himself, and loosing his limbs. I have actually repressed a lot of what he's said / did over the years, and its coming back to me now. I had all but forgotten how he spent 5 years never coming into the house, living in our detached garage drinking and allowing literal bugs to infest his legs, which is how he lost one of them. My mom raised me, and while we had our hard parts, she's been the main parental figure and closer in my life, i'll always love her more than any mate along the way.

Here's my name change. It was always going to be Jennifer North, 2 years ago I decided a new middle name as well, because it means literally nothing to me and I haven't actually gone through the court papers and all to change any of my names yet, and it doesn't cost me more to change more than one name. My new middle name I wanted Aoife, because its an Irish warrior, and my previous surname was also Irish (in its original context, its been warped by american names). But another memory of my dad came to mind, him talking about one of his exs. Jennifer. He's the one who choose my names, and the more i dig into the times i 'visited' him in the garage drunk off his ass the more i remember him reminising times with his ex Jennifer. Its not the only time he's done this, he keeps in contact with another one of his exes in secret from her husband. But it keeps making me think, am i named from a man I hate's ex from over 20 years ago?

I've always been known as Jennifer, actually more Jenni. I was thinking maybe I should rename myself Jenni Aoife North instead, but that same ex of his keeps coming across my mind. I know i'm seeming dramatic, but for the sake of length in this post, I don't want to go into all the reasons I dislike my father. I'm already deadset on changing my surname and middle name, i've been referring to myself as Jenni-Aoife North to most I know, be it the north side of my family, recent partners, new friendships, etc. I'm also worried if I change my first name I will come across as weird to my north side of the family, one of my cousins actually changed her name when she chose to become a girl and its caused a lot of confusion for reasons unknown to me. Me and my cousin are the only LGBT people in our family and I'm worried of us being seen as dramatic queers and such.

705,"Backstory, I (female) have 2 friends. For the sake of the story let's call them Mary (female) and Heath (male).
Anyway, I moved back into my hometown a year or so ago, and have since been spending a lot of time with these two friends. Heath I have known since we were 7. Mary since we were 14, they met in highschool and we were all part of the same social circle. Infinitely close with both of them. 2 of my favorite people honestly.
Anyway, I told Mary that Heath and I were gonna get an apartment together as roommates (nothing else) and Mary starts going off saying that he raped her and all this nasty stuff about Heath.
I asked Heath for his side of it and he started crying and never thought she would have thought about what happened like that. 
Well, as it turns out, Heath and Mary hung out about 2 years ago, Heath brought alcohol, they both got drunk, and Mary lead Heath to her bed and gave her a condom. After they had done some stuff, she said stop and he immediately did and then they just talked and slept. 
Mary is saying that it was his fault because he got her drunk. Which yes, consent cant be given while drunk, I understand that, but by that logic, he couldn't give consent either. But it is more of the concept of saying he raped her. 
Mary is a bit dramatic, and it is not that I dont believe her, as Heath confirmed the story, but it is more of the fact she defines what they did together mutually as rape when there was no form of force or consent on either side that Mary or Heath has told me.
Anyway, life goes on, they dont talk anymore, yadda yadda yadda. 
The main issue is that Mary has since gotten married and is pregnant, and I am sort of like an honorary aunt for this baby. Like, I was supposed to help take care of it when I am not working. But now, Mary wants me to not get an apartment with Heath because she doesnt want to see him (understandable if that is what she feels happened). Heath has already volunteered to leave the apartment when Mary comes over out of respect for her.  Also, Mary as my friend, doesnt want me anywhere around Heath when he is also one of my best friends.

So I am a super low-drama person in the middle of this drama that happened while I was gone with 2 sides of the story.
So like, what is the procedure of friendship here? Does anyone have any advice for me?
How do I balance her feelings while retaining my friendship with both of them?",10Sep2019,2

My coworker (A) was taught everything she knows by boss (C). This is a three year process and it‚Äôs a specialised trade so it is intense and there‚Äôs a lot to learn, A feels like they owe C a lot. However, C is a horrible and toxic person as well as boss. They pay A illegally low wages, are aggressive, homophobic, transphobic and racist, and generally unpleasant to be around. I joined the company as the new apprentice just under two years ago, working  full time and unpaid in order to learn a trade I have always wanted to do. As of yet, I have been taught exactly nothing, and as far as I can tell C has no intentions of teaching me and hired me only so he could take a ridiculous amount of time off this year (he doesn‚Äôt believe women can be left alone to run the business, but apparently me + A is acceptable). I‚Äôve stuck it out this far because if I was actually being taught, it would be worth putting up with C for.

Over the last few months me and A have both been looking elsewhere for new job opportunities. A has been offered an amazing opportunity she can‚Äôt turn down, and is going to take it. I have been interviewed and gone for a trial at another incredible place and will find out on Sunday if I have gotten the job (I literally learned more on my trial shift than I have the entire time I‚Äôve been at the current job). The problem is, C is currently working abroad until mid September. 
We both need to hand in our notices as soon as possible, but are stuck in a position where it looks like we have planned this to fuck C over, especially as me and A are good friends. Despite all of his shit, he has some redeeming qualities and we don‚Äôt want to ruin his business- it‚Äôs his life and livelihood and the main boss (D) who owns it is lovely.

Because A is fully trained, she will have to give a months notice before she is able to leave, whereas I can leave pretty much on the spot.

C is coming back for one day (Friday), and then has two days off again for a family event. We don‚Äôt know if we should

1) both quit together on the Friday, with me sticking around for the two days after. This way neither of us will have the shittier job of quitting second, and C will have two days to cool off. BUT C will likely feel ganged up on and might even fire us both on the spot (not that terrible to be honest but A has customers booked in she doesn‚Äôt want to screw over) he will then likely be extremely hostile for the month A has left to work. It also makes it look even more planned.

2) have A quit on the Friday, so C has two days to cool off, and then I quit on Tuesday (our weekends are Wednesday and Thursday) so he will have cooloff time and hopefully not be too shit to A. This way it avoids the volatile situation of us both quitting at once, and I can leave straight away despite having the worse situation.

3) Have A quit, then have me quit a few days later via text (I have never signed a contract so whilst this is cowardly it wouldn‚Äôt technically be a problem). This avoids hostile situations of us both quitting, gives A the benefit of going first, and allows him some cool down time.

Please help, I appreciate this is long but both of us are genuinely scared of him due to his attitude and history.",10Sep2019,1
709,"TLDR: Neighbor is super loud at unreasonable times.  Can't deal.  Need help.

Guy that lives below me is an aspiring rapper...or something...from what he's told me, he's gonna do whatever it takes to make it, even if it means his boom box that exists under my bed is cranking at all hours.  Its. The. Same. Shitty. Beat. For. Hours.

My initial response was to knock and ask him to turn it down.  That was also my second and third response.  He left a note apologizing, with his phone number.  I tried to offer a compromise.  12am Sunday through Thursday and 2 am on Fridays and Saturdays.  As a musician, I am sympathetic to not having a practice space but that doesn't mean your apartment becomes a studio at all hours of the night.

His response was less than enthusiastic and I may have let on to the fact that I have the potential to be a huge asshole, because *spoiler* I can be pretty fu***** petty.

I don't want to get cops involved because, judging by the aroma that wafts from his windows, he loves smoking shitty weed out of blunt wraps.  What is reasonable and acceptable here?

I got in touch with the property manager and he's gonna call and gently remind him that his lease says 10pm quiet time. 

 How do I deal with this and am I being unreasonable?",10Sep2019,5

Today my friend and I had a test that neither of us studied for. I suggested cheating on the test.

My friend caved and took my phone out of the hidden jacket we had and tried to look something up. The teacher saw some suspicious moment and cane to investigate just to have him open the phone and google drive was open and saw a study guide opened recently. He took a red pen and drew a line through my friends test. My friend tried to say I didn‚Äôt cheat and such making him feel more guilty. I don‚Äôt know if I should confess to the teacher and try to get him out and take the punishment instead of him or if it will back fire and both of us will have a punishment.

723," I am 21 and have been balding since 18. I decided to just shave my head and get it over with. People say I look older (like late 20's early 30's) and it's pretty obvious its because of the hair. However, when I tell people my age, they get shocked and say it is for other reasons. Like they say ""oh I thought you were younger"" and I say "" yeah i know, its the shaved head"" and they say no its not because of that. I've heard reasons like ""more mature looking"" or ""bigger"" (this could either mean overweight or tall) or any other reason that is not the hair.

I don't have any outstanding wrinkles except for a barely noticeable forehead line, but I don't think that is associated with age. Besides that, my face is baby smooth. I insist that the reason I look older is because of my shaved head, but they insist back that this isn't the reason. Like, I'm not an idiot. Shaving your head makes you look older. I don't get what they are trying to do? Are they just trying to be nice? Whenever they insist that it is not the hair, it makes me think that I look unhealthy for other reasons.

Does anyone else deal with this? I am just trying to figure out reasons why people are ok with saying I look older for other reasons, but avoid saying its because of the lack of hair. It makes me feel like I am going crazy

725,"I see contradicting things all over, some people have a bachelor's degree and say it's not worth it, while some people say you need education to get a job, I am 19 and currently getting an associate's in general education at a community college because I want to learn a lot about different things, and by different things I mean useful skills. I am learning to become fluent in Spanish, I am learning French and Arabic. I am also taking different classes that will work on me and make me a better person I feel like, as well as classes about crimology and history, etc, a little bit of everything! 

I have a job that I make around 25-30k a year part time because I go to school, and I work around 20-30 hrs a week. I love making money because i grew up super poor and I feel like that is what pushes me more and more to continuously get better jobs. I am wondering what my next route should be, since I don't really like school enough to spend 20k a year on. 

I really enjoy being the best in what I do, so I always try to work my way up in my jobs I get, right now I work in sales and am in the top 6-10% of my company sales-wise, but since I got to where I wanted in the company and had been recognized for it, I am a little over it and want to move on to other things. I see life as a video game in a way 

Right now I get my tuition paid for and get around 1k-3k back every semester, but that's only going to happen until I am done with my associate's. I also SUCK AT MATH! So I picked a degree that had no math in it.

I also travel quite frequently out of the country, and am planning on leaving the US for around 3-4 years once I'm done with my degree. I believe learning languages is super valuable, as well as developing interpersonal skills, which is something travel helps me in. 

I have 22k saved and invest some of my money into stocks, I plan to have at least 30k saved by the time I leave, but am hoping for 40k. I read often too in my free time so am just wondering what if anyone has any advice as to what I should do with my life, because like most people, I have no clue! I am happy I saved because it really does give me the freedom to do whatever I want, so any suggestions I can consider! I have no debt either so I am free to move around wherever.

738,"Hello guys,

Im a junior in high school and lately I have been facing the decision of whether or not to drop my French class, but it is such a shame because of how passionate I am about learning about languages and linguistics, but my French teacher makes it feel like a chore for me (unlike the other 4 French teachers I have had and the fact that I speak it with half of my family on a regular basis). Her accent is absolutely horrific and it is very often hard to understand what she is saying, but the other students talk with similar accents to her as 2nd language French learning Americans, and I come to be the one that has trouble following along. There was an extremely awkward phrase she has been using for the past 5 weeks now and it is translated to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you several minutes to do your work‚Äù literally into English. However in French we don‚Äôt give minutes, we say that somebody has minutes, and as an avid language learner in language learning communities I have never found somebody that didn‚Äôt appreciate a correction or advice to improve their language learning, and I figured who‚Äôs more passionate about French than an American that loved it so much she wanted to teach it? I told her after class today as politely as I possibly could, ‚Äúexcuse me, I just wanted to mention a phrase that I find would be very helpful as a teacher since I‚Äôm sure you have to use it all the time. In French we say people have minutes, but we can not give them, so we would say ‚Äòvous avez (you have a # of minutes), not I‚Äôm giving you ___ minutes.‚Äô‚Äù She stared at me cold stoned and told me I was very condescending and had a little whimper in her voice and she blushed and brushed me off telling me she had a meeting. My teacher defensively used my grades as a point to ‚Äúput me in my place‚Äù I suppose. I have the lowest grade in my class but all my classmates say that if anybody should have a higher grade than them it is me because I speak French everyday of my life and have been familiar with the language since birth and I really do try hard in that class because it is a college level class and I take 4 other college level courses at the same time as well. (I am in high school). I could test out of the class, but for now, how do I deal with a teacher like this who consistently makes basic French errors but seems to have a chip on her shoulder about it? Should I test out of the class and take something else? Should I stay and resolve it (staying would help with the AP credit as somebody who wants to go into linguistics so it is difficult. However I can also test for a fluency seal in Italian and still graduate as a trilingual in high school unless I try to increase my spanish level before I graduate within the next 2 years).",10Sep2019,16

740,"I know the title sounds like I‚Äôm finishing for compliments, but I‚Äôm honestly not. I know I‚Äôm not a bad looking woman. I‚Äôm in my early-mid 20‚Äôs, but if you looked at me you‚Äôd probably think I was 16,17, or maybe 18 on a good day. I have a youthful face, chubby cheeks, round eyes, a ‚Äòbutton nose‚Äô, and I‚Äôm short, like 5‚Äô3. I‚Äôm not curvy in the slightest, I have at most a B cup and a petite body. These are all things I should be grateful for, but I‚Äôm not. Every time someone asks me how old I am, they never believe me.

I take care of my skin and my body, I don‚Äôt drink much or do drugs, so I should be happy. But I‚Äôm not.

I can‚Äôt help but feel infantilized, like I‚Äôm not respected as an adult. It affects how I‚Äôm treated, people go out of their way to do tasks for me, like incapable. When I worked manual labor I was repeatedly told (mostly by middle aged and elderly men and women) that I couldn‚Äôt load trucks because I was too small to lift the bricks and mulch, and that I should‚Äôve let the men do it. Or I couldn‚Äôt drive the forklift, despite having my license, because it was a man‚Äôs job. Like fuck that! I workout and rock climb, I‚Äôm not weak by any means! Last summer I was on vacation with my family and I was wading in the ocean. This middle aged dude and his wife came up to me and, I guess I spaced out or looked confused, because the guy asked me if I needed help finding my parents. I told him I was 22 (at the time) and that they were back at the condo, and he had this like embarrassed/disbelieving look on his face. My own parents still treat me like a child (which is more understandable) and my mom refuses to let me do the most basic of things, despite the fact that I moved out. I can‚Äôt buy drinks without being carded (again, understandable because it‚Äôs their job). One time I had a bartender say that they didn‚Äôt feel comfortable serving me because I looked underage and that it could be a good fake, despite what my ID said. That‚Äôs only happened once. I‚Äôve been one 2 separate dates where guys from Tinder asked to see my ID, because they weren‚Äôt sure. That felt really insulting. I know they‚Äôre trying to protect themselves legally, but it still hurt. This summer I worked in the garden section chain hardware store with a bunch of guys who were all within the 18-20 range. 3 of the guys thought I was cute, but that I looked 16-17.

741,"Im 26 years old, and been living with my uncle at his home. So I basically moved to his city about 8 months ago because I got a good job offer here and my parents wanted me to live with him because I was new to the city (they're the overprotective type)
My uncle, while being generally civil with me, has had a huge nasty falling out with my aunt (who im blood related to) and they had a very nasty divorce. He still visits her because of child support and all but he's a sour guy, minus him letting me stay with him. I'm at work and the gym 10 to 11 hours a day, coming in at night and i dont spend the weekends with him (i drive home which is like 8 hours away)
Before their divorce he was pretty nice to me and my siblings and we respected him a lot. 
Because i was moving to a new city I thought I'd settle in and get a sense of my surroundings
Now i feel like I'm in my comfort zone because my work and gym are close to his home. However, no one in my family talks to him except for my aunt and he treats her like absolute sh*t. I know he has bad views about my parents too, and he ends up screaming at everyone he knows for petty reasons (me only two times) and keeps score with people. On top of this he's really stubborn and had a very big mean streak (he broke the tv in his house in a fit of rage, and talks about it proudly). I know he's going to turn mean to me some time or the other, little red flags starting to show
Should i bear it out with him and save money or should i get an apartment? At this point i can easily afford one, except that its going to be a bit far away from work (25 min commute)",10Sep2019,1
742,"I don't have any direction in my life anymore. I was so certain I wanted to be in this major. It was a perfect fit, from the beginning. I settled on a cheap school close to home, because it had a good program for my major. There's 6000 people in my freshman class, and I'm struggling to make any connections with any of them.

I went to a very small school, considering where I grew up. There were less than 50 kids in my graduating class. Now, I'm in a big city and i'm so overwhelmed.

I've always struggled with making friends. I've been diagnosed with a textbook full of disorders, but none of which should limit me to this extent. I've never had a filter, and have always said the first thing that comes to mind, regardless of if it's appropriate.

I was 5 months into a very, very good relationship. I've dated before, but I was a victim of abuse. I've never experienced something so wholesome and pure. She made me a better person. She helped me control my urges, create a filter, and think just a bit more. It's not something i can recreate.. I was able to do it because i cared so much about our relationship, and not screwing it up. I've never had much self-worth in my own eyes, and very few things are capable of making me happy. In the long term, People are the only thing i've found that can make me happy.

The problem is, my family isn't one of them. My dad has been verbally abusive since I was 8. He's improved a little bit in his temper over the past 2 years, but he still says very hurtful things, without skipping a beat. often, he does it calmly now, which can make it even worse.

My mom has been distant, though present. I have 4 younger sisters, 3 of which we adopted just last year. She's always had her hands full (and still does), with all the other kids, that I can barely get 10 minutes to call her most days.

I don't know who to turn to. I just lost the most important person in my life, because i leaned on her too much, and couldn't deal with my own problems. 

I'm trying to schedule an appointment with my therapist, but every opening she has for the next week is during my classes, and i lose a giant chunk of my grade if i miss even one class. My mom got in contact with a pediatric therapist, but, again, i'm struggling to schedule anything.

I‚Äôve got a date, and I found out she‚Äôs got a boyfriend. We added each other‚Äôs socials so that‚Äôs how I found out by the way. In case your wondering. As I was curious I was looking through and on one of her posts a guy commented and they kept commenting on each others posts as a couple would, you know the flirty messages etc... in the comments box. She hasn‚Äôt said anything and we‚Äôve got a date organised. Kinda feeling down about it, it‚Äôs my first date and she‚Äôs quite nice, from what I‚Äôve at least got over messages anyway. So yea, I think they‚Äôre still together as the last post they did this one was about 3-4 weeks ago. But why would she be on a dating app and do a date with me if she has a bf? Could they just be like really good friends? But on one of the pics it‚Äôs in a bedroom and they‚Äôre sort of cuddling in a mirror selfie? There‚Äôs nothing on her socials to say that she‚Äôs in a relationship btw aswell, she hearted this pic of her on his header... so yea

Edit, on her bfs socials he has that he‚Äôs in a relationship with someone, doesn‚Äôt say who, and his header picture is of her...

TL:DR - girl I matched with online and got a date with has a boyfriend. She hasn‚Äôt said anything.

All though I urge you to read the full story I understand if you‚Äôve only read the TL:DR for convenience. But it helps!

Thanks for the help!

Ps any help you can provide is appreciated, ik I‚Äôm not supposed to get hung on on her but I do kinda feel down and ‚Äòupset‚Äô about it... many thanks!

Edit: I believe they‚Äôre still going out as she only updated her profile picture probably the day that we matched, and her supposed bf heart reactioned to it...

Edit edit: It‚Äôs a long story, but the ‚Äòdown low‚Äô? Of it is I organised a date and she said yes, but that was a few weeks away and I said about bringing it forward she said yes, she‚Äôll have to check with work though. A few days passed and she hadn‚Äôt replied so I just sent a sort of ‚Äòhey what‚Äôs happening‚Äô message and we‚Äôve got a date. I specifically said in my messages at some point ‚Äòdate‚Äô

Edit, her relationship tag doesn‚Äôt say anything, not in a relationship or even single l, she hasn‚Äôt got it set on there. Her supposed boyfriend though does have his as ‚Äòin a relationship since x‚Äô but no name. They only thing I have ‚Äòlinking‚Äô them together is their photos together and the comments made on posts as if they were a couple, with kisses and emojis, you know the flirty couple messages.

750,"a lil intro explanation here: 
there are a lot of things in my head. most of which i can barely put into words. i have a journal to write in here and there to relieve some pressure off my mind,
but anyways!!! to keep it short n simple there‚Äôs just been so much going on in my life for the past 5+ years. i used to see a therapist often in high school and didn‚Äôt like it, but now that i‚Äôm older and out of high school, i feel like maybe i should give a therapist another try. 

what‚Äôs mainly feeding this thought recently is the fact that my feeling of loneliness has gotten to the point where it‚Äôs consuming me more than ever before. i barely have anyone i‚Äôm close with, let alone a friend. 
because of that, i find all my thoughts build up. yes my journal can help me get some thought out but you know, sometimes it would be nice to have someone to sit down with and know somebody cares. (i‚Äôm very independent y‚Äôall, i don‚Äôt rely on ppl for happiness and such but i‚Äôm sure some of u can relate,, it feels good to know someone cares and is there to listen and help out, idk)

but yeah, i want to give a therapist another go. they could help me cope and understand my head and what i can do and in all honesty, i just want to have someone listen. (lmao since it‚Äôs their job and i honestly have no one else)
but seeing a therapist isn‚Äôt easy to do atm...... 
if i tell my parents i want to see a therapist again, my dad will be the judgmental guy he is laugh/mimic me and my mom is so unstable and i don‚Äôt want her to have a breakdown. (don‚Äôt get me wrong i love my parents to death but no ones perfect including myself lol) 
i‚Äôm only 19 so i‚Äôm still livin at home, going to college and unemployed. we use the same insurance obviously so if i see a therapist there‚Äôs gonna be some type of cost + insurance coverage. and if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know yet, therapy sure ain‚Äôt affordable!! love that. 
and yes, i‚Äôve tried seeing if my college campus has some type of mental health assistance program or counselor but they don‚Äôt bc the ‚Äúgovernment wont fund them‚Äù??? sounds like a bit of an issue don‚Äôt y‚Äôall think??? 

i just wish it were easy to speak to a professional to help me cope and understand all this shit in my head. idk how i‚Äôm going to see a therapist or if i‚Äôm ever going to get help i feel i need??? 
idk what to do or where to go. 

i feel so helpless on top of everything. i don‚Äôt know what to do so if you guys have any advice let me know. do i just ask my dad and hope he doesn‚Äôt degrade me for wanting to see a therapist again? i do wanna keep it lowkey. 
it‚Äôs also expensive so i can‚Äôt control that obviously.

But now to get into it, she started harming herself about 1,5 years ago. She told my best friend who was all her best friend at the time. He kept it a secret for a year because she told him to. Once her close friends and I figured it out we held a light intervention. We told her we supported her and that we would like her to talk to someone about it if she felt comfortable with that. She didn‚Äôt, and that was the end of it. We never really spoke of it again.

About a week ago she told be that she started again. I don‚Äôt know why she told be because we aren‚Äôt even close. She also asked me to keep it a secret, so I have. About half an hour ago, she told me the guy she liked didn‚Äôt like her back. I tried to comfort her and I thought all was going well because she was laughing again. Mind you, this was over snapchat.

760,"This has been happening for a while where I ask simple things, such as don't go in my car or me explaining I hate when people buy me things because it makes me feel guilty and puts pressure on me to use it. 

I guess the best example is from this week: I go on a long thing about how and why I hate getting gifts, how it just adds to my anxiety and all this stuff. The next day she walks in saying she bought me a $27 self help book to help me get over it. I get upset that she blatantly ignored everything I said less than 24 hours ago but I'm stuck in this position of knowing her motives are good. So I feel like a dick going off on someone who bought me a gift to help. On the flip side stuff like this is constant and it's literally the exact opposite of I said will help me. I don't know how to approach someone trying to help but also just ignoring me and having the knowledge that it won't help but thinking they know best. It just adds guilt no matter what I do and no matter what I say it seems like she is so into this 'mother knows best' thing that she is just ignoring me or not factoring in what I say, at all. It's extra annoying because when I ask why she does it she makes me feel like shit going off about she's trying to help and I know that. I know her motivation is good and I never once doubted that. I just don't get why she's like guessing what will help when I told her the answer. It's putting me in situations where someone is disregarding my wants on something that only impacts me which is annoying but they have good intentions and technically are trying to help but in a almost comedically infuriating way and I don't know how the hell to communicate it without being a dick.

765,"High school was 5 years ago, but it was an incredibly dark time for me. I grew up in a very abusive family, a narcissistic mother, and an enabling and physically abusive father. What had happened was that I attempted suicide, ended up in the hospital for about 1.5 weeks. I‚Äôm not sure if she knew I was absent from school because of that, but she knew that my parents were abusive. When I was cleared to go back to school, my mom made me cut our friendship off. I know this sounds stupid, but narcissistic mothers are insanely obsessive and possessive over their children and their relationships. She never wanted me to have friends. She always told me while I was growing up that she should be my only friend. Stupid as I was, I always listened to my mother. I cut that dear friend of mine off. She was a great friend. She knew I was going through something, so she kept trying to get me to open up and ask why I distanced myself from her. I refused to open up about what I was really going through and to slander my mom‚Äôs name, so instead, I bullied her. I pushed her away through this. I cried everyday after school when I got home, but stupid me still kept up the front and listened to my mother.

I‚Äôm not trying to make excuses for myself... Bullying is unacceptable and I never should have done it. I‚Äôm probably the last person she‚Äôd ever want to hear from. But I really want to apologize and tell her everything. I moved away from my parents to a whole different state, and am no longer in contact with them. They don‚Äôt know where I am. I got diagnosed.

767,"I did attend the university for one full year before I transferred to another one. The census date to drop out was August 21st of that year, and the effective date of when I dropped out of all my classes was August 23rd, so it makes sense that I would be billed.

However, I was under the impression that non-payment resulted in dropped classes, as it is in my current university now. I did check with that university and I did not accept any financial aid, so there was no way that I was paying for the university at all. I only talked to my counselor as a formality to make sure my classes were dropped, but I assumed students would be dropped automatically if they didn't pay their tuition (or at least create a payment plan, which I didn't).

The university sent me an email around half a year later, telling me that I had an overdue payment of $3k because I dropped out of class later than the census date. 

Is there any way of cancelling this, or at least reducing the amount I'd have to pay?

769,"I know, not the best trait you can have, but I always want to win. I remember back in school we had a race over I don't know how many meters. I ran something like 11 second. The teacher said ""No, I bet you can be way better, maybe you just need competition."" I then ran again and was at 6 second or something, which was the school record.

So that describes it really good. I just need competition and it doesn't matter who I have to go against, I always win. 

Now I'm 19 and I encounter a big and unexpected problem. I don't have competition anymore. When I was 18 I took the highest career path in my country together with my best friend. He was basically my rival and he was able to keep up with me in pretty much every aspect, even beating me from time to time. He also loves competition, so that's good.

But in the last year I completely got out of his range, so now I have nobody anymore. The only people that can keep up with me when it comes to education are pretty old guys. I'm currently working with a team of 3 professors and they are obviously smart and educated, but they are old and they don't care about competition anymore, since they aren't as immature as I am.

But it really hurts me. I need competition and I need somebody that I have to win against, but I don't think there are many people my age that can keep up with me anymore, even though that sounds arrogant. I don't know what to do.",10Sep2019,2

Adam is a teacher at Daz‚Äô school, but doesn‚Äôt even have Daz in a class. The entire group has been trying to inform Daz but Daz just dips whenever we talk about it. Emily and I have both dm‚Äôd Daz and everytime he responds once or twice with ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not grooming me‚Äù and then leaves us on read. 

None of us have Daz‚Äô information. We don‚Äôt know where he attends or Adam‚Äôs real name. This could all be a scam and Daz is playing us but I‚Äôm treating it like it‚Äôs happening because of how Daz originally left out the fact he‚Äôs a teacher. 

What can Emily and I do? Is there any place we can call or anyone we can inform?",10Sep2019,1
771,"(NOTE: I'm 17 and my girlfriend is 16) We started to worry about this toward the beginning of August. We were unsure if she will get her period that month but we thought the best idea was to wait and see. It's the 10th of September and she still hasn't gotten her period. She's really scared of what would happen if her mom and her stepdad would do if they find out about her since they both have serious anger issues. We decided the best thing is abortion, but we don't have the money. We are trying these remedies to have a natural abortion like high intake of vitamin C, taking hot showers, eating sesame seeds, drinking pineapple juice, basically anything that has a lot of sugar in it. What leads me to make this post that she started to freak out again about what if the remedies won't work. She believes to be 2 months and she's getting more and more worried. I've stood by her the whole time but I too am unsure about this whole thing. I really need help. What should we do",10Sep2019,1

During those times it was ok but lately I've been feeling really sad, tired and overall miserable trying to keep up with the constant demands not only from work but from everything else that is affected by my schedule. It's nearly impossible to achieve anything during the day and my body is so confused by my hours that even when I do get home it's difficult to get any rest.

779,"Hey, so this might sound crazy. I‚Äòm trying to learn the piano by myself without any lessons, or apps, because I believe I can do it for free. The reason for that is, I don‚Äòt wanna feel bad if I‚Äòm spending 50‚Ç¨ a month on a practice app and I‚Äòm not making quicker progress than I would have without it.

My background: 17 years old
used to play sax and drums, I have a pretty good understanding of music in general, I love the piano.

So I bought the Yamaha psr e 363 as I did research which keyboard would be good for me to learn on. 

I already found a yt channel called Mark‚Äòs Piano, who does a lot of great, long lessons.

I also found out that there‚Äòs no point watching a song totourial, playing it a million times, because I won‚Äòt really be able to play the instrument. The faster way would be to actually learn the instrument, with rather boring excersises. Just looking for the quickest way.

781,"I am trapped in a job that I loathe. My father started an insulating company back in the late 80‚Äôs, with a lot of blood, sweat and tears. My mother and him got the company to a very successful point. The business was able to survive the 08 recession even though a lot of construction companies went under. 

Now to the tricky part. My father passed away early 2018. It‚Äôs been very hard on my family, but it‚Äôs easily been the hardest on my mother, she was forced to run the home and run the company. She never learned how to run it because there never was a need. So she got stuck running it when my dad died. Luckily the company is pretty self sustaining. Everyone expected me to take it over. I made it clear from day one that i wanted nothing to do with it. I even said that while he was alive. 


The problem, last august my mom approached me and told me I was applying to the company. I didn‚Äôt want to but she made it clear I was needed. So I started working for my mom. I hate it.


I‚Äôm not a blue collar working guy, I should be doing something with math or science. A lot of my coworkers are massive dicks. They vary from condescending pricks to racist assholes. Some are good. But imo the good ones are outnumbered. I‚Äôm completely miserable and i can feel my mental health draining. 


I told my mom back in April that I wanted to quit to work at a restaurant as a server (which I actually enjoy). She asked me to stay until she found my replacement. Surprise surprise she didn‚Äôt find one. I left for a short while once college started. But apparently she‚Äôs been backed up so i was practically begged to come back. She gave me a very hefty raise too.

782,"I work in customer service. Yesterday, I had a customer ask me if I could give him a pretty significant discount on his purchase. I told him I couldn't do it and he went from zero to a hundred immediately. He screamed at me to get a manager and started insulting and swearing at me, saying that he's been a repeat customer for years. My job has been stressing me out for the better part of a year and this guy pushed me over the edge.

I lost my temper and told him to shut the fuck up and to go fuck himself. He then pulls out his phone to start recording me, which is illegal in my state as we are a two-party consent state, so I reach over and grab his phone, covering the camera on the back. He then starts screaming that I assaulted him and that he's going to call 911. At this point, my manager shows up and tells me to go cool off while he deals with the customer.

After everything was said and done, I explained my side of the story to my manager. He said he understands why I reacted the way I did, said the customer was psychotic, recording me was ridiculous, and that I should be fine and not worry about it.

Today, I received a text from my manager's boss, who wasn't in yesterday, saying he wants to speak to me tomorrow and ask me questions about what happened. I'm worried I might be fired for ""assaulting"" the customer despite the fact I never touched him, only his phone when he tried to illegally record me.

What should I keep in mind when I talk to him tomorrow? Do I have a leg to stand on here or did I completely fuck up? There are a bunch of cameras in the store that recorded the entire encounter minus the audio, proving I didn't touch the customer.",10Sep2019,1

She is not allowed to visit me at my school, so I have been left with all the driving (which I don't mind too much), and if she tries to leave, her parents will see via the tracking and potentially take her car, etc. We are currently trying to plan a trip to Atlanta for a concert together, but are worried about her parents tracking her and ruining a good evening since they don't want her leaving campus ever unless for priorities.

788,"I feel stuck in my life and I don‚Äôt know how to change it. I‚Äôm currently dealing with bad depression and anxiety and just recently started therapy. I feel like all of the negative feelings that have been building up over the years have finally started to boil over to the point where I just don‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. I‚Äôm occasionally suicidal depending on the situation, but more often than not, I just want to die so I can escape the meaningless day-to-day. I have a kid, but I don‚Äôt want to be a father. I do the best I can for my son to take care of him and play with him and give him what he needs, but I don‚Äôt enjoy it. I have a fianc√©e of 6 years who loves me and cares for me, but I‚Äôm not happy and secure in the relationship, and I‚Äôm only comfortable when I‚Äôm alone. I have a good job with USPS in a comfortable and friendly office where I get to sit at a desk and practically do nothing for $21 an hour, but I hate it now. I struggle and live paycheck-to-paycheck, and the thought of working 40 hours a week for the rest of my life just to survive makes me want to give up.

Back in 2009, I started recording vocals and getting into music. I started out with covers, and mostly did that for almost 10 years, with a few original songs thrown in. In the last few years, I‚Äôve been getting involved with some very talented musicians and working on my own music. Over this time, I gathered a large fan base, and my YouTube channel got up to 37,000 subscribers before YouTube terminated it permanently due to a mistake on their part. I started over, and I‚Äôm back up to 8,000. I was always shy and had no self-confidence most of my life, but being the ‚Äúmetal vocal guy‚Äù on YouTube gave me strength and confidence and something to be proud of. I‚Äôm constantly working on improving myself and writing my next best song or recording my next best cover. The problem is, this became the core of my identity. Outside of my music, I feel like I have absolutely no value and there‚Äôs nothing interesting about me. So when there are times, due to our current living situation or what have you, where I can‚Äôt record music, I lose all sense of value and worth.  
 

Things went off the deep end when we had our son. Not only did my personal time get almost completely obliterated, but we can only afford to live in apartments, so depending on where we were, my recording time was very limited. Thankfully, we‚Äôre finally living in an apartment with cool neighbors that don‚Äôt care how loud I get, and I was able to set up a studio room in my home to record in again. I can only record on weekends due to my job, but I‚Äôve been able to start being slightly productive again.

The problems with my ‚Äúmusical life‚Äù though, are that as the years have gone by, I‚Äôve been in a constant struggle of just trying to make people care. I‚Äôve begged and pleaded with my family and friends to just listen to what I do, and I post my stuff everywhere and beg my ‚Äúfans‚Äù to listen, but I feel like nobody cares anymore. I almost have to force people to watch, and when they do, they love it, but it‚Äôs a fight every single time to even get anyone to try. Also, as Youtube and Facebook algorithms have changed, less and less of my real fans are even seeing what I do. I‚Äôll put out a new song and promote it over and over for a couple of weeks, and then I come to find out some time later, that so many people had no idea because they never saw it. I feel like I‚Äôm getting better and better, but going backwards in terms of success. So now, not only do I feel worthless outside of my music, but worthless in my music as well.  
 

My therapy has opened my mind to a lot of the feelings I‚Äôve been ignoring an repressing, and it‚Äôs started to help me a little bit with my depression and anxiety at home, but now, after my long weekend, I came back to work and found myself extremely miserable. I can‚Äôt stand sitting here for another second, but unfortunately, I used up most of my leave due to my depression and anxiety. I‚Äôm depressed and I‚Äôm so fucking angry, I just want to break my monitor and go outside and yell at the top of my lungs. My hands are running through my hair and I want to pull it out. I don‚Äôt want to work a soulless, meaningless job for the rest of my life, and I don‚Äôt want to sit at this desk for one more day.

I want to do something involved with music. I don‚Äôt care what it is. Singing, writing, mixing, hired vocal work, lessons, and all the other stuff that doesn‚Äôt make any real money. Both of the bands I‚Äôm in are in Europe, so we collaborate everything online. This means we‚Äôre strictly studio bands and can‚Äôt play live. My main band C4TM is putting on a show in Austria next spring and flying me out, but that‚Äôs just one show, and my first one ever. Any local musicians I‚Äôve found are either already happy with who they‚Äôre working with, or they completely suck.

Hell, I‚Äôd love a job at a music store or a music venue. The problem is, I don‚Äôt have any real skills outside of writing, singing and mixing my own tracks. I‚Äôve never even had lessons. I‚Äôm self-taught, and I don‚Äôt really know anything about technique, or even about musical equipment. Do I stay at this stupid job and spend what little money I have on taking classes in something? Where would I find not only the money, but the time?

How do I get out of this job and get into doing something that actually means something to me, and how do I find the time to do it when I only have 1 to 2 hours a day of personal time? How do I find a real value to my life so I don‚Äôt feel like I should just end it?

Right now, I‚Äôm supporting Andrew Yang and his Freedom Dividend, as getting an extra $2000 in my household would allow me to just work part-time somewhere and focus on music, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if he doesn‚Äôt get elected. I‚Äôm placing all my hopes in a political candidate, and I‚Äôve never done that before.

It completely caught me off guard and made me a little uncomfortable. It was so **out of the blue**, so I played it off like it was just a weird question, but I still hate that it happened. I just started the semester and can't drop the class, and I just want to forget it happened at this point. It's selfish, but I don't have the time, resources, or even desire to do anything or address it, and I'm hoping that it was just an off and badly formulated question.

803,"Basically, my husband is pretty sick and we've exhausted all our options locally. We'll be going to another large city to resume treatment. Even with everything we're putting into this, the end goal is probably going to stay the same. 

As for myself, I don't process my emotions. When the going gets tough, its like a part of my brain shuts down and I become very robotic. I want to console my husband, encourage him that all this is worth it. I want to give our lives as much consistency as possible with making our hectic schedule.... normal in some aspects. 
And I get so caught up doing, caring, and being superman...

That I just stop.

And my brain feel numb and fuzzy and I'm just so sad. Its been so many months of this, that I'm having a hard time processing myself because that part of me has been out of order for a bit. I'm a naturally super optimistic person. I like waking up and going, ""Lets make today good.""
Its easier to me.

Its getting harder and harder though. 

And my husband is having a harder time processing everything too. Especially now that we've exhausted all our local doctors and we're doing to need to be driving a lot more. I hate seeing him broken. I hate that my mind is being a big old dumb and I'm not effectively communicating like I need to be to help him process his thoughts. 
And he does try to do that for me. He's absolutely amazing and I adore him more than breathing. He's an amazing, gentle soul.
I'm just a hard person to console. I'm too much of a ""smile on my face"" and a ""it'll get better, I just need time"" kind of person. Now that I'm getting older, its getting a bit harder to stay that way. Maybe its me being stubborn. Knowing me, it probably is.

Typing this out is helping. I think knowing someone might take a moment to read this helps. Its like writing a letter, then dropping it in the mailbox with no return address. You don't expect anything from it, but the idea someone is going to see it helps. Makes some of the loneliness of being trapped in your mind go away.

The problem is this friend is massively narcissistic and kind of treats me like shit. I deal with it because we are friends and I do care about them. He literally thinks he‚Äôs famous. (we aren‚Äôt lol) I do all of the work. I plan the pranks, I set up the camera (he always has to be the star) I edit the videos, I design the thumb nails, I upload, I promote, I pay for advertising,  I try to set up collabs with other youtubers in our area.  I do all this because I can‚Äôt trust him to do it and stick to a schedule. It‚Äôs embarrassing when people commented about how we didn‚Äôt upload regularly or have a schedule. I  asked him to take more responsibility do something  2 weeks ago and he didn‚Äôt do it. I asked him about it today and you would have thought I was harassing him. He slapped together the email asking for the collab (that he was supposed to do a week ago) and then told me he was ‚Äúclocking out of the day‚Äù and I needed to ‚Äúget off his dick‚Äù. I get that I can be very driven but this was uncalled for.  I really enjoy making videos and interacting with the people  but my friend has got it in my head the only reason we are kinda successful is because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs on camera material‚Äù he told me our channel works because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs hot and I do the work‚Äù and I needed to pull the stick out of my ass and let him ‚Äúwing it‚Äù. It‚Äôs like hes the quarter back and I‚Äôm the kid doing his homework. These things take planning. Winging it is so unprofessional. He‚Äôs pulling stuff that he did like 4 years ago and recycling it into a videos.  He also told me once that he couldn‚Äôt have friends who are hotter than him‚Ä¶to me his best friend. I‚Äôm kind of at my wits end with my friend. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I keep working because I really like doing the videos, do I cut him out because he‚Äôs not pulling his weight and getting the things done, OR am I a massive asshole and I just don‚Äôt see it?",10Sep2019,1
806,"I‚Äôm not sure where to post this, but this seems like the best place. Sorry that this is very long.

I have at least 1/2 of my grade on Snapchat, so 40 people in my grade alone, and Snapchat reminds you when it‚Äôs your friend‚Äôs birthday. No matter how close I am to someone, I always wished them a happy for the past year, but when my birthday came around in June, not a single person even told me happy birthday. 

Today, 3 months later, I see one of my best friend posting dozens of happy birthday messages she‚Äôs receiving from our friend group, and I just don‚Äôt understand why not a single one of them would say happy birthday to me. I see people posting dozens of messages like this all the time, and I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs my fault or not that no one wants to tell me happy birthday.

I‚Äôve also been on this discord server for a year and a half, and we keep a list of everyone‚Äôs bdays where everyone can see it. Other mods always change the server‚Äôs theme for bdays of people in our friend group, but they did not do this for me. Heck, not a single one told me happy birthday. I mentioned it being my birthday during a conversation (because it was relevant, not for attention) and they totally brushed it off. I might make another post adding onto how they started to exclude me later.

TL;DR several dozen of my friends knew it was my birthday, but I did not receive a single happy birthday.
I haven‚Äôt mentioned it or let it affect our friendships, but is it valid for me to be upset with them still 3 months later?",10Sep2019,1

812,"When I say bitch, I don't mean: A girl is a bitch because she rejected me, I mean the main reason i'm over her is because I was finally able to see past the romanticized vision I had of her and saw that in reality...She's kind of a bitch.

So basically: I had feelings for someone I was friends with. I told her but she didn't feel the same. That was roughly 2 years ago and we didn't talk up until now. It's probably important to note that my other friends didn't really like this girl as she would treat them like shit and I suppose I wasn't a good friend because I sort of dismissed it and always had an excuse for her behavior: ""she's going through a rough time"" or ""she's rude, but she doesn't mean it; it's a joke"" hopefully you get the idea.

But she unintentionally reentered my life again and I guess the rose tinted lenses weren't obscuring my vision anymore, because I started calling her out on the unnecessary hostile way she was treating my friends. This lead her to lash out at me specifically and after a couple days of heated debate, we're no longer on speaking terms. Any reaming feelings I had for her have been completely and totally crushed. It was this and I found out she liked leading people on (i.e: I wasn't the only one); I feel stupid to have wasted the past couple years getting over her when she wasn't worth it in the first place.

So here I am: still single, no idea what to do with myself now. I know it sounds silly, but I don't see myself finding a relationship anytime soon because picking are pretty slim around here; most girls are already taken or from what i've encountered, very shallow. I suppose there's tinder, but i'm looking for a relationship more for the companionship rather than getting my leg over. Does anyone have any advice for the situation i'm in?",10Sep2019,0

814,"So I'm in university and I'm taking a discussion-based class this semester. I'm usually pretty decent at school and I generally like to participate. But this is a politically-themed class and people tend to hold on to their opinions very strongly. The problem is, whenever I muster the courage to participate, the other students seem to have an immediate recoiling reaction to what I've said and a bunch of hands spring up to correct me. (My comments are not provocative or offensive, just sometimes wrong or ill-formed.) I like the idea of exchanging opinions with my peers, but it's becoming really tough since the only thing my peers are able to agree on is their intense dislike of whatever I say. The way they go about responding to me tends to be really dismissive and condescending, and it makes me feel like a fool for even trying to join in the discussion. Now I'm considering dropping the course, because I'm finding it very difficult to learn when I don't feel comfortable participating and it's very difficult to participate when my contributions are always met with a universal sentiment of ""you're completely wrong, how could you not know this already?"". The prof is kind and helpful but at the end of the day it's a discussion class and most of our time is spent talking between students. So I need some advice: Do you think dropping the course will be a mistake? Has anyone felt this way before? Does anyone have advice on how I can make myself heard and participate without making a fool of myself? Thanks is advance.",10Sep2019,2
816,"I realize how much I am missing out on. I basically have no life. I've experienced nothing I want to experience. And it hurts me to see others who get to have the experience that I wish I could have. 

My issues from gender and self exploration are seeming to get worse and I don't know what to do about it. I just want to be normal and go through life normally. I want to be able to relate to the things my peers do and experience what they experience, too. I want to live my own individual life, but I am jealous that they are able to experience the things I cannot due to our differing circumstances. 

It doesn't help that I have height insecurities. I'm 4'11 and I'm angry about it. People go on and on about how short people are 'so cute' and 'adorable when they try to be intimidating' and it makes me feel even worse about myself. My 'short man syndrome' on top of my issues with my gender (specifically genitalia, which makes me want to get out of my own body) and past trauma that I'm working through I just start to feel like life may not be worth it.

824,"The company I work for organized a restoration workshop to train people in rehabilitating old houses. Everyone who attended the workshop was required to bring their own respirator (for lead paint fumes)  which they would keep after finishing the workshop. One guy (pseudonym: Fred) argues with my boss suggesting that our company should be buying the respirators. My boss refuses as the workshop was very expensive to run in the first place, and he thought it was reasonable for all of the attendees to buy their own respirator (they are about $30). 

I worked with Fred directly during the workshop. Fred was a pretty odd guy in how he interacted with people, though he wasn't too bothersome or demanding during the workshop itself. There were a few notable things about him. He did not want to be in any photos. The quality of his attention was also pretty terrible, he couldn't remember anything for longer than a few minutes. And most strangely, during the workshop Fred has to talk to the local police who were investigating some alleged animal abuse. According to Fred someone called the police because Fred's dog had been out all morning and they didn't see a water dish outside. Fred was certainly off putting but the group pressed on as the other attendees were doing a great job and learning a lot. 

Anyway, we wrapped up the workshop over the weekend and our organization handed the keys back to the property owner of the house, which is another organization related to ours. The guy calls us the next day inquiring where his certificate was and if we needed his mailing address to mail it to him. We explain to him that we are going to email it and we don't need his address. THEN - two days later - the guy calls and says he left his respirator on the site. So today I go up to the house and look around, of course its not there. So I call him back and tell him I can't find it.

Fred essentially doesn't believe me and won't take my word for it that I searched the house. Now Fred is insisting on going back in the house and looking himself. I told him that we are not responsible for his respirator and don't know where it is. Fred is frustrating and is beginning to make me feel uncomfortable but I don't feel like I'm in imminent danger.

Anyway, what should I do here? 

* Give Fred my Respirator and Hope be goes away?
* Ignore Fred and stop answering his calls? - He knows my companies and my bosses phone number and can figure out where we are located pretty easily.
* Let him search of the house and go from there?",10Sep2019,3

Basically I‚Äôm lonely af. Moved last year, didn‚Äôt make friends at new school, now I sit alone at lunch everyday. It isn‚Äôt too bad when I have a book. 


Usually I have a book and I sit there and read all lunch. As school just started, I haven‚Äôt had the time to get a book from the school library. So, I‚Äôve been noticing a lot more than I would if my nose was in a book. Also noteworthy, the only table that I could sit at was the ‚ÄúMentally Handicap Table.‚Äù The aids and kids let me sit on the other side and don‚Äôt bother me much. They‚Äôre all really nice. And for some reason, I now want to qualify to be able to stay with them the whole day. 

I know being mentally handicapped isn‚Äôt fun, and people shouldn‚Äôt want it, but I do for some reason and I hate wanting it so much. 

I don‚Äôt understand. I thought at first I might just want to attention of the aid, but then I realized why would I want that? I definitely didn‚Äôt live a bad life. My parents love me, I get fed, I‚Äôm cared for, but I still want that at school. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily coddled a lot, but I always hated being coddled. The only bad thing to ever really happen was my dad cheating and my parent‚Äôs divorce, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that isn‚Äôt repeated to anything. 

Now the part where it would ruin everything I worked for; if I hypothetically have what I want I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take any of the advanced classes I‚Äôm in now. The only reason I take them and put the extra stress on myself is so I can secure a good future. If I had this, I probably wouldn‚Äôt get to take the classes at they have totally different schedules than anyone else. 

Worst part: The want has been overwhelming lately. The only reason I‚Äôm actually asking for advice is because I was literally tearing up at lunch earlier because I wanted it so bad. 

So, can anyone please help me get rid of the want? And if not, at least explain why I want this when it would ruin everything I work for?",10Sep2019,2

I‚Äôve been with this company for over 3 years now.  And I‚Äôve hated it almost the entire time. Boss is very rude, and demanding.  I work 10+ hour days, and he only pays me for 8 hours.

846,"Hi guys, I'm currently sitting here with my friend..because we need advice. 

We both attend the same university &amp; today in class, she had an interesting experience with an interesting guy. Here's what she has to say:

""So, its only been two weeks since classes started, so I barely have had the time to really meet people in my classes...but there was this guy in my food workshop class and he had a tattoo that I commented on. From there on out, he started to linger around me and start brief conversations. Today, after class, we ended up walking next to each other &amp; I casually asked him about UCLA (he had mentioned in class a few days prior that he had once attended there and was at our university now for grad school). I asked him why he chose this university for graduate school rather than just staying in LA. He then told me, ""I don't like talking about it."" I took the hint &amp; decided to drop it. I then invited him to my sorority house for lunch one day because I honestly felt bad for the dude. He told me he was \~27 and still living in the dorms. While we were eating, I asked him again why he decided to come here. He then felt comfortable enough to tell me that he moved here to ""get away"" from being in a gang, murdering people, and selling drugs. Apparently his family was also wrapped up in gang activity, but I felt this was almost a lie? He went to UCLA, he was an astrophysicist major and mechanical engineering major, and he supposedly was in the military as well. At least one of these has to be a lie. I suddenly got a really bad gut feeling about him as he was telling me about his lack of remorse or regard for other people. He explained that he had no heart &amp; that killing people caused him not emotion. I immediately felt like I was going to be sick. But wait, there's more....

After some investigating, I actually managed to find his twitter. What's bizarre about his twitter is that he only has 8 followers &amp; they're all bots. Also, his posts are pointless and seem to contain jargon &amp; what seems like ""code"". That is why I'm on here. I was hoping you guys could help me figure out what exactly his social media means, if anything. It's possible he could have a mental illness like schizophrenia due to him referencing ""troncat"" in his social media, which is a reference to a voice in somebody's head telling them to commit crimes. Troncat was referenced in Tyler the Creator's song: ""There's a voice in my head, who tells me to do all these messed up stuff I don't wanna do."" His Facebook contains 1 follower (who is also a bot) &amp; his Instagram has a video of me at lunch with him in my sorority house.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm including some screenshots of his account on an Instagram account I never use since I'm new to Reddit &amp; don't know how to add photos (sorry guys, I'm not tech savvy). I've blocked out his username and photo for privacy reasons. 

What should we do? What does his social media mean?

847,"Ok so I started seeing her last year, it was going great then she suddenly went a little cold. After a while she told me we shouldn‚Äôt see each other anymore because she and her friend found out they have feelings for each other and she wants to see where that will go. I said I would‚Äôve liked to spend more time together but I understand. 

We don‚Äôt speak for a semester then all of a sudden she hits me up like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe I made it through sophomore year‚Äù. I sent something back and we got to talking, eventually we schedule and meet up for a date because apparently her and her girlfriend broke up. We had a great time and hooked up at my place. Second date we go to her hometown and it went well but a little less eventful. Then she went to a different state for this internship and I would hit her up every once in a while to banter, flirt, and see how it‚Äôs going. But she seemed to be getting colder and responding less as that went on so I gave her space for a month. 

Then I sent her a text a week after we got back to school and she never responded, so I waited a week again, sent her a snap, she responded, I sent something, she responded again, I sent something again and she left me on read. My instincts are telling me to go no contact for a while, but last time something like this happened I was never left on read, and I was given an explanation as to why when she said she wants to see where things go with her friend.

Im really confused on what path I should take right now, 5 or so of my friends wants to get an apartment together come February-ish. Im total I‚Äôd pay around $700 a month to live in that apartment (taking account everything we need to pay for).

Right now I live with my parents rent free, they talked about me paying rent at some point to help out , but that makes me want to move out even more.

But the problem comes with September, I‚Äôm planning on going to UW next fall, which means more than likely moving out again, should I stay with my parents for another year, save my money, and move out when I go to university. Or should I move out around February for a couple of months and then go to the university and move out a second time. The finances for college is still getting worked through and I have no idea if I‚Äôm even able to afford it.

I'm in school right now but only have class twice a week. Once I'm done with this semester I want to move out of the state and right now in really bad with my money. 

I dont have much of a social life but that's not by choice, I really wish I did. My biggest concern with getting an overnight job was the crippling effect it could have on this but at this point I'm cool just giving up my time to this for a good while until I'm in a better financial place.

At my current job I'll get a max of maybe 20-25 hours per week on average, but it's usually lower.

I'm just not making or saving money. 

So I think the way to go is to get something that goes overnight and has plenty of hours BUT, I should also mention that I worked at a walmart for 2 years and I am without a shadow of a doubt completely unwilling to go back to that.

Anyways most of this was pointless, anyone have experience working overnights?",10Sep2019,1

I‚Äôve been totally supportive of him and even told him I could pay for a lot of the activities during the trip so we could have a fun time. Today was going really good (unlike yesterday), and when I got on the train to go back to my apartment he even said he loved me and that he hopes I have a safe trip home. It was going well until he visited his therapist today. He just said that he had a long stressful talk with his therapist and that he said he wants to talk on the phone tomorrow (we NEVER talk on the phone). I said that it might be better to talk in person on Thursday before our flight, and he said he would rather call.  And when I said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù twice, he didn‚Äôt text it back.

858,"I (23F) have been talking to someone (31M) for a few months now and we hit it off surprisingly well/easily right off the bat. We‚Äôre both in the US, midwest and west coast. We talked all the time every day, obviously not wholly 24/7 because we do have lives but when he‚Äôd knowingly be busy he‚Äôd let me know in advance and then he‚Äôd still make efforts to get back to me a couple times a day at least. We‚Äôve sort of mentioned meeting up sometime, we‚Äôve gotten flirty and gotten well into the realm of sexting, we even glossed over the possibility of us ‚Äúonline dating‚Äù, everything seemed to be going well. 

More recently he‚Äôs pulled away quite a bit (it seems). He doesn‚Äôt tell me in advance when he‚Äôll be busy, he‚Äôll disappear for days at a time and then claim he never got my message(s) and assumed I was busy so didn‚Äôt text again sooner or that he was somewhere with zero service, he won‚Äôt send me pictures anymore unless I ask, etc. I want to believe the best, especially since he does keep coming back, but I‚Äôve been ghosted before and it‚Äôs always around this point where things feel good so I just have this voice in the back of my head telling me that he‚Äôs going to ghost me too. He just doesn‚Äôt seem genuinely actively interested in talking to me anymore.

I just have a sinking feeling that he‚Äôs on the verge of ghosting but either feels bad straight up ghosting or has enough manners not to, but just doesn‚Äôt have the balls to tell me he‚Äôs done with me. I mean people don‚Äôt just flip their behavior like a switch like that? And I don‚Äôt know what to do about it? I feel like no matter how I might address it I‚Äôm just going to sound like a crazy internet wannabe girlfriend because we‚Äôre not officially dating. Further, shortly(ish) after we started talking he asked my intentions and we both agreed we‚Äôre go with the flow type of people. I meant that as in I was ok with whatever direction it was naturally headed (platonic, online fwb, relationship, etc) so long as once headed in that direction we do establish it more clearly. I really really hate ambiguity and not knowing where I stand and right now that‚Äôs exactly how I feel. I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with relationships and dating, even less so with bigger age gaps like this one, so I need advice on how to approach the subject, what to discuss, and so on. 



TLDR; 23F feels 31M is pulling away after spending a few months getting to know one another when it started off really well originally. We initially agreed we‚Äôre both go with the flow people but the ambiguity is really killing me now and I‚Äôd like to address it but I have no idea how or even if it‚Äôs worth doing so.

Academics have always been doing the minimum amount of homework to pass so I could maximize video game time(now it‚Äôs smoke weed and play video games). Every year since like 2nd grade I‚Äôve gotten grounded/yelled at because of bad grades. Literally every year until I found ways to hide grades and avoid conversation about school at all costs. That didn‚Äôt work for long and ended up making the consequences worse after building up lies for 6-12 months when final grades were checked by parents.

I‚Äôm not sure what to feel anymore, I just lie so much to friends and family to avoid them and/or find a way to smoke weed and play video games. Living this lifestyle still managed to barely pass me through high school and obviously is not viable for full time college students. I‚Äôm talking like 3-4 hours a WEEK doing homework and mostly because there is a due date scheduled. Obviously that time needs to be triple or more for a student to be even close to passing classes in college.

We've had issues with the apartment from the beginning, like broken appliances, messed up floors, payment processing issues, and most notably, neighbors. It's not just one set of neighbors, either. Neighbors across the hall fight every night, downstairs neighbors yell across the parking lot to each other and blast music, cars come through at 2AM and park outside playing music so loud it shakes the stuff on our walls. I've filed complaints with the complex at least three times already, but have received zero response. 

It's gotten to the point where my roommate and I are exhausted every day at work. We can't use sound-proof headphones because we sleep through our alarms. And we don't have the money to break our lease and move early. I'm starting to get desperate and just need a way to sleep through the night until I can finally move out.",10Sep2019,3

To cut to the point, I live at home with my mom and today she found a lighter and half a gram of coke in my bag. Yes it's a dumb place to put it, and yes I am very much an idiot. She hasn't confronted me about it yet, but I know she will soon. I am convinced she knows, the baggy is gone and the zip of my bag was left half open.

I have never tried coke before, however had it as I was going to take it to a party, and my main concern is that she's gonna think i will fuck up my life, because I know she will never let me get over it. I have never been caught doing anything else along those lines, so I'm assuming the consequences will be quite severe.

You literally have to be a marine so do this test.
So you‚Äôd think ‚Äúnot really unfair, I mean everyone should‚Äôve gotten the same marks‚Äù
Nah.

Everyone chose their besties, so while I was going super sayain god mode, chubby kid with glasses is getting basically an A+ because his friend is giving him marks easily, like the kid wasn‚Äôt even doing jump squats, he was just bouncing the ball on the floor while bending down and picking it up.

The teachers fully acknowledge the other kids getting easy marks, while I have to have the fitness of a marine.

882,"So I just started my first day of college, and I'm currently in math remedial so I'm only taking 2 college level classes. My first class of the day was my math remedial, it was fine. My second class was Sociology and by God did I find it atrocious. So the professor starts off by telling us about police brutality towards blacks. And asking us if all people are equal (what the fuck?), and talking about ""white privilege"". First time I heard of such despicable nonsense. Apparently white people are privileged, she did not go into this at all and just stated it as it's a fact. And everyone in class room ate it up. What does she mean I'm privileged? Is there evidence for this? If there is what does this mean? All these questions were swimming through my head. And why am I taking a nonsense class? I'm a biology major. 


So we jump into our last class, history. The professor starts talking about native americans and how Europeans conquered the Americas. Everyone in the class ""those Europeans are evil, they took the land of innocent people"" yada yada. The history teacher goes on by saying that this isn't necessarily true. And that native americans were violent themselves and had war and did gruesome stuff. Fine. The class is still so raddled and I couldn't even concentrate on the board.

884,"Hi all,

New to this sub, and need some advice.  My ex bf has 2 twin 4 year olds, and he is a cocaine addict.  He admitted to me that he's had it in his system while in their custody. He is pretty neglectful of them, and while that is concerning, I found out after I broke up with him that his current roommate has served jail time for domestic violence.  My ex and his other roommates have heard him beating his girlfriend upstairs, and he will come home blackout drunk even when the toddlers are there.  One night, they woke up screaming and crying because they were scared. My ex will also leave them unattended for hours at a time naked and alone with this person in the house.  I am very worried. 

This breaks my heart, and I feel seriously inclined to tell their mother because while she's aware of the drug use (she's trying to get full custody), I'm sure she has no idea about this roommate otherwise she probably wouldn't drop them off anymore.  I am concerned for my own wellbeing as my ex got very aggressive and harassed me after the breakup, and I had to block his number.  We live in a small town and so if word got out that I told her, I'm concerned for what he might do to me.  But this is so serious for the children.  

Needless to say, I'm very conflicted and unsure of what to do. It's a very sensitive situation.

885,"Thanks to whoever takes the time to read and respond to this post. I am currently a full-time college student and work a part-time job. About a year ago, I ended a long term relationship after coming to the realization that I'd been slowly isolated and removed from my friends and family over the course of a little over 5 years. My confidence, social skills, and sense of self had completely eroded and its been pretty rough for me but I'm glad to say I've been slowly improving. However, during the first few months after the breakup, I had stopped working for a couple of months and depleted the savings that I had, and when I did go back to work I've only worked just enough to go paycheck to paycheck. I also currently have about $900 dollars in credit card debt that I have accrued over the past few months but I thankfully have 0 interest until 2020. 

Here's my current problem: I don't work enough hours at my current job so I'm looking for a second job to work on weekends, and I had just enough to cover my internet bill until I had to replace a flat tire as of yesterday. My $75 bill is due tomorrow and I have $50 in my account, I've posted a couple of things on Offerup that'll sell for maybe $150 total but probably not selling in time. I don't get my next paycheck until the 20th. My parents can't really afford to lend me money and I owe them $100 for helping buy some things for the apartment I moved into recently. I don't really have any friends that I can ask as I'm not close with any of them and I doubt they'd be able to afford it either. I've looked up some gigs on Craigslist but all of them are either scams or job postings and not one time gigs. I'm not really sure what my options are for paying my bill tomorrow, and I need to last until next Friday. Once I find a second job I think I'll be able to get back up on my feet.

Details:
So the student parking lot for his school is under construction, so every student, even ones that paid for a parking pass, have to find street parking or pay for off-campus lots. Basically, it‚Äôs been crazy because there is no parking for the students and people are fighting for parking. My bf one day couldn‚Äôt find parking for class, so he broke a ‚ÄúFire Lane No Parking‚Äù sign so he and his classmates could park and make it to class after work. This was in the under construction lot that is technically blocked off (so even if there was a fire, I don‚Äôt think the fire truck could park there but idk much about fire lanes). I‚Äôm by no means saying his actions were justified, just explaining the events/his thought process leading up to that moment. He was notified that he had meetings with the school board AND his union board a couple days ago because of this. Then, yesterday, he arrived on campus for class and noticed there were police vehicles parked on campus. He freaked out and didn‚Äôt go to class because he thought he might get arrested.  

So my question I guess, is could he actually be arrested for it? What could happen? And what could he say in the meetings that might help him?

I've had a crush on a girl for a really long while now, and I really like her personality and just talking to her in general. I've known her for about 4 years now, and we have gotten to be pretty good friends. I have never really experienced a ""real"" date, and I literally could not be newer to dating, but I figured I'd take my chances and ask her out, to get to know her more. I was planning on asking her out on Wednesday, however on Monday, one of my Best Friends (while we were playing Truth or Dare) confessed he had a crush on the same girl. (He was an old friend of mine from another city, and recently move to my city about a year ago, and he did not know that I had a crush on this girl.) He has been dating, ever since 8th grade, so about 4 years now, and left bitter-sweet ties with the majority of his ex-girlfriends, including one that now hates just about everyone in our friend group. In his defense, all of his breakups were definitely not his fault, and I in no way dislike my friend, but this leads me to my dilemma. I really care for this girl, and I want to get to know her more, but I also don't want to catch my friend off guard or do anything mean, because my best friend has always been there for me, and I really admire and appreciate him. If I stepped back and let him date my crush, and didn't say anything, I honestly and truthfully don't know if I could watch, and if he did break up with her, I think there's a decent chance that ties would be cut between them, or at least tainted.

906,"I'm a guy in my mid-20s, with no college degree, no friends, and no job skills. I struggle with pretty crippling depression and social anxiety, both of which have held me back in a lot of ways. For the past two years, I've worked for Instacart, which is, if you haven't heard of it, essentially like Uber, but for grocery shopping. I love pretty much everything about the job. But what I didn't realize until fairly recently is that I need commercial car insurance to do the job (which is something that Instacart never explained when I signed up).

So now I'm paying four-times what I used to for my car insurance. Before figuring out that I needed to switch insurance plans, I was fairly happy with my income - I wasn't earning enough to rent out my own place (I'm still living with my parents), but I was earning more than I ever did in retail. Now that I'm on a commercial plan though, I'm really struggling financially. 

So I need to start looking for a new job - ideally, I'd like to find something that pays better than Instacart (because I'd love to get my own apartment someday). But at the very least, I need to find something that doesn't require commercial car insurance.

I've done some community college classes and really wanted to go back to school this semester (even though I don't know what I would major in), but right now, my depression is too severe. I'm not ruling college out for the future (especially because I've always loved academics and am really sad that higher education has never worked out for me), but this just isn't the time.

Does anyone have any job recommendations? I'm a pretty incompetent person, so moving on from Instacart to something else feels overwhelming (I had other jobs before Instacart and was miserable in them). One of the best things about my current job is how independent it is. Not having a boss or any co-workers can be lonely at times, but it's great for my social anxiety. On top of that, Instacart is just really easy - before I started working for Instacart, I thought that there wasn't any such thing as an easy job, but the actual day-to-day requirements of doing Instacart aren't hard at all.

In fact, Instacart can even be kind of fun sometimes. I'd be very happy staying in this job for the rest of my life, if only it paid a little bit better. 
 
My least favorite thing about working in retail was the repetitiveness of it. Shopping for groceries all day can certainly still be repetitive in its own right, but it's a lot more mentally engaging than straightening shelves or working a cash register - and Instacart sends me to all kinds of different stores throughout the day, which allows for some welcome changes of scenery. 

Even if I were to settle for a job that pays the same as what I'm making with Instacart, I doubt that I'll ever find an alternative entry-level job that I enjoy as much as what I'm doing now. Instacart offers a very rare balance between ""extremely easy"" and ""mentally engaging"".

I feel like I've already thought through all of my options, and nothing seems like a good fit for me. But I figured I'd ask here, just in case there's something I haven't considered.

Thanks to anyone who's bothered to read through all of this! I know it's super long, haha. And let me know if you have any advice! :)",10Sep2019,0
908,"Some background: My girlfriend has had depression for most of her life and has medication for it, and is currently going to suicide therapy weekly (since February). Her depression every year suddenly gets worse on September first and she had no will to live this entire month, then goes back to normal on October 1st. She is full of self hate and low self esteem and feels like a constant burden. She never asked for anything and doesn‚Äôt complain about anything. And it is extremely tough on her to ask for anything, even a hug when we are together. 

With this in mind, I‚Äôm going to get going with what happened. I love to give my girlfriend attention, I actively seek out any way of giving her attention cause I just love giving her attention, and she loves attention too (still struggles to ask for attention). I always say you can ask me for attention whenever you want and I‚Äôll give it to you, and she‚Äôs reluctant at first, but she‚Äôs slowly opened up to it and has been asking me for attention more and more and I‚Äôve Ben really happy about it. However, for the past week or so, (since September began) she‚Äôs been more hidden, makes sense cause it‚Äôs September. She hasn‚Äôt been paying as much attention to me and has even been ignoring me when we‚Äôre together, but talks to me when she wants attention. Which at first I was ok with, telling myself she‚Äôs not doing this on purpose or it‚Äôll pass and all. But it‚Äôs taken it‚Äôs toll and I felt almost neglected and even used by her cause she‚Äôs been ignoring me until she wants attention then doesn‚Äôt give me any attention after I give her attention. 

She slowly picked up that something was bothering me. And after a while I decided to tell her how I felt cause she really wanted to know. After telling her how I‚Äôve felt for a while she completely shut down and lost herself in her depression. She didn‚Äôt mean to do any of it and she felt really bad for it and entered one of her depression episodes.  Here‚Äôs a part of a text she sent me about 20 hours after she entered her episode that sunrises how she felt. 

I‚Äôm a horrible girlfriend, I‚Äôm to selfish and don‚Äôt pay attention to my you I ask too much. They‚Äôre right I am an attention seeking bitch, I do only care about myself. I‚Äôm failing OP he deserves some who‚Äôs going to pay attention when he needs attention. I know I don‚Äôt deserve him and it hurts when he says things like he did today. I know I asked him to tell me and I wanted him to but it just really hurts because it makes me believe that all the self doubts and flaws are true. 

Now after telling her I feel even worse because it caused so much pain for her. She entered a depression episode where she completely forgets where she is, who she is and just wants to die. She sits there and rocks back and forth scratching her arm for hours telling herself to die or that ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok‚Äù and it made it that much harder for her to be open to me and ask me for things like attention and love. 

I‚Äôm lost and just need help on how to let her know that I‚Äôm sorry and I want her to ask for my attention and love again and that it‚Äôs ok to ask things from me.

All of which he was notified of and we agreed to move in with all damages present as we just desperately needed a roof over our heads.
If I can't recover the photos from move-in on my old phone do we have any hope of winning a court case against him with the photos of the home in its condition when we left?

910,"I just got a free Galaxy s10 plus from my parents. They got it for free from their carrier. I was using a Galaxy S7 Edge prior and the thing was really slow and battery life sucked after almost 4 years of heavy use. I've been using the s10 plus for a few days now and I really do love it. It has great battery life and the speed is so refreshing to what I was used to.

However I came across some listings of phones and was comparing the prices of many. I could sell this phone for at the very least $700. It is a low estimate since the phone is the 512GB variant. I've gotten my parent's okay on this, so it's all up to me now.

I'm only $18 so this amount of money is a lot for me. I have around $5000 saved up so this is close to 1/5 of that. I'm not sure what I want to do with my money. I've always wanted to buy my dream car so this definitely will help towards that but I'd really like to keep this phone too. I don't work as of now and never have which is why I value everything so much. If I do keep the phone it'll just be like the last one, where I'd use it for at least 3 years. So it wouldn't be wasted but I can't help but to wonder if selling it now before the value plummets is the better idea.",10Sep2019,1
911,"I work night shifts only at a hotel, just another normal day getting ready for work, got my stuff and all and went to my car to leave the house.

As i get in the car i see through the front glass,one of my kittens in the middle of the street.

I hoped it was sleeping but time is too short to hope, couldn't be positive this time.

Got out of the car shouting and crying,to find my little angel lying dead with his head smashed on the hard surface of the road..

I felt like my heart met my stomach, didn't know what to do, i had to go to work.. got in the house told my dad as fast as i could, he came outside.. and i told him to take him off of the road, atleast for now until i get off work and bury him.

I live in a small town and an even smaller neighborhood, i have 12 cats, they are my end and my beginning.

My house is right on a turn of the road, the road is so small and short, you can barely drive imagine going fast.
Motherfuckers run like 70km/h on the fucking turn in a fucking neighborhood not even a main street.

I just can't stand this.
I want to kill everyone at my neighborhood
They are all so fucked up people.
There is a guy whose house is like 100m away from me and he poisons and kills cats, mentally retarded cunt
His son and daughter are cops and they cover him, shame on them
Can't do anything to him legally or something because he got his ass covered the only thing i can do is take his life away like they do to these angels.
I want to grab their hearts bare handed and put them in their fucking mouth and shove it down their fucked up throat.

I just can't believe i raised my 3 month angel with his siblings...
Feeding them, playing with them, having fun with them, making life beautiful for them, watching their mom breastfeeding them, growing them. 

Just to have a monster take away his innocent life in a matter of seconds.
It's so UNFAIR üò¢üò¢ AND RIDICULOUS

They act as if they're the only person in the world who suffers and make no effort whatsoever to connect with and have empathy towards those in their life. 

When you live with one of those people all you can feel is ashamed and like a burden. There's no space to talk or vent or make sense of your own feelings and it's just so very suffocating to exist around them.

Sometimes one of those people is your elder and refuses to take your opinions and emotions seriously.

I met this 17-year old friend (his name is Sam) when I was a junior and he was a freshman. We played Tennis together (he was my doubles partner at one point) and we have been friends since then. We play video games together, hike together, go out to eat together, and we both consider each other pretty close. He comes to me for advice about high school (he's currently a senior, while I'm in my second year at college) and just how to get through it without losing his mind.

She leaves my little brother (5) with poop in his underwear when she watches him because she doesn't want to have to clean him, she hardly feeds him properly, she leaves him to do as he pleases, which has led to a few things getting broken, and when confronted she just screams about how awful I am. I've begun missing days at work because I can't rely on her and I can't afford a babysitter. I just don't even know what to do anymore, and to top it off I accidentally got pregnant so now I'm having a baby with a guy I've known a couple years (I know him well/ not just an acquaintance), but never really dated.

922,"So I recently moved home about a month ago after graduating from college in May. I spent my summer in my college town working a barista job and mostly having fun. Now that I have been back I have really been searching for a job (mostly ""big girl jobs"") and there aren't many in my field of interest/within my experience level in my hometown. I want to move to a bigger city in my state, but it is so expensive right now, especially considering I don't have any job prospects here or there. This is the first time in my life I haven't returned to a new school year in the fall and it is really weighing on me. I feel lost and like I am failing myself. I am so thankful to have parents that accepted me back into their home, rent-free, which is amazing. However, they are pushing me (as they should) to find a job or something to do rather than spending my days in their basement withering away, and I agree with them but it is so HARD!

I know a lot of job searching and opportunities happen through networking and connections, but I feel just so discouraged right now. I know I will have to work a barista or server job again for the time being, but it is so hard because I spent four years expecting to end up with a career. I guess that is my main problem, I should limit my expectations for now :/

Most people from college either found jobs right after graduation, or are pursuing grad school. I think I might go back to school, but I don't want to put in another two years to end up again where I am now. If you've dealt with the post-grad life scaries how did you get through it?",10Sep2019,1

924,"I love my son but his autism is extremely challenging. Lately I have been feeling bitter about my life has become.

His stimming is OUT OF CONTROL. He is constantly making loud noises/screaming, banging his hands together, running/flailing around and just cannot keep his body still. He can‚Äôt even use the bathroom without stimming to the point that urine ends up all over the toilet, floor and wall. His noises/screams are deafening and nearly constant. A home is supposed to be your sanctuary but mine is the opposite. The best part of my day is being at work. A few times I have cried on my way to pick up my son from his day services. 

I have tried to talk to my husband about my feelings and how I don‚Äôt know if I can keep having our son live here. He basically shamed me. He said that it is immoral for a mother to want to ‚Äúsend her child away for someone else to deal with‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even sure if there are group homes for children his age or if he would qualify. Maybe it‚Äôs a complete overreaction to think about that.

I just can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I gave up my dream career because it was not compatible with raising an autistic child. Our marriage is deteriorating because my husband doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the challenging part of things so it all falls on me. We don‚Äôt have sex anymore because our son cannot be left alone and is always loud. By the time he‚Äôs asleep, I am exhausted and not in the mood. We haven‚Äôt been able to find someone willing to babysit in awhile. Not even our parents want to. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we had a date night. Having our son has changed us both and he‚Äôs not the man I married anymore. Divorce is basically inevitable. Split custody seems like the only way I might get a break.

I know where she lives and where she goes to class (through completely non-creepy methods, if you're wondering. I happened upon the information amid conversation), but I'm pretty sure just popping up somewhere along her daily schedule would be iffy. I know she has social media accounts, but she's never online lately. I see her in passing about twice a year or so, but it's going to be a good while before that happens again.

Side note: I also have her personal email, but this is not an option, because I ***didn't*** obtain it through legitimate means. I overheard her reading it out to someone else a while ago, and I accidentally memorized it. I'd rather not pop up unwelcomed in her inbox.

All of this is inevitably going to sound a little off-putting, since I have to point out the creepy side of the coin, but that's exactly what I'm trying to get advice on. What isn't okay? Have I already crossed that line in any way?",10Sep2019,2
928,"Him and me have been best friends since we were like 9-10, hung out 3 to 4 times a week, did basically everything together for so long. Im twenty six now and hes a year younger. So we have quite a history. Hes like my brother, I cherish our friendship more than anything. I feel like hes the one person who actually gets me. Hes also the last real, true friend I have. Im a very sensitive person and very particular in who I want to be friends with. I dont want a bunch of wishy washy friends, I need a strong close friendship or else it doesnt really mean much to me. 

The three people I was most close to was him, my other friend and my dad. I could tell all three of them anything without feeling judged, like I said Im very sensitive (I just put up a front a lot) so its hard for me open up to most people. So those three meant a lot to me. Unfortunately my father passed away suddenly from a heart attack, I didnt even get to say goodbye or anything. I loved him so much and miss him everyday still. My other bestfriend decided he was gonna move to another country, I slowly tried to distance myself from him so I wouldnt hurt so bad once he left. Ive kind of latched onto my best friend I have now, since everyone else Ive trusted the most is gone, hes basically all I have left, and this past year and a half hes started dating... 

At first it wasnt so bad. We still talked and played a lot on our pcs, hung out a lot during the week, but slowly hes stopped talking to me and hanging out more and more as the past year has gone by. Hes going to school now too, so like I get it. I understand he needs his time for his relationship and school. The thing is now we hardly talk like we used to. He still plays his pc a lot but he never wants to play or talk with me anymore on it. We play a lot of the same games too so I see him on them all the time but whenever I ask he doesnt want to. Yet he'll talk with our other friends when they ask no problem... Just usually a no for me. Even if he says yes, he just wants to play and not talk, compared to when we would talk and play all the time. I thought maybe I wasnt being engaging enough in conversations so Ive been trying to work on it by talking more and just being more open and social, but it not enough? Despite all that, Ive taken it all in stride because he still hang out a decent amount. I would usually stay over for a night twice a week but now hes telling me I cant stay over anymore and that we can only chill for like 4 hours. Compared to a couple weeks ago when I would stay over for the night no problem, we would stay up till like 6 in the morning. He started school now tho so I know he cant chill that much, he only gets two days off. I figured I could just stay over once a week and that would be fine, but he doesnt even want to do that. He just wants to hang out for four hours once a week. Ive already felt like hes distancing himself a lot this past year but now its gotten to this point. Hes my bestfriend and barely wants to do anything with me anymore, hes the last person I have that I really trust and I feel like Im gonna lose him too. The thing is he tells me he cant hang out with me as much, but then makes so much more an effort and takes time for his relationship. I understand that he needs time for it. I really do. Its just sucks when he'll go hang out with them for the day and night(like we used to all the time)on his day other day off, and then tells me he doesnt want to on his other day off because either, he doesnt want to screw up his sleep schedule, he has homework, or we wants to play video games. Its like, he'll give me these excuses to not chill but then does everything Im asking for with his gf. I have no problem admitting Im jealous, its only natural after being such good friends for so long. 

Hes always tried telling me he doesnt date, or tried assuring me theyre just friends, i assume he means friends with benefits. The thing is I never believed that, neither has anybody else I asked about it. So like, how could you treat your best friend of over 15 years worse than a girl you dont even want to tell other people your dating? It just doesnt make sense to me and really breaks my heart. I feel like I have no one now and he doesnt give a shit about me anymore. The one person I cherish the most barely cares about me. Im honestly crushed. I tell him how I feel, and he just tells me Im being crazy or that my mind is fucked... its only since he started dating that hes started talking to me like too. He used to be so nice to me. Its like hes not even the same person... I dont really have anyone to tell, so I have to come to reddit just to get this all out. This feeling just hurts so bad, knowing Im slowly by slowly losing my best friend. Im so upset and hurting and I have no one to help me. I feel like Ive been alone my whole life, to lose him is just too much... Any advice and encouraging words would really help me rn.",10Sep2019,1

933,"Hello, I‚Äôm an 18 year old male, and my mom back in May made me install life360, which if you don‚Äôt know is a tracking app. The problem is is that I‚Äôve always been an introverted shut in, even now in my freshman year in college I‚Äôve just been in my dorm watching anime, or going to classes and doing homework. I haven‚Äôt even made a single friend yet. So I really don‚Äôt go outside or get into trouble at all. Anyways, in May it was my second time hanging out with my friends from school, yes second time during my whole high school career.  While I was with my friends my mom called me, obviously nervous and asked me to install the app, I did without realizing what exactly it is. Well anyways through summer I didn‚Äôt go outside and it quickly left my memory. During late August my friends asked me to hang out as some sort of a last goodbye, so I went to my friends house, and later at Denny‚Äôs in 3 in the morning. I initially didn‚Äôt want to go, and my parents didn‚Äôt want me to go either, and I told my friends that my parents didn‚Äôt want me to go but they ended up coming anyways. While they were driving to my house, my parents were freaking out, asking me if my parents could pick me up after, if there was going to be any alcohol, if they were good drivers etc.. anyways the whole time they were tracking me on my phone. I told my friends this and they told my to uninstall the app because it‚Äôs a clear violation of privacy.  I said I‚Äôd do it when I started college, which would save me from having to argue in person, and I did uninstall the app.

Fast forward to today when my mom texted me asking me if I still had the app installed, I said no, and now she and my dad are freaking out. I keep repeating the same thing that I Don‚Äôt get into trouble or go outside etc, but they just won‚Äôt listen. I told them that there is no danger at my particular campus, I‚Äôm in a college town with low crime rates and not near a large city, but they keep falling for media fear mongering, that I‚Äôm going to get killed or something. Anyways now my dad is going to try and force me to get a job and start paying for tuition, even though they really forced me into college and I couldn‚Äôt possibly pay for it, or even have time to get a job. I feel like a broken record, that I‚Äôm an adult and I‚Äôve always been safe, never gotten into trouble, I don‚Äôt hike alone at night or go down dark alleys (even though there are no dark alleyways where I am at) but they just won‚Äôt listen. They are very stubborn, how in gods name can I set this boundary? I was planning to go back home this weekend because I forgot my belt, but I really don‚Äôt want to anymore. All of my friends agree, hell even reddit agrees if you look at the top rated posts on r/insaneparents from the past few days that this is a clear violation of boundaries. I‚Äôm a very easy going person, and to have boundaries is very rare for me. But I need to put my foot down and tell them to stop. I have plenty of proof of this happening if you need it, or if you need to see what they are saying, so just ask and I‚Äôll pm you or something.

Point of the story is that the vehicle in question was written off and insurance is giving them next to nothing for the car. My parents are by no means able to afford a new car as a result of the diminishing oil and gas economy and on top of that, my step-dad hasn't had a job since 2009. The car was worth more as it was on the road then the paper value and it's really stressful to see my parents in this position. They were hit pretty well and both of them got whiplash. My mother had already had a pre-existing back problem from many years ago as a result of a herniated disk and this, of course, aggravated it. I guess the only real question I'm asking is what can you do to get more value for the car and what the best course of action is on the personal injury settlement so they can avoid being lowballed.",10Sep2019,1
937,"Hello everyone 

Ive been going to this counselor, lets call her Lindsay. I was introduced to her through counseling network thats implimented at my university. I initially called their hotline over personal issue and was connected to her. 

Ive been seeing her over four sessions past month and half. It helped in the beginning first. But im questioning where the therapy session is going, and what exact goals are. 

I asked this to her before leaving the counseling last time, and didnt get any exact answer from her. But im finding out from my friends that their counselor sets goals together. 

Is her vagueness out of purpose? Im not knowledgeable in psychology, or has attended any therapy sessions before. The university is covering the cost so far, and i mentioned to her the 2000 dollar victim services credit before. Im unsure if she has a set goal for me, or just wanting me to keep coming back for money. I sent her an email today if she has any goals for me based on previous sessions. She havent responded so far. 

What should I expect? I already told many personal histories to Lindsay and wouldnt preferred to find another counselor, though i would if it is necessary.",10Sep2019,1
938,"I did a pap smear at a small clinic and the male nurse who did it was rolling his eyes at me, talking shit about me and acting very annoyed by me. When he finally did it, it was the most aggressive pap smear I've ever had in my life and the equipment was drenched in blood after he stuck it inside me. He even went to switch out the equipment at the last minute and brought another tool in to use in me without opening a new package in front of me. Should I be worried about this causing an infection or long term problems?",10Sep2019,2
939,"I am a boy and I am in high school . Before I went through puberty, I could be friends with anyone. While I was going through puberty, I was also starting middle school. Since there were a bunch of people that I didn‚Äôt know, I became more shy when talking to others. This mixed with me going through puberty made me really shy when I talked to girls. Because of this I  forgot how to become friends with girls. Now that I am no longer going through puberty, I don‚Äôt feel shy anymore when I talk to others, but  I still don‚Äôt know how to be friends with girls. This didn‚Äôt bother me because I didn‚Äôt really need more friends since I always had 3 or four friends in all of my classes. But this year I have no friends in most of my classes, most of the people around me are girls, I would change seats but they are assigned so I have no other choice. I have to make friends or I will be bored out of my mind and everyone will think I‚Äôm shy. Any advice on what to do?",10Sep2019,1

942,"We both have different schedules and he hasn't been reaching out. He's been hanging around other people more. I know he doesn't hate me. I told hims this last semester and he told me that just because he hangs out with other people doesn't mean he doesn't love me anymore. I understand that sometimes this happens were people just drift apart but, if I'm being honest, I don't want that to happen. I want to continue to be his friend and be in his life but I also don't want to be the one to always reach out.

Any advice on how I can navigate this. And, if my feeling of us drifting apart is correct, how I can be okay with all this?",10Sep2019,1
