1,"Howdy y’all! I have a (as my possible employer called it) “mini-interview” tomorrow for my first ever job. I’m an 18 year old and my last day of high school was last Friday. I applied to be a delivery driver for a large pizza chain, and I was wondering if you guys had any advice for me. I have no idea what I should bring with me, what I should wear, or what I should even prepare for in terms of questions she may have. Anything would help as I am quite clueless right now. Thanks for your time!",23May2019,3
2,"I am going to start this post stating that I suffer from depression and hold on to guilty.

I have been in a relationship with someone that I would call my best friend for the past four years. After a year of dating he started staying out all night with his friends and I started to feel ignored. One night I started to talk to a person that I had a previous ""friend with benefits"" relationship. Things lead to me not only cheating on him but also confession to my boyfriend that I had cheated. I thought that he was going to leave me but he did not. I stopped the relationship with the other guy a d stayed with my boyfriend. As time went on I became more depressed due to lack of financial support coming from my boyfriend. This past Christmas I had kicked him out for the 2nd time. During that time I connected with the same guy in which I had cheated. I felt guilty for leaving my boyfriend and living him financially unstable. Once again I had resumed the relationship with my boyfriend and kicking the other guy to the curb. 

Two weeks ago I had confronted my boyfriend about money and it lead to a fight. This was the first time that he was physically abusive with me. I feel like I deserve this and that I am being punished for the actions of my past. In addition, he not only quit his job but was fired and is currently unemployed. We only fight about money and now I am in the position of taking care of all over the financial responsibilities.

I know this is a ""poor me"" type of post but I need to know. Would you beat your girlfriend? Am I stupid for staying with him?",23May2019,1
3,"I’m just finishing my first year at western Washington university trying to study design, but I’m having to do all the general education requirements before I can start studying what I really want to do.

I’m so tired of taking lecture classes about shit that doesn’t interest me, I know exactly what I want to do. My dream is to work in video game design and do concept art or something along the lines of that, but to do that I need to go to a art school not out of state to even be close to affordable.

6,"  Im no social butterfly to put it bluntly, Im not good with people or talking in general. Whenever I try to talk or articulate myself in any way it feels wrong. Anxiety is part of the problem, but every time I try to put myself out there and try and overcome it in a way, it never turns out well. Recently I’ve made some new friends and it’s been going alright for the most part, though I can definitely tell Im becoming a nuisance. Sometimes there just isn’t anything to say and when I talk, its almost unbearable to stay in the conversation because it clearly isn’t interesting or entertaining. I know Im not trying to hard because that point was eventually crossed.  There is a possibility I may have a speech impediment  actually, I tend to stumble in words much a lot. Family isn’t much different, Im not that close to them, Conversation with them isn’t  too good, and they’re the “Once you’re 18 get out of my house” type which I don’t mind, but makes me incredibly anxious when thinking about my future. Among the other things, emotional sensitivity is also a problem, little things from scoldings, lectures or even criticism brings me close to tears and make me existential. I’ve seen a therapist though I can’t say it has helped too much.

9,"So I haven't moved into this house yet nor has a deal been made. He started to talk about the pricing of the house and pros and cons about it. The backyard is an absolute mess. There's a lot of garbage and the rooms inside are cluttered with knickknacks and old stuff. He's been using the place as storage or something. The landlord is a friend of mine he says that if I help clean and move stuff out I can move in within a month. 

Out of the kindness of my own heart I helped clean everything including the backyard. I even helped him clean the garage. The house is practically spotless now.

As we were talking about pricing he whips out the ridiculous (at least to me as an 18 yr old college student) $1350 a month utilities included. Needless to say my jaw dropped at the amount. He said that it was a three bedroom house so in the end it would come to $450 each every month. After crunching numbers I did conclude I could afford it without killing myself too much.

I ask what I can use. He said that the garage and two sheds in the backyard are off limits. I knew exactly why, but I didn't know if that was exactly legal. 

I tried to educate myself more on real estate law and renters rights. There was a certain thing that I saw in the calculations. Is the renter responsible for paying off the mortgage of the house and obligated to pay for home insurance? Is it legal for the landlord to use the place as storage when there is a tenant living there?",23May2019,3
10,"I just had a minor procedure and was prescribed more Oxycodone than I will need.  My significant other struggled with additiction to opioids in the past, but I wasn't concerned about them around it because I trust them.  My significant other was updating their parent with my status and they talked about the meds I was prescribed. After, it was mentioned to me that said parent would like the extra Oxy.  I was kind of shocked that I would be asked at all, but like within 2 days of surgery?  I had at least 2 weeks of recovery ahead.  I was immediately uncomfortable with this idea because I tend to worry and didn't want anything negative to come out of this for my sig other or the parent.  I have never been in a situation where someone actually wanted extra pain meds. I personally hate the meds and feel terrible on it, so I just simply don't understand.  I don't feel comfortable with giving the extra to anyone and would prefer it was out of my house after I recover (I don't want to be responsible for something happening to someone on it).  I don't know if I'm overreacting.  I am not looking for someone on Reddit to change my mind. I am asking for advice and enlightenment. Is this a normal request?  Am I making a big deal of this?

12,"I am 20 years old, I have saved about $20,000 over the past 4 years. The last time I was in public school was when I was 13 years old. I was homeschooled for 3 years and then officially dropped out at 16. I received my GED and have been working a small job. I’ve lived in the same small town (under 3,000 people) all my life. 

I took college placement exams and have the opportunity to enroll in a limited access major and eventually, with enough time and work, go to medical school which is the only thing I could ever see myself going to college for. However, for the past 5+ years, I have been very depressed. I have no good relationships and I am full of anxiety over the smallest things constantly. 

Right now, I have two choices. 

Option 1 : Commit to college, dive into the pre-med school curriculum, work my ass off and hope for the best. This is a little daunting considering my current state of mind and I’m worried it’s not the right choice for me altogether.

Option 2: Take my savings, move to a completely new place, larger town/city with a job lined up and try to give myself a fresh start, gain some more life experience and build relationships while living the simpler life.

I spent the last semester completely freaking out and angry all the time, trying to get something locked down for this summer in NYC or DC, which is where, as an Econ and International Relations dual major, most jobs in my fields are. However, I gained nothing from it. I applied to at least 50 job posts, ranging from sales and logistics, to market analyst and PR positions. From the vast majority, I never even heard back. Of the ones I heard back from, at least 20 were rejections. I ended up with 4 interviews, and nothing panned out. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have added at least 100 people on linkedin asking to chat about a position in the past month, and have heard back from maybe 20, and most read my message and never answer. I have updated and re-updated my resume, written 50 cover letters, networked, reached out to people by email, and nothing.

14,"We’ve been together for 9 months minus the 2 days I broke up with him, until I foolishly took him back after promising to change (he didn’t). I want to make it clear that I don’t want to leave him because he has done anything to me. He is very sweet to me and has made me feel loved and respecting during our time together. My problem is his treatment of and around others. He makes dark jokes which is not really bad, except for the times he makes racist jokes that sometimes don’t even sound like jokes. He also has no idea what an inside voice is, especially around his friends. Sometimes he plays earrape at full volume on his chrome book, other times he takes out a kazoo and plays it very loudly. Even though we’re in high school nobody ever thinks it’s funny other than his friends, people just get annoyed at yell at all of us, even though he’s the only one doing it. It’s embarrassing being around him sometimes. He also never does any work at all, claiming that school is bullshit and it’s unfair that we need a diploma to be successful in life. (I’m aware not all people need that, but he doesn’t have the kind of intelligence or entrepreneurship to make it without one). I’ve voiced these concerns to him and he just shrugs it off or bullshits his way into getting me to think he’ll change his behavior, and me being the doormat I am, I do. The concern just keeps piling up and I’m sick of it. It’s clear he won’t change and I’m ready to move on. Only problem is, when I think about ending it with him I feel like a jerk since he hasn’t done anything to me.

My mom decided to intervene and ruin it by forcing me to break up with him because he wasn’t boyfriend material, because of his autism. If I didn’t I would be allowed to ever see him and it didn’t help the fact that neither of us could drive yet. We broke up, equally upset, but still talked.

My “Manager” was tasked with going through the security cameras and sending screenshots to the district manager. I got caught lounging around, because I had already finished my daily tasks and there is absolutely NOTHING TO DO, and he sends a screenshot and looks at me and says, “I’m sending this so he can stop yelling at me for you guys not doing your job”.

I swear, this kid HATES the district manager as much as the rest of us, and once the district manager starts yelling at him, he starts becoming just like the district manager.

42,"So my boyfriend (20) been best friends with someone I’ll call Mark (20) since they were both 5. From my prospective the friendships always seemed pretty average and normal although I did feel they were especially close. Once Mark went to college he started really getting into drinking and smoking as most college kids do. Last summer Mark asked to order a few shot glasses to my boyfriends house since his family would flip out on him. My boyfriend agreed since this was not the first time his friend did this.

He kept them at his house over the summer and then one night Mark stayed at my boyfriends house. The next morning Mark looked in the drawer where my boyfriend had stored the glasses saying they weren’t there.I myself saw them in that drawer many times and we are the only people in the room other than Mark.

They searched for it and did not find it. My boyfriend asked me if I had misplaced it or moved it and I said no, but I did see it in that drawer only a few nights before.Mark asked my boyfriend to compensate him for the item that was “lost” The shot glasses only costed $40 but I still disagreed that my boyfriend should pay him.

I had my suspicions that Mark had taken them, likely to enjoy them with his new college roommate who he had become especially close to during his freshman year. Also during that summer he cancelled plans with my boyfriend to see his roommate more than once, under seemingly suspicious circumstances. After this incident we were very upset that there was ZERO explanation for the lost items.

I told my boyfriend he should confront him and not pay him the money as it was Marks own fault for ordering the items there in the first place. I also said there was no other explanation and maybe his friend was growing out of him. (Mind you of course Mark still continued and continues to be his best friend, acting the same way) For a few weeks my bf beat around the bush trying to hint at the fact that he knew it was Mark himself who took it. But for weeks Mark kept asking for the $40 until my boyfriend finally gave in.

It took my boyfriend 10 months to finally confront him and when he did Mark simply said no and denied taking it. My boyfriend put the matter to rest and I can understand why. It’s been his best friend for years and I get that he doesn’t want to accept his behavior as wrong as I might see it.

I’m not normally one to complain, but I’ve held this in for so long and feel extremely frustrated. 

   I’m currently studying Architecture, which is a really good program to be in and promises a well paying career. However, it’s also a 5 year program, which means 5 years of expenses. I was pretty lucky, as I got a scholarship from the state that covers a good deal of my tuition for the first year. However, I only feel even more trapped and pressured to succeed, now. The reason I was able to go to school here is because of the support from my family. If there’s anything I couldn’t stand, it would be letting them down. My parents grew up in tough situations and have worked very hard to be able to give us a good life. Since they didn’t want me to face those same difficulties, they insisted that I get an education to make my life a little easier.

   I feel so lost and unsure of my future. I know that if I can work hard and stick it out, I will have a useful degree that will lead to a good paying job. This is really the only option that I feel is available to me right now. If I were to drop out of this program, it’s likely that I would never be able to get back in. I don’t want to do something that I may potentially regret later on in life because of a short sighted decision. I hardly know anything about who I am or who I want to be, I have no real interests, and don’t feel passionate about anything. I have trouble envisioning myself following this path, but what else could I possibly do?

   I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but my mental health has really taken a turn for the worse this year. As a result, my grades have suffered the consequences. For your reference, this is coming from someone who did fairly well in High School. My poor academic performance has had a further effect on my sanity, making me feel more useless than I already believed myself to be. My grades were the only real “achievement” that I had. Now, I have no redeeming qualities. As I fall farther into the pit of self loathing, I find myself saying things like “I don’t deserve to be here”, “you’re a worthless piece of trash, X”,  and “how did a dumbass like you even get here? Surely they must have made a mistake in admitting you”.

   At this point, I’m at a loss as to what I should do. Although I want to drop out, I’m too ashamed and would be terrified of disappointing my family. Even if other possibilities exist, would I be disciplined enough to follow through? Part of me feels that the reason I’m struggling is simply because I’m too lazy, uncreative, and unintelligent enough to do well. I feel like I’m a burden on the people around me and don’t know what to do. Please help me.",23May2019,1

I never get into arguments because of them, like, I definitely come off as a coward just to avoid any sort of confrontation or conflict. Well, for the first time since I can remember, my mom apologized to me for getting angry. I'm going to be real, I don't want to accept it. However, I worry that I can come off as ungrateful already because of the distance drawn between both my mom and I... I don't know if I should just swallow my pride or...? I almost feel like if I do accept it, I'm giving in to accepting all the other negative behaviors characteristic of my mom (and my family for that matter) because she FOR ONCE apologized. Her apology wasn't that great because it was clear she's feigning obliviousness to all the other times she and the rest of the family have lost their cool over absolutely nothing (though, I understand she obviously has no one to apologize for except herself).

50,"I had a good part time job at a fast food chain to help with college. Not much pay but enough for car insurance, gas, and meals to cook. I’ve been sick for about a week now, and I call my job, tell them I have strep throat and a virus. They said alright, bring a doctors note next time you work. I said okay. 

They proceed to spam call me for twenty minutes and when I pick up, they demand me that I bring that note right now. I tell them no as I’m bed ridden, throwing up, and will not be going anywhere. They said I am forced to come in unless I bring that note. At this point with my throat burning and my head killing I say, I’m not bringing a note in cause I quit. 
They had been mistreating me for a while but I swallowed it and stayed as the money was good and I had no where else. But this was the cherry on top as I never ever have called in. 


I quit my job with no plan, no back ups, nothing. I am so fucked and so depressed lately that this feels like another dip. I only have $600 in savings and I’ve job hunted all day to no luck. 
I don’t think I am suicidal but lately all I’ve wanted to do is sleep and when I’m awake I feel mind numb and I’m slacking in my classes already, so this is a major set back. I don’t even have motivation to fix it. I’m so lost.

53,"Hello all, I have a pretty good friend of mine who was going through a rough time about a year ago or so, he got fired from his job and couln't find a new one after months of searching. After a while he was helping us move out of our apartment and talking about his unemployment when he asks me if I can get him a job where I work. I work at a Lumber Company as a Truck Driver and we had been looking for a guy to clean up the yard and pull small orders for walk-ins. I was hesitant but I knew he needed help so I talked to my boss and got him a job. He interviewed and was offered a decent full time position and accepted it. 

At first his GF would drop him off at my house in the morning and I would take him home in the evening, I had a fuel efficient car and kinda took the extra 20 minute drive as a cool off period before I got home everyday. After a while his GF screwed up and lost her job, she is unemployed still. Anyway I no longer had to bring him home everyday as she would come to my house to get him after work, that's how it's been for some time now. 

Since then I had gotten in a wreck in my car and totaled it, but the other driver's insurance paid out and I purchased a truck that's not near as good on gas milage but it's perfectly ok for me and my hobbies. 

Today he told me that his GF would be interviewing for a job working overnights somewhere and she thinks she will get it, I kinda hope she gets something that works with his schedule but I do want her to succeed. With my truck I can't nor do I want to afford to take him home everyday, weekly it would add an extra 200 miles on my odometer to do so. I want to tell him I can't or won't but he has no licsense or car for himself and I can't see a way for him to continue working with me if I don't help him by giving him a ride. But it's just not in my interests to wear out my truck when I need it to last a long time. I haven't talked to him yet and don't want to upset him because I know they have had it rough recently, and we always hang out on the weekends and whatnot. But I am unsure what to do, have any of you gone through something similar to my story?

TLDR: Got friend a job and got a new to me truck and dont want to wear it out driving him to and from work everyday but he has no other way to get to work without me. His GF used to bring him to and from my house, but she's about to start working. What do?",23May2019,1
54,"I’ve been married 10 years, together for 12. He had four kids-2, 5, 7 and 9 when I met them- 15, 18, 20 and 21 currently. We had one- 9 now. Recently, the youngest step kid did a very bad and inexcusable thing. Because of this, I lost weight, gained weight, probably added 7 years to my appearance. It’s been very hard, especially considering he shows no remorse and is in fact downright rude to the victim.  I am in regular contact with the victim. 
The MIL has always been upset with me getting close to the kids. She starts acting very upset when she sees us having what I would call a normal family relationship. For her, it’s not-these kids need as much love as they can get- it’s, how can I get them closer to me?
When the event came out ALMOST entirely, she was on MY case first thing. When I told her what happened, her first response was “that’s what she says happened.” That was her first response!  I’ve talked extensively with my son and the victim. What happened, happened!  There was no reason to begin with doubt!
Now, she got to the oldest two, both girls, who are feminist and politically active. For some reason, after talking with their grandma, they are fine with what their brother has done. They are upset with me for being upset about it!  It’s a life altering event that the victim will remember and have to live with for the rest of her life!  And it’s not like he’s had a perfect record up til now. 
So now, she’s awful to me, the girls are weird around me and I’m very depressed.  She has never asked any further questions, there are plenty to be asked... she’s just rude. Am I really the bad guy here?  I can’t confront her- she gets offended very easily and is very judgmental. Even my husband says I can’t confront her. She has swooped in to this boy and made sure he knows she will love him no matter what. I love him also but I kinda thought we would be a collaborative front so he could realize the gravity of the situation.  The first time we were all together-one sister joked with him all evening and the other picked him up and spun him around!  He was purely concerned with his popularity- his answers to my first questions still give me chills. There was absolutely zero remorse or worry for her. At this point he must think- I can do whatever terrible shit I want and grammy will always love me. 
Is this fucking male white privilege?

&amp;#x200B;

It all started when I was best friends with K. K and I did everything together and had been best friends for a couple of years. Then, K and I got into a lot of fights. However, the fight that ended our friendship was because of a boy she liked. She texted me that I was ruining her mental health and that she won't want to be my friend ever again. This really hit me badly. At first, I was in shock; because I thought our friendship was improving but I guess not. 

Here's the thing. All of my friends were her friends. Or, I guess they weren't really my friends at all. That's when I met C. C was a very nice person and she was there to listen to me while I cried. However, C changed. She now makes fun of my appearances, tries to convince me that I'm gay and etc. 

I really feel like I don't have anybody in this world.  I can't turn to anybody and I'm emotionally exhausted. I will admit that I could be annoying and weird sometimes so that's probably the reason why I'm here. Probably I drove everybody around me insane or something. I really don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

(Not really related to the story; however after one of the fights K and I had; she told me she tried cursing me or something with some spices. I just wanted to put that out there because I really do feel like this is all a curse. Or probably I'm just overreacting. Have a good day.)",23May2019,1

68,"TW: details of sexual encounters/possible abuse

I went through a very hard divorce a couple years ago. I won't go into details, but it was traumatic and I still deal with the aftermath every day (trust issues, etc).

I had been with the man I married since I was 15 and he was 17. He always asked me to send him naked pictures, do things I didn't want to really do, etc. I don't know if it could be considered ""grooming"", but in retrospect that's how it feels.

The first thing that really didn't seem right to me happened when I was in high school and he was in the military. He kept asking to have sex without a condom, and I repeatedly said no. He kept pushing and eventually just went for it. I laid there and took it. Afterwards I told him that I didn't want to do that, and he said that he thought I was just being playful, and since I didn't *physically* push him off of me, I consented.

The second thing happened on vacation while we were engaged. He asked me to go down on him, and said I would after specifying that I *did not* want him to come in my mouth. He ended up holding my head in place and doing it anyways. I got upset and cried and he laughed. He thought it was a fucking prank or something.

I know some of you are going to say, ""why the hell did you marry him if all of this happened?"" And I can't really give a good answer, other than I loved him. Believe me, I've paid for the mistake of marrying him over and over.

But more to the point...was this sexual abuse? Or just the results of dating an asshole? I've been going back and forth with this for some time now, and I can't come to a conclusion. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want to be labeled ""sexual abuse survivor"" or anything like that. I just want to be able to define what happened to me.

70,"So this is long. 
My ex (24 M) and I (24 F) broke up years ago...we were both 18 and had been together off and on for maybe two years. When we did, I was a freshman in college and he was off doing whatever...he was playing games and couldn’t deal with it so I went and found someone who actually acted like they liked me. That’s not to say we didn’t have a serious bond. We have this strange chemistry where when we’re together it feels like nobody is around-as corny as it is. The kind of electrifying thing where we could be at opposite ends of a crowded room and our eyes still meet kind of thing. 

Throughout my college years after we separated, I got serious with someone else. Found out my ex did the same (well she thought it was serious) but he always was drawn back. Maybe every six months for three years he would message me or we would see one another and he’d pour his heart out. “I still love you”, “I wasn’t ready to be with someone who loved me like you do”, “I wish we stayed together”. 

Fast forward to Sept 2018. 
By this time I’ve been single-out of that relationship from college for a few months. He is a father to toddler with the same woman he’s been with off and on after we broke up back in 2013. I was at the club with my best friend and-it happened again- that magnetic energy where we just found each other. It was the first time in two years since I’d seen him. The last he was telling me he didn’t know how he’d be able to handle fatherhood and how he felt stifled in his relationship. Apparently nothing changed. He bought our drinks and poured his soul out right in the middle of the club.  His rant included “I still love you”, “I want to take care of you”, “I’ve put this woman through school and she wants more babies and marriage and I don’t know if I want that”, “I’m too young for this shit”...etc, etc, etc. He stayed by me for an hour. When he finally left with his friends he told me “I’ll die loving you” and kisses me on the cheek.

We didn’t talk after that at all. I had brushed it off as him being drunk. Nothing to see here. A few weeks later on Facebook I see his fiancé announcing their engagement. I was kind of stuck...he had just said he didn’t know if he wanted to be married?

Now it’s January 2019.
There’s not been much communication. I had been a bit sickened by the news of his engagement but there wasn’t much to say. One day I posted on IG story and he comments. At first we start surface level. I say congrats. He’s thankful. But then he makes quips about how I’m still his and shouldn’t post pictures where I’m too “revealed”. The conversation keeps going and more heart pouring. ALOT of it. To keep matters simple, we end up seeing each other the next day. In the heat of the moment, we had sex. I felt really shitty after. I have NEVER wanted to be a catalyst for another women’s pain but our selfishness did just that. I had no plans on saying anything. He and I only talked once in person after and he was still feeling the same ways. Saying he proposed because he owed it to her, and maybe their kid wants a two parent household. But how can a marriage be built on a foundation like that? It stung but he unfollowed me on socials- he can’t bear to see my face he said. I’m sure it’s because he feels guilty. It’s hard seeing this woman gush about him and how great he is when he cheated on her. I know I was involved but he told me before that he’s cheated on her a few times in the past. And I’ve seen him saying inappropriate  things in other women’s comments after this occurred. So hes not the best at acting committed. I haven’t said anything for fear of looking like a shit starter or for fear of her thinking I’m just doing this to get with him. Because although I care for him still, I can’t be with him. I’m at the point where I’ve lost all respect for him. They’re getting married in about a month and it’s kind of sickening how he’s acting like nothing happened and letting her brag on him. I just would like opinions. Should I say something or keep quiet?",23May2019,2
71,"I need to do it. I know that. I’ve been holding off from it, trying to work out my problems by myself, for a long while now. Some of my problems, however, I can’t fix on my own. Which sucks. So much. 
I know my Dad will be understanding. He is not a stranger to these types of things, and we’ve even (kindof) talked about this kind of stuff. 
My Mom, however... I have no idea. I think it’s possible she’ll feel hurt and she’ll think it’s her fault and that I hate her. I don’t. 
If I were to be diagnosed with some form of personality disorder (realistically speaking, I wouldn’t be surprised if this were the case) I think my Mom would use that as an excuse/explanation as to how I act. 
They will both look at me differently for this, and I don’t know if I can handle that. Of course, I should be happy about that. I’m not the same person I was in 2015. I’m hardly even the same person I was 6 months ago.
A little while ago, I told myself I didn’t want things to stay the same. I wanted things to change. I either wanted things to get better, or worse. And they have gotten worse. 
I don’t know if I can handle the change that this will bring on. I want things to get better, but they’re going to have to get a lot harder first.
I haven’t even started on the therapy itself. 
I don’t know how to talk about how I feel. I don’t even know how I feel. And even if I were able to describe my feelings, it wouldn’t feel real when I started talking about them. The last time I went to a therapist, it was the same way, and I know it won’t be much different. 
I was never comfortable with making eye contact with people. I’m still not. I don’t want to go back to a therapist to have the same experience I did then. I want to talk as mutuals and I don’t want to be told what to do and if I don’t want to do something you have. To. Understand. That. 
Privacy is very important to me and it has been violated many times in the past. If I tell one person something personal (although I don’t do that anymore), I don’t want them to just go and repeat it to someone else. Don’t go through my phone again. And don’t just walk into my room and look through my stuff whenever you feel like it. 
I can’t stand being serious. I try not to take anything seriously. I avoid answering serious questions from my friends, and in turn they’ve stopped asking. But I’ve gotta do this if I ever want to be happy again. I don’t really care if I don’t end up being happy though, I just don’t want keep feeling like whatever this is.
Both parents are in the dark about this stuff, but they have their suspicions. 
I need to tell them that I need to see a therapist, but how do I approach this? What do I tell them? I don’t want to end up putting this off ‘until next week’... then ‘until next month’... because then school will start back up again and I won’t do it at all. 
To an extent I’m fucking terrified. This is going to be the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do (which says a lot about how ‘exciting’ my life is :/ ).

So yesterday I saw them at finals (i'm in highschool), and told them to ""Tell me if they have free today or tomorrow,"" they said they could today, and I told them to contact me exactly when they can, and they just kinda nodded. But today they didn't reach out to me in anyway so now I'm worried. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had past experiences with them where I'll text them and they'll give me really short responses and make me feel like they don't want to talk to me. I've also had some times where they just seem off when they're around me. Yet I've also had times where they happy around me and not unwilling to be around me at all. We've hung out in groups many times before and I've gotten little to no weird vibes. 

&amp;#x200B;

They also don't really initiate texts with me tough, but I'm not sure if thats with everyone or not. I also know that sometimes they'll take upwards of two days to respond to things, even with friends they're super close to and have known since they were little. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda stumped cause it could totally be that they are just an non-initiative person that has no issues with me what so ever, but it could also be that they do not like me at all and are just trying to be polite whenever I text or try to hang out with them. So I don't really know whether or not I should text them and talk about it, and I also wouldn't know how to word it. They're the kind of person that never really gets ""meta,"" with any of their relationships so I don't know how not to put them in a position that I'm confident would make them comfortable whilst also accomplishing what I want from the interaction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Help would be appreciated! Thanks.

73,"SO and I are moving across the country (NE Ohio to Las Vegas) and have about 6 months to find an apartment. We visited and found a place we really loved, but it has overwhelmingly bad reviews. Other places we like have not been pet friendly, or have been way out of our price range, or in a bad neighborhood. We have been searching endlessly but without being there in person we are getting a little discouraged. We don't want to sacrifice money (and time, stress, and potentially our safety) by moving somewhere awful. How can we find a place that will fit for us? Any pro tips?

74,"I have a job I enjoy, and a co-worker I hate! She cried to higher ups that she is so busy and overwhelmed, so they tell me to help her and she won't let me. She likes to control everything! She is so uptight I swear she shits diamonds. She likes the attention and people to think she is so put upon, and acts like a victim. But, when given help or tools to reduce the work, she refuses. She lies, gossips, manipulates people and situations. 1 boss sees it, but cannot do much as the other boss buys the act. 

I love what I do and my co-workers, this 1 person is ruining everything! I have tried talking to her, ignoring her, helping her, and reporting her. I really do not know what to do. I have to work with her and she just plays games and literally messes with my work, files, etc. We have open work spaces with no locks! I have caught her in the act!

76," 

Ok, I don't know where to start, so I'll keep it simple.

I live in Canada and I currently live with my grandmother and have the majority of my life. I am a 19 year old male and am currently looking for work but not employed. My mother is an unemployed alcoholic with serious mental health issues, she is currently residing in a last tier public housing place which is about to kick her out because my father keeps bringing alcohol and cigarettes to her residence every day even though indulging on such substances is strictly prohibited at this location. Naturally they want to kick her out for violating their basic rules, they have given me only 1 days notice before-hand. I am just learning of my dad giving her alcohol every day now. My mother has a social worker contact who works for the city and has said there are no other options for housing and I don't know what to do.

My mother has lived with me and my grandmother before, from November to February. When she was here because she got kicked out of her last place, I can't say the adjustment was easy. When I say she has mental health issues, it's really not a joke, she has violent/destructive fits daily which often come with intense yelling and other annoying things like leaving water taps on, leaving doors open, and breaking things. She has clinical schizophrenia and takes allot of energy and time to manage. Me and my grandmother simply cannot bear that burden. My father knows this and is purposefully trying to get her to live at my grandmothers house again. He is completely unwilling to take her in either, and as previously mentioned there seems to be no other place in this city which can take her in at the moment, she even get's turned away from homeless shelters.

I seriously need advice, I feel completely powerless in this situation.",23May2019,2
77,"My workplace seems to have both a gossip and an uncomfortable discussions problem. People will gossip out loud (whispering thinking no one hears) about both supervisors and others. They will also suddenly begin uncomfortable discussions, often centered on race. 

Example 1: Coworker's schedule is changed without warning by a supervisor and people will proceed to discuss how much they do not like this person out loud, even right outside another supervisor's office.
Example 2: Someone went to the market and observed a stereotype. Discussion of stereotype and how it is ""true"" will occur. 

Example 3: Coworkers above my level will speak in front of coworkers a level below me as though they know whether they are up for advancement when they do not actually know or have any authority.

These conversations often happen in situations I cannot escape from, whether it is near where I sit, in a meeting room before or even during a meeting, etc. 

For example 1, I know the best option is likely to leave the situation ASAP, even if it's one on one. But sometimes they just won't stop, even if I claim I have to do something, or they will follow me to my desk.

Is there any feasible way to stop these conversations in a polite and professional way without offending the other parties involved? I don't necessarily care if they gossip about me if I upset them, it is what it is. But I do have to keep working with them, which is why I'm not just being extremely blunt in a response.

Any strategy or management tips for how to end these uncomfortable situations would be appreciated. I have not experienced this lack of professionalism at other jobs and find myself at a loss.",23May2019,2

Shortly after they retired they began meeting new friends who they would hang out with a lot then would suddenly disappear and we’d never here about those friends again.  This has gone on for a while and it’s recently happened again.  They met this other couple through a game night they have with several other couples.  They’ve gotten pretty close to them and they’ve helped my parents a lot with moving recently and are even dog sitting for my wife and I as we’re temporary displaced from our home for remodeling.  I met the husband recently and he is very nice, nothing against him personally at all.  When I met him he knew a good amount about myself, my wife, and our toddler.  Not a creepy or excessive amount but just enough that I can tell they talk about family a lot with them.  Anyway I can’t help but feel like they’re swinging with these people and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  They’ve been sending us pictures of our dog to let us know how he’s doing and have now invited my family up there along with my parents for dinner so we can see him.  I don’t know how I feel about any of this.  Am I wrong to feel strange going up there to dinner with my wife and son.  We do appreciate very much that they’re watching our dog and I’d like for my son to be able to see him but if what I suspect is going on is really the case it’s just a weird situation to me.  The husband was recently down here and my dad went somewhere with me for 15-20 minutes and left him home alone with my mom.  May have been completely innocent but I found that very strange.  Just not a normal thing for a husband to do but maybe I’m crazy.  Personally I do think what they’re doing is wrong morally but beyond that I just don’t know what to do.  I don’t want it to affect my parents and I’s relationship as we are extremely close and I know if my wife ever found out it would be extremely uncomfortable so I really have nobody to talk to about this.  I have 2 brothers but I don’t want to put this in their heads if it’s gonna do what it’s doing to me.  I’d easily say I’m 80-90% sure they are swinging or at least something like that is going on there.  Any advice at all or just feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Nice just having a place to vent because I go through periods of thinking it’s not a big deal get over it but it’s times when I call and want to do something with them and they say they have plans with these people that it bothers me.  I can say honestly I don’t like at all the idea of them spending time with these people, knowing what’s going on, instead of spending time with us or their grandson.  That really really bothers me and it may be selfish I understand that.  Now I’m rambling.",23May2019,1

87,"TL;DR gfs abusive, racist mom accuses me of rape and sexual assault , I don’t know what to do as I can’t talk to my girlfriend currently and we’re 
I’m 14, and around three months ago got into my first relationship with a 14 year old girl , things went smoothly until last month , which was a definite rough patch for us, we constantly fought and hurt each other, though at the end of the day we always reconciled and loved each other all the same
Until I told her that some of her track and cross country buddies were shit telling her, doesn’t seem that severe right? Well, after her mom realizes that she’s feeling down because of a fight in the relationship she interrogates her about the relationship (to add context , her mom and dad were both abusive to her, her dad sexually abused her but was never legally apprehended despite it being reported, and her mom physically and emotionally abused and neglected her.)
So, my girlfriend tells her mom about what I told her, regarding her track and CC friends talking shit.
This started everything, her mom accuses me of being abusive and making this up in an attempt to make my girlfriend leave track, despite the fact I was supportive of her interests , sports, etc.
So over the course of the month her mom manipulates her into believing I’m abusive , I’m using her, and I don’t love her
As well her mother accuses me of sexually harassing , assaulting and raping her, I of course asked my girlfriend about these accusations and she says her mom made them all up and she never felt like that 
So this leads up to the end of the month, after an entire month of her mom manipulating her and forcing her to breakup with me, despite my girlfriend still loving me dearly we reconcile, and things seemed smooth
Then she gets involved at our school, tells counselors, teachers, tried to get a no contact order on me
As well she threatened to call the police if I contacted my girlfriend , I still did , because I love her so much 
But after talking this out with Counselors and other school officials we reached a conclusion that we would stay together and that she would talk to her mom about it but the day after she talked to her mom about it she did not show up to school, I heard from her halfway into the day, she said she had got into a massive fight with her mom she had started cutting her self, at that point I had panicked and I ran out of school, I called the police, ran to her house and met the police there and after a few minutes of talking to her mom right now I told the police about how she was abusive and stuff though they never asked me for evidence or screenshots which I have , where she admits to her mom hitting her
So she gets sent to a hospital and I don’t hear from her for a week, a week ago I found a way to contact her, her mom found out today and she threatened police again and told me to never contact her 
Reddit, what do I do? I love her so much, but I’m facing serious allegations , and we’re not of age yet, so we I can’t do anything

I (F19) known this guy (M23) for a year through  an online dating app. 

We finally became intimate and close for the last few months, and planned on meeting each other for the first time in a couple of weeks. We have been long distance, yet never been official to date because of the distance. 

Today, he confessed to me that he gave his ex another chance to start dating again.

Apparently, his ex called him multiple times to get back together... which led him saying yes in the fear of feeling no regrets. 

Yet, it ended up him being hurt, and asking me forgiveness in regards to talking to his first love again. 

Although I have no reason to be upset because we’re not in an official relationship, I still got hurt.

Yes, I appreciated him for being honest with me. But, it triggered me into wanting to end my potential relationship with him because I knew he has a history of cheating and engaging a continuous toxic relationship with his ex. 

I have confronted my worries about this with him before, and we talked it out... but right now I’m worried if this could be another sign I should end it for good. 

He told me he still wants to build a relationship with me, but three hours ago I told him that I needed time alone to process all of this information.

From this, I need honest opinions and advice before I make a final decision. 

I could be smart and end it to avoid being hurt in the future, but for some reason I still want to continue working out a relationship with him.

What are your guys honest thoughts of how I should handle this situation?

I (used to be) a teachers pet in her class and she is super kind but one day i have my head down for like 5 minutes because I was tired. After class she kept asking me whats wrong. (I can't get in contact with my dad, so I might have been weird that day) I said nothing because I don't want her to be in my business.

The next day I wrotw her a note saying how I am not sad and nothing is up and that she doesnt have to ask me continuously what is wrong.

She talked to me during class out the door, saying that I have been acting weird and that other teachers have noticed too. 

I told her that I am fine and than out of the blue she asked if I had any siblings (no) and if it was just me and my mom at home (yes). She then said and I quote: ""You can keep acting like this for the rest of the year or act like a normal person for the rest of the year"".

He was overly strict, aggressive, and overbearing for dealing with the little soft spoken girl that i was, and he didnt really understand what i needed as a young child, let alone a young girl. He has always struggled throughout life, i believe with drugs and addiction, but he kept it hidden very well. I can and will say that he always kept me fed with a roof over my head, and always made sure i was safe.


Later in my adolescence life, my mom came into my life and i had moved in with her in the 8th grade. After i left, my dad no longer had any motivation to keep a job, and had even became homeless at one point.
He now lives with his sister in the ghetto, with no running water and no a/c. He gets in a lot of fights and gets ganged up a lot, as my dad is a lone-wolf with a hard head and a loud mouth. He is a great fighter hearing the stories so im not too worried.

 I have a hard time calling him regularly as i get lost in the motion of my current life and he can be very toxic in general, as he has become paranoid and is in a constant downspiral with his mental health. Often times i will get off the phone with him feeling very shitty and depressed.

I wasnt able to make it to see him for his birthday this month (due to a lack of planning on my part) and he was very upset with me. We came to a middle ground, as he didnt want me to drive there when i was due for an oil change. We agreed on a nice fathers day.

A few days later he calls me saying that since i didnt visit him or get him anything for his birthday, if i could put my name on their internet bill so that they could have internet. I wasnt comfortable with it and said i would think about it and let him know later. I forgot to call him back that night and i get a text saying,


“ pm-me-ur-dinner why you become so narrow~minded self~center dont wory about hurting my feelings there dead so stop beating~around~the~bush with me keep your fathers day dont care for it this time bye”


So i said,

“Dad thats silly im sorry i just dont feel comfortable putting my name on the internet bill. Its not that i dont trust that it wont get paid, i just dont want my name to be on another contract right now. Thats extra stress to add to all my other bills im paying.”


Then he followed with 

“Pm-me-ur-dinner you only see me a half a day in a year and on top of that you find time to treat me like shit that shows how much you love me you can keep your 6 hours a year i dont want your charity”

But the rest of my family doesn't come to my house because of the dog... With my class schedule I no longer do anything I enjoy. And all of my teachers dislike me because I don't participate. I have no time to be on internet because it turns off at 9pm(Hasn't heard of the concept of downloading I guess?) even though I am 16 years old. My father will never buy me things, but my mother does buy me things( my father monitors credit card) and then he screams till way past 9pm my ""bedtime"" at her and about how we can't be doing this without letting him know, but letting him know means that it won't happen. 
I'm tired of being fake to everyone as well, my family calls itself Christian, yet we haven't gone to church since before I started 3rd grade, and my grandparents are super Republican Christians who would hate me forever if I said any thing non-conservative. I am an atheist but my father would make me sleep on the street if I said that to him. I have nobody in my life to look up to, my friends do drugs, my parents are never home and when they are it's screaming. I don't know what to do at all and the best advice I ever get is that it is going to get better.. but it never has...  Don't know what type of advice to ask for really.

I am not in the best shape and have social anxiety and need to get some hands on experience before I get into the game, so I need advice. Should I go to baseball camp?

108,"hello r/advice, throwaway here and first post on this sub. Long story short, father has been abusive his entire life to my family/my mother and his children. Years of family therapy, seeing his children diagnosed with depression and enter counseling and take antidepressants, and so on, have not allowed him to develop self-awareness for his actions. He genuinely does not understand why it is impossible not to make him angry, why he's not justified in physically abusing us. He really believes that he's allowed to divorce my mother and financially abandon the family (he's the main breadwinner unfortunately), but if my mother threatens the same thing, he calls her a lying manipulative bitch and says he'll kill her. He has sided with his brother/my uncle when he (the uncle) sexually harassed both me and my mother, saying he'd move out and live with his brother rather than stay with his wife/children because ""family is always number one""??? (in some weird twisted illogical logic he uses)

The cycle is always the same. We confront him on his abusive behavior, whether this is in family therapy or in a psychiatric ward's family session or at a psychiatrist appointment and so on, and he refuses to listen and make changes. He refuses to acknowledge he is at fault, OR if he cannot handle/understand the truth of his actions, he immediately turns to acting like a victim, saying everyone hates him and he should kill himself because no one loves him even though he sacrifices everything for this family, everything he does is out of love and yet his family doesn't love him, etc.

My father has gone through his own traumas (eldest of 9 children, survived in poverty and was sole breadwinner for his family in the 50s in the Philippines, became a workaholic to attend and graduate from university, had a heart attack at 29 and 50 years old, cue lifelong health problems) and really needs his own therapy. I know the standard advice to abusive relationships is always to leave and distance oneself so that the abuse can't happen in the first place, but... financially, it seems impossible (3 kids in college, mom's salary is only $50k/year) and his physical/mental health is unstable enough to cause another heart attack (doctor's words) if he were to go through the emotional burdens of the family leaving.

110,"I’m 18 (F) in a small town and I graduated highschool around a year ago. I wasn’t necessarily “popular” but I was someone most people liked. I had my own “friend group” of around 10 girls, but was someone who would talk to anyone in classes and (most) people liked, the class clown type. 

After graduation my friendships slowly started to fall apart. I still get along with all my HS acquaintances, we interact on finsta etc. but they were never people I hung out with outside of school. My actual friend group would hang out a couple of times a month but it started to slow more and more progressively.

After summer I started Esthetics school (which only lasts around 9 months) and made a lot of really great new friends who I love. We never hangout because I commuted an hour to school and we are all from different towns so it’s understandable, and I dont have any resent to them. 

But now my old friend group has almost completely cut me out. There was around 10 of us to start and now there’s only 3-5 girls who hang out with eachother and never invite anyone else. Not to mention we are all cousins so it’s awkward to run into them when they haven’t made an effort to speak to you in months. One of the other girls who got excluded as well and I hang out and talk separately sometimes, but it feels kind of one sided and in our group chat it seems that she’s always so desperately trying to be friends with the others again and they couldn’t care less. The “queen” (for lack of a better example) of the friend group is basically who everyone else follows around and since we had a falling out she’s lead almost all of them into cutting me out.  

Now that I’ve given a little background, I’d like to get to the point. I’ve been so depressed because of all of this. I’ve always been the type of person who didn’t love school worked but loved being at school because I’m best when I’m surrounded by people, laughing and taking everyday. I’m very extroverted and get depressed when I’m in the house for days with no one to interact with. 

The thing is it’s hard to make new friends in a small town, everyone goes back to college in the fall and I am here since I’m done with school, plus everyone in this town already has a “friend group” and it’s not like you just get invited into a group that has had the same people for 4+ years. I feel lost and don’t know what to do, but I’m sick of feeling so empty and lonely.",23May2019,1

119,"Hey Reddit, throwaway account for obvious reasons, just reaching out for some advice I'll try to summarize the situation the best I can. 

I am a freshman in HS, earlier this year I got out of a serious/intimate 10 month relationship in a very rough way and it took a very big toll on me. I made some mistakes I can't change, but learned a lot of good lessons. 

When going into high school, I applied for a more rigorous academy within the large high school I would be going to, it adds some classes focused in global politics and diplomacy to your schedule. There are around 160 people in the academy, and 2300 in my school. 

I am friends with pretty much everyone and get along well with most people, I don't, however, have a or group of close best friends that live near me. I have been looking for a relationship, I strongly believe I am ready for one. There are a few girls I like and a few that I think like me, not sure, but that's not the focus here. 

See, this academy, we have our own lounge that we can be in during lunch. There is a group of sophomores, boys and girls that are in there daily. The obviously most pretty girl over there, let's call her Mary, likes to, in a teasing way, talk to me about us dating, blow me kisses, tell me to call her, today she asked me to prom (witch passed). I talked to her on Snapchat and she said she was dating someone, I messaged her today and she said she wasn't. When I talk to her on social media she is generally short with me and has left me on read numerous times. My friends (Freshmen in the room as well) tell me it's obviously a joke and she's making fun of me, and doesn't like me. I really like her, she is really pretty and has a great personality, kind of at a crossroads of what to think/do?

On the other hand it is gonna be really hard to quit since my dad wants me to go play in college and will not want me to quit and my coach is gonna be pissed that his starting guard is  quitting. I'm not sure what to do since if I continue playing I'm just gonna be miserable but everyone I know wants me to play and Im not sure that after I quit i won't regret it.

121,"So basically, I was at a party and I was having a good time, until someone I knew offered me a bag of coke. Me, being a drunk idiot, decided I would take it off him. Later, one of my mates asked me for a sniff, so I gave him one. As I was tying the bag closed, it ripped and loads fell out. I put what was left in my pocket and tried my best to forget about it. Then the guy who was selling it told me I owe him $50, by next week. I have no way of getting that money this month, let alone week.

123,"Obviously people work full time and go to school full time and make it work. I don’t necessarily have the need (or want) to do that. I live very close to my university, friends, and girlfriend but I’m having a hard time finding employment that’s low stress, low hours with decent pay— most jobs tick the first two boxes, that I can work to pay for my place while going to school full time. I have the safety net of moving home for free, as long as I’m employed or enrolled in school. While being home, I have the low stress employment option of helping out at my mothers store. It’s not doing well and I could help (and have helped in the past) drum up business. I would be paid enough to keep gas in the car. The catch is that it’s an hour away (roughly 40 miles). So that means almost daily hour long one-way commutes. Also I can’t imagine that it wouldn’t strain my relationship having an hour between my partner and I.

It was really hard to get out of and it all blew up in my face when I reported the guys for sexual harassment because one was insistent on figuring out exactly why I did what I did. He was so angry that I did that and I was honestly afraid. I did it because I knew that is exactly the response I would get if I talked to him. Maybe a month later, I got a new job and left the old one. I happily got on Facebook and updated my info saying that I left my old job and started a new one. Well, two days later and he decides to like the post that says I left my old job. What a smack in the face and he knew it.

125,"So I’m basically turning 19 pretty soon, and I feel like I’m just behind in life. I’m always dealing with some sort of insecurity or self esteem issues, my confidence just bounces most of the time, and it’s just so easy for me to get into a depressive state. 

I’m commuting to college while living at home, and it is absolutely heart crushing to see everybody have social groups with there floor/roommates, and I’m still just by myself. Sure I do hangout with some people, and I know a good amount of people, but I don’t really have anybody I can count on, or who I could ask to hangout with.

This is just amplified because over summer all I’m doing is smoking weed for most of the day and exercising. I’ve asked people to hangout and usually they’re just too busy or something. Since I’ve gotten off from school, I feel like everything’s just been a blur and I smoke in the morning, throughout the day, and sometimes before I go to sleep. That’s literally all I have in my life, and I would have probably killed myself if it wasn’t for weed.

My household is pretty dysfunctional, and it’s like everyday someone is arguing, crying or fighting. I get criticized and brought down all the time by my parents, and they just always make sure to tell me what I’m doing wrong or how I’m messing up. I don’t get along with my dad for multiple reasons, (I’m not going to get into them) and my mom is just like the most overbearing helicopter mom you can think of. 

I appreciate her, and she tries to do good but she always makes me doubt myself, and to give you a better picture of the situation, it wasn’t until last year of freshmen college that my mom unwillingly stopped tracking me. She used to track my every move and would ask me about what I was doing, and if I’m hanging out with wrong crowd, where I was, where I was going, etc, and I finally turned the feature off and she started balling her eyes out saying I was going to die and she wasn’t going to know if I was dead.

And it’s like everyday I’m interrogated, it’s all about tone, and body language, and the way she asks the questions, it’s like I already did something bad. I can’t do anything without my whole family getting on me about everything, and being the oldest, it’s like everybody likes to direct their attention toward me.

I’m so tired of everything, I feel like [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bn81hy/men_of_reddit_how_do_i_get_over_the_fact_my_20s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) post and I’m just letting my parents and home life get in the way of everything.

I then texted his wife, started a conversation about cooking, asked what they ate for dinner.  It makes me feel like I am going insane sometimes. It causes me a lot of mental and emotional anguish.

128,"So this is going to be really long cause there is a lot to explain to fully understand the situation. Honestly, I'm only coming here cause I'm out of options speaking this involves my only close friend. This is still a very fresh wound for me so if I get ranty I'm sorry.

My best friend (who I will call angel) and I had a very strange relationship for the past almost 4 years now. But everything has literally imploded on its self in the past month. When we first got close we where both cringy, nerdy kids starting in a new school at the same time. We became inspectable. You know that best friend in movies that are like the perfect pare and seem impossible in real life, that was us, nothing cause come between us, we solved ever fight maturely, we talked about everything, everything was great. Soon it grew into something more romantic but when you live where we do that is something you ignore for as long as humanly possible cause you need to just pray the gay right away and you never tell anyone(this is important later). In private, we cuddled and hugged and laughed and honestly, not that I'm one to say this lightly cause I promise I'm not, this is when I started to fall in love with her. But on the outside, I was a completely different person. We both dated other people had other relationships, but always came back to each other. This went on for a very long time. Angel saw me in the worst condition of my life, she was the only person I could count on. 

The summer of our freshman year as like a dream. Most summers she went up to Ohio where she used to live but that year she stayed here. We spent most of our time together. One night we were sitting on her bed I was on top of her holding myself up on my arms, talking(we never did anything sexual this was really normal for us), and she kissed me. Most people describe their first kiss as awkward or something, this, this was honestly magical. The next day while I was getting ready to go to the mall(the only place to hang out here) she did it again. A few weeks later I kissed her for the first time, a few days later she told me she wanted to stop kissing it was going to fast for her. Of course, me being me, I did without argue. This is when things started to get weird. 

I know people change in high school but it was like something kidnapped my angel and replaced her with a shitty clone overnight. She wouldn't ignore me but she treated me really different than she ever had. She treated me like I was just another person that should be privileged to be her friend. This sounds harsh but that's how she described her new ""friends"" she met. She would never do ANYTHING without be starting it first from conversation to a simple hug to I love you. That not all though, her jokes started becoming condescending at me and hitting things she knew weren't funny to me or she would just flat out leave me out of anything when she did something. So I told her I felt this way cause that is what we always did. She apologized and told her to tell her when she did something like that. But when I did she would get mad and say I'm being attention seeking or just getting upset over nothing. I tried to invite her into everything I did, I did EVERYTHING I could to make her happy and she would always ask for more or less at the same time like she would want me to finish something for a class for her at 11 at night but then ask me to stop being so clingy or texting her good morning. I always did everything she asked without question cause I was so scared of losing her. 

Halfway through the year enters Blue.  Blue was Angel's new girlfriend. Blue was perfect, sweet, shy, intelligent (Angel is like INSANELY smart that kinda a big part of her personality), and beautiful. The biggest thing is that her mom knew they were dating and was completely alright with it, the main reason she never wanted to be official with me is cause she didn't want to lie to her mom so this was a big red flag. Of course, I had no right to be as completely DEVASTATED by this because we are us where aren't an actual thing as she said it (still in private being as romantic as always). As things started to get more serious with them I start to lose hope, when I get depressed I start collapsing in on myself I get quiet, have little motivation, and I try to make everyone around as happy as possible while neglecting my own needs(spending all my money on random presents, making food for them but not myself, etc.) When I had almost lost all hope Angel told me that her a blue broke up because she decided that she truly did love me and wanted to officially be with me. On one condition, we could only tell a select few people and not do anything ""couplely"" in public because if her younger sister found out she would tell her mom.

A month later she broke up with me. A week after that she told me that she and Blue never broke up. In the time we dated I asked her THREE times of her and blue where stilling seeing each other each time she said no I am just being paranoid. Her excuse for this is that she was worried about my mental health. I had never been as angry as a was when I get that text. I had given up, I don't get mad, I never had gotten mad at her like this before but I went off and told her never to talk to me again. I haven't been able to bring myself anywhere never her tell today (my last day of school)  I actually build up the courage to be within 5 feet of her and gave her back her sweatshirt. It was my comfort object, my anxiety anchor, but it was that because it was HERS so I decided it just needed to be gone and today was my last chance so I gave it to her and walked away without saying anything cause I panicked and was shaking like crazy. She left it by my stuff which kinda pissed me off so I wrote a note saying ""I will only but as much effort into being your friend as you put in. Decide if you still want to BEFORE you contact me. "" and a friend of both out ours (closer to me then her) took it to her. Apparently, Angel saw the note and say ""who the fuck does she think she is"" then turned around and acted like it never happened. I just saw that she deleted me from a music playlist for the book we write together so I have no access to it anymore, deactivated her account on a social media we used together, AND blocked me on Instagram. This was the first time I even acknowledge her existence scene what happened.

I'm hurt, conflicted, and really confused about what to do. I miss her so much but she is so much happier without me and clearly, I wasn't as important to her as I thought I was. Also, she lied directly to my face; I can't trust anything she has said now. I would proofread this but it was hard enough to get it all down and took me hours, I'm sorry my writing is horrible, I know. Anyways, a part of me wants to just give up and never talk to her again, the other wants to fight for her back with everything I can.

ever since the 6th grade...when i had a new iphone 5C and my crush asked ""how much was that"" and i couldn't even stomach to say the amount, because her parents wouldn't do the same for her so why should mine. sometimes i outright lie about the prices of things.

my parents bought me a $3k car because it was more convenient for them than driving me around. they wanted to buy me something like a new civic (≈$20k) but i insisted on something less expensive because i  would feel shame driving something a teenager shouldn't be driving. i also struggle with the fact that they just bought me something and I didn't have to earn it..my plan is to save up all my paychecks and pay them back for it so i can say ""i own this car"" and not feel ashamed of driving it around on their dollar.

work is another nightmare socially. i'm ashamed to tell people i go to my school because you can immediately tell that i get treated differently for it. it feels like i'm wasting everyone's time there because they all know i don't HAVE to be there and i'm just taking shifts from other people who actually need them. i received a ""you walk like a [my school] kid"" once which wasn't at all meant to be hurtful but it crushed me because i had to face that having money is engrained in my very being and inescapable

134,"Hello. 

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially this is the timeline of whats been happening. 

Middle of March I apply to this Summer Camp for an Internship, the respond fairly quickly asking a few questions and what not, then we schedule an over the phone interview. The communication for setting up that interview was sub par... but we got it figured out. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the interview was over they said we will let you know in a couple weeks we have a few others we would like to interview. As per usual, right? I say okay and go on with my life. A few weeks later I haven't heard from them or tried contacting them because the internship I really wanted also took a couple weeks to give me an answer, once they declined me I contacted the Summer Camp this is mid April at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I e-mail as a response in our thread of e-mails and get no response for a week, I send another e-mail as a new thread and they ask if I can give them more material, which i do. Although initially the link wasn't working to my material for her, so I sent her a more direct link and she never told me if it was a working link or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I e-mail them a week or two later after no responses asking if the link worked as well as if they have made any hiring, in the new thread of e-mails and have yet to receive a response.

138,"I’m 25 years old and I have Asperger’s sydrome (high functioning autism). I get overloaded in crowded areas or places that overstimulate my senses. 

On sunday, im leaving rhode island with my parents and boyfriend and we’re going on a trip to universal orlando. The only other time that i was on a plane was when I was 5 years old, i dont remember it much.

Im a bit nervous for the trip because im not sure what to expect on the plane ride. I always hear about annoying children or sneezy passengers, but i wanted to know some examples of things i might need to mentally prepare for.

Additionally, could I have some advice on ways to distract myself from those things that might force me into a meltdown? I’m bringing my nintendo switch, so that should help at least a little bit.

My boss isn't wanting to get me a hotel room but insists I drive four hours back after working. I have done this once before and began nodding off while driving back. I let him know this and that I'd rather just get a hotel room and not take a chance falling asleep at the wheel. He is still insisting that I make the drive.

140,"I've lived a cushy life. I grew up in a lower middle class family in one of the wealthiest parts of the US. I've wanted for nothing.

I grew up in the age of the internet. Had one of the first PCs with internet. I was such a self taught nerd in 5th grade I was invited to goto a conference to teach elementry school teachers the best way to ""teach computers"" to kids. 

I realized as a young age I can learn almost anything online if I put my mind to it.

So I skipped college. Went on campus to hangout and got the social experience without the bags of debt. Met my husband. 

Fast forward......Find a job doing grunt work for a small local caterer. I work my way up from working for free just to cook to running the company in 6 years. 

I realize my passion and strength is ethical food and people. Growing people.  And I feel overworked and underpaid at the catering gig. I was doing it all! And not growing. 

The big catch. Super flexible hours. I was the boss, basically the owner.

I finally called it quits and honestly it felt like leaving an abusive relationship .. regret, anxiety, fear. 

I got a job for a large chain paying me what I'm WORTH plus benefits and overtime ... 

I started this week and I'm still feeling that feeling of knowing more than everyone. It sounds horrible and I hate it. I know morally I shouldn't be this way. I stay humble openly and listen and except criticism. But I just can't help but feel I'll never be happy working for anyone else. Being a manager has semi filled a later hole. 

I also feel this career is just starting. Should I just see where things go?",23May2019,0
141,"My life is going pretty shitty right now, I feel. Here is a list a few things I'm going through. I'm 25 and I'm balding and I recently shaved my head again ( I grew my hair out for a few months, but realized it looked pretty bad and was making me self-conscious too much). I shaved my head since it was giving me so much anxiety, but now I feel like everyone is judging me and being awkward around me because of it. I have depression and anxiety. I have been self-medicating with kratom which has a similar effect to opiates and now I feel like I'm hooked. I'm sure this is contributing to my anxiety. I don't really have any close friends in the city I am currently living in. I have a D&amp;D group I frequent biweekly and there was this girl I was interested in. I got mixed signals and I took too long to ask her out, so I believe she lost interest. I also wasn't interested when I thought she was, so she probably got fed up with me. When I did ask her out I was incredibly nervous and made an ass of myself because I was sure I would be rejected, but ""fuck it"" I wanted to see if there was still a shot. Not only did this lead to awkwardness in the group, but I feel like I'm losing friends because of it despite trying to reassure her that everything was okay. Honestly, I'm sure she feels she dodged a bullet. Honestly, I can just see people judge me like I'm constantly some freak show.  I genuinely like these people and I didn't have any malintent, but I feel like people are drifting away from me because of how awkward I am and how I make them feel. And then a week or two later, my computer gets completely destroyed due to a wire sparking. Luckily, I bought a new one, but now my phone just broke so I need to get that repaired. I feel the only good thing about me is that I work out and am in great shape.

I feel like I'm at my wits end and am on the verge of a breakdown. I don't know what's wrong with me; why I am such a failure in almost every aspect of my life. I feel like I'm a good guy. I know therapy is the answer, but ironically I can't even register for an appointment because my phone doesn't work. What am I doing wrong with my life? I feel like I'm on the verge of crying right now because I want to change, I really do, I really want to be the best version of myself, but I really don't know if being me is good enough in this world. It sure as hell doesn't feel like it. I'm sorry for venting, but I have been a crappy couple of weeks and I would appreciate some advice and support.",23May2019,1
143,"Hello, I have been pretty stumped as of lately as to what I want to do in life. Not necessarily as to what I want but I guess on how I should achieve it and what my next steps are.   
For the past year I have been working at a company I care deeply about as a Customer Support Rep in a call center. Working there has helped me grow as a person and finally get a drive I have never had to pursue a better career. Which led me to apply to college for computer science for the next 4 years. I am only 23 years old so I figured now is finally the time to get it out of the way since I know what I want to do.  
The tricky part is that it's expensive and I just want to make the right decision.    
I had always had a strong drive to visit Japan and 4 weeks ago I finally did it. I went to Japan for 2 weeks and fell in love with everything. People, Food, Culture, Work Ethic, etc. thus confirming I wanted to move there as soon as possible and possibly just study overseas and get a degree there. Looking into it seems more and more impossible with the research that I do and on-top of that I had been talking to this girl that I met up with there for a quite a few months and now that she wanted to be official I also have the stress of being a good boyfriend on-top of it. 

I hope this doesn't really come off as stupid. It's just this has always been a dream of mine to move there study hard and just try my luck to see how far I can go. You really don't know until you take the first step but in this case I just don't know too many options. So here I am!

Before i continue i'm all for having a life outside of video games, i do and i expect them too as well. Also worth mentioning he has a girlfriend (approximately 8 months now). They work together, and ill ask text him during the day to see if he will be on some game that night... 

like today i texted him to see. He says ""yes""

This leads me to believing ok we will be playing games tonight. WRONG, his girlfriend who he literally sees every working day and then probably 5 nights a week is over so we play about 30 mins of games then he says ""since Sam likes GTA we're gonna switch over to that"" like oh im sorry i didnt realize i was playing fucking games with both of you. I kindly accepted his invite only to realize ""your welcome to join"" means ya we wont be on the mic so is basically like playing alone

I know your going to say hes growing pout of video games, but nah were talking about a guy who when his brother is home will play video games basically all day with him and I. so thats not the case 

As for his girlfriend, he fucking sees her at work every day he works, not to mention they usually do something after work 5 days a week.... plus the fact that i really don't like her. IDK it just seems like hes pretty much casting me aside

Another example would be making plans to see End Game, i say lets go May 1st (our mutual friend cant so reschedule even though hes seen it). I say lets go on the 6th since its cheap night, he cancels on monday (3 days after he said sure)  because he hasnt had a day off in 2 weeks, aka instead of going to see a movie we will see in theaters on the cheapest night he wants to cancel and spend time with Sam... the same thing is going to happen with Detective Pikachu (may as well fucking go alone)

ya i dont know ever since he started to date Sam, he seems to be choosing to just lounge around with her than doign shit with me. Like ya that'll happen to a degree but its at the point where im if hes on for one night like he was before sam its a good day. 

Just seems like im putting in more effort than he is into this friendship.",23May2019,1

148,"So I just saw a post on an unrelated thread asking the general question of, ""Are you angry?"" When I opened it, it went more into detail about the specifics of that subreddit, and was asking if people were angry about, ""x.""

For a split second though, before I opened it, I felt something faint and very deep start welling up inside. Its still there, now. Its almost like a rage. Like, if I had a sledgehammer and a vacant house, Id demolish that crap. Its so deep and so intense. 

Here's the deal though, I don't consider myself an angry person. I don't feel anger on a regular basis. Im actually pretty chill. This feeling though, its there and its real. I don't know where it came from and I don't know what to do about it. I don't feel like I'm going to snap or anything, in fact, I have pretty good self-control. I rarely act rash.

Im also the type to bury stuff. Emotions tend to get in the way of things, so I push then aside and move forward in a more rational way.

That rage deep down though, its kind of making me wonder if its affecting my health. I also wonder if I were pushed over the edge, however far that is, what could happen.

Does anyone else relate? Is this normal? What can I do? I've tried exercise, but I can't seem to really tap into this feeling when I do. It feels like the only thing that'd satiate it would be to break stuff. To destroy things. Its weird.

Any advice?

Im 28 y/o male, btw. Had a somewhat traumatic past I never delt with. The feelings just kind of faded away after awhile and I got on with life. Im wondering if this means they're still there.",23May2019,1

My second attempt I tried vaping but got frustrated with the process. Every time I felt like I was making progress the pens would crap out or break. Went back to smoking after about 3 months as well.

161,"Long but necessary (promise it's some Hot Drama)

So basically I'm a university student studying history and computer science, and when looking for summer work my dad, a big wig at the company he works at, sent out my resume to a historical conservation department his company was working with. Some time passed, my resume ended up being passed around his company, and I was called in for an interview. The guy interviewing me was in charge of hiring me too, and while he was nice he either didn't understand what I was saying despite my best attempt at explaining OR decided to just ignore what I was saying. 

My first day was today, and I'm introduced to the woman who is my main overseer. She starts asking me what I know, about my qualifications. I was watching her work on this massively huge and complicated excel spreadsheet, so I mentioned that I know NOTHING about excel. She sorta just looks puzzled and goes ""oh huh that's strange"". I was confused but oh god did I find out why in a meeting with the entire work team a few mins later.

Before this meeting, I had a very vague description of what my job was. The man who hired me, our project manager, introduces me as an ""EXPERT in database programs"". Explaining further, he somehow interpreted from me telling him that I study computer science and saying I have an interest in database PROGRAMMING,  that I was some sort of wiz kid at excel.

I have no experience with excel- it's not even on my resume. The work I've been hired to do is beyond just basic quick learning of it; the woman I'm working under/with is a true expert, and I'm supposed to be at almost her level. And the database that is being built from the spreadsheet is so huge there can be virtually no mistakes. 

I'm not just UNDERqualified, I'm UNqualified. I'm honestly a bit mad too, my project manager's disregard has put me in a very difficult situation. I under no circumstances implied that I have worked with database programs before. I have no idea what to do. Do I just wait for them to discover I'm incompetent? That seems shameful. Do I quit now and leave gracefully?

This is my first (and probably last) time going on Reddit, I decided to share my story and ask for advice on this forum because I have nothing else to do and honestly I can't really be 100% vulnerable with anyone in my life as it is. So here we go, throughout my entire life I have never been the best at anything, I have never even strived to be number 1 although I have wanted to be. I am not super passionate about anything really and that bothers me. I have the tools to have an amazing life and all I do is lay in my bed for hours on end watching Netflix, eating food, and thinking about what I could be doing while making excuses for why I'm not. I'm currently in high school and have a good amount of friends, my grades are fine and I have been in a few relationships, however, I feel disconnected from everyone else in a way I can't begin to describe. I wouldn't describe myself as edgy or even rebellious, I don't drink or do drugs even while all my friends are. My only reason for not partaking is that I want a future devoid of those things for reasons unknown to me. To get back on track I am a high school student, tall, not especially fit, and not especially pretty in all honesty I'm not proud of who I am and I think that is the main reason for why I am on here today, I am asking for advice on how to clean up my life. I crave something more than what I am currently going through. I have the ability to see something isn't right, however, I don't do anything about it, I'm just watching helplessly on the sideline as my life goes down the drain.

Last year I went to visit him after he moved away from my town and he told me he had a 13 year old girlfriend and since he was 18 at the time, he asked me to refer to her as 16 to anyone else (Legal consent age).

Yesterday I visited him again and he's now living with her and they sleep in the same bed. I instantly got scared, but kept my cool having trust in him that he would do the right thing.

168,"I got a job at McDonalds and today, at 7:30 AM was my first day actually working. Before I got the job my parents kept telling me almost every day how I’ll have to walk around and stand for several hours. I figured I would be fine since if I’m working the drive-thru, cashier, or making burgers, I’d be standing the whole time and I have no trouble doing that. Well, today I was trained to do various things like taking trays when people are done eating and cleaning them with a rag, serving food to guests at their tables, wiping tables down when guests leave their tables, cleaning the windows, sweeping, and mopping. Serving food to customers, taking trays to clean, washing tables and sweeping were all very easy and I really liked meeting different people and everyone there was honestly very nice. But literally an hour later my legs started getting tired, I was sweating bullets, I got tired/groggy and all I could think about was how much time has passed and when I would leave so I could just lay down, watch tv, and play video games. I’m pretty sure I went into the bathroom about 4-5 times so I could sit for a couple of minutes until I got my energy levels back up and one other time to text my mom telling her I can't do this, its too much work, I can't walk around this long, etc. She told me I needed to go back to work and stick it out because I had 2 hours left. The girl training me asked like 2 or 3 times are you sure you can handle this job? and are you sure you can handle this job by yourself? She did say later on though that she was the same on her first day and soon she got used to it. 

 Eventually, it was 10:30 (lunchtime) and lunch breaks are 30 minutes long at this McDonalds. I clocked out at 11:00 AM, ate a small meal, and wait for my grandma and cousin to pick me up, since my mom couldn't pick me up. 

 I ended up texting my boss later on in the day about how the clock in/clock out thing didn't work and she said thank you and told me she would get it taken care of, then she asked how it went today. I told her how in the beginning it was great but then, later on, I felt exhausted, tired, and sweaty. She told me what I'm doing is only temporary and that I will be trained to do the cashier and drive-thru. She didn't tell me when though. I asked if the reason I couldn't work those positions yet was because of not having my hepatitis records yet and she said no its because your dad requested that we start this training slow. 

Anyway, enough rambling. I want to know if there are any tips or tricks for when you’re walking around/standing all day at work. I should probably also mention that this is the first time in months that I’ve actually walked around and actually done anything besides being on my ass watching youtube, eating junk food, playing video games and doing shit on my phone. I’ve recently started to try and eat better and tried cutting out soda but I started drinking soda again. Once I cut soda and energy drinks out completely and started tracking my calories/things I ate,  I felt better and slightly more energized. I was in a better mood as well. About two days ago though I ate a huge meal (2 party pizzas, a king size take five bar, and some fruit punch) and after I ate it I became very tired and was suddenly in a shitty mood for some reason. Maybe it was my bodys way of telling me I should stop eating that way? 

 Another thing I should probably mention is I have a heart defect so that’s mostly the reason why my parents are telling the people at McDonalds to take it slow on me.

172,"So this story is long and complex and please consider all the variables before replying. This is a complicated time in my life and this is a problem I am not taking lightly. I'll keep most of the details, but I am willing to respond to follow-up questions that could help your ability to give me advise because this is such a complex issue. 

I distinctly remember (and have always had memories of this, not a ""recovered"" memory situation) several occasions where my dad sexually abused me as a very young child (around 3-8 &amp; I will spare you the details). Because I was a child and did not how to process this or even understand what was happening to me, I never said anything. In my adolescent years, he would not touch me sexually 'per se' but we would have ""tickle fights"" and such that would make me uncomfortable and I voiced those concerns. Those concerns were never taken seriously by either of my parents. One time he took a picture of my in the shower (never left my doors unlocked after that one) and various other very obviously creepy and gross things till I was about 13 and finally realized that I could just lock the damn doors. Throughout my childhood I was definitely deemed a ""daddy's girl"" and kept that persona going because I felt safe in it. I felt like I was in control of the way others perceived me and I secretly new that he was a sack of shit. Throughout high school it remained in my memory but that shit wasn't happening anymore so it was all fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward - its the summer after Sophomore year of college. I went home for the summer and this is when real feelings about the abuse came up. It was the first time since I went to college that I spent a serious amount of time with my parents again - this turned out to be a terrible idea. Because now I was completely rude and honestly lashing out at my dad in ways that my mom didn't understand why. One night, she we had a conversation about my dad and I told her that I just did not trust him (for various other random reasons I gave her) and was planning on leaving it at that. THEN she fucking asked me if he had ever ""touched me"" and I was like, well actually yeah. Then all hell broke loose. My mom keeps telling me that well if they get a divorce, I will loose my scholarship (dad's in the military so my college is free so who the fuck would give that up?) and he'll probably go to jail, and X Y &amp;Z bad things will happen. So then SHE goes and tells him what I just told her and we have one of those long ass discussions, as every family does, and we come to the conclusion that we need a therapist. Two things about this therapist - 1. SHES MY MOM'S BEST FRIEND'S MOM &amp; 2. One of the first things she tells my mom is that sometimes children don't understand the events how they actually happen and they could also have false memories.....WHAT THE FUCK LADY HOW IS THIS HELPING. I'm not going to even explain the actual Psychology on this one (oh, did I mention I graduated with a major in Psych focusing in child development and trauma?)  or explain myself and how victim blaming is the absolute shittiest thing a person can do in situations like these?

&amp;#x200B;

So I FINALLY get home and quit seeing that psychologist ASAP. And the long and short of it is this CURRENTLY:

1. my dad refuses to admit to anything
2. my mom thinks that ""something happened"" to me (whatever tf that means) but it definitely wasn't my dad
3. I'm completely sticking with everything I claimed - because its facts
4. that therapist is unprofessional af
5. communication has been shit
6. my parents fully (besides my 20hr/week job) support me financially
7. in August I will start grad school and become financially independent, but stay on their health insurance (but I'm gonna still pay for it)
8. they constantly tell me they love and support me and do so......but also don't believe a really large part of my truth and this is a topic of discussion that (obviously comes up all the time) causes a LOT of emotional pain and a lot of feelings about the trauma itself
9. I get nightmares for at least a week after every time I see them

&amp;#x200B;

It's now the summer after graduation.....still trying to work on my communication with my mom and it's actually been going really well. Every couple of months; however, when I mention something about the abuse, she tells me what this therapist says, that she doesn't believe me because there's no ""proof"", and asks me what I want her to do (she wants me to tell her to divorce my dad so she doesn't have to make the decision, but I'm not about to tell her how to live her life because she's having a hard time dealing with her conscience). BUT (HUGE BUT HERE) this time she drops a bomb on me that blows me away - she was also sexually abused by a family member when she was little. She never told anyone except my dad and apparently didn't think it was relevant information. SO in the context of this conversation (the one about me making everything up and there being no proof) I asked her if there was any proof that this happened to her and how she would feel if her mom didn't believe her. She got PISSED. Like never even answered the question and just completely avoided it. and she FINALLY admitted to not believing me (because at this point she only said she was ""Switzerland"" and didn't not believe me or my dad and explained that it must have been someone else because she found no proof). Then as I emotionally shut down because all my hard work toward good communication has now gone out the fucking window (apparently). 

&amp;#x200B;

I AM SO DONE. This is absolutely not the first time we have had this conversation and I feel that in the context of her  similar childhood experience and complete lack of validation from her, I want to go ahead and bite the bullet. I want to tell them to politely fuck off and never talk with them again. Proposed plan of action: tell them to fuck off, do not take anything from them, tell other family members to ask them if they want to know why I don't talk to them anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: emotional stability, complete independence (so their financial bullshit isn't hanging over me anytime we get into a fight), I'll finally feel a sense of freedom, space to restore and reflect without their bullshit ass noise, don't have to respond to my mom's bullshit; family gatherings are already awkward af so nothing will really change there

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: I only have 2 mo. with them, I've done it this long so whats a couple months?; have to explain myself to family members; I won't have the money they promised to me once I go to grad school; loss of relationship with mom

173,"Hi all, I know this post would seems like pathetic.  In high school I had crush on this girl. At that time I told her that I like her and stuff, but she rejected me. However, we remained a good friends. We still talk from time to time. 

The thing is I still like her, maybe even love her. She is the most beautiful and sweetest girl I ever met. I want to open up to her again. The problem is I don't know if she even likes me or cares about me; I guess I will never know until I open up. Also, she lives in ankther country. So, I think even if she shares same feelings as I; I don't think it is going to work out until I move there. (I planning to move out there to start a life if my current plans ((totally unrelated to this subject)) didn't work out)

So I want your advices kind redditers. Do I try to forget about her? Or open up when I go visit her; move to her country? Or open up on social media? Or do I just pretend there is no feeling and enjoy the friendship? When will be the best time to open up to her?",23May2019,1
175,"Long story short. I have an opportunity for my dream job in Stamford, Connecticut. I live in New Mexico currently and am self employed and barely making ends meet. So taking the job would require an expensive relocation. I do not currently have the money to fully relocate and the company will only reimburse some relocation costs after maintaining the job for 6 months. So I was considering, if i were to take it, getting a small loan from family members for work clothes and a flight, flying to Stamford, and being homeless for the first few weeks on the job while I save money for a place to live, using laundromats for laundry and a gym for showers and a locker. I would be the only one going so I'm sure I can feed myself pretty cheap, and keep hygienic at a reasonable price too. What do you think? If you were in my shoes, would you take the leap?

177,"From how she has made it seem, she doesn't have much respect for me because I am friends with him. He is a bit offensive and gets his foot stuck in his mouth often. He has upset me on a number of occasions because of his inability to think before speaking. Despite this, he makes me laugh, keeps me on my toes, and will always apologize when I bring to his attention that something he said was hurtful. 

She thinks I just make excuses for him. She has also been on the receiving end to his offensive jokes, and finds them much less funny than I do. She thinks he's a straight up jerk.

She has never made it clear that how she feels about him affects the friendship she has with me. So what happened next was incredibly surprising to me. In the past he made an inappropriate comment about a family member of hers. I must have tried to explain to her that it was just a joke, while inappropriate, he didn't actually mean what he said. 

The other night she approached me and directed a lot of anger at me. She threatened my life- she told me that if I ever disrespected her family that she would kill me. I have never been on the receiving end of death threats before, I was stunned and very upset.

He might not be perfect, he says some dumb shit and is basically a small boy in a man's body, but he isn't a bad person.

What I do know is he has never given me a death threat before. Since the fight, I sent her a message saying that I was still upset about her death threats. That I never found his jokes about her family funny, and was sorry if that was how it came off. It made little sense. I asked her to talk to me if my actions/behaviours were upsetting, so that we could figure out a solution and clear the air. 

She basically responded with a ""i'll respond to you if i find the time"" and this was yesterday. 

I'm not sure what to think. I am seriously questioning my friendships with her, and with him, and myself. Surely a reaction that strong must be based in some sort of truth- yet then I realize she actually found it necessary to threaten my life, and all credibility is sort of lost.

What. Do.",23May2019,1
178,"I'm actually above average height. I'm 6 feet 0 inches tall and I'm smart in some classes (Mainly Biology and World History). I'm finishing 9th grade right now. The thing is my GPA is really low because of my laziness. I don't have any friends. Also I've never been with a girl before. I've never even kissed a girl before. And I'm skinny fat. 

A few months ago when I was in school alone by myself I would sometimes get sad thinking those things but lately I've made myself not think about it (I learned about stoicism). I get really mad when I see idiots who always ask me about answers in class go up and talk to girls like it's nothing and get respect. I get really mad that most of my friends have been in a relationship while I never was. I get mad that even people who look worse than me have kissed someone before. 

I used to go to they gym in my building almost everyday to work out but I don't think I'm ever going to get to what I want to look like. I would do a hundred crunches, bench press 30 pounds 150 times, and run 4.5 on the treadmill for 20 minutes. I would get really tired and skip for 2-3 days until I do it again. 

When lunch starts for me I have nobody to sit with. I would look at people in my class that I talk to who would sit with their own friends in lunch. When I try to sit with a new group people would be quiet and would barely talk to me. People that I want to be friends don't even care about me wanting to talk to them and would talk to their ""friends"". Like this girl who I wanted to be friends with that is still friends with a guy who peed on another guy in the bathroom and got suspended for 2 days. Since I have no one to talk to I go to the media center in my school to read stuff on Reddit and Quora and watch Youtube videos. 

I think that one reason that I don't have anyone to talk in school was because I join any clubs or sports. In the beginning of the year I wanted to join football but I realized that I didn't wanna get tortured and be in risk of getting a concussion so I didn't join. I also tried out for basketball but I didn't get in. 

My Spanish teacher was one reason why my GPA is low because she would make everything harder for me and would give help to people she personally liked. Also in English and Math I would be lazy and forget to do things or purposefully not do them. 

I'm planning to try better next year and raise up my GPA. I'm also looking to take a break this Summer and focus on making myself better for next year. I'm switching to French and I'm also planning to learn Geometry on Khan Academy for an hour a day to get knowledge for what I'm doing next year. Also I am planning to get a job and sleep better (I constantly go to sleep at (11-12 PM). I also will still go to the gym and exercise and build muscle so I can join cross country and try my luck in basketball again.

Nevertheless I feel like a loser. I feel like a loser in a lot of things I did this year. I plan on trying harder to make friends next year but I don't think things will get better. What do you think about this? What should I do?",23May2019,1

To fulfill a dark fantasy of hers, she actively goes out through the worst parts of her area to satisfy her rape fantasy. She does this often, as in a day she would either find 3-5 different people, group or not, to have their way with her.

he makes music. he’s pretty good, but he doesn’t have many fans just his friends. he has like 8 followers on an app. and i don’t care about that, it’s just weird (you’ll understand after i explain everything)

he told me today he has a gig at a pretty big venue in a few months. first i thought umm how is that possible. no offense he just hasn’t gotten his publicity break yet. and so i went to the venue website and i looked at the concerts for that month. and every month. he isn’t there. 

he seems to REALLY like me, we talked for hours on the phone and stuff. he compliments me a million times every day. at first i thought he might just be playing me. but he spent hours on the phone with me right? he would spend time with me? 

but right now i’m kinda doubting it. 

he has like 7 songs. i think all of them are original- except one. the other day he sent me a link to the song and said “i just wrote the best song.” i thought it was amazing-

but today because of the concert thing things felt fishy so i looked up the lyrics to that song. and what do you know. it’s someone else’s song- entirely. i looked up the lyrics to his other songs and they don’t come up so i guess those are original. 

everything else about him is perfect but these two things. i would like him regardless abt him having a concert. i don’t know why he would lie about this. why he would steal someone’s song. 

i’ve yet to confront him about it- i don’t know if i should. i feel he would just block me out of embarrassment..

if he lied to me about this, what if he’s playing me? what if he doesn’t like me? is everything just a lie?

or was he just trying to impress me and this wasn’t ill-willed. i’m so confused. my heart is torn. i was falling for him. now i don’t know what to think- i need other people’s opinions. 

thanks :(

tl;dr: a guy i’ve been talking to online who i’m falling for REALLY seems to like me. we’re perfect together. he makes music. i found out he lied about having a gig and he stole a song from someone claiming it as his own (his other songs are his original pieces i think). i have yet to confront him about it, i don’t know if i should. if he lied to me about this could he be lying about liking me and could he be playing me? what should i do/what should i think?? thank you :/",23May2019,1

198,"So I should preface that I’m a very anxious and shy person and have I very low self confidence- so these mistakes could have been avoided if I didn’t have these issues. Throw in being a newish employee and adjusting to my new state after recently moving 4,000 miles away from home. 

So my job: I am the assistant of the merchandising manager at my company. first mistake- I was tasked with creating a company bulletin by one of my company’s buyers. I wrote something up and emailed the draft to the buyer- she thought it looked good and wanted me to post it to our company website and send out to each store. My manager needed to approve of the bulletin before hand, so I emailed her the draft and asked if it looked okay to send out. She never responded to my email, and as her assistant, I should have reminded her. But as I was shy and new at the company, I didn’t want to seem annoying, since she is literally the most busy person in my department and has so many more pressing matters to attend to. This was back in January. I completely forgot about it and discovered today that I still never followed up. The buyer who initially asked for the bulletin never inquired about the status either. I am mortified. I have no idea how I should proceed. I did my part, but I feel completely responsible since I should have reminded my manager about my email. 

Second mistake (of course both would happen at the same time): back in February, I ordered promotional advertising for our stores for Valentine’s Day. I make the purchase orders but the adverts go to the store operations manager. Apparently the printing company screwed up and the advertisement needed to be reprinted. The operations manager refused to pay for the bad print job. Printing company complied and said they would reprint... and I never heard back from the printing company or the operations manager that the new advertisements were received (I guess I wasn’t copied on the emails- she has a bad habit of leaving me out of the loop). Now since I created the purchase orders, I need to receive them and turn the paperwork into finance. I assumed we were not paying for the job because I never heard anything about it, and my purchase order was never flagged by finance as being still open during end of the month closing (they send an excel file every month with all open purchase orders and mine was never listed) this seemed to confirm in my mind that the purchase order was obsolete. Of course, being shy, I never followed up to confirm any of this. Long story short- not the case, we still were issued an invoice for the print job and now it is 4 months late to finance. I went ahead and received the purchase order, but now I’m afraid to turn it in to finance because I know I will get in trouble for it being so late. 

How should I handle both of these issues? Should I address them on separate days so both mistakes don’t come to light on the same day and compound? I have to address the finance issue first, so should I tell my manager about the bulletin on another day? How would you handle this?",23May2019,0

200,"25F I have an interview tomorrow to work under social workers at a clinic. This will be great job experience for me because I’m going to college for social work. I’ve only ever worked in fast food and I was in the military.

I’m very nervous. I want this job, and I don’t want to mess it up. I bought new clothes just for this interview and I made a folder with all of my documents. I plan to arrive 15 minutes early. Is there anything I’m missing or forgetting? 

Also, is it okay to appear very eager for the job? I’ve had a difficult time finding a job like this nearby, and I want the experience. It’s much less for the money, and more because I’m passionate about the work and haven’t worked in this field yet.

204,"We are both guys.  It’s an embarrassing thing to even ask.  I’m 21 &amp; the guy was 17.  No, we did not have a sexual relationship.  I am not a predator &amp; I’m sure as hell not going to jail over a quick fuck.  

I met him when I was a lot younger through my mom’s best friend.   Eventually, as I got a little older they let me babysit him when they’d go out.  Which I didn’t mind, I literally had no social life or obligations 🤷‍♂️ so I didn’t mind playing video games with a kid, watching TV, whatever.  It kept me company too, ya know?  

Well, we stopped doing that about 3 years ago when his mom felt he was old enough to be home alone.  I admittedly got attached to him.  Not romantically, but like a little brother.  So we’d still hang out &amp; whatnot quite a lot, and he’d always ask me for advice on friends, school, life etc.

I wasn’t aware of his feelings until the end of last year when he’d been drinking.  He confessed everything in a sloppy drunken text.  I was super nice about it &amp; understanding bc we all know how that shit hurts.  Instead he got clingier with me.  He would always question why we can’t be together &amp; didn’t like any of my answers.  

Within the past two months he had gotten really sexual towards me.  Going on about how much he wants to fuck me, sometimes grabbing my ass, trying to kiss me etc. and I’d always yell at him for doing these things.  I never made him feel like it was okay AT ALL.  

Well, one night we’re playing PS4.  Our moms are out at a winery so it’s just us.  It starts by him getting me to look at him &amp; then forcing a kiss on me.   I push him back, and tell him to cut that shit out, or I’m leaving.  So, he gets up and he locks the door.  At this point I just grab my bag off the bed &amp; try to force myself past him but... yeah I really couldn’t.  

The thing is I’ve been on E for the past 10 months.  Nobody knows.  But I am a weak ass bitch.  He’s also a bit taller than me.  And it’s honestly really embarrassing to even admit this to anybody.   But he held me down and forced me to have anal sex with him.  Didn’t even use a condom, or lube.  I bled quite a bit, and he finished inside me.   

He started crying afterwards saying he didn’t mean to, and he won’t ever do it again.  That he never wanted to hurt me.  I was speechless, and stayed quiet.  Then he started saying if I tell anyone he’ll say I was the one who initiated.  And that nobody will believe me because he’s the minor.   

I’m just really lost &amp; I’m hurt because that was my friend ??  My fucking friend man.  I don’t want to see him in jail, he’s a kid.  And I don’t want to go to jail.  Fuck I don’t know what to do.",23May2019,287
205,"Throwaway acct for obvious reasons 

Every once in a while, for some reason or another, I get suspicions that my girlfriend is cheating on me. Usually there isnt really any substance behind my suspicions, but recently a weird, kind of sus thing happened

Most recently, it had to do w lube. My gf and I used one brand of lube and it was absolutely great, worked like a charm. We eventually ran out of that and began using a new, different brand.

The lube is always kept at her house in her drawer.

We used this lube, it didnt feel as good, but there never seemed to be a problem. We had one or two more rounds left in the bottle it seemed.

Just under a week ago, I was reaching for the lube again, and I pulled out an unopened bottle of the first brand.

I asked her why the new brand, and she said she liked it more

I left it at that, until later, the situation still felt weird to me

She started off by saying that the lube left a mess and she didnt like it

I texted her about it asking her why she wouldnt say anything if wed been using the lube for a long time... never a peep about why she didnt like it

She says she was going through her drawer one day, decided that the last time wed used the lube was the last straw, and she threw it away and went to target to get the first brand we used

It just seemed odd to me that she wouldnt have even talked to me about switching back, or at the very least told me that she did make the switch before I opened the drawer

She said she felt hurt that I would even suggest she cheated but the situation is so odd. It seems like a decent probability that she had some guy over, used what was left of the bottle (one or two squeezes) and then went to get another bottle afterwards. But she just decides to tell me NOW that she didnt like the lube?

210,"Not much to say besides I’m at a point in life where everything has gone wrong and has been going to complete shit over the past few months. I moved to the US about 3 years ago now, back where I’m from I was super connected with family, they were my best friends and my uncle was a father figure to me considering I never had one. My father was a psychopath and abusive beyond what words can describe. He was so abusive I have little recollection of my childhood.

My uncle grew up as a father to me. As soon as I moved here, they cut contact with me almost entirely for 3 years now. These people were everything to me and I was alone once I moved here. I had vertigo earlier this year and was handicapped for months, I couldn’t even take my dog on a walk, it spiraled me into a vast depression. I’ve been with my girlfriend of over 2 years, we’ve been going through a rough patch recently but I was finally able to schedule a time to go home for a while and she was going to come with me. We budgeted everything together alongside our return, she’s had a lot of deaths the past year and it’s weighed down heavily on her. The past few months she’s taken a lot of that out on me and it’s been progressively getting worse. A lot of shit has been going down with my job and I’m unsure whether or not I can keep working there, they haven’t paid me in forever.. She said she didn’t want to be together anymore, which is whatever I guess, problem is she tells me this almost a week before I leave and entirely cancelled my ticket. I got the ticket for so beyond cheap at the time, $500, now tickets are upwards of $2,000 to go home and I can’t afford that. I’m already balls deep in medical bills because of my vertigo so I’ve been almost broke the better part of the year. I’ve been extremely depressed and for the first time in my life, suicidal. Now all this shit happens and odds are I can’t see my family anymore as she cancelled me ticket over a week ago so there’s no getting that back. On top of the mental shit she’s put me through my life has driven me insane, I hate this. I don’t want to continue living and due to unique work circumstances I don’t have insurance. I need mental help, someone to talk to, something before stuff possibly goes severely downhill. I haven’t seen my mother and sister in years, have been abandoned by the rest, fucked over by medical stuff, fucked over by work, fucked over by my “girlfriend”, mentally fucked over by her, I can’t handle this anymore. I just need help for once in my god damn life, somebody, I can’t afford any costs for medical care. I have no money atm, I haven’t been paid by my fucking job, it’s entirely chaos, because of all the medical debt I can’t just move out, I don’t have much money saved up. At this point I may just go homeless as well. This was entirely out of the blue and is the last thing I expected from her, to fuck me over a week before I’m supposed to go home. I was going to get all the help I needed there, feel great after seeing my family, now that’s gone. I’m scared. I don’t know what to do.",23May2019,1

My friends have also noticed this and said he may be interested in me. They say sometimes he’ll look at me and say that we’re always taking. There’s also been a few things said such as remarks by his friend saying “*he* likes her” in front of us both or which my friend said, his friend talking to him about telling her I like him.

He then asked me if I knew why my ex-bestfriend was getting involved know even though she knew that he and this other girl have been talking to each other for a few months. My ex- best friend is doing this because she knows I like him and she also knows I hate being the relationship advice giver to my crush. So I tried to beat around the bush but finally he's like please tell me since it involves me. I told him the truth but not 100%. I told him that I used to like him and that I'm over him. He told me that I was super kind and a good friend. That he also appreciated I didn't try to ruin his relationship with the girl he has a thing with. He then uses the ""I value you and I value our friendship"" and then proceeded to apologize. I know all to well that line is the most classic friendzone line I've even used it before. It was just unexpected to be put in the friend zone.

My friends know me for my humor, tendency to make stupid decisions (we all get a good laugh out of everything), and my borderline obnoxious laughter (constant).

I'm a very genuine person and want to share all the joy I can. My personality is very strong and it's hard to miss me.

Why is it when I'm getting to meet new people I hardly talk? It's embarrassing. It's like I dissociate completely and just observe everyone else's conversations. I only rarely let my real personality peek through with new people, it took me about a month to be able to start conversations with other people at my job.

This last time has hit me harder than usual because not only did I have to step down due to my increased levels of anxiety but instantly they promoted my girlfriend. Now don't get me wrong she has had management experience before and my problem isn't that she is progressing, it's more that straight after my manager told me that she would be promoted( something I already knew as I was the one who told she should go for it) he started cracking jokes that now 'I'm her bitch' and he started trying to get me to work in the kitchen instead of out front where I have for years. And the whole situation just makes me feel like this time around I'm being pushed out. The only reason I was feeling stressed about my promotion was because the shifts I was doing I had no other management as support so everytime an issue came up like half of the staff calling in sick on the Saturday evening witch is busiest day off the week and I had to try solving every issue whether it was complaining from customer or staff everyone was looking to me to have the answers, and I was doing well until I went to close and then one of the managers who had her shift covered by my other half so  she could go to a party decided to shout at me about how even though the bar was almost empty and there was no staff working but myself I couldn't close earlier. Which left me feeling like I was just a failure who can't do anything right, so in a moment of stress and anxiety I made a decision I now regret because I feel like I am going to be stuck at the bottom of the business forever, while having to rely on my other half to pay the bills and even though I'm quite progressive it makes me feel like I'm not a real man.

227,"I have been working as a contact employee at my current office for around 3 1/2 years. Small office, just me, two attorneys and the receptionist. Attorneys and I have always gotten along great and developed friendships over the years. I don’t get healthcare or benefits but my work hours and days are super flexible. 

I’m not a fan of the receptionist, in fact she’s a big reason why I’m leaving. She would interrupt me to talk constantly (literally for hours at a time) and significantly decreased my productivity. I tried to handle it on my own, but failed. Asked for help but the attorneys never really did anything about it. My Frustration mounted. 

I recently got an opportunity to do a little part time work for a family friend’s new business. I told the attorneys about my new schedule and what I was doing while we were out to drinks celebrating some birthdays. Then the next week, I reminded them the new schedule was starting. I did only one week of part time hours at the family friend’s business and they offered me a salaried position with PTO and health benefits. I accepted the offer this past Saturday and gave my two week notice right away. 

They’ve been loading me up with too much work for a while so I have been super behind on tasks. When I gave my notice I asked them to lay off new assignments so I could make sure I finished everything that had already been assigned to me before I left. I told them I wanted to leave them in the best possible position with no work left incomplete. 

They have been SUPER shitty to me since I gave notice and the office is increasingly uncomfortable for me now. My heart is broken because I truly cared for the attorneys as people and worked really hard for them during my time there. They kinda turned on me and I’m extremely hurt by their reactions because I considered them to friends.

I'm totally guilty so I'm ready to take my punishment which, since its my first violation, is probably a zero on the assignment and a letter grade drop, but what I also didn't realize is my friend was also contacted for suspicion of sharing answers. They talked with me and I just felt so bad I truly thought I changed enough to deter any possibility of copying but clearly I'm dumb and they caught me and I got my friend in trouble. I told them that I was willing to do anything to help them clear their name and take responsibility for my own wrongdoing.

233,"Recently found out I got something funky going on with my gut, Crohn’s disease or something. 

Not gonna go into the gruesome details but I found this out on Tuesday. 

Regrettably I have had to take the rest of the week off from my new job - a job in which doesn’t handle sicknesses lightly. They don’t even pay for sickness. I’ve seen people fired on my team for taking too much time off sick. 

So I’m genuinely stressed about being ill and worried I’m gonna get fired! What actions can I take to secure my job, prevent myself from being unjustly fired and make sure I’m not shafted by any of the managers?  Should I join a union? How do I do that?",23May2019,1
235,"So my dad is a very intelligent guy. Until it comes to money. So anyway, he retired early on SS, which I’m happy for him. But he also did so without a place of his own (he was living with his girlfriend at the time) or any money in savings. That relationship dissolved,  and he’s become somewhat of a gypsy now. He just floats around the country to stay with family until he overstays his welcome and moves on. 

Now we have a very young child, and another family member already here in our 3 bd house. We have a den that he can stay in, but I always tell him a week at most. He usually ends up staying two. I love my dad and want to help him, but I don’t want to facilitate his poor life choices. Last time he was here, he said he wanted to get his own place, so my wife gave him papers to fill out for senior housing (what he wanted). He had almost two weeks to do so, never read them, and left them on the kitchen table when he left. And now he wants us to find him a hotel around here (we live in a tourist town) for $500 a month, which is about 300 dollars short of somewhere we’d rather he not stay for his safety. 

We make a decent living, but we always try to be smart with our money. We can not afford to help him at that cost, or we’d have to dip into our own savings- something he should have  but probably gambled or drank or smoked away. 

I want to see him as much as I can, because I worry about how long his lifestyle is going to last, and I want him to know his granddaughter, and of course, I love him, but I also don’t feel like we are quite old enough to be in the sandwich generation yet; he should’ve been able to last at least a few years on his own. 

Am I wrong? Should I let him stay here in our full house, which will put a further strain on my wife and I, should we offer an extra few hundred bucks for him to stay a month nearby, and put a strain on our finances for the month whilst trying to save money and put money away for our child and house? Am I being ridiculous here?

238," 

Buckle up, it’s my first long post and it’s about the mess I’m in and I’m in a jumbled mental state right now. 

I (27) had untreated manic depression (highs and lows of feeling like garbage and hating myself) since about 12 years old. Finally at the end of last year I got some cheap insurance to be able to see a therapist and doctor to start dealing with everything. I’ve been on meds about 5 months now and things are feeling a more manageable sad. 

However, 

Since January I have not had stable work. Left my job because it was toxic and I thought I would be able to find something easy. From January to March I was using up all my savings to pay rent while in a severely depressed state. It was so bad I was wearing only one set of clothes per week during that time and barely doing anything. End of March and I’m starting dog walking and worked 3 conventions, Barely making ends meet. I’ve had to borrow money ($1100) from family to stay afloat and pay bills all while I was seriously looking for jobs but I can’t do that anymore. I’m ashamed I had to borrow money and they can’t help me anymore anyways. 

I can’t really get groceries either and in my depressed state I didn’t try to follow up on food stamps because I felt like I was taking away from someone who needs it. 

Here’s the deal. Rent is due on the 1st and is $680. I haven't’ been able to pay my health insurance which is now overdue and need to be paid in full for $175. I only have $100 in my account. I may have some $300 headed my way in the form of savings bonds.

The thing is my grandparents are being moved into assisted living due to declining health and mobility issues. I live in IL and grandparents are in MN. My mother flew me in for real cheap since i’m only a few states away to help her. GP are leaving a lot of stuff behind and I’m thinking that since it’s being dumped anyway I can sell it and MAYBE pay rent!  

I get there and apparently my grandma’s sister has essentially taken over and they already tossed many things that later I found out were not meant to be. I show up and first thing she does is blow up at me. Calmly take her tantrum as she threatens to leave my mother and I to deal with the rest. I told her fine and take over. Thankfully no art was tossed but some nice older cameras were. 

I was stuck between helping mom pack stuff for GP new place and watching them while my mom did legal stuff and got them set up at the assisted living place. 

They’re moved in, I had to move my flight TBD. I need to be back to pay rent or I’m Eff’d in the A. Still don’t have enough cash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr;

Depression stink for 3 months kills $$ and motivation to find job. Have few gigs but no bites on real work. Family loaned as much as they can(1100$). Not enough money to pay rent on the 1st. Helping GP move to Assisted living and trying to sell things they can’t take. Rent (630$) due in one week. Have 100$.

241,"I live in the Middle East. In Lebanon to be specific. Job opportunities are hard to find and everyone is homophobic af (especially my parents), meanwhile I'm bi/ace. (Biromantic asexual) 

I've grown up with an abusive yet loving father, that just didn't know how to be a father, and a very nice mother but extremely close minded at the same time. My little brother annoys me all the time and I cannot spend a day without being annoyed by him. I have been planning on immigrating to Europe after months of planning but I'm not sure if leaving my family behind would be a good choice. I have planned on cutting contact with my dad if he keeps harassing me this much, but I don't know how much that'll affect my relationship with my mom and how to contact her. My cousin is planning on coming with me once she finishes uni in Lebanon and she's the daughter of my dad's sister, again, not sure how much cutting contact from my dad will affect our relationship and her future. (She's my best and only friend irl) Or any possible abuse that might happen at home, my relationship with my grandmothers, aunts and uncles.

If I keep contact with my dad, he will harass me through the phone. I know he will. And I don't know how much home abuse that'll cause to my brother or mother. When I proposed continuing college in America, he got pissed off because he doesn't want me to leave home. I will not go to Europe with his permission, as that is impossible. As an adult I can leave -- with legal papers and stuff all done -- without needing his permission.

What should I do? I really cannot stay here because of my sexuality and no jobs, I hate the people and I don't have friends. I never came out to anyone about being bi/ace and if I did I'll get massive hate. My dad threatened to kick me if I'd come out as gay countless times, too.

While we're on the topic, any advice on immigration? How hard is it, what should I do, how should I handle situations? As an Arabian I expect quite a bit of discrimination and hate, but besides that I don't know what to expect.",23May2019,2

245,"The past year,  myself and others have noticed that I’ve been acting different. This has been causing me to lose confidence and have found myself to be socially awkward around friends I’ve known for years. (Sorry If this is long, but it all goes with the story and my problems).

background information:
     In the summer of 2017, I was doing music and started to make my first mixtape/album on SoundCloud. I was working on it for most of the summer and occasionally went to a lot of parties with my friends and was living my best life. At this time I just graduated Middle School and was one of the most popular people in my grade at the time. This was by far my best summer ever because it was filled with parties, hanging with friends, and love. In August, about 2 weeks before my freshman year of High School started, I dropped my debut mixtape/album and basically I wanted to drop it then leave social media or the spotlight for about a week to sleep and regain energy because I was burnt out after recording and became sick after it was all done. So I just didn’t really go on my phone and social media(which is like the lifeline in middle school) but I talked with my friends through texts after they congratulated me for my effort and the project. A week later, I came back and everyone was like “let’s go” and “the tracks are epic Sean” and I was pleased with their reactions. And of course they were people hating but that never really got under my skin, there was also a diss track made on me and I came back with another diss but that beef was all for fun and knew the friend for a long time. In this short time, my friend was having a party for the McGregor/Mayweather fight and I was excited because I’m a huge McGregor fan and Irish. So this party was happening a week or so before High School started and it was fun, and I really stood out and was basically “the party”. This party signals the end of summer for me and a new adventure for me in High School.

     Summer is now over and I finally enter through my high school’s halls. The first two months go smoothly as like I never left the middle school, I was the class clown, befriended some upperclassmen, and was basically the same kid. October comes around and this is usually the month I love, because it’s my birthday month! So I wanted to do something different this month and became inspired by my favorite YouTuber KSI. If you didn’t know he left YouTube at the start of 2017 and took like 4 months off and became very distant and secretive in that time. He blacked out all his social media and deleted some YouTube videos with millions of views. When he came back around June of 2017 he dropped a EP where the point of it was about evolving from his past self and basically “changing”. I became inspired by this, because I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again and also I didn’t like some of the cringy shit I was doing.  So I decided on doing this idea with the intent of dropping a project after. So I planned out a date when I was gonna start going quiet and when I’ll drop my project and then be my evolved self. I planned to do it on the Friday after school in the first week of October and end it on October 20th so my project would be out on that date and so I can celebrate my birthday on the 23rd in my new self. I blacked out my social media and deleted it off my phone and wrote about a Kendrick Lamar verse about shutting off the lights, idk recall it atm. 

    But this original plan took a turn when not even 3 hours in on my plan, my friend on Xbox said some shot about me where I broke out of myself and started to basically fire back insults at each other. This led to a boxing match between us where I went back on social media to promote it. The match has nothing to do with this but we drew as in we both couldn’t finish the match because I may have threw him on the ground. So after that we both respected each other and became friends again. After this, I was questioning if I could do the plan I intended because I was never like the quiet kid in school, but I decided I have to, so I stopped joining my friends Xbox parties and deleted my social media again. For the month I was doing this for, I had a hard time staying silent and became very bored after I stopped talking to my friends and my friends started to notice my strange behavior. October 20th came and I dropped my project about evolving and changing and it was received well. Also I started wearing a bandanna like KSI. I became the class clown again and started to get back to my old self again but there was like this hint of black in me for no reason. My birthday came around and people were wishing me happy birthday and shit and everything was normal. I was also told to take off my bandanna on my birthday because the administration felt like it had to do with a gang, and my school is really worried and anxious about this type of shit but not with students being picked on or mental illnesses, so this ruined my Birthday for me at school. But after my birthday, things felt different.

     I was still making my case as the popular kid in my grade but I felt a little different with my confidence and mental state. I don’t remember some weeks after this but the next key event was that I signed up for basketball. The main thing I wanted to do from the plan was to try new things and I tried playing Basketball. I was stressing during tryouts because I felt like I wasn’t doing good, but no worries Because I made the team. A couple of practices in, I injured my foot and had to be on crutches till the end of December (this happened in November). I was basically cruising through the year at this point, but I noticed I was struggling in school and was getting stressed. After the new year I was off crutches and got to play in my first game but didn’t get to play a lot because I just came back from a injury. I played the most of the 4th Quarter, and only got 1 Rebound and I air balled a wide-open 3 Pointer. After this I felt embarrassed and wanted to improve. But this would be the last game I would play that season, because I injured my foot again while playing with friends. I felt like I let people down and became anxious when people talk about like practice or the games I missed. I started to feel socially awkward but is don’t really think of that till later.

   Months past by and I’m ready to play baseball(the sport I’m very good at) but I was still struggling in school. I make the JV team and it looks like I’m starting at 2nd base, but I can’t play because I got 2 F’s in my struggling classes. I would like to say I’ve been a great student and always got good grades before in school leading up to this. I was Devastated with this news that I can’t be on the team anymore and cried a lot, and I went back into hiding basically for about a week or two. I started to come out of my shell again but I still felt embarrassed and didn’t know what’s wrong with me. I finished the year with really nothing else to my name, I dropped a song, did my finals and the year was over. 

    Summer of 2018 is here and I’m relived because I passed all my classes and I worked my ass off to avoid staying back freshman year. I worked in silence while everyone was enjoying themselves. At the start of the summer I decided that because of all the shit that happened to me, I was gonna drop another mixtape/album. I once again spent most of my summer working on it and realized this summer wasn’t like last years. I wasn’t invited to much parties, friends would hang out without me, and just went through days in my room without really doing anything. Once again, I made this summer a learning experience for me that I will eventually get out of this slump and dropped my mixtape/album in August. This project is my best piece of work yet, and many people were hyped for my return to the top. During this summer I took another chance and decided from my friends offering me the idea to play football. My best friends were the QB and the starting linebacker and It was difficult but fun. Sophomore year started for me like the beginning of freshman year, I became confident and started to chill more with friends. This took a turn when football really humbled me in that I wasn’t good at it and sometimes I looked like a bitch. Teammates enjoyed my music, but the thought of them making fun of it came to my mind multiple times. I became sick and had to take some weeks off from practice but I knew that I had to finish the season and get the respect I deserved. So I came back and finished the season. 

    Couple of months later I decided not to try out for basketball again, because my body was hurting from football and I needed a break before the baseball season. Good news, my grades were the best I’ve had in a while with many A’s and B’s. So the winter months really weren’t anything to me, but I still was becoming socially awkward around my friends and others. Months past and in baseball I injure my thumb and can’t play all season which really broke my heart because that’s 2 years off from playing the game. I noticed at this point that my friends were having major sweet sixteens and I wasn’t being invited. I got invited to one last minute and I’d don’t enjoy myself because I felt I want suppose to be there and felt awkward around the people I used to hang around a lot but don’t anymore. After that, I broke down and knew I was acting different. My grandma died shortly after and that hit me hard and now it’s almost the end of the year and I’m still like this. (Sry for long information, felt needed)

MAIN POINT:
   I want to ask for help from reddit, because I’ve been dealing with myself not acting the same, distancing myself from friends, feeling negative thoughts, caring way to much about peoples opinion about me, and evolving backwards from where I was. I used to tell myself that I could never get depressed, but now I feel like that’s the only thing that happens now. I used to be a funny kid that everyone liked but now I’m just another kid who I think lost his spot at the top. I want to blend my 2017 self with my 2019 self to make the true evolution of me, but I gotta get this shit Together first. I want to ask if anyone knows how I can get my confidence, self-esteem back and not be socially awkward around my friends. Once again, so sorry for the long post I’ve been holding this in for too long and just want to be myself again. Please help me and Thank You for reading.

247,"Hello, it's been a few days I'm in confusion. I had to google a lot to understand and such. Okay so here's the story goes.

I met this guy, super nice, super gentleman. He claims he likes me a lot and want to work it out the relationship and he says he'll give effort to it. You see the problem is he acted so different in chats, mainly in WhatsApp. It's like two different person. In real life, he's so sweet and gentle, in WhatsApp he's like an arrogant bastard. You see I'm a very calm person, and I'm very understanding. Like if you say you're busy, then I won't bother.

He works as a doctor and I know he's busy. At first his chats was good now it's like super short, and sometimes he just read, but as WhatsApp has it last seen, sometime he doesn't read my text, but he's last seen is just recently and sometimes he's online. I'm not a stalker or anything, i'm just confused atm. Even when I ask for a 5 minutes call, he only call me once and after that, he said he's busy, and being super understandable, I just give up and wish him luck. 

You see I'm confuse, at WhatsApp he super arrogant, like you don't even know this guy but when u meet him, he treats you so well. Last night I told him I wanna meet him and he agreed, and we met. Okay thats an effort after that meeting he treats me the same in chats. It's like two people. Plus he doesn't like video call and such. Even when I want 5 minute only for his call, he always says ""later"". I'm confused now, like if you really like a person, you would spend even like 5 minutes to her/him right?. I feel like I'm the only one making effort you know. I don't know if he's playing hard to get or he just annoyed with me. I'm confuse. Any advices on what should I do know is welcome.

248,"3 months ago I met this guy on Discord. I won't say his name for obvious reasons.

He's a really chill dude, very energetic and fun to chat with. We've gotten to know each other in a short while, and we seem to trust eahh other very well. He's one of the closest friends I've ever had.

He likes to vent in our conversations sometimes, talking about his past decisions and some tough situations he's going through at the moment.

He recently told me that he really loves talking to me and wishes that we could chat forever. But we can't, since I'm really busy with family trips and plans. I'm one of the few friends he has, and I've noticed that he becomes slightly upset whenever I don't have time to chat with him.

A few days ago, he suddenly messaged me, saying he ""doesn't care anymore"" and that he wants to end it all. I've asked him what's wrong. He replied saying that he's nothing but a failure, and that none of his friends care about him anymore.

I'm genuinely worried about his well-being. I want him to get through this. He hasn't been replying to my messages lately and I'm just so scared of the aftermath that's about to come.

I told my managers I’d be returning to work, but then yesterday I walked 7500 steps and then lightly kicked my kitchen table with my bad foot.

253,"Hello,

I'm a 20 year old guy from Washington State. I'd been in a relationship for just over 2 years, my first serious one. My family and friends have all been really supportive of me as I struggle with depression and anxiety after the event. I wanted Reddit's opinion, and I guess there's a lot to unpack here, so I'l start from the beginning.

I should open by saying, it was me who decided to break things off. For one reason or another, I just... wasn't happy. I thought I'd be following true happiness by cutting the relationship struggle out of my life, but regret quickly filled its place. After a month long break for me to think things over, we met at a mutual class we both attended, she brought a friend from work that evening (Now her boyfriend), and we broke up. She claimed to be completely distraught. 5 days later, the two were together. About a week later, they were sexually involved. I realize this must all sound hypocritical of me, being the one who broke up, bit I felt just... Betrayed and Jealous. It doesn't take a super genius to realize she had eyes for this guy before we were through. Despite all of this, she *promised* we would stay friends, maybe even best friends. 

I realize how Naive I must have been, because I sunk into a deep depression. Panic attacks and thoughts of suicide followed, but... I got help. I talked through it, and eventually I came to accept what had happened, that it was the thing I needed to do. I no longer trust her, she broke that entirely. I no longer regret breaking up with her, and just last week by pure dumb luck, she was at a dancing event that I was at, when the most amazing thing happened...

I felt okay!

I felt like I was able to know she was near, after everything that had happened, and still wish her the best, be happy, and have fun by myself.

I started getting out more after that, been thinking about asking a cute girl out, maybe get back into the dating scene. But I digress.

I decided to send her (my ex, not the cute girl) a message. I told her how I felt, how I felt better, and how I'd like to start taking steps to being her friend again, like she'd talked about for so long.

But she rejected me. She told me, ""No, you're not done healing yet. You need more time."" Like she was in control of how I felt or something. What right does she have to say something like that? Tonight, for the first night in... weeks. I feel like I want to break down and cry again. She broke my trust, my heart, and now, my feelings.

She's been such an intergral part of my life for so long. (2 years is a lot for me, I know) I don't know if I want to cut her out of it. I'd lived my life thinking that these were never things she was capable of, and yet... here I am. Left wondering what to do.

Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk.

255,"So I used to be friends with the high school douchebag because I'm usually happy to befriend people as long as they don't treat me poorly. Of course there are exceptions but this person wasn't so much a bully, just an obnoxious ass who would often place himself on a pedestal and put everybody else down. Once he tried directing this behaviour my way, I tried to simply brush it off as a joke, until it \*really\* got under my skin to the point where I spoke to him about it before just flat-out cutting off contact with him.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I'm concerned, he's still a pretty big asshole to people so I honestly don't think I'll be reconnecting with him, at least not anytime soon, however my current concern is how his parents feel. His parents were generally pretty good to me, however his behaviour is largely due to how is parents spoil him and how they feel that if their son is to be rude to someone, that person probably deserves it. I've had recent run-ins with both his mother and his father each separately where his mother simply said her hello in a hardened polite sense, whereas his father drove past me and flipped me off. In that car with him was his son, where he seemed to just be pissing himself laughing.

Given that I was often seen amongst my friends' parents as the mature one, I'm sure he's likely exaggerated the reason as to why him and I aren't on speaking terms and has added in little white lies. While I'm aware that it shouldn't matter, I don't want people to hold any sort of anger or resentment against me without knowing the full story, with of course me being sure that he just told them whatever they would need to hear to dislike somebody. I know where they live still, and I sort of just want to talk the situation over with them as I don't want anybody holding what I feel is unjustified anger or resentment towards me. Is it worth having a discussion with his parents?

256,"I have some cousins who live with their dad. Their mum lives elsewhere and the parents have pretty much separated for good now. We invited the kids for a Mother's day dinner because we felt like they should be a part but they ended up acting out and demanding that we take them elsewhere because the food would take too long. We refused because it was my mum's day and she deserved to have a good day. They retaliated by giving us the silent treatment,  we requested for our food to go (the adults) because we had had it. The kids begrudgingly ate their food and finished, said they were still hungry (after complaining that they did not want to wait for food so would rather go get fast food on Mother's day). When all was fine, we got the check and left. They slammed the doors in our faces and walked way ahead of us. Dropped them off home and as soon as my mum pulled into their parking lot they started getting out and the car had not even stopped . My mum tried to tell them how disappointed she was in their behavior but they ignored her and walked away. She told the dad but he never responds to her.

257,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a guy in his mid-twenties. I have really nothing to be particularly self-conscious about. I'm educated, not hideous and am quite successful. But I've found my willingness to share things through my social media(which I once did openly and received plenty of 'gratifications') due to the ongoing comments of a specific person.

&amp;#x200B;

About 12 months ago, I matched with a woman on a dating app. We had similar interests, mutual friends and the initial chats were engaging and fun, but there really wasn't anything much there. We followed each other on Instagram, and still do. I've noticed this person never would like something I posted, but always left some snide comments on either my story, or my posts. I had been quite ill for a number of months and posted my first day back at a gym as a milestone of sorts, she replied back I looked like a human cloud. Videos of myself playing guitar she would comment how stupid my face looked. Today I posted a selfie for the first time in 2.5 years, not one minute out she had already commented 'pout game strong', she didn't like the post. Now this woman has zero interest in talking to me, so it's not the case it's friendly banter or there's anything at all underlying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had always brushed it away as just an attempt to be funny or the sorts, but after so long and really no contact with said person, it feels like it could be more malicious to me. There's the argument for 'well should you really be posting selfies(albeit not regularly)?' or posting anything online that could be construed as being 'narcissistic'.. But honestly, everyone I know does so(friends, family, etc.), I don't hold them to different standards, why should I hold myself to them? In fact, this said person constantly floods my feed with pouted selfies, all her socials events, 'felt cute might delete later' posts and so on. I found myself today, worried, or at least self-conscious about the post I was going to make prior to making it... and when her response was so fast, it hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess as a 20 something male, I should just brush this off, or somewhat tolerate it, because why should I be bullied? But similarly, I feel like if I was ever bring this up to her or other's I know personally I would be handed the 'oh get over it, you're a guy'. I guess as a user of social media, there's a certain level of criticism we should come to expect, but this just feels quite directed at me. Am I right in thinking this?",23May2019,2
258,"I've always had some problems with anxiety and depression, but lately I've been feeling afflicted by them more often. Usually, this happens when things are going wrong or stressing me out in my life. 

Currently, most things in my life are going pretty well. I have my bills mostly managed, I don't really mind my job, I've been spending time with friends frequently, and I'm on a break from school. Seems like it should be pretty low-stress, right?

Regardless of all that, I've been frequently feeling like an anxious mess for apparently no reason. On top of that, I have almost no energy or motivation to do anything. If I wouldn't lose my job, I would sleep in all day. At least half of my days off of work, it isnt rare for me to spend 12-14 hours just waking up and letting myself fall back asleep almost right away. 

I'm kind of at a loss on how to better my emotional state and figure out why this might be going on for no discernible reason.

I used to get mostly straight A's in math and science, though lacked in social studies and English, but it all just faded away after starting HS. People often tell me that I'm an intelligent man, but they always feel like hollow words when I hear them now.

I really wish I had the motivation to do something, but so much has been happening and changing. I'm still rather adept at math, and also now do computer programming. I would like to do AI for college, but on my current path there's just no hope for it.

I'm fighting a lot of depression and social anxiety on the daily, I don't have any real friends anymore (my last group of friends ended up stalking me online) and am always lonesome. Some people, likely those aforementioned 'friends' have been spreading rumors about me as of late as well, and it's just all piling onto me. I can't seek any sort of therapy because my family can't afford the costs. They also seemed to have forgotten about it the minute after I mentioned it.

260,"I’m assuming it’ll be an important note for this, I’m 17 - turning 18 in July. So, I’m not an adult and I still am a child living under my parents’ roof. 
My father is a bastard. He’s been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, meaning there have been times he breaks out in a bit of drunken anger. I have terrible memories of the fear he strikes in me when he can get physically aggressive and the countless times he’s sped down the highway drunk, with me in the backseat. After seriously questioning whether or not his drunk driving would lead to my death countless times and finally finding him lying at the bottom of our staircase blackout drunk and thinking he was finally truly dead, I’ve decided to cut him out of my life as much as I can. Which, he seems to be equally okay with. We have not spoken in months, because I indirectly revealed his infidelity (not the first by any means!) to his wife. Needless to say, we’re both very angry at eachother and I think it’s fair to say we hate eachother. 
Like I said, we’ve basically been estranged but living under the same roof, he hasn’t spoken to me in months. Tonight, he randomly approached me in anger, yelled “you!!!” and demanded I start taking over one of his household chores everyday or he’ll take my phone. I know — this is a CHILDISH issue (I am a child anyway). He’s a terrible alcoholic, so do I have to listen to this bastard just because I’m living under his roof? My mother pays the mortage herself but “his” roof. I don’t really want to suck up my pride and give in to his demands, especially when it’s his responsibility. But, it is a small chore and It wouldn’t break my back. 
It’s childish, but I don’t want to do anything to show any kind of respect for him. I don’t want to give him that pleasure of knowing he’s an asshole, but he’s an asshole with authority. I’d like a little dignity, but I mean I’m a child. I’d like my phone too.",23May2019,2
261,"So today at work after lunch we were getting in the work van, and said person was sitting in the outer most seat so he had to get out to let me in. In the process of doing so he lightly punched my shoulder as a joke and I did it back (light just like he did me) and he absolutely lost it. He effectively round house kicked my shin with his steal toed boots. Now mind you this guy has been my best friend for 8ish years. Obviously pissed I pushed him and he then threw his phone at Mach 10 at me and hit me in the nose. I took my cup in my hand and threw it at him. And yelled “FUCK YOU” I’m left confused and astonished. We worked side by side the rest of the night and we were fine but for some reason, I feel bad. Like I did something wrong I don’t yell like that or get mad like that. I know he has anger problems but Jesus Christ.

264,"Okay, I've never posted before but I really, really need some advice. I've been in a great relationship for the past two years. We now live together and tonight my boyfriend (21) and I (19) were having a nice night making dinner and drinking some wine. He got a little carried away and had about 6ish glasses (that I saw) which is super super super unlike him (typically he has like 3-4 MAX, in this case I only had 1.5/2 because I wasn't feeling very well and the wine was making my stomach feel even worse). So it's about 11pm, we're both pretty tired and decide to go to bed. He falls asleep by about 11:20ish, I'm up until about 12:30. At about 1:00AM I wake up to him peeing on our bathroom floor, completely missing the toilet. I'm a really like sleeper, but I thought I heard him hit his head on the door frame when he was walking into the bathroom (it was really loud) so I woke up and see him peeing on the floor. I begin to shake him and try to wake him up because his eyes weren't even open, but he just kept mumbling about how it 'doesn't make sense' just over and over. Literally just pees on the floor and then goes back to bed. This is like 100X out of the ordinary as this has never even close to happened. It gets even worse though. I am absolutely pissed. I clean up the pee with dirty towels, throw them into a garbage bag and put them on the 'outside' mat by our door. I go to wake him up and he will NOT wake up. I try to shake him, poured a little water on him, and eventually I smacked him hard as hell on the ass. He will not wake up. Finally I resort to dumping an entire cup of water with ice cubes on him and he jumps up. I try to explain to him that he needed to take a shower because he must have been very very drunk but he didn't understand anything that I was saying. I was explaining the situation to him and he literally just kept mumbling about how he couldn't understand. He sounded like he was still dreaming even when he was 'awake'. Then I started yelling at him, telling him that I was about 2 minutes away from leaving if he didn't get in the shower. He was still confused but I was beyond furious. He got up and swung at me hitting me on the arm, not hard but almost disoriented. I was beyond shocked as he is literally the most respectful guy ever and has never even attempted that before. Then he yelled at me to telling me that he didn't have to pee and just did not understand a single word I was telling him. I finally got him into the bathroom and explain to him what happened (including how scared I was because he hit me). He was willing to take a shower. He still seemed like he was dreaming (he was the whole time, I just wanted him to shower because I was worried about how drunk he was). Then when I told him that he had hit me on the arm (there was no bruise or anything) he freaked out and said that if it was true he was killing himself because he loves me and he didn't want to hurt me. He started screaming, mostly at himself about how he was done and wanted to die. I am a huge feminist so at this point I'm completely dressed ready to leave his ass until I realize how furious he is with himself for trying to hurt me. At which point I realize that he literally sounds like he wants to kill himself. He punched himself in the face and was still completely disoriented. I finally talked him back to bed, but I have no idea what to do. NOTHING even close to this has happened before. He does have severe anxiety and he takes medication for it, I don't understand if the alcohol caused that reaction or if he just drank too much or what. Essentially what do I do? Do I leave him? Do I kick him out? Obviously if I do stay with him then drinking ever again is out of the question forever, but is that even worth it? please please please give me some advice.",23May2019,1

266,"So I was woken up this morning (3:30) to one of the mouse traps going off as we’ve had mice eating cookies all week. Not sure if it’s still alive, but it’s heart was still going when I took it out of the snap trap and into a box. Going to wait until the morning to see if she pulls through or not. 

I’m also in the woods, so it’s easy for me to release it in a abandoned barn down the road. If not, I’ll dispose of it.

But that’s not the tricky thing. It’s a female mouse, with obvious signs as it may have had a litter. Any advice on how to find the nest? I’d want to either move it or find a way to ensure we don’t have a dozen more loose eating things in the house again.

269,"So I've been planning on going back to the city I grew up in for about a week just to visit. I considered asking around to family and friends first if I could stay at their places but my cousin there just gave birth to a baby and has two other small kids, one of my friends is living with her mom and two siblings in a two bedroom so no space, another of my friends has like 5 little siblings so definitely no space. The only person I know that would probably have space I haven't talked to in forever and I don't want to just hit her up out of the blue just to be like ""oh hey can I stay with you"". So I planned to get my own airbnb and just visit them outside of it. 

I was discussing summer plans with a friend in one of my classes and I was like yea I'm gonna go to x city to visit some friends and family. And she was like ""oh cool are you like staying with them?"" and I was like ""no I'm staying in an airbnb"" and she kind of side eyed me and was like ""none of them will let you stay with them? that's kind of weird to visit a place where you know people and have to get your own airbnb"" and I explained my situation but she seemed skeptical.

So now I'm wondering is this a weird arrangement? Should I hit up that one friend who may have space for me?",23May2019,2
271,"To preface this, I (M19) am as ordinary as you could imagine. I live in a upper-middle class family in a 1st world country, and am mostly stable mentally. I attend university, play video games, play sports, and I have multiple well established social circles as well as a group of closer friends which I can admit anything to, besides what I write here today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, for no reason at all, I get the intent to viciously harm people. This usually happens when I am alone and undergoing a stressful situation, or am observing something and then imagining a scenario for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Example, I see that a guy is being rude during a traffic jam, and is swearing and honking his horn at other drivers. I look at him, then imagine him swearing at my mother, or father. Then, without warning, I can vividly imagine myself beating his face to a pulp then crushing his skull with his car door and running his body over.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, somebody hurt my sibling during a football game a while ago. I don't even know what this person looks like, but I imagine myself confronting him, then hitting him until his face is no longer recognisable, then tearing each one of his teeth out and beating them into his face.

&amp;#x200B;

It even applies to animals. I see a dog in the park, and think of it biting my dog. Immediately my thoughts go to breaking this dog's ribs with a stick and crushing it's teeth and then breaking it's jaw in two. Then my thoughts turn to the owner, thinking up something just as gruesome as the examples I have already provided.

&amp;#x200B;

Many thoughts like this invade my thoughts on a regular basis. I have never acted on them, and never will. I don't think I would enjoy playing out these scenarios in real life, but I can relive them at will, at any point in time. Is this normal for people my age?

Altough my boyfriend just made a detailed savings-schedule for himself to buy a motorcycle, he's already broke this month.
He didn't do this on purpose to make me pay for more, but it still puts me in this position. Don't get me wrong, I earn way more than him and don't have any problems paying for our groceries or gas or whatever. I just don't like the thought of me fueling his impatience. We've been talking for weeks now and he knows I won't stop him from fulfilling his dream, but I also won't support him, i.e. buy safety clothing for him or gift cards, that make everything affordable for him, since I am really scared of him getting injured or dying. (We both know how he handles his car and he as a vast knowledge about motorcycles which makes him feel like it will be easy for him)

I haven't slipped up so far, but I'm noticing things I want to say or that I imagine in social situations that would really fuck up some interpersonal relationships. I don't want to hurt anyone but I'm scared I will, soon.

The reaction seems to be connected to power, and knowing the subject of the torture or violence and  is absolutely terrified and in misery/agony.

SKIP THIS IF SQUEAMISH: The violence has included knife dissembowelment, raw/live cannibalization, violent fights, capturing and starvation, breaking a window and pushing someone's head across the shards.

The fantasies usually involve close-up 'reaction shots' of the fear and pain they feel. The victim never dies, rarely do the fantasies actually become sexual. The only common denominator is that I like the victim as a person, male or female (though I'm bisexual) ugly or beautiful, if I appreciate their company and value them as a friend; I've probably fantasized about prolonged, brutal torture.

278,"I met who I considered my best friend when I was six years old. We continued to stay best friends throughout teenage years and into adulthood until I started to not be able to stand them. It started when we were about 16 probably, I started to get really annoyed and hurt by things they would say/do. 

A few things for example: 1. I would talk about my favorite musical artist who means very much to me, I have an emotional connection to this artist and consider them to be a huge part of my life and a great influence on me. Whenever I would bring up this artist, my friend would only say bad things about them. They even listened to the artist and said they liked them, but they never liked to encourage things I liked. They would always put my interests down. One time I brought up a fact about the artist and they said they didn’t remember me saying that when I told them I thought they would know because I talk about them so much. They said “sometimes you just talk so much that I tune you out.” That broke my heart. They said that four years ago and I still think about it constantly because I didn’t think that someone I considered so close to me would say something so mean to me. 2. They would constantly put me down as well as my interests, “jokingly” hit/punch me, and just be rude. The last time I hung out with them and a group of people, someone else in the group actually called them out for being so rude to me. My friend said “it’s okay for me to be rude to (my name) because we’ve known each other for so long.” 3. They would constantly ditch me in the middle of our plans to hang out with other people, or go on phone calls and ignore me while I was with them. We would make plans in advance, and then they’d change their mind halfway through and leave me because someone else invited me to something. They’d get a call from their partner when we’d hang out and instead of having a short conversation or saying they can’t talk because they’re busy, they’d drop everything they’re doing with me to have a long conversation with their partner and ignore me when I tried to talk to them too. I wouldn’t be bothered if this happened once or twice, but it was a reoccurring thing that drove me crazy and kind of killed my self worth. 

I think it’s all just been a build up of me beginning to hate them. I hated the way they treated me. They’d say I’m an important part of their life but their actions never followed that statement. I would ALWAYS treat them with kindness, I’m very uncomfortable with being rude even if it’s jokingly. I try to be as positive as possible and always support their interests and try to encourage them and ask about things they liked.I just feel like I never got the respect back that I gave them. Around a few months ago, I ghosted them. I know that’s bad on my part but I’m very bad with confrontation. I just thought that they would get the message that I don’t want anything to do with them anymore. They sent me a text saying they noticed I deleted them off social media and wanted to know what they did wrong and if I was okay. I told them everything I was feeling. I told them when we would hang out, I was always looking forward to the end of it, I was starting to never be happy when I would be around them, they made me feel like garbage about myself and started giving me a lot of self worth issues. I told them I couldn’t have someone in my life who made me feel like shit about myself. I told them it would be best for me if we weren’t friends. That was the end of that and I haven’t talked to them since. I just feel like I’ve made a mistake. They’ve been in my life the majority of it, they were like family. But to help myself, I felt like I had to do this. The awful behavior on their end has been going on for years. I was at a breaking point and couldn’t take it anymore. I just want to know anyone’s opinion if you think I did the right thing. 

TLDR: I had a friend my entire life that showed toxic behavior and it started to take a toll on my mental health, I told them I don’t want to be friends anymore and haven’t spoken to them since. I’m having doubts that I did the wrong thing by dropping them from my life.",23May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

There were some family memebers who were abusive towards me, both mentally and physiucally.  It was all treated as something completely normal in the family so I've never tried to rebel. I was only trying to make myself invisible and not attract anyone's attention. 

 

Once I miraculously graduated from highschool (started skipping weeks and months after one inciden) I loked myself in my room and rarely left it. It was so bad that I got used to holding down my poop in order to now go to the toilet too often. At that point it was only my mother and me living in the apartment, as all the family members left the town. Even though my relationship with my mother is pretty good I didn't see how she could help me.

&amp;#x200B;

It went on like that for many years. My mother was silently providing me with some necessities and only occasionally would bring up the topic of me getting a job or going to college.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to college. I got accepted but couldn't pull through. Every time there was a stressful situation (like an exam or a difficult assignment) I would freak out and want nothing more than find a place where no one can see me and where I can't hear people saying how bad I will fail this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped out of college. It was a hard blow on me. I locked myself in my room again for several years.

&amp;#x200B;

Once my mother mentioned that they needed a person to help out while a girl was having her maternity leave at her workplace. It was a simple job which did not require any qualifications. I agreed. It was pretty bad, not the job, but myself. I didn't know how to look people in the eyes, was not sure when to greet them, how to ask when there was something I didn't know. I wanted to run away so badly that I cried almost daily. The only reason I could hold on to the job was that it was only a short-term one. It was supposed to be, I should say.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on I was invited for another position in the same company. I was really happy because I was chosen and specifically asked by my new boss to accept that position. I have no idea what she saw in me, but very soon she got  disappointed with me. Although I could handle my job just fine, I did get into a few very awkward social situations and made my boss think that I didn't respect her. She started treating me colder, but again it didn't affect my job. I thought it was rather normal, until that one time when everyone from the department was invited to a New Year's party and I was the only one left out. I don't drink alcohol and don't enjoy other people's company that much, it was the fact that I was the only one who was not invited that hurt me deeply. Those people didn't want me, just as my family back in my childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to quit, but I knew I won't be able to find another job because I didn't have any sort of qualification. And I decided to try it again, try to get a diploma. It was a very stressful process but I got a place in a decent university in our capital city. I even got something that could be called a 'scholarship' (i.e. I don't need to pay for my studies at all). My form of education implies that one only comes to university to take exams twice a year and doesn't need to attend classes on daily basis, this way I can continue working.  I've just finished my first year at university, which was extremely stressful for me, but I am a little bit proud of myself for not dropping out during the first year.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, the situation at work becomes unbearable. I did everything I could to get transferred to another department, and now when I have to contact people from the previous one they always treat me terribly. Although now I don't need to communicate with them every day, it still happens about two times a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to move to a different place. Maybe even a different country. I want to change something, but I don’t know how. I feel obliged to finish my university first, which would take 4 more years. I am not sure if I can hold on for that long here. I don't have any savings because my salary is rather low. I know that I need to find a new job but it feels like I don't know anything, there is nothing I could call my sphere of expertise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my situation is not normal. I am technically an adult but I cannot take care of myself. I probably act like a child most of the times, but I cannot change it. Every time things get bad my mind goes completely blank.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to change things but I don't know where to start. I feel like I need money more than anything. If I had enough money to just leave this place and move to a foreign country where no one knows me, maybe I could have a fresh start. But I realize that I need to change first. Nothing will change unless I can change myself. But this again, how exactly can I do it? In order to look for a therapy I would need money again, not sure about the cost but I most certainly cannot afford it. It feels like I have to wait for my university diploma to apply for a new job, because at the moment I am not qualified for anything. And only after that I can probably start saving a little. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped, and lost. And worthless more than anything of the above. I can't see things getting better. Is there anything I could do today to make a change? I am not sure if I can go on like this for who knows how many years.",23May2019,0

287,So here is the story. I am 20 year old male and I am currently a chef. A job I had wanted since I was young. but now after 2 years and 2 restaurants. I am finding I do not like it as much as I once thought I would. It is a lot more stressful than I thought. One of the other things I wanted to do as a kid was to work outdoors. I am an eagle scout so I have a lot of experience with camping and general outdoorsman skills. I am not sure what would be the best career path for me at this point.,23May2019,1
288,"So basically throughout my entire study abroad planning process I’ve been so overwhelmed by the options and felt intense pressure to pick the perfect program. I put off my choice until pretty much the last minute and I went with the program I thought would be the most rational choice. 

Shortly after I made my choice, I freaked out and asked to switch. I was given the option to switch over or stay with my choice (twice) and I stayed with my choice yet again. Now, I have been feeling nothing but regret. I can’t shake the feeling that the program I chose isn’t the best for me. I am a huge overthinker and worry about everything, so, I know that this is being blown out of proportion. 

This has been on the back of my mind for weeks now. I can’t even give a concrete reason to why I feel like i made a mistake, but I still feel like it. I think that my heart wanted the second program. I have idealized this other program since it’s more immersive and seems more authentic. I didn’t choose it because of the slightly higher cost and the shorter length and because I didn’t know entirely too much about it. I wish I had just chosen it but something stopped me from choosing it (twice).

Still, I can’t even seem to get excited about the program I chose. I want nothing more than to be excited, and I genuinely can’t get myself to be in that state of mind.I am truly not sure what to do. I still want to go, but I am debating if it’s even worth it if I can’t even seem to be excited. I know my anxiety/overthinking is getting in the way, and I just don’t know how to stop feeling this way.

I think that a lot of my fear is surrounding this idea that study abroad is a life changing experience and it’s one of the best experiences ever. Since that’s typically the stereotype, I feel like I need to live up to it and I’m a little terrified that I won’t (especially with the program I chose).

I have three options. Firstly, I can just not go and better plan for another semester (I’ve already delayed once though). Secondly, I can just go and make the best of my situation and probably have an amazing time. Third, I can try to switch again. At this point, I’m a little embarrassed of my advisor since I have tried to switch two times before and still ended up with my initial choice. Also, it’s honestly really late in the process. I do definitely still think it’s possible to switch, but it is definitely last minute. I am wondering if I should just leave well enough alone.

I am writing all this because I honestly just want some advice/ guidance.  What do you think I should do? 

*note: both programs are in the same location but one is an American program through a provider and one is an immersive program at a university (with a large American population). I chose the first one 

TL;DR: I chose a program, tried to change it twice and still stuck with the same program. I am still not comfortable with my choice, and I feel like I should change it again and actually make the switch final this time. Should I or should I just leave things alone?",23May2019,0
289,"So there’s this girl I really like but for whatever reason I just never got the courage to let her know. I think it was mainly because of our good friendship and I didn’t want to ruin it or make it awkward. And I guess I waited too long, and one of my friends is now hooking up with her. They tried to keep it on the DL but I found out. Idk if they know that I know but it sucks to find out that she’s got someone now, and it’s even worse that it’s my friend. Regardless, I know it is entirely my fault, I should’ve just said something to her about how I feel... a LONG time ago. I’m an idiot for that and I don’t think I could ever forgive myself. Even if she would’ve said no, at least I would’ve gotten over it a while ago. This shit sucks now man, it hurts for real. I don’t see them breaking apart any time soon either. How do I cope with the mistake I made? What’s a good mindset to have about this whole thing? I know it was my fault, I let this happen, but it still hurts.",23May2019,0

292,"Some background--I grew up in an abusive household where my dad enjoyed hurting and humiliating me and making me feel helpless and my mom ignored it/guilt-tripped me whenever I expressed how much I hated my dad. As I got older, I began to act increasingly fake around them, copying their emotions and living in this dissociative haze of fear, shame, and anger until one night my sophomore year of high school where I got in a fight with my dad and shit hit the fan. Since then there has been no physical abuse, even though the threat of it is always there and I always have to be careful. I am in college now and have been living on campus since January, and through meeting some awesome people and working with therapists here my mental health has immensely improved, as has my ability to be genuine and vulnerable around people. I'm scared that if I move back I'll undo all the work I've done and go back to that dissociative haze where I felt like I was living in limbo.  


My parents pay for my tuition (state school) and my housing, and I'm fairly sure they are willing to pay for all of my tuition since they have the financial means and it is a pride thing in my family's culture. However, I feel very uncomfortable relying on them financially--part of it is that I feel like they can pull the rug out at any time and I want to build a life on my own terms, but I also feel immensely guilty since I feel like I'm just using them for money (my mom has been very vocal about this). I want to pay for my tuition and my living and be financially independent but I just don't know where to start. I told my mom that I want to live in a studio apartment this summer and go to summer school here and she basically told me that she felt like I was abandoning the family and wanted to nothing to do with them, which is true in a lot of ways (as per my therapist's suggestion, I haven't told my family anything significant about my life in the past 5 months since I don't trust them at all). She then agreed to pay for the studio apartment and school for the 3 months of summer.  


I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out since it's beginning to hit me that I'm going to lose my family and I'm a fucking kid and I have no clue what to do and I don't know if I want my parents in my life or not, I don't want to lose them but I need to have people that I trust and can rely on before I can let them back in my life. I have a younger brother that I care a lot about who confessed to me before I left that he feels emotionally numb and afraid a lot. I am scared that he's going to be stuck in that emotionally abusive hellhole and won't want to leave because the only emotional connection he has is to my parents. I know I can go back and I'll survive but it'll undo so much of my personal work and I don't know if anything I say will even help my brother while he's living there. On the other hand, I don't think I can become financially independent in three months. I want to push my family away, build my own life, and try to reconnect only when I feel like I have a life to come back to and actually WANT to rather than just doing so out of fear, but the prospect of paying for everything and turning my back on my family is so immensely scary I don't know where to begin.

I guess my question is--what can I do? I have 3 months in a studio where I can apply for jobs/scholarships/other stuff. Is it better to apply for a loan and completely sever my dependence on my parents, or to go through college using their money but having them hold it over my head? On a more emotional note, is it wrong to use their money to get a place to live for 3 months only to turn my back on them as soon as I can be financially independent? I want to do the right thing for me and I feel that it's wrong to lie to them and use them like that, but I just don't feel like I have any other choice.",23May2019,2

295," 

So I have applied to study Medicine and have 2 places at different Universities and I'm mega torn between what I should choose.

I guess finance is my biggest concern as from quite low income family, but there are loans and bursaries which I'm sure I'll qualify for. I've also saved a decent bit of money myself.

First Option is my hometown

Pros:

it's potentially slightly cheaperi'm closer to family,  
it's a 5 year course rather than 6 (though I might still intercalate in which case it's 6 anyway),  
I get to continue with my current Piano teacher who is probably one of the most inspirational woman and best teachers in the area, maybe even country

Cons:

Been excited to go to the other uni  
Quite frustrated with my current church because of its lack of young people and need to move somewhere else. Difficulty is I'm quite involved in worship band and AV and would be frustrating for other church members for me to leave  
Not sure I'll make as big an effort to make friends here as I would elsewhere  
Medical campus is quite isolated from the actual uni  
Less independence

Other Uni:

About 2 hours drive from hometown  
6 Year course - 3rd year would be intercalating and the options here are much better here than the other uni (Psychology and Zoology are offered which I think are both really cool)  
I would be living in the same city as my closest friends  
There is the opportunity for me to find a new churchI was looking forward to a new city and independence

Cons:

More expensive and no option to move back home to parents in 3rd / 4th year to make things cheaper  
Course structure means less clinical and patient interaction until 4th year  
Leaving home might be hard on family

Any advice would help  
Thanks

EDIT: I should also say I need to get a summer job. So any advice on how I'd go about doing that would be appreciated. I look quite good on paper, but I'm not sure how much grades matter for a retail job. Also I am away for 5 weeks this summer which is a huge amount of time.

297,"So I’m kinda spoiled in that I have/had multiple job offers. Naturally, each comes with its downsides so I already declined one.
The two I have left are fairly similar in duty and pay. But one (Job A) seems to be a better fit culture wise. They also pay some benefits, allow home office once per week and have slightly besser conditions concerning overtime.I still rejected that offer because it’s in an area were cost of living is very high. I explained my reasoning to them and now they came back offering to pay for relocation and maybe negotiate pay. Thing is I won’t be able to negotiate a salary that would fully compensate for the cost of living there. I’d still have to spend around half of my income on rent. The job offers an apartment which I could rent for cheep in the beginning. That eases the situation a bit but at the end I would still have to either commute or pay high rent.

The other job (job B) is in a low cost area and that appeals a lot to me. But they stress “family culture” a lot, which stresses me out. They advertise an “attractive salary” yet pay the absolute minimum people in my profession are willing to accept, even as recent grads - which is what their staff is made up by, lots of young folks. Also with my low pay I would still have to consent  to being a consultant on demand, meaning they can send me off to their customer for up to 18 months at any time. I don’t get consultant pay and there is no bonus when you go consulting. They don’t pay any benefits. Actually, I feel like they’re fancy on the outside but not necessarily on the inside. But the ratio of rent to salary is very good there and I think I would do well in a team with a lot of people who are my age.

Still, I appreciate the more professional attitude of the first job AND them coming back to me and offering benefits and such. But then again I couldn’t live as comfortably as with the other job.

I’m literally torn between the two. None of them is superior in every dimension so I would be losing something either way. I tried to quantify my thoughts and job B scored better but then lost points because of the housing situation. I really don’t know what to do.",23May2019,0

I also have major depression, anxiety, ptsd, and insomnia.

I’ve started smoking weed but it isn’t legal in my state for recreational use and I do not have a medical card. But smoking weed helps my mental issues soooooo much, from being suicidal and feeling like my chest is going to burst, I end up feeling relieved, happy, no suicidal thoughts or tendencies BUT every single time I smoke I end up eating without even realizing I’m doing that, I’ll eat whatever food I may have AND eat large amounts.
I need to take better care of my health or else I’ll suffer the consequences of my actions like nearly all of my already diagnosed ailments/diseases will worsen. I want to have a better control of my diabetes, lose weight and essentially be healthier from where I am now. Yet if I don’t smoke weed my mental illnesses get extremely bad to the point where sometimes I’ll have an uncontrolled anxiety attack in public or my suicidal thoughts and depression manifests into me using bad coping methods such as harming myself or isolating myself from others, some days I’ll even call off of work because of how terrible I’m feeling.

What can I do? What should I do?

I’ve even planned on not eating after smoking and I will literally find myself already eating food without even noticing I went to go eat food. Any advice is useful advice.

304,"TL;DR my friend blew up at me and snapped and said I'm not a therapist and I dont care about your problems. Stop messaging me,fuck you. 

For context the problem I needed to tell him about was why I was so uncomfortable with the leader of our friend group. The leader of our friend group,I've confirmed this from his childhood friend who is also part of the group,that he likes me. He would constantly buy me food,electronic stuff,and video games that I cant afford to pay back. He'd make jokes that oh toucan pay back send nudes or make jokes about how hard he'd get if I mentioned certain clothing I bought like a skirt. He also made everything I said sexual. This was making me extremely uncomfortable and I've talked with the leader about it before and hes a very no kind of guy. Hence why I turned to who I thought was my friend.

He wanted me to tell the leader of the group the problem and that it would be solved but I dont think he got that the leader doesnt get it makes me uncomfortable. And he wouldnt listen to anything I had to say without him saying tell the leader. So I asked why couldnt he just hear me out and then he blew up and said he has his own problems and everyone in the world has problems to deal with,hes not a therapist,he didnt care about my problems,and stop messaging him,fuck you.

This hurt because again as I stated earlier,he claimed to have been a friend and that he would be there to the best of his ability if something happened. He wss there for me once when I was a crying wreck because of some friend drama and he tried comforting me and talking to me. Now this happens and its such a 180. It upsets me because I feel like he expected me to know he was going through something at that moment. I'm so used to having people just say they're dealing with something so get back to them or that's what I tell others so when he flipped on me, the argument exploded. 

I feel like I lost a friend,what do I do? (I've had my problem get called trivial by some other reddit user. I just feel now my feelings of being uncomfortable are not valid.)",23May2019,1

When we went out, she wasn’t very talkative and then when we got back to her house, we had a conversation about eye color and apparently I interrupted her by mistake (even though she took a long pause so I thought she was done speaking) and then she got upset with me over it and stopped talking to me and completely fucking ignored me, I apologized profusely and said I didn’t mean to. After continuing to ignore me I said something along the lines of “you playing” and then she freaked out at me told me that I always interrupt when I had no fucking idea I was and never bothered to tell me and then continued not to talk to me. After realizing she wouldn’t expect my apologies I finally decided that I had had enough of this could shoulder BS.

306,"I'm 6 months out of a divorce. 24. In the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas. I'm an adopted child who's mom passed away when he was 19. I have no family.

307,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. And on this Reddit account.
I need some advice for a problem I cannot handle on my own. There will be a TL;DR at the bottom. Here's the story:

I was raised in a very toxic household, my mother was very controlling and emotionally manipulative, my father was just along for the ride, I have no idea why he married her and how they are still together, my mother had almost full control over him and the money he earned, despite her being a ""stay at home mother"" that seldom ever cooked dinner.

The household also had a mob or pack mentality, basically if anyone did the slightest thing wrong, they would be scolded and insulted and called stupid, used as the scapegoat, etc. (I am very disgusted that I ever took part in this, but I knew no better).

Being at home all the time meant I saw my mother a lot as a child, from a very young age, if I did the tiniest thing wrong I would he subjected to very cruel punishments, typically being hit over and over with whatever object my mother could find, being told I was going to be murdered or being force-fed whatever could be found in the bathroom or laundry room, typically bars of soap.

My parents would act like school children around each other, getting into the pettiest of arguments and being extremely dramatic, yet when I mirrored the same behavior, it being all I knew at the ripe old age of three, I would be bullied by my mother for being a ""drama queen"".

A lot of my parents' (especially my mother's) actions and habits rubbed off on me, as they tend to do when you are in an environment like that for a prolonged amount of time. Things such as becoming a tiny bit emotionally manipulative (thankfully I almost never showed it),  thinking I could buy people's friendship, being melodramatic over the tiniest thing, etc. I don't blame myself for those things, I learned those behaviors from my parents.

I was also bullied in school, right from my first year elementary school up to my second year of high school. I was always picked on in elementary, I have no idea why. I was never an asshole kid, I never even performed any of those manipulative behaviors unless I was in a very tricky situation, such as when I did something bad like accidentally break one of the teacher's pencils or something silly like that and lied to get out of it, I don't recall ever doing anything like that to my peers except buying their friendship with toys or allowance money. Yet I was still bullied for everything, anything the bullies could pick at, from my pale complexion due to my parents being shut-ins and therefore me as well, to my kindness and not knowing what porn was when I was 7. This was a very small rural school so I knew the same people every year, and every year there were the bullies and there were the bystanders. I tried getting teachers involved but to practically no avail, it was hopeless and over the course of 8 years it wore down my self esteem.

When I got to high school things were no different, I was instantly the target yet again for all the troubled kids to punch down on, this time it wasn't just emotional bullying and exclusion though, it was also physical punching and kicking, etc. This also being a rural school I had every single class with these kids, and yet again the teachers did nothing when I asked for help. How hopeless that system was.

As I got into my formative years I began to realize that all the habits I had been raised with were awful, I immediately tried my best to cut them out of my life, and I was able to. Because of this though, I began to realize how shitty my home life really was, it was like I had been awoken to it, and I realized I didn't want anything to do with that kind of behavior. Now that I knew how shitty where I lived was, both there and school became an emotional nightmare, and my grades plummeted because of it.

The same year that the bullying died off because I suppose people became maturer, I met a person online who I quickly became friends with, little did I know this would be the worst mistake of my life so far. This person lulled me into a false sense of security, and convinced me he was a hacker on the deep web (ridiculous, I know, but when you are a naive kid in your somewhat formative years, you'll believe anything. Especially when he sprinkled in little facts here and there throughout our friendship to keep the narrative going, he was a very good manipulator and liar). At first he presented it as this cool thing, he was my best friend, and I was his, I would tell him about my problems and things like that, while in the background he was quietly isolating me from all my friends by either becoming enemies with them and convincing me to take his side or sucking up all my time so I would drift away from those friends.

He made me tell him everything about me through subtle ways that still freak me out to this day, I was around him almost exclusively with little to no contact with other friends unless he was present, he seeped himself into my life and he wanted to stay there, I suppose because I gave him the attention he craved or something. I was the perfect target as the attention he gave me in return was that which was lacking from my parents my entire life.

I met my then boyfriend near the end of this hacker man and I's friendship, and he wasn't happy about my time being consumed by this new person I had met. Hacker man, as we will call him, began sending my boyfriend-at-the-time (or batt for short) death threats, saying things like how he could hack and doxx BATT, when BATT came to ask me if this was true, me believing it too said yes.

Hacker man also blackmailed me into leaving BATT to be exclusively friends with him, through the use of selfies I had sent on Snapchat (that he had screenshot without my knowledge and that were quite frankly embarrassing) and even getting to the point where he threatened to doxx ME as well. These are the two most prominent things I remember, but there were many more blackmailing techniques used, such as the ""it's him or me"" thing, me obviously wanting to choose hacker man as I didn't want to but BATT or myself in danger as hacker man heavily implied would happen if I had chosen BATT. 

Somehow I managed to buy time to make the decision but it caused me to have several mental breakdowns and paranoid outbursts that hacker man was spying on me through my computer through the use of a zip file hidden inside an image that contained an RAT (remote access tool, basically what tech support scammers use to take control of your computer, this was only one of the crazy things my paranoid brain thought he was doing but there were many more). 

I talked with an old friend about it who kind of knew hacker man because he ""went deep"" and had some conversations with him and found out hacker man had been lying about a lot of stuff. Right then and there I cut ties because I now knew he was harmless.

After this, BATT and I had a short lived and stressful relationship, to say the least. He became very toxic and he would accuse me of outlandish things and was very dramatic and petty,  it was almost like I was dating my own mother. He had a similar upbringing to me and I suspect he just hadn't grown out of it like I had.

I was very depressed and emotionally vulnerable throughout the entirety of the friendship with hacker man and my relationship with BATT, this caused a lot of insecurities to fester in my head. Very bad insecurities, I will probably go into more detail about them further on.

I met my recently ex girlfriend some months after the whole hacker man thing blew over, she was a friend at first, but after BATT and I broke up, she was there for me, and she helped me get back on my feet as I was on the tail-end of my depression. We then bonded further after that and began dating, it started off wonderfully.

I must mention at this point that I am a trans girl (this means transitioning from male to female) and I was out to my GATT, as we will call her, for the entirety of our friendship and subsequent relationship, I just hadn't begun my hormone replacement therapy yet (which is when you take medication, hormones of the opposite sex, in my case estrogen, and hormone blockers of your birth sex, in my case testosterone).

Once I started my hormone therapy, that's when things started to go extremely downhill, it is essentially like having a second puberty but much more severe, think of it as the brain chemicals of an angsty 13 year old girl in the body of an adult, not nice.

A culmination of everything that had happened in my life came fourth, like estrogen had ripped open all my mental wounds and was letting them spill everywhere. I became extremely needy and clingy, I became very VERY anxious and insecure about everything in and outside of my relationship, it felt like the whole world was against me. My primary insecurities were that of being lied to by everyone, especially my girlfriend (this manifested in doubting her love was real, things like that). That I was being manipulated, told everything was okay when it really wasn't things like that, none of which was true.

My self esteem also greatly plummeted, this is from a combination of all of all of the factors, shit home life, years of my needs being neglected at school by my peers and teachers, and hacker man's awful and toxic attitudes towards me, it's made me horribly depressed.

All of this I cannot control, I feel like my brain is on autopilot and I'm just watching, I got more aggressive like I used to be when I was younger and I found myself considering very manipulative or guilt trippy things (thankfully I never acted on those). I've watched the insecurities and self esteem issues destroy my relationship and there was nothing I could do about it. Like I was so overwhelmed that I lost all control of myself, it's now beginning to destroy my friendships and my school grades and I don't know what to do, I want to get it under control before it ruins my life. Does anybody have any recommendations? I'd like to start with healthy habits and things like that before seeing a specialist as they are typically quite expensive where I'm at.

TL;DR: Had a shitty upbringing that left me with shitty habits, shitty insecurities and shitty self esteem issues, it's controlling my life and I want to take back control before it ruins my life. What can I do to help myself?",23May2019,2

So me(m) and this girl have been friends since we were young. Last year we were both into each other and almost became a thing, but never ended up as anything. Suddenly one day she stopped being into me and I was hurt by this. It took me like 3 months to get over her and when I did we barely talked. 

One day recently I was out with some friends and I saw her. We get to talking and I invite her to hangout with my group(both m's and f's) while we go to the beach. She ends up coming with us. By the end of the day I start getting a vibe that she is into me but I take no notice of it. 

As of like 5 weeks ago I was talking to some girls and they said that they were getting a similar vibe from her as well. This was before I saw her randomly the other day and it was very obvious she was interested. Now after she hurt me last time I was happy to just stay friends and I don't really feel like being in a relationship with her. She has not admitted to liking me but I know for a fact she does. I need advice on how to ask her if she is into me, and then what to say because I don't want to hurt her.

324,"I’ve (24M) known this really great girl (23F) Sarah for a while.  She’s cute, funny, and really smart.

This week on vacation with friends, we hooked up.  Something about being with her was unlike anyone I’ve dated/known before.  It felt natural.  We knew what each other wanted, and we just had a really strong connection.  She told me she felt that we had a really unique connection.  There was something amazing there, and we have a crazy amount in common that we both agreed was something rare.  We’re on the same page for nearly everything.

The problem is that her best friend - and a very close friend of mine - has a huge crush on me, and has had one for a very long time (like 4+ years).  About a year or two ago, I got very drunk, and made out with the best friend.  I am not attracted to this person at all, except as a platonic friend, and I have made that bluntly very clear.

While I was making out with Sarah, she told me how important her relationship with the best friend was - and that this could only be a one-night thing.  For that sake, we had to make sure nobody knew and cut it off right after.

We made out for hours, and then the best friend walked on us not-so-discreetly pretending nothing was happening on the couch at 4 in the morning.

The next day, we pretended nothing happened, but she kissed me secretly before I had to leave to take a long bus ride home.  The best friend knew, and mad a remark/jab at us flirting when I threw a couch pillow at Sarah.

I want to date her - or at least try.  Even if it doesn’t work out, I think we can potentially be a really good team.  I’ve been with a lot of people both long and short term, but I’ve never felt a connection like this before.  

I’m really praying that I’m not crazy and only feeling this on my side (something in my brain keeps saying ‘she was lying to you, she’s just using the best friend to get out of dating you’ (even though she told me she really likes me and would want this to be more than one night) but maybe that’s just my own dysfunction projecting).

She lives a ways away from me, and it’ll be complicated - but I’m willing to work for it.  I think she feels the same way, and I really don’t think this is something that I should throw away.

What should I do?  Am I blowing this out of proportion?  Should I find a way to pursue, or give up?  Ultimately, I want her to be happy.  If she doesn’t feel the same way, I’ll move on, but I think she might want this too.  And I’d like her to keep her very strong friendship with the best friend intact as much as possible.  They have something strong.  But I really like this one, and I think there’s something special here.",23May2019,1

326,"It’s been a month and a half since he (20M) left me (21F). I feel it was my fault. My mind ruminates and I can’t help but think about everything I did wrong, thinking how things would’ve been different. Here’s the story: Everything was great in the beginning, he told me I’m unlike any girl he’d ever been with and even got me expensive things to show how much I meant to him. What was messed up of me was I had gotten into this relationship right after breaking up with my ex of 4 years and was unsure about what I was doing. I contemplated going back to him with the current boyfriend knowing (he looked through my history and saw I googled “how to choose between 2 guys”)and he got scared. Finally I got my head straight because the current bf helped me realize how bad my ex was (he was legit stalking me and guilt tripping me), then reassured current bf I wasn’t going back at all. I felt so bad I did that to him. As time progressed, I learned exactly how many girls he’d been with (which was a LOT) and he’d talk about all his sexual experiences. I always said it’s fine to talk about that stuff cuz I wanted to be a chill person, but it just made me insecure and overwhelmed. He kept reassuring me I was special and beautiful, but I couldn’t stop feeling insecure as I learned more about all the girls he’d been with. It was to the point that I had pretty bad body image issues because I felt I had to compare to them (he did compare me to them a bunch of times. I asked if he thought I had a really good butt and he said he’d seen better on his exes) I thought it would be fine to brag about my past and so one night I was drunk and I talked about how I made out with a super hot body builder guy and he got insecure. He was saying he wasn’t my ideal cuz I was into body builders but I assured him I was attracted to him and that I wasn’t into that anymore, I was also unaware that the guys I once thought were “hot” were on steroids. He couldn’t trust me on that, I felt terrible because he told me months before how he felt insecure for years about his body and here I was being insensitive. I also made him insecure about his wiener size (he was well above average) and I told him I wasn’t sure if he was big since he was never fully hard in the beginning (that’s because I was really awkward since I was really sexually inexperienced and he was kinda turned off by that but didn’t tell me the reason because he didn’t want to be mean) and I guess I had a different vision from what I’d seen in porn (not knowing they use optical illusions). He kept saying how he did virgins and they thought he was big and how other girls were amazed with him afterwards and how I’m just quiet after.I also told him how my ex sucked at sex but then would later say he was pretty good at points (it was over the course of 4 years, I remembered things later on) then he snapped and we got in an argument because he thought I lied about sex with my ex. It was to the point I was having an anxiety attack and he kept saying “sex with him was better wasn’t it” and I wasn’t sure if he meant if I thought it was good at the time I was with him or if I thought it was better after the fact, so I said yes it was in a sense cuz that’s how I felt about it at the time of being with him. He was appalled and said “no wonder you can’t get wet” and “no wonder I only feel the passion with you once in a blue moon”. Truth was, I could never get wet because of performance anxiety (I was overwhelmed by his experiences and how inexperienced I was, he also told me how he broke up with people over bad sex. The pressure was on).I felt like I truly messed up and tried to reassure him I thought sex with him was amazing and I guess he saw I wasn’t lying. After that, he was saying he had trust issues with me because I had lied before which I’d owned up to. he blocked a ton of girls that he knew were gonna try something and only talked to the ones he trusted, I still felt uncomfortable with him hanging out with people he’d previously had sex with. There was a girl in which he really valued their friendship despite having had sex before. He admitted to me he quit talking to her because of how insecure I was. She came to his work one day and said it had been a while, then his coworker asked why he didn’t talk to her. I felt terrible about how insecure I was. I’d also have a short temper at times and kinda snapped at him. I snapped one day at him at lunch out of stress about making it on time to a job interview (it was also near the end of the relationship and I was under a ton of pressure to fix things) and kinda stomped my foot. It was kind of my fault for being stressed since I poorly planned ahead and misplaced my car key. The next day after I snapped he texted me about how his friends in relationships don’t have to put up with that and he asked himself why he did and that it pushes him away from me. I again felt terrible and beat myself up for poor planning. He would make jokes about fucking other girls and would say I was too uptight and needed to be more “chill”. The entire relationship he said he wanted a chill person and that I was too emotional, saying he’d “never known a girl as emotional as you (me)”. He told me many times I needed to “get better” (in terms of anxiety, depression, insecurity) and I’d promise to, only for him to get disappointed and say he he didn’t trust me. He assumed he knew what was wrong with me, he’d also always assume that I was upset since I have resting B face and wouldn’t believe me when I’d say nothing was wrong. He had thought about leaving me for months. He tried luring me into leaving him, saying things like he has bipolar, an “emotional disorder”, and saying he was frustrated with himself because he wanted other girls. I was willing to accommodate any of his stuff like I’d been doing (he has a ton of medical issues). Finally he left me. He told me he “couldn’t put his life on hold and wait for me to get better” and said he wasn’t going to date anyone for a few months so I could get better. The next day he went on a date (he didn’t tell me tho, which is funny cuz he got mad about how I lied/his stuff from him) and he got together 2 days later with a girl in our friend group. He wanted to be friends but I said no, and when I confronted him about things he’d done he got angry saying how dare I have the audacity to say he was even 50% of the problem and that it was all me. I always justified everything he did. Battering me in a sense because I lied to him and he wanted to know the truth, I made him insecure, I snapped at him and even hit him once. I don’t want him to be right, but he kinda is and that’s what’s making it harder. I’m haunted everyday by things I did and how I could’ve done things differently. My self esteem is completely destroyed and I’m having trouble forgiving myself. Im scared to fall in love again. Everyone tells me he’s an asshole and I do think that, but I just feel he’s right too. Idk what to think, it’s destroying me. I want some advice. 

What do you guys think and what can I do to forgive myself?

327,"Hey there, I’m a 17 year old boy that has “one more year of high school.” Well that’s what I thought. 
The last year in middle school my goal was to graduate high school on time and go to college to major in computer science. I was in a class called AVID which helped me focus to get to my goal of graduating and finding the best college for the career I wanted to major in.  In the city I’m from there’s about 10 public high schools. Only one of them offered this class, AVID, which I was taking in middle school. So I decided to go there for my freshman year because I basically had everything figured out. I got all my classes and AVID helped me take the right classes that year. I loved my freshman year. I was in the soccer team and I only failed one class which was history thinking I was going to take summer school to recover those credits. When the school year was over, my mother told me she didn’t want me to go to a public school anymore. She told me she enrolled me to a Private Christian school for the upcoming year. I was upset and that’s when everything started to change. I grew up in a Christian home and I helped at my church (basically every day, except Tuesday and Thursday) with the live stream, certain software, and website. That’s how I started to like computers btw lol. 
Well back to the story 
Everything started to change when I moved to the private school. When I started my first day, I only had 5 classes. Biology, world history, personal finance, Bible and logic. I had no electives. I went to go talk to the office to see if I can get any electives that involved being on a computer. They told me they only had art and life hacks. So I decided to take the life hacks class to get credits (class was a complete joke). I was disappointed on how bad this school was but my mom liked it because It was a Christian school, smh. I did well that year, though I was so overwhelmed with religion. I just felt so exhausted hearing about how to be a good Christian and helping my church. It was just overloading me, that I changed myself to just stop believing in God. I didn’t want to be involved with God and go to church anymore because going to a Christian school was too much for me. My mind was just giving up on God. I started to feel a big change so I started to vape to calm me down. From vaping, it turned to smoking weed, from smoking weed, it turn into smoking wax then I started to drink thinking I would be numb and just not think about God. I noticed that my goals of studying to be a computer science wasn’t there anymore. I just gave up on my dreams because I just had no teaching that would help me improve on computers. I started to get very depressed, my life was changed completely. My junior year I just wasn’t motivated anymore. I went to the private school again, I had no choice. I started to get in trouble with the school, actually got suspended twice. I only had 4 classes because that’s all the school could give me. The classes were algebra 2, bible, history, and literature. No science because it didn’t fit my schedule and they didn’t offer any electives this year. I was doing ok the first semester but then second semester was when I got more depressed. I was lonely at the school. I had no one to talk to. I stop having hope for myself that I stopped going to school. I went to therapy to get help but it didn’t do much. The school year is over now and I told my mom the only way I can go back to school is if I go back the public school I first went to. She agreed and try to enroll me. She told me, she had bad news. This was yesterday. She told me that I was able to enroll back but since I don’t have enough credits to graduate this upcoming school year, that I have to take 2 extra years to get my electives, sciences, and math credits. This is just making me just want to drop out of school which I basically did. I want to go back but I don’t want to stay two extra years and it wasn’t my fault I didn’t have all the credits. The private school screwed up my life. It screw me in all directions. I feel embarrassed of myself. I don’t feel worthy. I’m trying to seek for advice on what I should do. Should I drop out literally and get a GED? 
Sorry for the long text. I just want to let you guys know what’s going on. Just please help me! PLEASE 😔",23May2019,1
328,"Here's some context. I'm 16 and in high school. I have known ""girl 1"" for 2 years because we both helped each other get through the passing of one of our close friends. After we got closer we have sort of been dating on and off. We've sent nudes and everything like that and I feel super comfortable around her. But when we're not being actively sexual I'm not really in the mood to be romantic at all.

This past school year we went to different schools and it was difficult to keep contact. This is where ""girl 2"" comes in. She and I have been talking for a while and both confessed our mutual liking for one another. Girl 2 isn't very romantic and she's not allowed to date. However, I like her more than  Girl 1. 

Last night Girl 2 and I didn't really text and I assumed she wanted to be left alone (we had been texting for weeks). A few hours later, Girl 1 pops in my DMs and is saying she misses me. I did to, so we start to talk. Now, no matter who I'm dating, I will always love Girl 1 because she helped me through a time that I might not have made it through without her. So we're saying we love each other and all that when we get in a call.

It's great. I'm aroused, she's aroused, and we're teasing each other. I'm not going to say much but we got really sexual. When I, you know, came, I got really turned off. I know this is normal, but it's different with her. It's like if we're not being sexual I can't be talking to her.

Now then, I kind of feel like I cheated on Girl 2 in a way even though we're not dating. I know she would never do something like that. I just need some advice on how I can deal with this situation.",23May2019,2

330,"I broke up with my girlfriend 3-4 months ago, after 4 years living together (27M/29F).

I’m currently back to my country (Italy) for a few days. I’ve been here for a week and I was supposed to go back to London today (which is where I live).

Since I still have some sort of a relationship with my ex, we were supposed to see each other one of these days. On my way to the airport I’ve realized I was going back just to see her and it didn’t feel right.

I’m looking for a new job lately (I’m a UI designer) and I’ve spent the last two months in London being depressed all day and basically staying there just to see her once a week, for a couple of a hours. It’s not worth it.

I was going to do the same mistake today; going back there, see my ex for a couple of hours and then spend an entire week depressed until I see her again. It’s not healthy and it’ll not take me anywhere.

So today I’ve decided to not go. I’ll stay a few more days here with my family and enjoy the great weather and the beach.

If I don’t put my happiness before everything else, no one will do it for me.

332,"So my partner (let’s call him Ryan)  and his twin (let’s call him Barry) are very close. They are korean and come from a traditional Korean family. For a long time their mom didn’t like Barry’s girlfriend/now wife because she (let’s call her Britney) wasn’t Korean. Barry and Britney have been together for 8 years, and they are now married. Ryan/Barry’s parents and her get along great now and she has a daughter whom they adore.

Ryan was single for 5 years before we met and it was almost like Barry Ryan and Britney did everything together. He was like a second husband to britney. Along comes me a year ago (I’m Korean) and his parents adore me from the get go. This was obviously threatening for her but I’ve been making every effort to not make her feel threatened. She is bossy and like a second mom to the boys. I’m not the bossy leader type and I couldn’t care less if she wants to call the shots. What bothers me is that infront of the boys she is all nice to me but when they are not around she is cold. She will say things like she forced Ryan to go on a second date with me and I’ll never be his number one because Barry will always be. For Christmas she gifted me a weight loss diary, and I feel like she is always trying to make me not feel included (for example she will say things and look at me and say it’s an inside joke) she will call my partner darling and she asked him to come to her family’s home (interstate) for Christmas with her daughter and husband. 

I’ve told my partner how it makes me feel and he said well if you know she’s insecure about you getting along with my parents, don’t talk to them so much when they are around and talk to Britney instead. I feel like is solution is for me to enable it and I’m not sure what to do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

333,"This story is to long to explain, I have a previous post about it. 

Short story is. I turned in resignation on Monday. 2 weeks. Area manager called and told me I am setting myself up for failure in my new position and that’s because I don’t have experience needed to succeed. I have 7 years of exceeding sales experience goals. Yesterday area managers boss called who is over 4 states. Talked 1 hour. I expressed my concerns with this boss over my current situation of 5 people 4 desks where I would have trouble meeting goals. She answered questions and made an offer to match new job offer. I told her I want to think about because this is to much drama for me leaving when plenty of people leave monthly with this very large corporation. 

Cue my new manager calling me to congratulate me on passing the background check, etc. I’m officially in the clear to take this new harder sales position where I am one position below him. My goal is his position at a different location once I prove myself. New boss let me know area manager called him and tried to talk about me to him, ask about me and my pay and position, etc. luckily new boss saw through her and told her he is not going to discuss anything pertaining to me. 

Cue 10 minutes later area manager called to apologize for phone call yesterday, this is because I let area manager boss know word for word what area manager said because I wanted her to know this  

Well after finding out area manager called new boss to pretty much sabotage me. I am disappointed this has turned into such an unprofessionalism resignation on area managers behalf. 

I am suppose to call area manager boss today on my decision but I already made my decision of moving forward with new position and new boss, because new position and because of the lack of professionalism with area manager. I wouldn’t feel comfortable staying under this area manager. 

Would it be appropriate to tell area manager boss that one reason why I am not taking her offer is because the lack of professionalism with area manager where she stepped way out of her way to call new boss? 

TLDR: area manager called new boss to shit, area manager boss made matching offer on pay for new position, before I found out area manager called new boss, I am suppose to call area manager boss to tell her my decision but is it appropriate to tell her I’m not staying because one reason is the lack of professionalism of area manager?",23May2019,1

339,"So this chick moved in 8 months ago,
She was going through a hard time and was dealing with a loss of a friend when she moved in, was drinking a lot (I didn’t know the extent) and I wasn’t monitoring her.
Over those months I’ve woken up to fires in the kitchen at 3 am, every light and door on and open in the middle of the night, stuff trashed and blood all over the bathroom, been hit, screamed at, jumped on and verbally abused while she’s been drunk as hell and that’s just some of the highlights.
It all came out she’s an alcoholic- the interlock on her car should have been the first red flag however I believed the lies, was naive, tried to see the best in people - I know, I wish I had left sooner.

We’d sat down twice and I’d told her how I felt and I was scared for my safety, my dogs safety (she was feeding her stuff she shouldn’t when I wasn’t there) and her wellbeing. After both times I told her that if this keeps happening I can’t live here anymore.
The third time I let her know I’m sorry but I’m moving out - have given her a months notice and trying to find someone to take over from me as she doesn’t want to leave.
We’ve finally found someone and she’s now complaining (after only meeting one of the people) that she wants to keep looking.
I’ve got 7 days till I move out, and we are co-tenants. Things have turned sour, she hasn’t even tried to find someone, I’ve had to remind her constantly to put her name on the bills etc.

Now she’s not agreeing to settle on someone this means if I leave and she decides not to pay the full rent after verbally saying she would I’m still responsible. 
She could really stuff me over and I could end up paying two lots of rent until or if someone else moves in...
Even if she signs the papers to say I’ve left it includes signing over that she’s paid me my half of the bond ($900) which she won’t not to mention $400 in one months rent in advance they hold onto until we leave,

349,"There’s a TLDR at the bottom, but ahead is the long version with all the details. I’m a 16 year old guy. All names are fake.

Yesterday I had a 3 of friends over to hang out. My neighbor (Kyle) came too, but he wanted to go outside. We decided to go to a lake nearby in the woods that we’ve been visiting since we were kids. We took a trek through the woods to get to it since there’s houses by the main trail now. Strangely, there was not just barbed wire, but razor wire dividing the area that we were coming from and the area that we wanting to hang out at. We went through it without much thought as there had been barbed wire before and that someone just wanted to update it. We hanged out by it for a bit, but got really hot. We didn’t want to go back through the woods and the wire again, so we decided to walk up the main trail onto the road this time instead. The trail led to this house’s driveway, but we were too tired to care so we just walked up it. Once we got to the sidewalk we saw some geese (trust me this part’s important) and me and my friend John followed them a bit. He said “I wanna pet one!” and got closer, but it hissed so we ran off and went home. End of story, right?

I get texted an image of a post by that neighbor three hours later in a private facebook group that had a security cam video of us walking up from the lake and across their driveway. The post asked the group who we were and said they were concerned that we may be the same people who vandalized their trailer a few months ago (that wasn’t us). They also made another post saying that in the audio there’s sounds of geese and that someone says “I wanna CUT one!” making it seem like we’re animal abusers too. They forwarded this video to the county as well, which means police have possession of it too. 

Me and my friends decide that i’ll tell my mom ASAP. I do so and she gets really angry. Not at me, but at them for posting a video of minors and making these allegations. This turns into a dumpster fire of angry comments, a phone call, and eventually my parents and Kyle’s parents wanting to go to their house. You see, my mom can get very carried away with these things, but I had no choice. We all went to their house and had a heated argument with the father in his garage. They argued about property lines, the guy’s wire he put up, and whether or not we hurt any geese. The hostile environment made nothing get done and he said he wasn’t taking the videos down nor were we allowed on that property. All the participants (except me) left frustrated and calling him stupid. 

Now i’m in a difficult situation. I feel like the right thing to do is apologize to him one on one, but my parents don’t want me anywhere near there. I want to apologize, ask to listen to the audio with him, and see if he’ll take down the video for my sake. This could seriously mess up my reputation if it went outside that small group. I don’t want to disobey my parents, but I also feel like this is the only way to save not just my skin, but my friends’. Should I go to their house today? Should I ask r/legaladvice if it would be smart to make them legally take it down since i’m a minor not giving consent to the video?

TL;DR: I walked through my neighbor’s property and got caught on camera. They’re accusing me and my friends of abusing animals and vandalizing property as well. My parents and others went to their house to clear things up, but just made things worse. Should I go to their house to apologize myself and possibly get the video taken down despite my parents telling me not to?",23May2019,1

I managed to change her behavior by getting really upset and mad every time she did something wrong, because when I tried to calmly explained things, like ""your behavior is making me depressed because X..."" she never listens. Whenever I would get mad she would get VERY offended and say I'm being disrespectful. After a period of hard work and a lot of fights she stopped most behaviors that made me depressed (such as forbidding me to eat after cleaning the kitchen, which resulted in me being malnourished), I talked to my therapist and we agreed I'm fine and don't need sessions for now. I've been generally ok. But my mom isn't. My therapist said she definitely needs help, and I should probably talk to her about it because she's making other people's lives so miserable- especially my dad and her sisters. 

I couldn't bring myself to talk to her because she doesn't accept criticism, she gets offended and interprets what other people say as them being extremely disrespectful to her. I can ask my dad to talk to her, but she acts the same way with him too.

I've been studying for my psychology degree and I think she has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which makes a lot of sense with her behaviors.

352,"Hey, people of Reddit, this is a throwaway account since I'm talking about something personal, I hope that's not a problem...

So about a year or so ago I became friends with this person, let's call him **Ronald** . Me and Ronald got along pretty well and found many things in common, we would spend countless days together and were generally having fun. Everything would be fine, but a couple months ago he ""flipped"", I don't know any other way to put it. We did not see each other for three weeks and when we finally met, he seemed to have changed his entire attitude towards me. He started calling me a ""liar"" and a ""thief"", among other things. I really didn't know why and he couldn't entirely explain why he was doing this either. Ronald never said sorry, never even mentioned this incident again. I've tried to reconnect with him a couple of times, since I do believe people deserve second (and sometimes even third) chances, but every time we met it would somehow spiral to the same thing again ""liar"",""thief"". The last time I saw Ronald he discussed his birthday party with me, he talked about not wanting to invite me since there would be people who are not ""tolerant"" coming. He also noted that those people find me ""creepy"" and ""weird"". I asked him why might they be feeling such things , but he refused to elaborate. It's worth noting that I am not the most ""common"" person style wise, so I am often found ""weird"" by other people. Despite all that he still invited me to his birthday party. I need advice on whether I should go to this party or not, if I choose not to go, this would definitely be the end of our friendship. I fear that he invited me only as an ""act"" to the other guests. It's also worth noting that I do have anxiety issues,so It might just be my mind making more of this than it should. I don't have many friends and I am very lost. What's your advice?

I live down south and so the temperatures can reach over 100 degrees on some days so wearing any sort of long sleeves is a death wish. Is there any way I can get rid of it? And am I really right in thinking it's noticable? Have you always shaved your arm hair (more specifically for my females)?",23May2019,2

So at the start of the relationship they were both happy everyday it was smiles and all the small and stupid arguments that every couple has but it was a normal healthy relationship.

But after a few months in Will opened up about his depression which I kind of don’t believe because it’s that kind of person that uses it for attention, he would cry in classes and make sure that everyone can see that he’s crying. 

During this phase he become more and more clingy to Zoe which led them to 9 almost break ups in 4 months. He told Zoe that he would hang himself if he broke up with him. 

And more and more frequently I see him crying and crying everywhere and he only does it so he can get Zoe to comfort him and get her attention

361,"     I’ve been in good terms with a girl I really like for months now. Let’s call her... Autumn. We’ve talked in person and on social media, helped each other out, and have done school work together in the 3 classes we have together out of 7. The school year was coming to an end, and I figured I couldn’t ask her out in person until next year unless we went and did something, but I figured I’d just do it then.
Here’s what went down 2 days ago:
     The night before I Snapped Autumn asking to meet me in the school courtyard the next morning. I couldn’t find her until the last few minutes since she gets to school a bit late. She was talking with another friend then turned her attention to me as I walked up to her. I got a normal conversation going about the last day of school (which was that day) and she was in a great mood to review her year. I said, “Well, I’ll miss my friends too, luckily I’m a more social person this year so I have some of their contacts. But, look, what I’ll miss most is the most beautiful, caring, and loving girl I’ve ever seen.” (That’s true, not just some compliments thrown together.) I gave her a few seconds to figure it out and she blushed a bunch. Then I said, “And that brings me to ask... will you go out with me?” Autumn then looked nervous and lost eye contact, saying, “Sorry, I’m not ready for that”, then I sat in silence as she walked off with her friend and I said, “Well... sorry.” (I know that’s probably a dumb move but I’m very apologetic)
     We have first period together, which we were walking to anyways. I got there at the last second, which concerned my teacher since I’m always there about 45 minutes early. I tried to do some work while trying not to get upset. (Note that this is the first time I asked a girl out, and anything to do with relationships gets me down since I’ve been single my entire life) A few minutes in to class I couldn’t hold it in anymore and speed walked to the bathroom. I sat there and thought about it, and stayed there the rest of class. (that class is about 50-60 minutes long) As time went by, some of my friends, some strangers, and even the toughest guys in school walked in to use the restroom and all asked if I was okay. I only told them it was my first rejection. Towards the end of class, a classmate was sent to check on me. I told him what I told everyone else, he went back to class, and I stayed until an administrator tried to calm me down and escorted me to Guidance. I calmed down and have felt better since, so don’t worry, I’m not in some crisis over all that.
     As I walked to Guidance I got a Snap from Autumn. She noticed me being gone most of class and apologized while explained her choice. I told her not to apologize, because she has every right to reject me, especially because it makes her more comfortable. We talked a bit more about it throughout the day, and we haven’t talked since. Remember this was only 2 days ago. I want to send her a message asking if we’re still on good terms in her book. And unlike most situations, I feel like I’m able to try again, but much later.
     What do you all think I should do to AT LEAST keep our friendship together, and possibly a future relationship?

363,"So in my country, colleges aren’t that hard to pass. Everyone can go to it as long as they have a diploma and a few bills to spare. My program is only available at selected schools, so choices are very limited. I really want to go to this uni, they’re top 2 in terms of quality and there’s greens everywhere. But it’s a two hour travel from my home (I’ve decided not to board because of my father’s health), so it’s going to be hell everyday. 

But my parents suggested this other uni, their alma matter which is very small compared to uni 1. It’s also looks girlish (there’s pink everywhere), plus it’s beside the school where I almost got kicked out. The memories are very painful in that street, but it’s much closer compared to that uni I mentioned before. I won’t have to travel 4 hours a day just to get by, but I’ll have to deal with lower quality of college life and a living reminder of my mistakes everyday.

I’m not that good of a student, but I just don’t want to regret this decision of choosing a school again. We’ve wasted a lot of money because of my blunders, so I’m extra careful this time. The problem is time is ticking in. I’m the only one in my friends who still haven’t enrolled and the final day is getting closer. Any advice for a freshie on how to choose a school?",23May2019,1

I see folks with books lining their shelves, posters everywhere, random things here and there, and I've always wondered how they did it. Why do they buy these things? How do they decide on it? As someone that suffers from depression, I always used that as an excuse. Would that be the reason? What books do I buy? What posters do I buy?

So my parents use Ancestry.com to track family history and see who’s apart of our family tree. We all did one of their dna tests and got those results back about a year ago. They don’t use it too often but yesterday my mom and I were on it and saw she had a message from someone. 

It went along the lines of “hey I’m trying to find out how we are related, it’s showing me we are cousins and I’m trying to find my moms biological mom...she was adopted in Florida in 1946 and was only known as baby Evans” my mom and I were pretty confused by this. 

Okay so this is where it might get tricky. My mom and dad share an account. My dads mom (my grandma) had the last name Evans before she got married. She has 9 brothers and sisters. All of them have now passed except for her and her younger brother. 

My dad called my grandma lastnight and brought up the message to her. She said she immediately got chills. Her sister evidently got pregnant young and was sent to Florida “for camp” when she was actually giving birth to this baby that was adopted there. But no one has ever ever spoken about it since they come from a verrrry conservative background. 

The great aunt of mine that gave birth, passes away last year and she only has only ever had one daughter (besides the one she gave up for adoption). 

My parents are struggling with the idea of telling her(my great aunts daughter) They think that my grandma should be the one to tell her. My dad doesn’t even think she should know. My mom and I say that she 100% needs to know. I mean it’s her half sister...

I need advice on how I should approach this situation. I’m friends with her on Facebook and it’s almost killing me not to let her know.

369,"I haven’t gotten a haircut in over 2 years, mainly because I can’t afford it.

382," Most colleges in my country have entry tests.

During the past year (4th high school year) I tried applying to the one of the best Unis in my country (I live near that city) various times. The 'highest' score I got is 47, out of 100. I nedeed 60 to pass it.

This year (5th high school year) I tried applying in another Uni (same city), which has a slightly different test. I got \~18 ('17.something' actually, close to 18) out of 50.

What's the difference with this Uni? I can look at statistics.

Looking at those, I scored about 1 point lower than average in Maths and 'Logics' (these are two different sections), almost average in the 'Comprehension' section (0.09 lower actually) and 0.5 higher in 'Basic science' (Physics + Chemistry + Geology).

There is an English section as well but they don't count it for admission purposes (I got 26 out of 30, average is about 15).

Additionally, this Uni requires students to score at least 10 in the Maths section, otherwise students will have to attend a Maths course and pass a 'partial' exam, plus a 'complete' exam later on.

Students who score at least 10 will only take the 'complete' exam and don't have to attend that course.

Comparing my results to the average I couldn't help but think about my 'suitability' (apologies if that's not an actual word) for an Uni lifestyle, if I actually manage to make it far enough to be admitted (they'll take the first 50 students in the ranking).

Plus, while still in high school, I find it extremely hard to study and understand some subjects (barely having a 6/10 avg, which is barely the minimum)

384,"So my apologies first. This is kind of long.

I'm 24 and i've always had a yearning for foreign cultures and languages. I grew up in a very.....very small town. My last year in college was really not great and it kind of broke me. So much so that I decided to teach English over in Spain for a year. I didn't want anything to do with my degree because that's how bad my senior year got. But I knew I wanted to travel. That one year turned into two. My family isn't super happy that I am overseas. I always get the talk about coming home, settling down. Or they feel like I'm avoiding something or even them. My relationship hasn't always been great with them. My grandparents have been super supportive even though I know deep down they want nothing more than for me to come home. I had a family medical emergency and it really scared me into continuing to be abroad. It brought up a lot of issues between family dynamics. I decided that at the end of the summer I will return home. However the idea of 'settling' down genuinely gives me anxiety. I recently thought about the idea of coming home to spend time with my family. Start working with my degree (because i do miss it and want to start) and then maybe in a year or two move and teach abroad in another country. Somewhere in Asia so I can travel and potentially get rid of any student debt i have left. But I know that once I tell my family they are going to freak out that Im thinking about leaving after I just decided to go back.

When I talk to my coworkers in Spain they always praise my bravery for coming overseas and encourage me to continue. It's like I have two sets of very different opinions on this.  I see my friends getting houses and settling down and it makes me feel like i'm doing something wrong. Especially since i know how my family feels. I know that buying a house or getting married isn't something that I want, but their ability to know and have a sense of permanence and purpose in one area is envious. I don't know what I want. I doubt I will want this forever. I would like to eventually be in one spot. I don't see myself traveling forever or teaching overseas forever. But for right now it's like a pull in that direction. 

I love my family and don't want them to feel any type of way. I understand that my family will not always be there and if something happens I am far away and won't be able to see them. But the idea of moving to a city and just continuing in that place sounds uneasy to me. Im the type of person who ponders on decisions forever before making them. So I feel very conflicted. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm young and nothing is permanent yet, to ease the anxiety. I know life doesn't end at 30 but it feels like I'm supposed to slow down. What would you do? Am I wasting my time on experience that isn't towards my degree? Am I being selfish? I'm not avoiding anyone. It's a possible opportunity to help pay down loans and travel.  I love my family regardless of our issues. I just feel such a strong pull. I need an outsiders opinion.",23May2019,1

It’s my first year of university, I work 30 hours a week part time I focus on improving myself through podcasts every day and exercise at least 3 times a week.I also do my best to read as many books as I can and limit my social media usage.

Despite all the errort I try and put in all the time, it feels like nothing has ever changed.My body is not in that much of a better shape, I haven’t begun respecting myself more I failed one of my exams in my first semester.I still don’t have a girlfriend, it feels like all I do is my waste my time working hard without it ever paying off.

I go for about a month in an intense hard work mode , studying and reading and exercising and focusing on myself, after which something embarrassing happens to me that makes me realise I’ve just wasted my time with everything just being the same.

I’m really bad at putting what I’m going through into words so I apologise if my formatting is awful. I hope you understand what I’m trying to say.

I’ve been going through an intense depression ever since I was a kid, and the more I grow up the more I understand that success is what will bring me satisfaction with life. That’s why for the past year I’ve bee working my ass off even through the most choking moments of depression and just believing that this depression is what’s trying to wake me up to work even harder to reach my goals.

I never do end up reaching them though, even if I put insane amount of work into it.

At the start I thought that failures mean just that I didn’t do my best and then I’d try harder next time, but then I would fail again , then try harder next time, then fail again.

I feel like my work simply does not pay off and that I’m destined to be a miserable failure.The more I lose the more I feel like a loser, the less I win the less motivation and belief in myself I have.",23May2019,1
387,"Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. If there's a better subreddit for this let me know, I'm new

Basically it's as the title says; I have no idea how to form (and continue) a relationship with anyone. I've been going to therapy about it but I just really feel like I need to get my complete thoughts down somewhere about it.
 
In highschool I had awful social anxiety, it was difficult to reach out to anyone that wasn't a drug dealer or a ""drug buddy"". Once I graduated, or was in the process of getting my GED I got on tinder, and that really helped with my self confidence. I'm great at first impressions, being that funny, charismatic guy. Usually after the first date it's a solid segway into whatever I want with a girl. It never lasts though, after the couple times we hang out the conversations get shorter and eventually trickle off. This isn't really a one off thing, because when it's just about sex I get it. I do. But when someone wants an actual relationship with me, and I want a relationship with them, everything gets so complicated. I try too hard, or I try too little. And with that, those girls trickle off as well. I know it's a problem with me, I'm not under any false notions that the fault is any of theirs, or most of theirs lol. I dont know what it is though. Maybe I get boring? For some reason after they say ""Hey Copycat_Coffeeshop, I want a relationship with you"" my anxiety goes through the roof, and I end up trying too hard.

I don't know what it is that I do. It's the same thing with friends. I just have no concept of how a relationship is formed with anyone. Do I text them everyday? Do I see if they wanna hang out a couple times a week? Do I invite them over for games? I mean obviously everyone is different and there's no ""rules"" to having friends. I'm a huge introvert but I get lonely, man. I've been trying, I went to basically being an incel (without the hating women lol) to what I am now. Sure, I know I could just get on tinder and end up in another 2 week relationship, but after doing this for about a year now the cycle is getting more and more apparent to me.

I'm just looking for any advice anyone has to offer at this point. If you read this far, I really appreciate it, thank you.

Tl:dr: I have no concept of how a relationship is formed with anyone. I've been on tinder for about a year and have basically been a revolving door for girls. I can never keep a relationship going though, and this problem extends to people who want to be friends (not on tinder). I just don't know how to develop these skills.",23May2019,1
388,"So I work in a company with just three people, but we share two office spaces with another company that has about 20 people in it. My two coworkers are in the other big office, I'm the only one in this separate office. One of my officemates (we'll call him G), right next door to me, always takes phone calls with a speaker phone on and leaves his door open. It's incredibly distracting for me, but I admit, I'm super sensitive to noise.

I do have a door to my own office, but I have no windows in mine, so if my boss stops in and sees my door closed, he thinks I'm gone, which isn't great. (This officemate has windows on his office - in fact the whole wall is a window). 

I'd like to politely ask G to close his door when he has these calls, but to be honest, he's an aggressive jerk, and I'm expecting it to be unpleasant. Side note -- neither company has an HR person, so no one to go to on that. And my own boss has a habit of doing this too, although his room is in a corner of their office, so it doesn't seem to bother anyone, but makes it acceptable behavior to him. 

I barely know G -- I only know him around the office to say good morning to, but like I said, he comes off as an entitled jerk most of the time, so I've been really hesitant to say anything, wanting to avoid either a confrontation or a dismissal of my request. I think HIS boss may be somewhat easiest to approach, and I know her slightly better than G, but it seems like I'd be making a big deal out of everything going to her?

I had the thought of just emailing him the following: ""Hi G, Would you mind, when you have phone calls on speaker phone, could you please shut your door? It would really help to keep distractions down, and unfortunately, if I shut my door, it looks like I've left for the day. I would really appreciate it! Thanks, Pannymcc""

Does anyone have advice for how else to handle this, or does this seem ok? I know it may seem silly to others, but I have a hard time with confrontation and aggressive people in general -- plus -- this is ""their"" office, that I'm just taking up space in and I don't want to step on anyone's toes. But it's driving me nuts!",23May2019,2
389,"So I've got a little 6 month old puppy, his name is roo and he's awesome. But he still hasn't figured out to lift his hind leg when he pees, so he's always pissing on his chest and legs. He's also somewhat fluffy and has all white fur, which 50% of the time gets stained with piss. I have to give him a bath every day and he hates it, it's kinda funny but now I'd like to know if there's a trick to this or maybe he'll figure it out on his own after awhile?

I have been replaced so many times and I feel like it’s because of my own personality. My boyfriend doesn’t know what to say to me I feel like the friends I have really don’t consider me a friend but a second option or the second go to when they don’t have anyone else.

391,"My partner recently got a job at a law firm. She’s an assistant for the summer internship program for law students. So she helps that department coordinate events for the law students. 

Before this she worked as an assistant in media fields. She had left her previous job and looked for one for 4 months before she landed this current job. That had been a really difficult time for her. 

Fast forward to now. She’s been at this job for almost two months. She started out as a temp and then was offered staff. During her time as a temp, her boss was singing her praises constantly. Saying she was such a valuable asset that she wanted to end the temp contract early so they can hire her as full time staff.

Once she got hired as staff, that’s when the issues started. 

Her team is very small. It’s her, another assistant and her boss. My partner had made a mistake in an email that day and after that her boss got kinda crazy. 

Her boss now takes time out of their extremely busy day to scold my partner all the time about even the smallest things. For example, my girlfriend needed her boss to approve something, but it wasn’t urgent. She sent an email to her boss asking for approval “at her earliest convenience.” The boss then took her aside and scolded her for 20 minutes about using the term “at your earliest convenience.” 

She’s also constantly expected to stay overtime. She’ll work 12-15 hour days regularly. She is paid for her overtime. One time she left on time because she was told she could, but apparently that was the wrong thing to do. She was expected to stay even though she was told to leave. Her boss brings this up every other day (about how she left “early” this one day). 

Things like this happen constantly to her at work. It feels like they (the boss AND the other assistant) are bullying her and constantly making her feel stupid and gaslighting her when she tries to stand up for herself. 

Her boss even accused her of not caring about the job once she got hired as full time staff. Which is untrue because it’s clear to me that she really cares about this job. Almost too much. 

I feel like I don’t have any advice to give her other than to hang in there while looking for another job. But maybe one of you has better advice? 

TLDR; my girlfriend started a new job and it was going great at first but now she’s being bullied and gaslight by her boss and other teammate.",23May2019,1

Then people start pointing fingers at me and ignoring all the efforts I made, accusing me of making no efforts even though I lifted mountains. I don't understand why people are stuck in this hivemind of pissing me off.

394,"So, two of my friends, we'll just call them J(woman) and H(man), have started dating. I've kinda seen it coming for a while. Neither one of them is good at being secretive. Lol. 

So here's the thing, I used to have a huge crush on J. We've known eachother about 6 years and have been good friends for a while. She helped me after my dad's suicide and I helped her after losing a father figure of her own.Though our friendship has lessened in recent years. I still harbor minor feelings for her. Guess we can't always help who we are attracted to, right? She doesn't return the feelings though we do flirt a lot for fun. And it's making me feel conflicted about the relationship. I wanna be happy for them but I'm just getting that mixed with a small bit of jealousy and something else. I don't know what.

Now H is also my friend and coworker. We're ok friends. Wouldn't ask him to be my best man or anything. But his ex, who I am also friends with, is asking me about the whole thing, and I wanna give her unbiased answers but I don't think I can when I feel conflicted about the relationship myself. 

All this together is making it difficult to find out how to deal with it. I base a lot of my choices on logic and try to decide how to move forward based on that. Hard to do though when your emotions won't calm down.

I guess what I'm asking is how do I move forward with this. Do I communicate to them that the relationship is making me uncomfortable? We're all adults and they do have a right to date if they want to. Should I distance myself until I can calm down and react more rationally? I'm asking here because I could really just use some outside opinions or advice. I've dealt with this kind of thing before and been fine. Just rolled off my back. But this time feels different. Thank you!

Sorry for the long post.",23May2019,1
395,"So, I'm 18 years old. Going to college in a few months and I live with my mom, dad, and brother.   My relationship with my dad is nothing to write home about, but my mom has been steadily deteriorating over the years. 

I think it started a few years ago when I was at school. My mom spends most of her time in her the bedroom watching HSN, and having me and my brother bring her things from downstairs. Taking down her trash, bringing her club soda, those things. At the time, she had been complaining about my room for a few days, but I'd never had the opportunity to. I had a lot on my plate, and I was having problems keeping up with the workload at school. She'd never stophow things are all in the wrong spot, I need to be an adult, that jazz. Eventually, she told me one morning that I had to put all these things in their place NOW (it was a school day btw). I afraid of running late so I got as much of it put of the way with the idea I would finish when I got home. When i got back later that afternoon, I saw everything spilled out on the floor. My clothes, toys and office stuff were all just on the ground. 

I told my dad since I thought there was a break-in, but when he talked to my mom about it she said that she was the one who did it. She said that I was the one that needed to learn responsibility, and how she'd given me ample chances to fix it. She then went onto day that this whole thing was something I was doing ON PURPOSE.  

After that, I asked why she would mess up my rook if she wanted me to clean it. It didnt make sense at all. In response she sat me down and told me a story of how her grandmother's bed was so clean you could eat off of it. She told me how I needed to be clean and 'thorough' with how I did things, and that if I'd cleaned it sooner she wouldn't gave done it. By the end of the lecture, I remember just nodding and going back to my room, (mostly because I was bored out of my wits). 

A few weeks later, me and my brother were watching TV in the living room and one of us had made a really funny joke that sent the other one into an uproar. We were laughing and screaming, apparently loud enough for her to hear us upstairs.

So she comes down stairs and starts to scream at us. And I dont mean scream as in 'lecture' i mean she mockingly starts to scream at us. Mimicking our voices.

Now, my brother is autistic. He has issues dealing with pressure and breaks down quite easily. So when this starts he completely breaks down and she just keeps leaning into him. He yells ""STOP IT"", and she tells us to be more quiet before going upstairs. 

The same thing happened a few more times, and became a nearly weekly thing. 

To add insult to injury, whenever one of us would forget to flush the toilet, or didnt fix something exactly, she would lecture us on being adults and 'honest'.

Eventually, I had enough and told her to stop doing this. She called my uncle and made me listen to his lecture on how I needed to 'respect her'. I gave him a bit more context into what was going on, and told him she was mocking my brother and I but he told us that she was still our mother. 

I didnt feel like any of them really had my back on anything, and whenever they came over my mom would play victim and tell them how stressful we were for her. And that we needed to be more 'obedient' (again, her words).

After a few more years I had enough of it. I got tired of her complaining about us to our relatives. I got tired of her screaming downstairs for us to get her food and taking her garbage down. I got sick of her screaming at my brother, and we got into a pretty big fight with my mom. I ranted how she never stops to introspect and how she blames everything on me. She went back to her room, muttering to herself that I was a disrespectful child, and how I didnt know anything at all.


The same thing happened the next day when we ran out of toilet paper. She screamed about how we had to being up more rolls and i bew up again. She laughed, and asked me if we should take this argument outside, and that if I wasn't a coward (her words) I wouldnt have been hiding inside. That one ended with me walking up to her and saying quite sarcastically ""I know thos is hard for you..."", I tapped her forhead as I said it (Completrly in the wrong there, but I was in no mood to let this just slump off. ), and she responded by grabbing me and trying to force me to the ground. I stopped her and told her to let me go. After she did, she ran outside to her car and drove to my grandmother and some other relatives.

Later that night, they all came to the house, stood around me and told me how what I did was wrong. She made it out to be like I was the one that grabbed her first, and I was abusing her for years.


Now she's filing a police report.to get me therapy. I dont want to go because she'll just make it out that I'm the abusive one and that I'm just an angry child. I dont want to play these games anymore, and after graduation I dont plan on coming home. I dont really know what to do.",23May2019,1
396,"So I've been talking to this girl for almost two months now. We text everyday, hung out a few times at school, and went to see a movie together. We seem really close and have become really good friends. 

Yesterday I asked her to prom, which is honestly pretty last minute but we just started talking. She first said shes already going with her best friend, but added that shes not interested in dating people and likes me as a friend. It really hurts me bad because this was what i thought was my final chance after all of my failed relationships in high school. Not only that but she was one of the most funny, interesting, and kind people I have ever met, so I find it hard to imagine finding better for me.

We talked a bit yesterday on text about staying friends, and apologized to eachother about the awkward situation. She said ive been a great friend and does want to stay friends. She has been really kind and understanding but obviously things are different now. I want to talk to her again about the whole thing but its all so soon and i dont want to bother her and end up pushing her away...

Im hurting really bad right now. All of my friends have prom dates, and im feeling lonlier than ever. My self-esteem has plummeted and I think i might have lost a good friend. I know I need to wait longer but I cant help but want to just do something about this because i feel absolutely horrible.

I want to stay as friends but there of course is still that feeling of romantic feelings toward her and I want to latch on to any possibility she could like me still or even ever.

We can’t afford to give her medicine for it (apparently $3 per pill and 2 pills a day which adds up to... a lot) so she just has seizures every couple months. The problem is that I think they have changed her personality. She was a nice lap cat before the seizures and now all she wants to do is sit and wait for my other cat, Scout, to walk by so she can attack her. Scout is 14 and weighs less than half of what Georgia does. The good thing is that Scout will be moving out with me in August but that still doesn’t change the fact that Georgia has become mean and kind of standoff-ish.

401,"My boyfriends native to the area but moved up to mass a couple years ago, so we’ve been visiting his family and friends down here for the past week. Ive been living in western Massachusetts for all of my almost 20 years of life. It’s a rural farm area and I’ve never had much going for me there. There’s almost no opportunity, no things to do, almost no sun, and everyone is a stuck up dick. 
&gt; 
I also never got out much. I haven’t been to many places yet I still don’t see my future as being in Massachusetts. I’ve been very sheltered my whole life. This is my second time coming to Florida in my adult life, and it is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been in my entire existence. The sun and the heat feel so good. The palm trees are so beautiful. There’s so much variety of things to do, places to eat. And I would probably almost live at the beach. The vibes are so much freer, calmer, and it just feels like I fit here. I’ve never felt that before, I’ve always been out of place. 
&gt;
The other day, my boyfriend and I went to an animal hospital to visit the animals and the woman thought I was from here and offered me a job. I have enough money saved up for this trip to put money down on an apartment. My boyfriend has a second car down here that we could probably use until I get mine shipped down here. My dad has been the worst he’s been mental health-wise that I’ve seen, and just recently he’s got it under control. I told my mom how I want to stay here and she gave me the go ahead. She said I should do it if it feels right and if it doesn’t work out, I can always go back and live with her.

The only problem I have, is asking my dad. I need his opinion. He was in an extremely vulnerable state for over a year and I don’t want me leaving to bring him back to that place as soon as he got better. What should I do?

He's great and we love each other, sex life is okay, but I'm still jealous/insecure. 
I had some appointments with a psychologist, but at the end it didn't help me.

Let me give you some examples of my own behavior that I don't like:

I snooped in his phone 2 times: once very early in our relationship (I found a text to a friend of him where he said that he'd send him a picture of my boobs, if I'd send him nudes. We had a fight over it, but eventually he was just bragging as a 17 year old). And once a few weeks ago (I saw a text from some girl I don't know, it was something about a game I think). And this is where I start to hate myself because I can't stop thinking that she's a threat and he's still texting her and I should check again.

He went abroad to study for a few months and I was scared, just because it is a difficult situation right? The thing is that there was one other girl (pretty cute one) from our country. I asked him to please make some other friends than her, because she made me insecure. He said that I shouldn't worry and he won't become friends with her. Eventually he did, of course... We had some rough discussions and the conclusion was that I was wrong asking him not to become friends and I'm way to jealous. But he wouldn't talk to/text her anymore, so we could move on. 
When he was back home I wanted to make a video with his phone on snapchat and saw she had sent him something. Of course I was sad and jealous again.

So how can I stop with being a jealous girlfriend? Because at the end he did nothing wrong.",23May2019,2
406,"About a week ago I was walking home from school when a kid, taller and bigger than me tried to mug me. I defended myself after he punched the back of my head and a lady stopped the fight. Up until like two days ago nothing happened and I went about my daily routines such as going to school etc. However just yesterday I was at a local park with some friends and my girlfriend after school when the same boy but this time with four more of his friends all hooded came into my direction so knowing that I’d be safer if I just walk off I walked away but they began to follow me so I started to run and they shouted “we know what school you go to”. Whilst I do finish school and have a three month break off I still have to go in for another two weeks until I’m done. However, them waiting outside of the school for me doesn’t bother me as I know I can easily avoid getting beat up/hurt. The problem is that I live in a dangerous area and my girlfriend lives where the gang followed/where that guy attempted to mug me. It doesn’t help that my friends all made fun of me for “being scared” or “being a pussy” but it doesn’t necessarily bother me too much. I can’t tell a teacher or the police because the police is very weak here and doesn’t do anything to help, with muggings and stabbing happening frequently. I’m scared that when I run into them the next time I’m going to be fighting for my life as there is a high chance the gang carries knives. I need to go see my girlfriend of course and I need to walk home and to school but the chance I run into these guys again is just so high it scares me every time I leave the house. To tell you how dangerous my town is I’ve been nearly mugged and had my phone stolen and reset almost 3 times (including this time) in the past 2 months, with several other of my friends also having these encounters.

I mentioned it to my coworker, who just so happens to be majoring in graphic design. I used this is an opportunity to hang out more often with her and spend more time to get to know her as we designed a new menu. 

A few days ago her parents surprised her and visited her at the restaurant while we were still on the clock. I hadn't noticed, so I continued joking with her and teasing her like we usually did during work. A few days later, we were eating together after work and she mentioned she had to tell me something.

She said that her parents asked if she liked me, and it turns out she does. I like her as well, however she's told me in the past that she's still kinda getting over a 3 year relationship that ended a little over a year ago, so I admitted that I wouldn't want to make things awkward between us especially at work.

411,"I just finished my freshman year at a university as a computer science major. Applied like crazy for internships because it’s hard to land one as a freshman. Got one through my university and started yesterday. Got an email from another company that I got theirs. Now I don’t know what I should do. 

Internship through my school: data input, not as cs related as I would like, $13/hr &amp; 40hrs/week (required). But is work from home and will be continued throughout this Fall. 

Internship from tech company: more cs related, $18/hr &amp; 40hrs/week. 1.5hr commute both ways. But will help me more major wise.

412,"I have a personality disorder ridden and enmeshed family. It’s hard to tell what is and isn’t normal because I’m just now learning about this. 

I was raped and molested frequently as a child. My father taught me that it’s my fault and taught my brother that boys get desperate.
He was crazy but he was dying. At times my brother would protect me from assault but I’ve heard from other family members that my brother did something borderline sexual to them. I remember about 5 years ago waking up in the middle of the night and he was on top of me.

I’m 18 now and he goes through my phone and checks my room for boys. He gets angry and threatens to come with me when I step out of the house. When I put on actual clothes he looks me up and down in a way that makes me uncomfortable and asks me about where I’m going and with who (as if I’m seeing a boy which I’m scared to do because my family is constantly on my back about boys). Something about it makes me uncomfortable. He’s almost 25 and asks me why we don’t sleep in the same bed anymore and gets furious with me when I tell him I don’t want hugs or kisses today or at the moment.  

Something about it has an incestuous ring and it’s scary and makes me upset because my brother has been my only real support from emotional, physical, or sexual abusers and financially. Moving out doesn’t help either because my mom sabotages my attempts to move out (getting me to quit my job, telling me I can’t work, bullying me into depression).",23May2019,1

I have multiple interests in life. I couldn’t do anything worthy until now. And still sttrıggling with doing so. I decided to do, create and try whatever i dreamed before.

Now i thought about this, and it’s bunch of irrelevant subjects to one another.

I’ve found a job and will start in june. (Been looking for 2 years and thats why i was in a bad place) 

I hope it will be all good soon.


Now the subjects are;

-Working on building a promising career for future, SAP Consultancy on mu case. (Will start in June)

-making my own music. I have very good taste in music at least i’d like to think i have. And i believe i can create some listenable tracks

-everyday i think about things that can be counted as startups. (App ideas, biz ideas etc) i want to create things in that area too. (Like today i got a call about my idea i’ll go talk to people about it but i have to focus)

-one or two subject may be counted as well but i think it will be more than enough if i could be able to do these for starters.

414,"is it normal to feel like you’re not “allowed” to grieve someone you’ve lost because of all the guilt you feel? i genuinely don’t know how to right now and i know it’s not healthy. I recently lost my dad. We were very close when I was younger but during my late teens/early 20’s I did a lot of things he disapproved of that I know hurt him a lot. I didn’t have enough time to mend the relationship with him and now I’m starting to wonder if he lost respect and love for me. 

I know everyone deals with death differently but what is generally considered normal? I’be always been a very emotional person who cries at the smallest things, whether it be tears of happiness, anger, sadness etc but i can’t cry anymore even though it felt like a form of therapy for me before. I don’t feel much deeply anymore, feels like im just going through the days, riding it out because what else can I do? I’m not sure what the grieving process is supposed to feel like. I’m 24 and this is the first time I’ve lost someone this close to me.

420,"Hey guys, i hope you all are having a nice day!
So, story is, i'm really confused about my teacher. He's around 45-50 years old, he's one of my art teachers. He always praises me and asks me if i'm okay and things like that, and for a few weeks now he wanted to show me his studio. He told me not to tell anyone, because he doesn't want to bring others, just me, because i'm apparently very talented and outstanding. Last Sunday and yesterday i went there; Sunday to draw and yesterday to be a model for others to draw. I got there earlier and we were alone for a while, he checked what position should i be in and then we talked. After he offered me a cigarette he started asking me if i've ever been with guys and if i'm a virgin, started asking about my genitals and if i masturbate and stuff like that, you know, nothing weird AT ALL. Then he told me how he likes hanging out with his friends and that maybe someday i could join too and we could drink champagne. For your information, i am turning 17 this September, which leaves me underage. It sent me off that he, my teacher who's decades older then me is offering and asking about things like this. I had an undershirt kind of thing under a simple white shirt and he was like, what's that? And pulled my shirt just enough so he could see my chest. Then in his studio, before the other students arrived he was sitting in front of me. He told me to stand up, hugged me and sat me on his leg. And he didn't effing let go, i looked at him like wtf and he just smiled. I still can't figure if he just took a breath or smelled me tho. So i stood up and took a few steps back, and he just kept smiling, then everything went back to normal. He messed with my hair a lot and grabbed every chance to hug me. 
So y'all remember how i wasn't supposed to tell anyone? Yeah. Few of my classmates who i'm close with know plus my 2 best friends. Besides my mother, of course. I wonder if i fucked up with telling them all this, i feel pretty guilty about it.

I texted him 2 hours before we were to hang out and he never read my text. An hour after we were supposed to hang out I texted again, kinda mad, like “are you serious??

It sounds good, right?
Well, life is not so great actually.
I come to you guys because I need help. As much as I love what I do, I can't seem to be able to study anymore. I have 9 exams this semester. That's a lot and I started studying early so I have time to take all of them.
The thing is, I can't focus these days. I sit at my desk, trying to read articles and write essays like a good student during finals, but most of the time I end up doing something else. Even the smallest distraction breaks my concentration. I read stuff that trigger some other unrelated stuff in my mind and poof! I've wasted another hour watching cat videos on YouTube.
It's always ""Hey, it's 12:45, might as well wait until 13:00. I'll play some video games in the meantime."" And then I lose track of time. 
I tried taking short breaks , but they turn into long breaks. I tried working on something else to have a bit of diversity. I tried taking a walk outside. I tried listening to music. I tried coffee and tea. None of them worked. 
At this point I'm just angry and frustrated because I could have done more and I should be doing more, but I just can't. 
It's like running a marathon and stopping right before the finish line, unable to move. Everybody's cheering, but you can't hear them. You're there, stuck in a moment in time.
And it's not just this aspect of my life that's affected. I also need to lose weight but it's always ""I'll start on Monday. A piece of chocolate won't hurt. Today I'm not going for a walk, I have more urgent things to do."" And so on.
These lies I keep telling myself are pushing me on a road on which I do not want to go down. But there's something stronger that keeps pulling me back. 
I have seen a psychologist, but all the things she said and all the exercises she gave me were in vain. The thrill of changing, of becoming a better person disappeared after a week and I just couldn't be bothered to start over because I knew it would be pointless.
People I talked to said that I lack discipline, but at my age it should come from the inside. I can't expect someone to babysit me. The problem is that I was never an obedient and disciplined person, so I have no idea where to start from now.

427,"This is gonna be really long, so buckle up.
* Note: I’m a Teenager, if you haven’t noticed by the title, but there it is.


BACKGROUND:
      I have very religious parents. They’ve always been very Christian, and yet, growing up in such a household didn’t alter my religious views at all. I’m a weak atheist, a firm part of the LGBTQ+ community, and a simple teenager just trying to pass my classes.
My parents don’t know any of my views- to them, I am this pristine child of Christ who’s thoughts are exactly like their own (don’t get me wrong; I love them to death, but my whole family is very stubborn).

     Well, just a few months ago, I developed a very strong crush. I’d never had a crush before, believe it or not, as I grew up very independently and never needed anybody to lean on. But this girl- she’s just amazing. We’ll call her Naomi, because my naming isn’t original, and I’m very obsessed with musical theatre.
Naomi is somebody I’ve always thought of highly, but only recently have I had a crush on her. She’s really sweet and all, but you guys aren’t 100% here to hear me rant about how great this girl is, if any percent at all. 

      So, I have a concert next Thursday, as you saw from the title. My mother is ecstatic. She’s so ready to hear me perform, which is awesome and super supportive. But I planned to come out at this concert. Through song. I know, really cliché. I’m in a lot of fandoms, so I’m singing a song from a T.V. show that’s from one lesbian to another because that’s special. But, here’s where the issue comes in- my chorus teacher assigned a project to write our own songs. It’s a final.
He heard me practicing mine, and asked me to sing it for the concert. 


THE ISSUE:
      He asked me to sing the song I just wrote at the concert. That’s fine. I get another solo, sure. But a friend of mine teased me and said that I should write a song about Naomi. So, I wrote a song about Naomi. And I invited Naomi to the concert literally that morning, and forgot to say anything to the chorus teacher. He’s already helped me practice this song, so I don’t want to quit on him. 

      But my parents, being religious, get worried whenever I seem to drift from the “perfect child” view of me that they have. I sang a very depressing song, Waving Through a Window, for another chorus concert, and they got me therapy just because I liked a song. So they’ll surely know I’m gay, which was my original intention, but now I’m almost 99.9% sure they’ll assume I have a crush. Which is true, and they won’t be wrong, but it’s just terrifying.

      Why I’m looking for advice? Well, to cope. As in- how in the world do I have a full on conversation to my parents about all of this, and deal with confessing to my crush? 
      
      Yep. There’s my rant. I am so scared.",23May2019,1
428,"So it’s definitely not illegal in my state which is the most important thing, the age of consent is 16 and she’ll be 18 in 2 months. But I still don’t know how to feel about it. But anyways, I met her at work and she would constantly hit on me. I told her to leave me alone at first because I had a boyfriend and she has a girlfriend. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend and started feeling really lonely bc I have no friends rn after being in such a long relationship, just lost touch over the years. She kept asking to hangout and after some encouragement from another coworker 25m saying that we should when he heard her keep asking I decided I would. I found out she isn’t a normal 17yr old. Pays all of her own bills, responsible for herself doesn’t depend on parents which explained why she was so much more mature. Nothing happened but ended up hanging out again and hooked up. Yeah she has a girlfriend but idk I can’t really say anything about that part. I went to her house to see her again and her 21yr old sister was there who also works with us.

I don’t see her sister for a few days then end up working with her and we have to close together. She doesn’t say anything to me until everyone leaves that I’m never allowed over there again, that We’re disgusting, I’m disgusting bc I’m older, and says she’s gonna beat my ass if I come back there.

I've always been so optimistic of people, so nice and calming just so I don't let things go out of hand and so I'm the person to give advice to. Around 13 I had my first heartbreak which sent me spiralling down into the thought that no one cares, after so I got over it. Around a year or two later I fell in love again. Her name was L, let's say. L loved me as much as I did her and she always seemed to want to talk to me everyday, after awhile we got into an argument about my time schedule because it was hard for us to talk (I was busy with exams and such), I then broke up with her as a way to basically say ""maybe this isn't such a good idea"". I had a great best friend at the time, he was awesome, I could talk to him about anything and he always listened. Here's where the fun part begins, after so I break up with her, I tell him that I still feel for her and I still have those feelings tucked away in me somewhere and they don't want to come out. After I told him that, he decided he wanted L, he immediately asked her out after I said that to him. I did know he had feelings for her, but after i said that to him, I felt so distraught, so anguished and angry. He then later on decided to throw me out of his life, calling me a cheat, a prick, he even made it so L didn't want to speak to me just because I broke up with her. Ever since this guy did this, one person after another just didn't want to talk to me, I lost hope, faith and all my friends just because of one guy, I even try to message one of the group friends and they usually don't want to talk. After so onto college, I met these group of people which were okay and we always had laughs and all, we talked a lot of our problems and a lot listened. Now after college, one of the main people I hung out with doesn't care anymore.. I message him? Ignores me, hapoy bday message? Ignores me. Ever since these has been happening, I can't find myself to trust people the way I did before. I still even second guess myself with the group I have on PS4, I try to trust people as great as I can but I just can't.

435,"I am a naturally friendly, happy person. I say hi and good morning to pretty much everyone at work even if I don’t know them, I live in the Midwest, what can I say. 

I used to walk past the front desk every morning, and say things to this security guard (SG) such as small talk about weather, office happenings, all very general small talk. SG messaged me on skype one day, trying to chat with me. I do not work “with” him so I am unsure how he found me on the Skype business network; I’m not sure why a security guard would have access to that information, but he found me. I shut down the conversation because at work, I keep things work. I don’t go get drinks with coworkers, I make small talk and go home. As such, I blocked him on skype immediately. I also now park further from the front door, just so I can walk in through the side door to avoid the front desk. That worked for a few days, but then somehow he began every morning being in the elevator area (not near his desk) every time I would come to work or go to lunch. Every time. These instances can certainly have nothing to do with me, but I decided to just not take the elevators and take the stairs up to my office just to make it even that much easier to avoid him. The stairs are far from his desk, I thought it would be fine, and it was for almost a whole week. This morning, he was standing by the entrance to the stairs, not walking past, just standing.  “Hello, I haven’t seen you in awhile” he said. I just said that I’ve been parking in a different spot, and told him to have a good day, and walked up the stairs. 

I can totally see that this may have nothing to do with me, we work in the same building so maybe he just happens to have a similar schedule? Or he wants to get to know me and has no malicious intent? But there are two things that are making me ask for advice about the situation. 

#1 I have bad, bad vibes. I try to trust my gut on these things and I am telling you, alarm bells are going off like crazy. Have you ever met someone that just feels very off and you don’t know why? You look into someone’s eyes and you just feel like somethings wrong? I have asked a coworker I am close with how he feels about SG, without telling the coworker why I was asking or giving any context. The coworkers response, in a somewhat joking way was “oh well he’s nice enough but definitely a serial killer.” I just played it off and said “oh haha I hear that” or something to that effect. 
#2 he literally sits in front of 3 computer screens worth of cameras on live feeds. He can see when I’m walking somewhere, and he can tell where I’m headed. The amount of times he’s been away from the front desk and has “just run into me” has become daily if not twice a day, and now that I’m changing where i walk to specifically stay away from him, it’s even more concerning to me that he always seems to be there. 



 I am going to start walking up stairs that are even further from him, and buy pepper spray. He is a very small man, and I am not physically intimidated by him but I just don’t know what to do. This may sound like I’m overreacting, I totally get that. I DEARLY hope that I am. Truly, I hope so. What do I do??? If it drops off and he’s normal, and gets the picture that I don’t want to talk to him, problem solved! But what if my guts right? How do I have peace of mind at my workplace?",23May2019,1
437,"About a month ago, a friend of mine thought I was laughing about a rude comment made about her family member. While I dont remember laughing (I didnt think it was funny so this made no sense to me) I have upset people in this way before. As a defense mechanism, and as a faulty attempt to diffuse the intensity of a situation, I'll ""laugh"". Its not because I actually find something funny, it is almost purely due to anxiety.

She never told me she was upset until the other night. After what was a fun night out, I mentioned the name of the person who made the rude comment. She was instantly triggered, turned her intensity towards me, and threatened me. She told me if I ever laughed about or disrespected her family, that she would kill me. She repeated this to me, telling me how serious she was. I was incredibly upset and we ended up having a giant argument.

I tried sending a message a few days later telling her I was still upset about the death threat, but also that I was sorry if I actually had laughed because it wasnt my intention. I asked her to bring up things that bother her so that we can have a conversation next time.

She told me she would respond to this message only if she could find the time. She hasn't. I also heard from her boyfriend that she doesnt believe she overreacted at all.

440,He’s recently opened up to me about his depression and suicidal tendencies. He’s told me how thinking of me and being with me helps him cope but obviously I can’t be there all the time. It makes me so upset knowing he’s going through all of this and there’s only so much I can do to stop it. He’s in therapy but it’s not doing anything for him and I’m so worried.

I'm not even in need of sex, as I have a partner who fills that need. I want to be fully supportive of women wearing what they want, and also of maintaining a safe feeling work environment. I don't want to go to HR and be like ""make them wear bras please"" but I don't want to come off as a thirsty creep either. How do I fix this? I'm not even talking like long aggressive stares.

445," 

Hello, everyone. I've got a weird situation here- the rent at the motel I'm staying at is due today and my paycheck from last week was short because I skipped two days and then quit the job. Putting it shortly, my mental health isn't the greatest rn and the place was just way too hostile &amp; stressful for me to keep working there.

I've got a new job starting next week but until then I need a bit more to cover things so I went through my transaction history at BoA to see if there were any overdraft fees I could contest and while there are five of them, they're all from last year. The three customer service reps I've talked to including two supervisors said that they can only go back 90 days but I figured I could go to corporate or executive customer relations or just someone who could get them waived.

Has anyone else had any experience getting an overdraft fee refunded that was older then the 90 day limit or does anyone who works at BoA know any loopholes I could use? There's got to be something.",23May2019,1

Senior in high school

I've quit nicotine for at least a month by now and I'm not gonna lie it's probably the best decision I've ever made but something seems wrong. For this whole month I still have the same lack of energy as if I was smoking to begin with. I don't study as much or do anything physical apart from occasional walks around my town but for some reason I just don't have energy to do anything anymore. I want to join a gym and even start working but I just feel awfully tired right after school to the point I can barely do anything and I start forgetting a lot of things. I might be lazy but i still want to do these things yet I feel like I mentally and physically cant. I also don't take naps and sleep extremely late even though I'm tired just because I can't fall asleep plus I've been having the same neck/back pain for this whole month. I've had depression and suicidal tendencies back then but it's gone for now if that might has to do anything with me. Should I just straight visit a doctor and ask what's wrong with me? Anything can help :D",23May2019,1

I done good in my GCSE’s with the average grades being B-A’s and a few AS levels. I thought I would like to continue my education in medication, but school was such a tole on me mentally I dropped out because my anxiety peaked. 

I decided to take a year out job hunting and then I decided to take an apprenticeship. Some things led to another and I’ve been put on hold for another six months. And at this point I don’t think it’s fair on my parents to put up with me.

But I work 5am to 3pm and I get a 15 minute break at 9am, and usually at 9, my SIL comes over to my house to smoke with my wife, which I have no issue with, but when she comes over, I don’t know if she’s doing it on purpose, but she always wears low cut shirt and she has some pretty big tiddies so they kinda hang out, and I absolutely cannot help but stare.

So the issue is like I said, not that I’d leave my wife for her, because I wouldn’t. But I see those things and I just wanna see them uncovered.

452,"I've got two job offers, and I am not sure what I *can* do, should do or could do.

The first job is an administrative post in a multinational corporation, 19K a year + 1K bonus per year, health insurance paid, free lunch for employees, discounts in products, free gym with basic utilities, and an in house doctor. Basically, stability, comfort but not something I am passionate about. I would start mid June, 6 months contract which would be extended.

The second job is a teacher assistant position in an international school, 16K a year, free lunch for employees and your kids can go to the school for free (but I don't have kids). The plan would be to start as a TA for a year, study to get my teaching certificate and teach biology teacher the following year, increasing my pay to 20K a year. I've never worked in a school, so is new and exciting, but I might be too late to apply for the teaching certificate course, which costs 4K. To start in September, 1 school year contract.

My options:

1. Accept both jobs, start with the first one, and if I really like it give up the second one.
2. Accept both jobs, start with the first one, give 1 month notice and then start the second one.
3. Accept the first job, negotiate with the second one to start in 6 months (end of first contract) as a way to save up money as I am late to apply to a teaching certificate degree.
4. Accept the first job, negotiate with the second one to start next year instead, as a way to save up money, take full advantage of corporate position, and being able to apply and pay for the teaching degree more comfortably.

Are there any other options?

I've never been in this situation. I really wanted to accept the teaching job, as the administrative job was my plan D, however, the advantages and stability of the administrative job is quite welcoming for someone who was unable to work for 5 years due to an illness and has used a lot of the savings. I didn't know the teaching position would have such a low income. If I didn't have the first job offer, I would have accepted it gladly, but now I have an option.",23May2019,1
454,"So this might be a long one. My dad is red flagged or was however because Ontario now has a pedophile protection code where it's all blued out if you try to go on the website now so not sure how it works. Anyways, he has my two brothers, A (8 yr old) &amp; E (18 yr old) because he ended up claiming he pays rent for the basement  apartment so it's kind of a loop hole. He has molested E and I when we were 4 and 6 (I'm the oldest) and the baby sitter as well and we lost all visitation rights when I was 8 years old (before that it was supervised by a worker) anyways that didnt stop me from wanting to live with him when I was 13, which was a pretty dumb mistake because one night he got drunk and was trying to show me a ton of porno magazines and trying to get me to cuddle him? So I went to my step moms  mothers house for the night at like 3 am and moved back in with my mom shortly after. (My moms broke and he had a lot of money I blame greed for wanting to live with him then honestly.) He eventually had another kid with my stepmom and he is the most adorable little kid in the entire world. He has severe autism and ticks, but hes also my best friend in the entire world. When I was 13 and lived with them, he would cry every time I'd leave the house. Every time my stepmom and dad would fight I'd hold him and his ears and try to comfort him through it. I love my siblings they're my everything. And hes the youngest out of 5 of us. Anyways, flash to when I'm 20 and living on my own. I've forgiven my dad for everything and even spent a lot of time with them since I've been living alone. I make sure I'm not around my dad when hes drunk but I have forgiven him for everything just to be around my siblings growing up, E ended up moving in with me at one point but then moved back in because he wanted all his stuff, (can't blame him my dads pretty manipulative and Es older now and makes his own decisions). Anyways things were going really good for a while until I posted something about how proud I am of my stepdad for recovering from a heroin addiction and being an amazing father to his two daughters right now (my two sisters) because it was a post about homeless people and my stepdad was homeless at one point for a very horrible reason that wasn't really his choice. Anyways I'm allowed to be proud of him. He knows I absolutely hate drugs because of him and hes trying everything to change. My dad however saw it and lost his absolute shit on me. I took it so hard but told him I dont need him in my life if hes going to continuously freak out on me like this. I have horrid anxiety and throw up everytime things like this happen. Its brutal. But flash again to A's 8th birthday and me texting them trying to ask if I can buy him a gift and drop it off. No answer just ghosted hard. So I figured I geuss not but maybe they'll let me call him on his birthday if I left them alone. Call on his birthday and my stepmom freaked out on me saying to leave her family alone if I'm just going to continuously hurt my dad. I mean there's a million other things I could have written here but I'm not trying to make this too long. I'm just so confused how being proud of my stepdad for quitting a horrid drug and being a better person and getting himself off the streets could hurt him so much. Hes never changed (my dad) so how can I be proud of him??? My brother is everything to me and I want to fix this but it's so hard to come up with the words to fix this. I dont want to say I'm not proud of my stepdad hes one of the greatest men I know and he is the one who raised me?

459,"To start off, on Monday, my good friend named Filip wanted me to get tampons from the girl’s bathroom so he could trash his buddy’s locker as a joke. I thought I would be pretty funny so I took 20-30 tampons from the girl’s bathroom. I gave it to Filip and during passing period and he ended up trashing the entire hallway with bunch of other people. I was pretty pissed off and just shrugged it off, praying they I won’t get caught.

Fast forward 2 days, it’s Wednesday. Somebody snitched on us so I get a call down to the vice-principal’s office and obviously, I was scared as fuck. It wasn’t just me that was involved, it was multiple people. Those people went up to me in the hallway and asked me not to snitch. Most of those people were going to be in the talent show, and if they got suspended, they couldn’t be in the talent show. I’m not a snitch so I kept their word. On my way to the hallway, I met another friend that goes by the name of Choo Choo. He told me to lie because the vice principal had talked to him and according to Choo Choo he was bluffing about the security cameras. I kept his word and headed towards the office.

The Vice Principal interrogated me heavily and I denied the allegations. He pointed out the security cameras and I told him that if he checks the security cameras, he won’t see me. I still thought he was bluffing and I didn’t snitch on anyone, which was a huge mistake.

I was stressed out from 2nd-7th period. During passing period, I went to print something last minute. I had to hurry up because I didn’t want to be late for class. All the sudden, there were these 2 7th grade bullies who went up to me and asked me if I could fight them after school. I said “buddy, go back to class I got work to do”. As the printer was at 89%, the bullies push me and banged on the computer and keyboards, so it won’t print. I was super furious and mouthed the n word. They weren’t black, I said it out of context and it slipped out. I don’t think that you should say it in any context, but now that I said it, I’m really guilty. The bullies told the office, and I headed to class without the piece of paper. 

During 9th period I got called to the office and I knew it wasn’t going to be good. I headed to the office and met the Vice Principal again and asked me about the N word. I denied it because I doubt there were security cameras in the library and I didn’t want to risk an in-school suspension and the talent show. But I knew it was endgame for me so I ended up confessing. I got an in school suspension and I owned up to my responsibilities and actions. Filip ended up getting one too but it was for half a day. 

The tampon thing was a little stupid scheme that I did. The n word thing is what I am super guilty about. I realize it could haunt me for the rest of my life. I also realize that the entire school will know about it because of a stupid decision that I made. And those 2 7th graders could tell the entire school about it. And even if I survive through that, those people could come out whenever they want and tell my boss/coworkers/etc when I get a job. I think it’s a huge deal and I really don’t wanna exist anymore.",23May2019,1

We found out as well that a few things like hard drives, old laptops, the piano keyboard were missing. He said that he did it for beer money as well as weed, nicotine patches, codeine cough syrup etc.. We told him if he sold one more thing, we'd kick him out and told him to enroll in a drug rehabilitation programme. I also put a lock on my door.

He was really upset and was questioning leaving her because he was tired and exhausted as well from the relationship. Once I got to her house she was working on putting their 1 1/2 year old to bed. She asked me to take her and then just lost it. She was bawling so badly that she couldn't stop. She could barely get two sentences out without crying.

I suffer with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, etc. The whole gen z baggage. Recently, as we moved into this year, it got worse. I don’t eat (I force myself to eat throughout the day that rounds up to a meal). And it’s been hard up keeping normal things like cleaning and hobbies. My suicidal thoughts are relentless, but do not worry, I completely have control over that portion of action. Atleast for the most part.

Lately my depression has gotten so bad that I began to harm myself again. But it’s not like what it was years ago. I’d slam my fists into my head or body and it’s like I can’t control it. Just as soon as my emotions and mind feel like they’re melting me and overwhelming my body or head will ache and my fists just fly right to them and start pounding. I try my best to hold back, to calm myself down, but it doesn’t stop. I don’t want to hurt myself. I worked so hard to stop hurting myself, I’m embarrassed I even started again. And especially ashamed of how I do it. I at one point smashed a handheld vacuum on top of my head during a break down. It’s not pretty and it’s not what I want, but it feels like I lost control.

The worst part of it all is that I completely disconnect from myself when I start going down hill now. Like, the best way to describe it is that I’m watching a show of myself, watching myself cry and freak out. It feels like a normal, conscious me is in the back of my mind watching this all happen. I have no better way to describe this. At times that normal me would have awful stuff to say while I’m in a depressive episode, “if you keep doing this they might care about you” “how long until you kill yourself, that will really get their attention” “hurt yourself some more so they’ll feel guilty” and sometimes during those moments that i just disconnect from myself my body just goes relaxed, no more tears, normal, like everything’s ok, before everything just flows back out and I’m back to rocking myself and sobbing. The other half of the time that normal me is just quietly watching myself fall apart. Not too often but the disconnect happens sometimes as I’m hanging out or doing things. It just feels like I’ve completely lost myself. I worry that if this becomes a consistence and continues to get worse, I’ll kill myself and watch myself do it.

I’ll try to answer any questions you guys have, this is my first time posting on reddit I just heard it’s a good place to get yourself some advice.

Here’s a couple quick things that might help to know.

My family just isn’t the best to me. Trust me, I’ve asked for help. Until I have a noose with me like my brother did, they aren’t going to do anything. I don’t plan on getting anything close to me that can actually kill me to help keep me alive. It’s just complicated and useless to continue trying as it ends up only hurting me and making it worse.

I’ve reached out to my boyfriend for help, we’ve gone through issues because of my mental state though. He tends to ignore it even when I told him I was hurting myself and needed him. I no longer reach out to him. He’s going through his fathers recent suicide right now. I don’t see it right to try and reach out anymore.

I want to start therapy, but my anxiety has been holding me back from it. I’m working on it though, I’ll be there eventually.

My friends are good people, I know they’re here for me, but they just don’t talk to me personally much. I don’t feel right reaching out to them consistently.

I haven’t had an episode in a while, but that’s because I’ve barely been alone. I’m usually out with my boyfriend helping him cope with his recent loss. Though when I get home I disconnect. He notices, but we leave it alone and he leaves for the night.

I’m sorry this was long and probably confusing, I just want some advice and understanding on whatever is going on with me.",23May2019,1
475,"I met this guy at work and long story short, he seemed nice at first but now I think he’s a complete asshole. I went to AmITheAsshole subreddit and asked if I was an asshole for slowly ghosting him.

Mixed results but everyone was telling me I should just tell him I don’t want to be friends. Thing is I have anxiety and telling someone that just sounds awful to me. Is there any easy way to do this, or should I just suck it up and tell him?

(Note I’m planning on telling him via message. I also rarely see him in person)",23May2019,1
476,"I recently found out that my 12yo brother is being bullied at school and I need some advice on what I can do to help him. He is severely emotionally distressed and suffering a lot.
The bullying is in the form of verbal abuse and occasionally physical. There is a group of kids at his school who always want him to hang out with them and when he does they will often try to peer pressure him into doing things he doesn't want to do. If he refuses then he is subjected to verbal abuse. If he refuses to hang out with them then he and his actual friends are abused.
As far as I know, this has been happening since January and he only revealed it to my parents and I this week. He has previously lied about it to us; he told us that his glasses broke because they fell off when he was running when he had actually been put in a headlock.
To conclude, any advice that you guys can give me on what I can do to help him would be very much appreciated.",23May2019,2
477,"In short, I started cutting myself three weeks ago. Before this, I was hitting myself and scratching myself hard enough to cause my arms to bleed. So yeah, I am pretty self-destructive.

And unfortunately, I also have a friend who deeply cares about my well being and now she's planning on telling one of our teachers about me cutting. She's doing it tomorrow and I really don't fucking want that but every time I try and convince her not to tell I either upset her or simply fail to persuade her.

478,"I want to give you some context about me: I had it quite easy for the most part of my life. School: good grades with no real effort (I listened in class, and did the work, but no extra at home. most of the time I didn't do my homework, which sank my grade a bit). Got through college quite same (played LoL most of it instead of studying). Got lucky and landed my first job as I was in college internship month. And worked there since. as Data analyst/entry and QA. As time went on I was considering options, but mostly stayed at the same job because of people. And the company grew from \~10 people to \~150 ATM in 3 years.   


Last year there was changes in management and I went away from QA and was left at DA/DE position... Mostly Excel work, analyzing and then entering the data. I get quite good payment for the place I live in and live quite a comfortable life.  


Again, last year, I took out mortgage and got myself an apartment to live for me and my girlfriend... (this is important for my decision..)  


Well even though we now have a huge office with entertainments, you don't have to sit at computer all day as some robots.. But this job just got me burned out.. I can't force myself to work more than I need to. And even then the job is literally the exact same shit everyday... I just feel like I am standing still and do not learn anything, just not growing as a specialist... Because of this I started spending more and more of my days on Reddit and YouTube. sometimes I can't force myself to do anything productive for days.. Sometimes i would think to myself I want to quit and change the job.. But this is so easy and safe... (especially with 30y mortgage..)   


But now for some reason I start to feel even worse. I was almost at the verge of panic attack after I came home today just by thinking how much I hate it that I have to go there everyday (mon-fri)...  


And now I mostly just basic worker without real good knowledge as I, for the last 3 years, just stared at the excel screen day by day.. I can't even force myself to do anything at home, as I come back defeated. I just spend time with my girlfriend or watch netflix/play games. I even gave up on my dream to go for software developer job, as (mostly from having it easy all this time) can't force myself to overcome obstacles and learn to code past functions/arrays..   


Now I hate my job, have near panic attacks thinking of what will I do if I quit and won't get as lucky? what will I do with the mortgage? 

More or less questions are: How do I overcome this anxiety? How should I start learning and preparing for something new? And how for the first time in my life I convince and fight myself from taking the easy route and just staying where I am for another 3 years?

481,"To give a little background, I’m a college student without a job. Personally, I don’t mind giving rides if we’re all hanging out and will not ask for any compensation. However, I have this friend that simply expects me to give rides for free to places I don’t really care about. He has been a known freeloader in the past but has recently gotten a job so he’s not absolutely broke. He basically asks to hang out but eventually, he’ll say that he has to be at some place at a certain time. I do it for free though I obviously resent doing it and I feel like he uses these hangouts as a source of transportation. Recently, he asked if I could take him to a place 30 minutes away after a hangout. I asked if he could chip in $5 for gas and he refused. He was aggravated about it and claims that he would do the same if he ever brought his car (he lives 2 hrs away so his parents take him as their jobs are nearby) but he never has. I gave in (stupid me) to giving this 30 min ride eventually but I honestly am pissed off at the situation myself. Personally, I feel like I’m being used and I don’t really value this friendship but he is part of my friend group so I cannot just drop him randomly.

488,"Some background on this: I am a lesbian, engaged, woman. My best friend is a straight male. We have known each other for over six years and have talked on a constant basis despite the distance (I moved away for college and he stayed in our hometown). When we first met 6 1/2 years ago, he was interested in me. We briefly dated. I was struggling with my sexuality and wasn't sure what I wanted. Since we got along so well, I decided to try to date him. It didn't work out. I treated him unfairly and cheated on him with women. (Which I still feel terrible about) We broke it off and I tried to repair our friendship. He was eventually understanding. It took years to get to a normal place, but we did. We've been each other's support systems for years. He's traveled to see me in my current city several times, staying with me and my current partner the last time he was here. I visit him when I visit my family in our hometown. He knows my family very well and they love him. We've become like family. I helped him through deaths in his family and several other traumatic events. He's friends with my partner and loves us both and has completely moved on from me romantically. OKAY. SO. with that in mind, here's the story:   


My best friend started talking to this girl on facebook that he had known back when he was in high school. They hit it off online and started developing feelings for one another. She does not live in the same state as him, so she planned a trip to our hometown on the same weekend me and my partner were going to be visiting as well. My best friend and I thought this was perfect timing because although I was wary of long-distance meet-n-greets, I knew how important this was to him, and I would get to meet the person that was making him so happy. We talked about hanging out together — all of us. The weekend came and my partner and I flew into my hometown. My best friend ignored my texts and calls for the entire weekend until the day I was leaving back to my city. Apparently, when he told his love interest that he wanted to hang out with us, she freaked out. She did not want to meet me, citing that she was uncomfortable with us being friends because we had dated six years ago. I did not know this. We all met after me begging to see him (since I only see him two or three times a year), and it was awkward. Looking back I realize it was my presence in the situation and her insecurities about our friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been three months since that meeting. They have officially started to date even though they're not in the same state. He is moving to her state in the next couple of months. He has not talked to me on a consistent basis at all. We went from constant communication to basically none. I confronted him about it and he said it was because of how torn he felt about his gf, begging me to empathize with her case. He says that she had a situation happen where her ex was friends with his ex and they ended up falling in love again and her ex broke her heart. While I can understand the trauma there, I can't fully empathize considering I am a lesbian and am also engaged to someone I love very much. Furthermore, she's a grown woman, older than every single one of the people involved in this, and we all go through terrible relationships sometimes, but that doesn't mean our lives should be defined by those situations. To me, it comes off as incredibly insecure and controlling.  I can't say this to him because I know it will only distance him more, but I feel like I don't have a place in his life for absolutely no reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also causes so much resentment in me because he threw away a friendship of six years for a 4-month relationship. I don't know what to do. We are currently not speaking because I told him that I couldn't be in this in-between state anymore where I was such a sore subject with his partner. I told him I'd be happy to stick around if he could just talk to her and make her see I'm not a threat in any way. He told me he would, but it's been almost a month with no answer and I haven't heard anything back. It looks like I've just lost my best friend and I don't know how to cope with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm angry and hurt beyond words and I guess I just need advice as to how to deal with this in the best way, and if that way means walking away from this and just ignoring the loss, then I need advice on how to make this hurt less lol. I guess I just need affirmation that I'm not crazy too. Because my partner and my friends think this is nuts, but they're all biased. So maybe if someone empathizes with the other side I might be able to understand and be less critical. I don't know.",23May2019,2

It has been proven that eating healthier and wearing cotton underwear helps keep your flora from smelling funky. I’ve done that and my partner and I have had a better sex life because of it. The problem is that, one little bit of sugar ruins my flora right away, I’m not sure what’s going on. I’ve never had this issue before where I eat unhealthy and my vagina smells bad right away, like REALLY BAD. To a point where it turns my partner and I off. 

I’ve been tested for STD’s and there’s none so it has nothing to do with that. Could it be possible there’s something internally wrong down there? Or is it because I’m older now? I’m 26 for reference.

499,"Very recently, I had a friend my age (20) die pretty tragically. There's been an outpouring of love and support from the community for her family and friends and for each other, and she truly has left a legacy of love, kindness, and joy. While death has always been a struggle for me to accept, this recent passing of my friend has been affecting me more than usual. 
I'm afraid of looking back on my life and feeling unfulfilled. It's always been one of my biggest fears since I can remember. My life has so far not been very boring, and certainly full of love and adventure, but I still cant help feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. When I look at my own parents, I feel like they were so full of potential with so many opportunities, but they just settled for mediocre and never having accomplished much. I'm terrified of waking up in thirty years and realizing that I've become like how I've always perceived my parents to be 
 I know I am young and that I can't expect a full, well rounded life when I'm still just starting to explore the world and my identity. I try to stay active and occupied, and while I know that my life is not boring, I still go to bed feeling empty and unsatisfied. Since my friend's passing, there's been an added desperation to live and experience as much as I can while I can. It doesn't ever feel like enough. The days and weeks and months seem like they pass by with little to remember. 
I've been thinking about volunteering, as a way to give back, and maybe going back to therapy.

So 5 years ago I was accepted into a big, high-ranking university on a full-ride scholarship on a course that would have led to a well-paid and respected career. During those first few years things went very south for me; depression, close relatives dying, my best friend committed suicide, I was having trouble making new friends, nothing made me feel happiness anymore and I became antisocial and anxiety ridden. I still tried my hardest and even changed major to something less demanding but I was still spiraling. I just wanted to disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a complete breakdown a couple of years ago and moved back to my hometown to work in a supermarket and try and get better. A couple years on and I'm still there, I'm a lot more stable than I used to be and only now I am looking for jobs that will give me a career as I don't have the money (or sanity maybe) to go back to full-time education. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is: how do I explain my past without sounding pathetic? I had a job interview recently for a good position with lots of upwards opportunity in an international company, I was so psyched I could possibly be getting my life back on track, but they asked me towards the end of the interview about my university experience... and I became self-conscious and blurted out nonsense. Even with my colleagues at the moment - they are telling me to go and do 'bigger and better things' and 'why did you leave your university course, why don't you just go back?', and I have no idea how to respond without telling them my life story to understand. If I try and deflect with 'Oh I went through some hard times but things are better now' further questions are always raised or I look like an idiot who isn't smart enough for further education.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help, I'm tired of feeling like I let my only opportunity in life pass me by. What response can I give that isn't awkward and long?",23May2019,2

-At primary school, I had a very close friend that friend left. And in his place a person we'll call with the first letter of his name: G. 
-I don't remember how we became friends. I always thought G was quite quiet. I have no memory of G at primary.
-Now at high school G does things that make him untrustworthy now in secondary school (Year 8)(Grade 8?)
-He sets me up to test me manipulates what I and he says to get what he wants
-I've told him this via. text and he says he wants to change: why should I trust him now after two years of lying.

508,"My friend and I have been going after a girl for a while now and both of us know that we like her. We were eating at our graduation and she kept putting my arm around her, and it made my friend extremely angry, but I worked it over with him, but she wanted to know why my buddy was angry for that moment. I decided to text her that I would facetime her after we all were home and confess my feelings for her, but plans changed and she asked me to text her what was wrong, and told me that she knew that we liked her. My buddy drove her home as well and also told her his feelings and the whole information about our ongoing struggle over her.

I texted her this morning to call me when she wakes up so that I can talk to her about it, and this is where my need for advice comes in, I don't know what to say to her.

509,"OK so context:

About a few weeks ago, I cracked my back tooth somehow, half of it broke off while I was asleep.

Had tooth ache for 2 days, and then developed dental abscess about a week later because my local dentist was booked too  much to see on a shorter notice.

I went to the emergency dentist and he gave me some antibiotics to get rid of the infection, and they worked, and he then referred me to a different dentist for an assessment (this is about 3 weeks or so now) and they booked me for a removal of the tooth today.

However, I ended up having a massive panic attack in the dentist's room (I genuinely have a fear of dentists and needles which is what the surgery would be about) so they decided I am too anxious to have treatment.

So they referred me back to the emergency dentist who is referring me to a local hospital to have sleep anaesthetic. 

However this will be about up to a 2 month wait.


Is it safe to live with a cracked tooth for about 3 months? Is there anything I should  do to keep the tooth clean from infection/stop another infection rising?",23May2019,3

My 6 yr old American Long Hair male cat is peeing under my dining room table. I’ve brought him to the vet twice and now they’ve told me it’s a behavioral issue.

He has a total of three boxes and they are cleaned regularly. I’ve tried blocking the area off for an extended period (not great for the flow of our house) and he goes right back to the same spot as soon as I open the dining area back up. Help!

513,"My sister can’t take being wrong, she is hypocritical and thinks the world owes her, or at least that’s how she acts.

The scenario and result.
Sister talking about how a chips flavor changed it’s bag color from green to blue, part way through I pipe up, If she had carried on talking I would have let her finish, she stopped so I spoke. She then accused me of cutting her off, which would be correct if it was my intention, I apologise and wait. Not 10 seconds go by when my dad does the exact same thing, I look in her direction and she asks me what I’m staring at, so I call out the hypocrisy and she throws a tantrum, so I leave. Curious myself to see if the chips packet color changed because it’s always been one from my memory, I find the company has a FAQ where it literally says that it’s a common misconception, I send her a couple of screenshots and the message “according to brand name they never changed the color”. I go back in the room 5 minutes later and she treats me like I’ve just farted in her face, my mum leaves to the shop and says that we better sort out our differences, I try to talk and get told to stop talking and leave it alone, I started recording because I tried.

Look, in my opinion she is a snowflake with a superiority complex who doesn’t like to be proven wrong, or rather challenged on her beliefs (even over stupid things such as color of packaging of chips) I’m at a loss, she’s my sister.

515,"Excuse my pity party, but I'm posting this in the hopes that you all can teach me something that I have yet to learn from this recurring theme in my life.

Story time: I had been doing well at my job for a while, been on a really good streak and then I had one bad week (more on this later). Which my bosses of course noticed. My best friend planned a trip to go camping because he's switching jobs and he took a week off between the two. This all happened last minute so I decided to take off 3 days sat, Mon and Tues to travel with my buddy. 

At the same time, a family member who I am not close with died and the memorial service was held that weekend in California and I live on the east coast. I wasn't particularly close with them and decided to stay behind because if not my friend would go alone.  I figure I can pay my respects later. Also the plane trip would be rather expensive and I'll need to replace my car very soon. 


So my family leaves at the drop of a hat, and I luckily found someone in the last Nick of time to watch our 2 dogs before going camping. My family didn't have a plan for the dogs honestly. 

I got back two days ago and my dad calls me and says ""Can you come a few states over and do a job for a friend? I need an answer right now and he'll pay you well $1500 for 3 days. 

I just took off work and my boss was kind enough to let me go last minute. Then I'm being propositioned for a sizable amount of money at the expense of my boss again. 

I let the money go thinking that I couldn't do that to my job. 
I may also be leaving this job soon for a much better paying job. 

I am seriously kicking myself now for not just taking off again. That money could have went into my next car and my savings! 

I feel like this happens to me with women as well. I feel like women who are actually interested in me come into my life two at a time. And I'm stuck juggling the pros and cons of both girls without trying to be a player. Which comes off weird in my actions around them. 

The thing is these things keep happening all at once and overlapping one another forcing me to choose. 

 I wouldn't have a problem with all 3 of the events I described above if they'd been spaced out properly. 

Why is it always one or the other? 

Can anyone share some wisdom/ a fresh perspective with me without making me feel too shitty? 

TL:DR :
Months will go by with no events be it friends, jobs or life events/otherwise, and then several things will happen all at once.  The same goes for women that I really could consider dating. They seem to come 2 at a time.
How do I come out on top in these situations w/o regret?

Is there a lesson in this that I am missing?",23May2019,1

So I started talking to this guy on FB who's going to be attending the same university as I am once summer ends. He sent me a message and we stated talking and flirting with one another. We seem to have a lot of chemistry and a great connection. We've been talking non stop for close to 2 weeks, but he told me early on that he didn't really want a relationship and we both agreed that it wouldn't be the best idea to go into the first year of college tied down to anyone. It was never really my plan to even do so, I was going to go into college seeking new experiences and being open to them, just like any other student.

However, he came into my life out of the blue and I feel as though we have moved sooo fast and already have a really strong bond. But, he continues to reiterate the fact that he doesn't want a relationship and that he likes the way we are now. We flirt a lot, send each other very sweet messages, joke and talk throughout the day about basically anything. We even have a snappchat streak going, so we send each other snapchats everyday. At first, I didn't really care when he said that he didn't want a serious relationship because I thought I wanted the same thing: to be wild and free at university. Now I just don't know. He has said that he thinks we could have somewhat of a FWB relationship. Friend who like to hang out, but also have sex.

We ended up sexting the other day, and we both enjoyed it a lot. But he then again reiterated that he doesn't want a relationship when we began to have a serious convo about whatever it is that we have going on. He said that he liked what we had now and we both agreed that we didn't know how our feelings would change when summer was over so he said that we should just take it day by day and see where it goes and what happens but that we should stay in the happy bubble that we are in now.

I told him that I needed some time to think and that I would get back to him. He just confuses me because he seems to very much like me, he always texts me first, he calls be gorgeous and talks about wanting to cuddle with me and kiss me and etc...idk the ""relationship"" has just escalated quickly and we're just chatting on social media! I didn't ever expect to have such strong feelings for some random guy who messaged me on FB because we were going to be classmates.

I've come to realise that I don't just want to have meaningless sex with someone. I'm not built for it. I know myself and I know that I would just feel empty and hollow, always wanting more of a connection. I've been celibate for 2 years (by choice because I realised that casual sex was NOT for me) and of course the temptation is probably what is drawing me to him because we both like each other. However, I now know that I don't just want FWB.

The problem is that, I don't want to stop talking to him and he has told me in so many words that he wants keep me around and that if we decided later on down the line that the physical stuff isn't working, then we just stop and contiue to be friends. I also told him that if my heart got broken I would cut him out, to which he replied that he wouldn't make it difficult on me as he wants me to be happy.

So this is my dilemma: should I stop talking to a great guy who I have a connection with, because I don't want to be roped into a FWB relationship, always thinking in the back of my mind that it could lead to more as I know that I will get my heartbroken when it doesn't?

Should I just be honest with him and get my heart broken now if we stop talking, rather than get it broken later on in the future when things get more real?

I don't want to stop talking to him, but I also want to honour my feelings and be true to them. We haven't even met yet, but it just felt so real to me. Wtf it sounds ridiculous I know.

Advice?

TD;LR- Should I tell him I don't want to be FWB and that I want more, or just go with it and see how it goes?",23May2019,1
521,"Story time:

Once upon a time when I was in high school (only a few years ago, I’m in my mid 20s now) I was best friends with a girl who was about 2 years younger than me. We got along great, never had any issues. But when I went off to college 2 years later she decided to stop being friends with me. 

While this happened suddenly, I connected the dots. When I got to college I was immediately signed with a modeling agency, and of course, like most people I posted this announcement on social media as I was very excited and wanted my friends and family to know the big news! Modeling was something this girl and I (let’s call her Sara to keep things anonymous) had always bonded over. So naturally I thought she would’ve been the first person to reach out and congratulate me.

This wasn’t the case. In fact, all of her close friends and family congratulated me so I know she knew about it and decided not to say anything. When I confronted her on the matter she lied and said she never saw it but “oh, congratulations.” A few weeks after that I reposted a picture someone else had on Instagram (something dumb, like a picture of leaves) and she put me on blast saying I stole it from someone else. If I remember her comment correctly it said, “lol, this looks a lot like so and so’s post?” I deleted her comment and the picture as I didn’t wanna deal with her. After that we were no longer on speaking terms.

I decided I didn’t really need someone like that in my life, as her reasons for being mad at me were significantly petty. But, 2 years later came around and I was still pretty curious why she decided to end our friendship. So, I reached out to her thinking you know, some time has passed and maybe she’s grown up a bit. She agreed to grab dinner with me (seemed pretty excited) and said she couldn’t remember why she got mad at me but that I did something that “peeved” her. So, that was weird but I agreed to meet up with her anyways.

The dinner went fine, felt like old friends just catching up. When we left that night I said we should definitely get together more! And she seemed all for it. Did I ever hear from her again? Of course not. 

She ended up transferring to my college so I began seeing her around a bit. I remember one day she came into my work on campus and I had just missed her (this was about a year ago) so I shot her a text (something like) “shoot! Too bad I just missed ya!” and she responded etc etc. Everything seemed fine. No weird interactions. In fact, when I was at a football game last year she was the one who came up to me and said hi and asked me how I was.

Since then, I’ve graduated college, moved on with my life and haven’t seen nor talked to her. (update: Sara and I are both signed to the same modeling agencies now and work with some of the same people). But other than that I have no relation to her at all. 

I went on Instagram yesterday and saw her tagged in one of my friends pictures so I clicked on her profile as naturally I thought to myself “how is Sara doing?” and it turns out she blocked me. I have absolutely no idea why she would’ve done this. Like I said, I have not spoken to her or seen her in over a year, and we have not been good friends in YEARS. Can anyone make sense of this for me? I’ll get over it, I just thought this was an extremely odd thing for someone to do considering I haven’t even talked to her in years.",23May2019,1
522,"Ok so I think this is my last option I would often see people get good advice on here so I thought I would try it out.{ ok so I am just a teenager and ever since I was young I always had friendship problems friends would often use me for what I had the leave me once they were satisfied so I picked up pretty fast how cruel some people can be so I ended up distancing myself and having trust issues but the time I turned 13 I had about 1 true friend and that’s about it then in my bio class I noticed this one girl had liked the same thing I liked so I told her about them we talked a bit after that then more and more we talked then she ended up showing me to her other friends and they ask me “hey we are in a dance group, would you like to join?”

I never thought about dance as a serious thing I just only danced at parties and that was about it (and some past really shorty ballet classes) so of course so I said yes then after that it was all so fun we would do dances,have meetings,sleepovers. basic teenager shit and they more I got to know them I felt like they accepted me for who I am and I was happy to have a good amount of friends. So I opened up a bit and started to trust them a bit (so like I said I have trust issues but once I finally trust someone I go too much in being really giving person like I was when I was younger) then our middle school years were over and during the summer an incident happen with one if girls and she had she decided to leave the group out of aggression.

(To keep in mind I am often a very negative and bitter person sometimes and I get annoyed easily and I have anger issues so when I get angry sometimes I lash out a lot and am I also very judge mental to new people keep that in mind) so we all ended up going to same high school and I have classes and back then there was 9 of us but there were 4 of girls that have been childhood friends so it’s understandable they tend to stick with each other but I never realized it but recently how much stuff I didn’t notice cause I was blinded by just having friends after so long. We talk on Instagram have about two gc’s our main one where we just talks then our announcement one for dates will practice,have meetings etc. or.. so I thought but I found out that there was a lot of other gcs were it excluded this members or that member. Then I found myself slowly kinda getting with the main 4 girls so we would just hang out just us but sometimes they would talk about the others members like saying that this quality or that quality about them was annoying and I do that sometimes but it was easy to talk about the members with them.

But I only really talked about one cause was a attention seeker,and acted like a baby, and like tend to people on her side so when she did some fucked up stuff she wouldn’t get in too much trouble. (So I have more money then them so I get more things then them but I would never flex on them or be a douche bag about cause I was in the same position as them at once so I try to stay humble as much as possible) and they would make jokes like saying I am rich of course I denied it and just took as a joke. But until recently these groups of directors took interest in us wanted to do documentary on us cause we a young dance group with struggles but my parents noticed that this whole documentary thing was getting in their heads like yea I felt a little special here and there but never try show to other kids about what was going on but like more and more. 2 of the mains girls would feel comfortable with them and like so did one of main girls mom too like she would show them baby pictures and talk about their childhood. Then the director got to interview my parents and just ask about they think about the whole situation and they just talk about me a bit and just try to answers they were asked key word try. 

But they were telling me when we got home that one of main girls mom would try to stood them up like a competition to see who was the best like she would interrupt them answer the question they were asked etc and of course we found it funny and mom told me that’s why her daughters act they are like attention seeking at some times and very whiny at times cause that’s how their mom treated them. But I never really much about it. But I noticed that parents would often ask how were the girls? How was the group? But this Question would often pop up  when are YOU gonna perform with the girls? When are YOU gonna post a cover on yt with ? When are YOU just gonna stop showing to practices even though you are not in dance? 
and my sister told me straight up that I was a groupie/water boy to the girls then that’s when it hit me.. I WAS a water boy to them all those car rides to places, all those given items and clothes out of kindness and sympathy all those gifts and presents bought for them. And ALL of this all out kindness and just happy they were my friends.

Now this is my problem and why I am asking for help on here you know how said I had money well my whole life I have been called a brat,spoiled etc just cause I had money this was by family and some friends. So every time I heard that term I would get sad or mad but mostly mad I was actually a good and sometime too giving I can admit but that’s what hurt me cause I weak and easy to take advantage of I would often play by myself or end up crying at home the kids at school would talk about me. And know this was mean but sometimes my mom would tell things I would kinda Moan and groan and Sometimes was rude to my mom but I think that everyone once in their lives Ik it’s bad I am trying to stop. But I would sometimes do this in front of my friends and Ik they wouldn’t look say I am brat but I they think it all the time and I said as a joke “Ik you guys look at me like a brat” one of main girls said “ yea we do” so what proved my point but I never address it cause I didn’t want to lose my friends. My only friends. (But actually end up making couple more friends in high school and got really close to this one girl) so like I said when I get mad I lash well there was like 2 times I lash out on them but like I didn’t call them name I was just like “idc if your not my friends anymore y’all jump me and beat my fucking ass for all I care” but I would never insult cause I still cared about them. But more and more the 4 girls are pushing me away and like there were days were we could plan to hang out but then one would say they couldn’t go then one would be like oh then it would us 2 and me (oh I forgot to mention to main 4 are two sets of sisters so if one sister can’t go then the other can’t of course) then I text of sets of sisters and be like “so can I still come over or....” then they would be “😂 it would just be us 3” 

And I was thinking ok what’s the problem then I realized oh I get it they didn’t want to hang out with just me so I would send a meme to lighten the mood and just leave them on read this has happen many times before. And maybe you are thinking well didn’t you just hang out with the others girls well I mean I would but they don’t really hang out a lot and the dance group is spilt into 2 groups the main 4 and the other girls then I am kinda in middle but now I am at the end the girls pushed me away and away and my parents told me this but I was blinded so my and found that they been telling others people that I am controlling of my parents and no I am not I don’t cuss at my parents I don’t say I hate them I don’t make them my slaves I just sometimes get mad at them but that’s normal not all parents are always right. And also to mention I never but they never put in any dances like I never got perform like everyone has but me. So we have scheduled and on this Saturday we have meeting that’s when I was gonna confront them and tell that I am leaving even if it’s not all the members I can’t torturing myself just cause I care about the others but something recently came up. they finally put me in a dance I just went to practice yesterday to learn formations but I can’t go today cause to stay for class. But we are going to post the cover on Friday and I can’t just leave so wanted to get the cover over with but this one foreign exchange student joined us for a bit and she is the sweetest person but school is almost over and she is heading back to Thailand in june and I really am gonna miss her and I want to spend time as much as possible with her and she asked all of us that she is having a pool party the day after the meeting( the day I planned to confront them) then realized if I confront them then I won’t be able hang out with them anymore I already have got my others friends and advice and family this is my last option after this the decision that’s is chosen then I’ll just that after this is the nail in the coffin so here are my options


1.just leave rn don’t do the cover don’t go to meeting don’t  go to party for the foreign exchange student just confront them as soon as possible 

2: so the cover to get it over with but confront them on Saturday and don’t go to pool party and just say my goodbyes to the exchange student the day of the meeting 

3: so do the cover and don’t confront them and go to pool party and buy after the party confront them 

4: do the cover and don’t confront them and stay with them until the exchange student leaves so I won’t cause confusion and sadness cause I won’t be able to see her again (also before all this happens I said we should make her a scrapbook to wish her a goodbye and remember us and America)



So please help I need to know as soon as possible and also about the story sorry If i misspell or skip words my brain moves faster then my hands and I have dyslexia and I rambled I am sorry If you any questions for about anything to get a clearer opinion feel free to ask",23May2019,1
523,"I have one cat, she is about 8/9 years old. I also have a labradog and she is 8/9 too. I adopted both within the same year and they were both estimated to be about one year old when I got them. So these two have been together for a long time. I live in a two bedroom second story apartment. I have a roommate. He is very much a cat person. He has a cat that lives at his parents house and he's thought about bringing him but he's pretty much settled that he's going to leave the cat with his parents because that's his home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago my dad brought home a 'kitten' covered in rode rash from being tossed out of a moving vehicle. When I showed up I was like dad, that's a full grown cat she's just tiny. Then I picked her up and she was full of milk. He thought she was going to have kittens, I think she already had them and she was just so undernourished when he found her that she had no milk at the time. Now that she is eating well her milk came back but clearly her babies are gone. I don't know, she's probably pregnant again as it is. it's been like a week with her producing milk and no babies yet. I vaguely remember my cat getting ready for milk like the day before she gave birth.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad doesn't want the cat. I keep sending snaps of it to my roomie trying to get him to adopt her. He finally caved the other night but I had already left so she couldn't come home with me at the time. And on a realistic note I'm wondering how well integrating another cat into the apartment would go? 

&amp;#x200B;

I will need two litter boxes and it's difficult enough to place one. I'm not sure where a second would go. I know my cat likes to get territorial with new things and poop on things like a psycho. (Just once. just one poop on something new to me and never again) she has never been with any other cats so I don't know how cat friendly she wants to be. My dog is terrified on my cat and I'm a little scared for her to be stuck in an apartment with two cats. There was a long time where my dog wouldn't go in my room because my cat decided it to be that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate is pretty depressed right now. And I think that having a cat again that he cares for would be really beneficial for him. And he's a cat person and this little tiny female cat is sweet as can be. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it is going to be stressful for a while, and I don't know how worth it it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have a cat and a dog. My dad rescued a cat. He doesn't want the cat. Have been trying to convince my roommate to adopt the cat. Not sure if transitioning a new cat into a small apartment is going to be feasible. Adopt or not?",23May2019,1
524,"So a little back story, I grew up in a very Christian home with an uncontrollably strict mother. Sex was something that was a HUGE deal and it was constantly pounded into my head that it was wrong to have sex, especially out of wedlock. Now I’m 22(f) and my boyfriend (23) and I talked about how I really struggle being comfortable while having sex because a part of my head tells me it’s wrong. We’ve been working on that and I’m feeling way more comfortable with my sexuality and I’ve always been curious about sleeping with another woman. I discussed this with my boyfriend and we decided to let me explore that side of myself we could have a 3 way with another woman. Only problem is neither of us have any clue how that would work and how to go about this. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",23May2019,1

She came into the pub when he wasn’t there and asked me something about her phone as it wasn’t working properly, whilst I was trying to sort it she received a text from another man, it opened up and it basically a lot of nudes sent to one another. She doesn’t know I’ve seen them as I’m not a confrontational person but it’s wrecking my head. I want to tell my father in law but at the same time I don’t want to be dragged into it. Thought about sending him an anonymous text saying to check the texts between her and the male in question but worried that once it all comes out, people will find out I knew and ask why I never said anything?

528,"So I’ve know my friend, let’s call her Sam, for 8 years. She’s always been there for me, but she had scoliosis surgery when she was 12 so she’s always had back problems. So whenever do anything, she always talks about how her back hurts or how she can’t stand for too long or whatever. In addition, she is always talking about how she has anxiety and depression. I empathize with her because those are all things that I understand have a huge physical and mental toll on a person. The thing is tho, she is CONSTANTLY upset or complaining about something, and doesn’t do anything to fix it. At the beginning of our friendship, I would always be sympathetic and ask her what I could do to help. I soon realized tho that she doesn’t want help, she just wants to complain.

She recently had to get another surgery for her scoliosis and her negative attitude has been at an all time high. Every time I’m with her, she complains about her back or how she’s depressed. I went over to her place, asked her how she was doing, and immediately she said “oh my life is falling apart” in a joking way but that’s how she talks all the time. She quit her job, failed all her classes this semester, and has spent the past 3 months sitting around doing nothing while she heals.

One day I couldn’t take it anymore. I sent her this long message explaining how I love her but I need space while I finish up school and that her negative attitude is bringing me down. Obviously I realize now that was NOT the thing to do in her time of need, especially since she’s so sensitive. She responded with an essay calling me needlessly cruel and unkind, told me I said such hurtful things in a callous text and left her as a casualty. She said I don’t do what good friends do and I’m only friends with her when it’s convenient for me. 

Sam had a falling out with one of our other friends, Lily, and to this day she complains about how that friend never came to her with her issues, Lily just cut her out. So my thought process was to go to her with my issues, and she still didn’t like it. I know I’m the asshole but I don’t think I want to be friends with someone who just lashes out at me when I’m being honest. My dad says apologize and try to fix it, but all my friends say that I was honest and there’s no nice way to express how I was feeling.",23May2019,1

Yet at the same time, my parents complain about having to drive me around, which wouldn’t be an issue if I had my license. If I want to go somewhere I have to rely on their schedule, and then they complain.

We are supposed to go to therapy soon for my anxiety, but I also wanna bring up these issues cuz I feel my parents still treat me as I was when I was younger.

534,"Quick background summary, he's not a super close friend, I see him fairly often but with people. I hung out at his house a few times with a group, I was excited to go over because he has a dog, but now I'm uncomfortable being there because he likes to slap her when she misbehaves.

Not '''too''' hard, a slap in the face which probably stings for a couple of seconds level of hard. And whenever she misbehaves, which is a lot. Grabbing food, humping things, jumping up, barking, plus other things. The dog is hardly trained, doesn't know any commands (his family has had her 8 years or so).

He also likes to hit her just generally, he'll go to pet her then psych her out by tapping her across the face a few times, or he'll grab her, go to hit her, then when she flinches he'll laugh and pet her.

She's still a lovely affectionate dog, but sometimes she cowers a little when you go to pet her until she realised you're not going to hurt her, it hurts in my chest to see her like that.

I tried to say something about how if he was trying to train her through punishment it clearly wasn't working because it wasn't stopping her acting up, but he laughed it off. I'm pretty sure his parents treat her the same, and the other friends who were there didn't seem to have a problem.

It's clear it's not causing her long term physical damage, but it isn't doing anything to 'fix' her behaviour and I'm worried for her psychologically. At this point she's so used to punishment/reward being totally random events

I love dogs, it feels gross to see this happen, but my other friends aren't bothered (they think i'm letting my dog-loving brain overthink it, they feel more pity for me feeling bad than for the dog getting hit). Am I overthinking? Do I have right to bring this up, or should I not overstep with his family's right to do whatever they want with their dog?",23May2019,2
535,"Ive posted about this earlier but it was just a copypaste from my r/bullying post, heres an updated version. 

YbrikG is an aspiring youtuber of the gaming genre, he before these events he has already stolen art and videos from other people.

Knaiifu is a 15 y/o who was commissioned by YG to make an icon for his social media. YG also sent him DM's asking for photos of Knaiifu's food, school table, and trees in his area. YG said himself that he just wants to see something from were he is. This made Knaiifu very uncomfortable, and he asked him to keep the conversation about the commissions

Knaiifu, like any other hardworking artist who is in a tight spot, expected to get paid but YG took the drawing without paying him. YG himself said that he intended to scam him.

After this Knaiifu posted some tweets showing what YG has done and asked for his followers to report him. some of Knaiifu's supporters reported YG and left comments calling him out showing disgust, some are mocked him for stealing videos and art, some flooded him photos of tables and trees. YG's yt and twitter were shut down.

YG got his twitter back and he proceeds to reply to logical and mean comments trying hard to act savage and petty. He then reposts one of Knaiifu's art (captioned ""LOOK AT THE ART I STOLE! @knaiifu""), Knaiifu posts a screencap of this tweet again asking for peope to report him. These two events are the mildest things this lowlife has done.

YG tweets about planning to doxx Knaiifu and leak his private information. In which Knaiifu again asks for his followers to report him.

Today May 23, 2019, YG posts a quora link asking how much it costs to hire a hitman while tagging Knaiifu. 4 hours later he posts private* photos that belong to him/other people (*whether or not these photos are private or photos dug up from his old posts/old accounts, there was still an attempt at stalking and exposing) Knaiifu chose to make his account private. 

(PLEASE dont go and look at/actively search for his information if youre going to YG's account) 

Please do know that Knaiifu has 12.1k followers and a lot of people are reporting YG, but his account is still active. This is causing Knaiifu stress and panic, and hes stated that he cant explain what was happening to his parents.

539,"Story time:

Once upon a time when I was in high school (only a few years ago, I’m in my mid 20s now) I was best friends with a girl who was about 2 years younger than me. We got along great, never had any issues. But when I went off to college 2 years later she decided to stop being friends with me. 

While this happened suddenly, I connected the dots. When I got to college I was immediately signed with a modeling agency, and of course, like most people I posted this announcement on social media as I was very excited and wanted my friends and family to know the big news! Modeling was something this girl and I (let’s call her Sara to keep things anonymous) had always bonded over. So naturally I thought she would’ve been the first person to reach out and congratulate me.

This wasn’t the case. In fact, all of her close friends and family congratulated me so I know she knew about it and decided not to say anything. When I confronted her on the matter she lied and said she never saw it but “oh, congratulations.” A few weeks after that I reposted a picture someone else had on Instagram (something dumb, like a picture of leaves) and she put me on blast saying I stole it from someone else. If I remember her comment correctly it said, “lol, this looks a lot like so and so’s post?” I deleted her comment and the picture as I didn’t wanna deal with her. After that we were no longer on speaking terms.

I decided I didn’t really need someone like that in my life, as her reasons for being mad at me were significantly petty. But, 2 years later came around and I was still pretty curious why she decided to end our friendship. So, I reached out to her thinking you know, some time has passed and maybe she’s grown up a bit. She agreed to grab dinner with me (seemed pretty excited) and said she couldn’t remember why she got mad at me but that I did something that “peeved” her. So, that was weird but I agreed to meet up with her anyways.

The dinner went fine, felt like old friends just catching up. When we left that night I said we should definitely get together more! And she seemed all for it. Did I ever hear from her again? Of course not. 

She ended up transferring to my college so I began seeing her around a bit. I remember one day she came into my work on campus and I had just missed her (this was about a year ago) so I shot her a text (something like) “shoot! Too bad I just missed ya!” and she responded etc etc. Everything seemed fine. No weird interactions. In fact, when I was at a football game last year she was the one who came up to me and said hi and asked me how I was.

Since then, I’ve graduated college, moved on with my life and haven’t seen nor talked to her. (update: Sara and I are both signed to the same modeling agencies now and work with some of the same people). But other than that I have no relation to her at all. 

I went on Instagram yesterday and saw her tagged in one of my friends pictures so I clicked on her profile as naturally I thought to myself “how is Sara doing?” and it turns out she blocked me. I have absolutely no idea why she would’ve done this. Like I said, I have not spoken to her or seen her in over a year, and we have not been good friends in YEARS. Can anyone make sense of this for me? I’ll get over it, I just thought this was an extremely odd thing for someone to do considering I haven’t even talked to her in years.

So yesterday I got into a huge mess flight wise (first flight was delayed, missed my original connection, airline somehow fucked up setting me up properly with another connection so I missed that one too). After running back and forth for 1.5 hours trying to get it to work, an airline employee took me under his wing and tried to get it sorted. After another 1.5 hours he managed to get me a hotel, meal vouchers and (most importantly) a good new connection. (I was the only person left at the airport at that time as it was pretty late at night). 
Normally I would try to contact his supervisor to let them know that this particular person helped a lot and was very forthcoming blabla because I think it’s important to support people that way. However: 

We chit-chatted back and forth a little bit and he mentions that he is a Trump supporter. It is usually an immediate dealbreaker for me. I study politics, politics for me are not only theoretical but solid parts of a person’s life and values. (Trump = racist, sexist, homophobic = bad!) I don’t think I’d be comfortable supporting someone who may not have helped me as much if I were non-white and non-straight passing. 

Now I am unsure what to do, I believe that employees should get their work recognized, but I don’t wanna support someone who might discriminate in a position of power. What do you guys think?

543,"I’ve been in an unshakable funk since October. 

Very brief backstory: been on antidepressants since 3rd grade (31F). Have social anxiety, diagnosed with mild agoraphobia (I can go places but if it’s something that isn’t daily routine I have mild anxiety attacks, which my dr won’t give me anything for) and have a whole lot of trust issues. I live in one of the most expensive places in California, and still live with my parents because I have no other options. I’ll be done paying my student loan next year and can finally start saving money and look into moving. 

In October, I left my job of 11 years (retail department manager) because I was so stressed and occasionally cried myself to sleep from it. I took a job with less pay, but better hours and schedule.. or so I thought. Since then, I’ve quickly become as miserable as I was at my old job and often regret making the change. I’ve been working on my resume in bits and pieces so I can try, again, to find something a little better. 

One of my biggest issues is that I have so much trouble coping with change, and now I’m afraid that if I get another job, it’ll turn out exactly the same. So I’m procrastinating on actually finishing my resume and getting it out there. 

I’ve grown distant from/lost friends because I can’t seem to care about much of anything anymore. My relationship probably won’t last much longer (from advice I’ve gotten from a different post) and I feel so incredibly alone. Friends I’m still on good terms with have reached out, but I almost always decline to hang out because it’s hard being around people that are so happy in life and I’m so miserable. I haven’t told them that, of course. I’m glad they’re happy. 

I know I need professional help, but my insurance is garbage and I’m afraid that it either won’t be affordable or I’ll start making progress only to have to stop going due to losing insurance from switching jobs. I keep telling myself I’ll look further into it on my day off, but I never do. I refused to go to a therapist when I was young and have refused ever since. I’ve never seen why a total stranger would be able to help me.

I don’t know where I’m going to live in a week. My lease with my boyfriend ends in 7 days and we don’t have anywhere to go. We had a condo lined up and were going to pay the deposit tomorrow but got a text from the real estate agent that they went with someone else.. I have no ID so we can’t even apply anywhere else until I get that. I was planning on trying to go to the dps this Saturday to sort it out but they will only give me a paper copy. I ordered one back in December 2018 and never got it in the mail. 

Even if they send it on Saturday I won’t get it for a whole week and then it will be too late because my lease will have already ended. 

Besides this, my boyfriend and I don’t even know if we will be together still in a week. He seems undecided on ending things but honestly I think we can work it out. We don’t know. We both still love each other so much and a break down thinking about losing my rock. We cry when we talk about it. 

My job and our schedules have been putting stress on us for over a year. My schedule is 7am-5 pm and honestly it’s just not me. I fucking hate getting up at 6 in the morning. 5 nights a week I’m stressing about waking up the next morning. Can’t do anything after work because I have work the next day. Constantly getting less than 3 hours of sleep because I naturally am a night owl. And it causes my boyfriend and I to constantly be on different pages when it comes to energy levels and wanting to go do stuff. Because he is a server part time and has been over the same time that I’ve been at my office job. I work 10 hour days 5 days a week and he works 5 hour days 4-5 days a week and has the ability to change his own schedule to fit his needs. I long for that type of freedom. It honestly feels like the world is going on around me but I’m stuck at work for a 10 hour block every day. Because he works shorter shifts and actually gets to make friends at work (I can’t make friends with people at my job because I am so different from them.) I smoke weed and my job drug tests so I have to hide that from everyone. But besides that they are all conservative boring people and I’m not. I even feel like they are making me a boring person. This job is making me a boring person. And on top of that this demanding schedule makes me so unwilling to do chores and stuff to better myself after I get off because I only get a 4 hour window of “free” time before its bed time again. This has caused me to gain weight. 

We’ve both thought about bartending. I think the schedule is good if you work in a club or bar. No morning shifts. The ONLY thing I’m really hesitant about is the money. I currently make about $550 per week plus I get overtime a lot so I’m looking at around $600 on those weeks which is ideal. If I can make that  amount weekly doing bartending, I think I would really enjoy it. Do bars and nightclubs discriminate based on weight though? I know I’m not ugly but I’m not skinny. I have good boobs and a nice ass I think I could use to my advantage plus when my schedule lightens up I REALLY want to focus on losing weight so I can have my idea body and reach the level of confidence I want. But if they will just discriminate based on weight from the get go then idk what the point is in trying right now because it will take me at least 8 months to lose the weight. I just don’t think my mental health can hold up at this current job for 8 more months. I need change, I need more me time, I need my youth back. I feel like on the edge of something but don’t know what.

558,"To start off, I had a college fund started by my grandparents at my birth that has accumulated a substantial amount since. In order to continue my education, I need access to this account. Originally the account was co-owned by both my mother and father. However, after they filed a divorce about 4 years ago, my dad took my mom's name off the account somehow without her consent claiming something along the lines of her having intent to withdraw all the money to use for herself. Before she was taken off she recalls the last balance being around 17k. Not only would this be completely off brand for my mom, it reflects my paranoias about what my dad may have done with ownership. He's struggled with a gambling problem longer than I can remember and lives well above his means, not to mention the recent tax fraud and subsequent fines. I needed to make a payment for my next community college semester, and called the firm to ask if I had the power to withdraw only to learn that I can't have any access to the account whatsoever and in order to transfer ownership I need the owner (my dad's) consent. Despite me mentioning that he has been uncooperative they understandably can't hand out my account information. He has refused to work with me every time I've reached out over the past few months, and it seems my only course of action is to use force (identity theft). I have his SSN which is all I would need to get the proper account details and forge his consent over a phone call. As far as I can tell there would be no verification for my identity outside of a social security number.

What kind of legal trouble could I get into if I'm caught using my his name and SSN to transfer ownership?

Would he have the opportunity to take me to court over this if he finds out?

If I find out that he has taken money from the account, but I used illegal means to acquire that information, could I do anything about it?",23May2019,1

561,"(repost because i didn’t get much feedback on my last post, I think because I posted it very late at night) 

I met who I considered my best friend when I was six years old. We continued to stay best friends throughout teenage years and into adulthood until I started to not be able to stand them. It started when we were about 16 probably, I started to get really annoyed and hurt by things they would say/do. 

A few things for example: 1. I would talk about my favorite musical artist who means very much to me, I have an emotional connection to this artist and consider them to be a huge part of my life and a great influence on me. Whenever I would bring up this artist, my friend would only say bad things about them. They even listened to the artist and said they liked them, but they never liked to encourage things I liked. They would always put my interests down. One time I brought up a fact about the artist and they said they didn’t remember me saying that when I told them I thought they would know because I talk about them so much. They said “sometimes you just talk so much that I tune you out.” That broke my heart. They said that four years ago and I still think about it constantly because I didn’t think that someone I considered so close to me would say something so mean to me. 2. They would constantly put me down as well as my interests, “jokingly” hit/punch me, and just be rude. The last time I hung out with them and a group of people, someone else in the group actually called them out for being so rude to me. My friend said “it’s okay for me to be rude to (my name) because we’ve known each other for so long.” 3. They would constantly ditch me in the middle of our plans to hang out with other people, or go on phone calls and ignore me while I was with them. We would make plans in advance, and then they’d change their mind halfway through and leave me because someone else invited me to something. They’d get a call from their partner when we’d hang out and instead of having a short conversation or saying they can’t talk because they’re busy, they’d drop everything they’re doing with me to have a long conversation with their partner and ignore me when I tried to talk to them too. I wouldn’t be bothered if this happened once or twice, but it was a reoccurring thing that drove me crazy and kind of killed my self worth. 

I think it’s all just been a build up of me beginning to hate them. I hated the way they treated me. They’d say I’m an important part of their life but their actions never followed that statement. I would ALWAYS treat them with kindness, I’m very uncomfortable with being rude even if it’s jokingly. I try to be as positive as possible and always support their interests and try to encourage them and ask about things they liked.I just feel like I never got the respect back that I gave them. Around a few months ago, I ghosted them. I know that’s bad on my part but I’m very bad with confrontation. I just thought that they would get the message that I don’t want anything to do with them anymore. They sent me a text saying they noticed I deleted them off social media and wanted to know what they did wrong and if I was okay. I told them everything I was feeling. I told them when we would hang out, I was always looking forward to the end of it, I was starting to never be happy when I would be around them, they made me feel like garbage about myself and started giving me a lot of self worth issues. I told them I couldn’t have someone in my life who made me feel like shit about myself. I told them it would be best for me if we weren’t friends. That was the end of that and I haven’t talked to them since. I just feel like I’ve made a mistake. They’ve been in my life the majority of it, they were like family. But to help myself, I felt like I had to do this. The awful behavior on their end has been going on for years. I was at a breaking point and couldn’t take it anymore. I just want to know anyone’s opinion if you think I did the right thing. 

TLDR: I had a friend my entire life that showed toxic behavior and it started to take a toll on my mental health, I told them I don’t want to be friends anymore and haven’t spoken to them since. I’m having doubts that I did the wrong thing by dropping them from my life.",23May2019,2
562,"Three years ago I went LC with my family and dropped all of my friends due to the huge amount of stress it was to be around them. My family was making fun of me at every turn because it was great for them to see me react and my friends were going down a dark path that I didn't want to follow. I turned to weed and I've only been hanging out with my boyfriend every day after work. I don't talk a lot in general but when I do I noticed I stutter or trip on my words and being quiet doesn't help at all. I don't even notice I'm being quiet until I hear multiple ""What?"" Or ""Pardon?"" after I start talking and I just feel frustrated, not at the person I'm talking to but myself because I feel stupid for not being to talk properly in my late 20s.

My 76-year-old father has always taken care of everything and everyone, but recently something has happened and he is no longer himself at all. The doctors say there is nothing physically wrong, but he is no longer himself. They now say we need to get him psychiatric help. It started about two months ago, He had a bladder infection and took himself to the doctor and picked up his own prescription for Levaquin. It was 5 pills to be taken for 5 days. He took 3 in four days and then became paranoid and delusional. We stopped the medication because we thought he may have had a reaction to it and waited for it to leave his system and for him to go back to normal. After about a week he was not better at all so we took him to the emergency room and they ran some tests. They said he no longer had an infection and the no stroke or anything like that. The did a psych consult because he was having trouble remembering stuff and wasn't acting like himself. They determined that he should see either a neurologist or a psychiatrist, so since he has a neurologist already because he suffers from central tremors, we went that route. One we later we went to the neurologist, and he immediately admitted him to the hospital for testing because he could tell that he was not himself at all. He had a bunch more test including a spinal tap, all of which were negative. They concluded that it was a metabolic problem and adjusted his medication. He was there for a little over a week. He then transferred to a physical rehab place to help him be strong enough to come home. By the time he left after 10-11 days, he seemed A LOT better. He went to the doctor 11 days later and at the time he seemed ok mentally. he was complaining that his stomach hurt so the doctor prescribed an acid reflux medication. About 8-10 days later he began exhibiting bizarre behavior. He started cussing up a storm and saying lewd things. Over the weekend it became worse, he tried to grab people’s private parts, he said incredibly rude and horrible things to people and he would constantly poke and bap my mother. We took him into the doctor Monday morning, which was a hell of a struggle because he did not want to go. The doctor had no idea what the heck is wrong with him and insists that it is a psychiatric issue and told us to take him to the emergency room and get a psych evaluation and have him admitted to a psychiatric facility. An ambulance comes and takes him to the ER, and we go through all the testing again but this time he is completely maniac and requires a ton of medication to get him to stop trying to grab people and pull out his iv or catheter. Finally, after the medication kicked in the psych people came and recommended in patient care. The closest place was pretty far, and he didn’t want to go that far. It was legally his decision, so we brought him home. It has been 3 days now and he is not as manic as before, but yesterday he told me to give him some porn to watch, which is not normal. I feel like I'm drowning, and I don't know what to do. I have been paying the bills the best I can, but I can't access some things because I don't know the password to his email and he can't remember it, and the password recovery through AOL is complete garbage. I have no idea how to make sure my parent's Medicare stays up to date, or how to get the forms to file their taxes. Plus, I don't know what to do about finding out what the heck is wrong with him.

578,"Hiya!

I'm an eighth grader and I've had a group of friends for a while now. Here's some of the people in it:
Adelard: best friend since Second Grade. Great guy and care about him loads.
Tim: Better friends with Adelard but we still get on well.
Alec: Recently got closer with him.
Trix: Used to go out with Adelard but we're cool. One of my besties. 

Anyway. Essentially I have two quandaries.

Firstly and more pressingly, recently Tim has started to do weed. He began after his brother and has been doing it. Now, I'm not too keen on this but at least Tim's nice enough to not pressure people into doing it. However Adelard and Alec both asked if they could do it as the three of them are having a sleepover at Tim's. Tim has agreed. Apparently this is a one time thing but I'm still worried it will become a regular occurance and result in me doing it. They're not the types to pressure me or anything but I'm still scared.

Secondly, after Adelard had been going out with Trix for a proportion of Seventh grade, they broke up at the end. They had a fallout at the end of seventh grade but became  friends and were fine but ""slighly flirty"". I had no problem with this and was cool with it. However they have recently had another fallout and I fear history is repeating. This was after Tim had been in a relationship of sorts with Trix and broke it off, calling Trix manipulative. He encouraged Adelard to cut off contact and to a degree they have. I never participated in a romantic relationship with Trix and am very good friends still with her.

The problems come together when I'm worried that Trix and Adelard will continue to fight which makes me feel sad as I would like everyone to be friends. I also feel more comfortable and happier with the group when there's boys and girls. Maybe they will stop fighting and we can get back together as a group. Then what with the weed I'm worried that I'm going to feel a bit uncomfortable and unable to express it. Tim and I have had a conversation in Gym about it and I don't think he's gonna pressure me but doesn't understand why I wouldn't.

Furthermore, I worry about the puppies well being if I do get a job as my MIL is going to be working over time just to be able to afford the dog.

I’m a photographer and an editor, and while there’s some good things about this pic, there’s also some really and truly horrible photoshop that was done. Like awful in the worst way. 

There’s some light on the jawbone on one side of the face. Jawbone and into the neck. Problem is that that side is in shadow and there’s zero way there should be light shots there.

592,"I'm about to be a college sophomore and recently started making some female acquaintances. While none of us actually talk that much, we do have occasional discussions. However, I started to reflect that I have always had male friends in my life. I had three female best friends in my lifetime (We all drifted apart), and many were just acquaintances or people I knew. Even though sometimes it was the case that the girls I used to hang out with were pretty toxic, I just noticed that any girl I come into contact with doesn't like me or never put any effort like I did. Here's some examples:

* Some girls found me annoying. When asked what they mean I never really got any specific answers, except ""You just are."" or ""I don't have to tell you, you should just know what you're doing wrong."" (We were all high school seniors by the way)
* Some girls would look at me funny when I make jokes or just talk over me during conversations. When I would leave, only some male friends would say bye and the girls wouldn't really bat an eye and continue conversing as if I wasn't even there. If I even said hi to a girl I knew, they would glance to the side and awkwardly wave at me or walk by even after making eye contact.
* Some girls have told my guy friends that they didn't like me because of my views on things. I never really got what they meant by that. 
* I noticed that girls would tell me that they were jealous of me. Some have said it was because I had a great body, I was a confident and spoke my mind. But then later on, they would despise me. 

I don't know, it's weird to be honest. I never was really problematic, the only time I had an issue with girl was because she wanted my ex and that was it. Maybe it's how I present myself? The type of girls I choose to associate with?

I can be chatty and I never cared much about what I wear, clothes are clothes and I would rather be comfortable. I'm also pretty energetic and have a happy go lucky attitude. I'm politically neutral, can cook food. On social media, I would posts pictures of myself, sometimes memes, and family events. I spoke my mind and wasn't afraid of any opinions and I like learning. But I never made anyone feel wrong for their views and opinions, I know some girls expressed anger towards me because I had said during a class discussion that I would forgive my rapist if he raped me (It was for a book we were talking about)

When I asked my current boyfriend, my ex (we're on good terms), and other guy friends I have why they liked me, pretty much every answer was that I looked at the bright side of things and never conformed my thinking to please someone else, that I stay true to myself. They said that while I did have my flaws, there wasn't any issues or anything unlikeable about me. So I just don't get why girls never liked me or  it's rare to get past the stage of acquaintances? Someone help me out.",23May2019,0
593,"Throwaway because my significant other uses reddit also sorry for anything grammar wise I'm on mobile.

My boyfriend loves me very much and I know he does and I know there is nothing he can do about it because this stranger is his boss.

Back story: his boss doesn't like me and my boyfriend and his colleagues describe her as their ""work mom"" because she likes to put on a front that she cares about them which I don't believe. She has showed time and time again that she only cares about herself and her job but I won't get into those details. He says she acts this way because she sees him as a successful son she never had. 

About 6 months ago my boyfriend, his boss, their colleagues and his bosses daughter (who works for a recruiting company and recruits people specifically for her mother's team) all went out to dinner. They were all drinking and a discussion about people's partner's came. I don't remember the discussion but during the conversation the daughter mentioned she was engaged to a surgeon and my boyfriend said he was dating a nurse his boss said ""well surgeons are better than nurses anyway."" The daughter apologized for her mother's actions but the apple doesn't always fall far from the tree, she's just as bad but we're not talking about her.

A couple of months pass and long story short I quit my job to change my career path and help him get to and from work. My boyfriend asks if he can work from home an extra day a week to save gas and not put so much strain on me driving back and forth and tells her I'll be driving for him. She says ""Well make sure she doesn't take advantage of you I know a lot of girls take advantage of men who make as much as you"". He tells me and we blow it off as her just saying nasty shit, whatever.

But then she started to do petty stuff knowing that I'm picking him up for work. I'll text him that I'm at his office and whenever she can she'll try to catch him before he leaves just to help her with half minded tasks that if she was in her position she should know how to do by herself like set up her email or Skype. Even though I know she knows how to because my boyfriend has helped her do it multiple times and now she's worried about it at 5pm? I KNOW it's a petty attack towards me and my boyfriend knows too but he can't do anything because she knows he has to help her because she is his boss. 

One of the times she was holding him in her office my boyfriend said he had to leave and she said ""Oh your chauffeur is here"".

Like I said there's nothing he can do because she's his boss. But I always have the constant thought of what petty thing she'll do next or what slander she'll do. What do I do? Because her words and actions have really been starting to take a toll on my mood and mental health. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that she slanders me to my boyfriend and his colleagues even if they don't believe it (I've met most of them). What do I do? How do I cope with this healthily?",23May2019,1
594," i started dating this girl shes 20 im 23. on our first date she told me that she has bi polar disorder and gets high highs and low lows and that she wasn't taking medication for it I told her thats fine that doesn't bother me at all and we could work through it.  I knew what bi polar disorder was but i never took the time to actually research it because i thought it was just mood swings here and there and i feel so fucking bad because i tried to be there for her as best as i could before it was too late.  Fast forward to this past Saturday her best friend is leaving for mexico for 2 weeks and then she sends me a text saying ""im starting to get low, i promise im not losing interest in you im just depressed and have a lot of stuff going on right now"" i then ask ""what can i do""? she says ""nothing"" so that night after work i go to her house with a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates and we have a good talk about things and i thought we were okay we would get through this. I was wrong. The next day she sends me texts saying shes not happy that ""life is shitty"" and that she ""wants to be alone ""and she doesn't know what to do. I  then call her and ask ""are you really doing this?"" ""are you really breaking up with me?"" and she says ""yeah i guess so""  ""i don't want a relationship right now, I'm not happy with myself"" I hung up the phone because i was so hurt and i haven't said anything to her since monday

595,"(This is a throwaway cause my friends and family know my main reddit)

So I’ve been dating this wonderful guy for 9 years and he proposed to me a couple months ago. We don’t want a big wedding. Just a small one with friends and family. I’m an American and my fiancé is Japanese. He has an unusual job but it’s his passion and it supports us (I also have a job but it doesn’t make as much as his does). Ever since my mother found out I was dating a Japanese man, she was upset but assured herself that it wouldn’t last due to cultural differences. But on our 4 year anniversary, she pulled me aside and tried to convince me to break up with him cause he’ll eventually cheat on me with an Asian woman. It broke my heart. But I talked to him and he assured me that he’d never cheat. And on the night he proposed, my mother called me well sobbing. She said that I need to marry an American man that can protect me and care for me. I just hung up and went to bed. And now that we have put together our guest list and sent them invitations, my mother started posting on social media about how I was brat for not inviting her to the wedding and how she wasn’t going to come even if I sent her one. I don’t know what to do. My friends all tell me the same thing which is “every mother is like this, just ignore it. She’s your mom after all.” I don’t know if I should keep her in my life, stop talking to her, or what. I just don’t know what to do.",23May2019,1

597,"We have been together since December of my senior year in high school. I'm in college and he is not. We still live in our hometown. He is my best friend, we are together every day when theres free time. We've been through so much together. 2019 has been the most difficult year of my life, I was in and out of the hospital a lot, lost a job, lost touch with a lot of my friends who I thought would be in my life forever. But he has always been there, supporting me and helping me get back on my feet. I don't know where I would be without him.

We have always had a rule, that we each need to have our own individual things outside of the relationship. We have other friends we see on occasion, we have our own respective hobbies and jobs. Its not an unhealthy relationship where hes the only thing I've got, you know? But sometimes it really feels like hes the only one truly in my corner. When school would be kicking my ass or there would be family drama he was literally always there for me to help me feel better.

A few weeks ago he got accepted into college. I'm so happy for him because hes been wanting to start school and get out of the town hes lived in his entire life. Its also a school that offers the field of study he wants to peruse. Its a great scenario for him and I want to support him in this.

When I got that text that he had officially enrolled in the fall, I sent him a congratulations message but I literally burst into tears. This means that he'll be moving 2 hours away from me. In the past there were times where we almost thought we would have to do long distance, and he was not on board. He said he didn't think the relationship would last if we weren't seeing each other almost every day, and I almost agree with him because I don't think I could do it either. We haven't really discussed it this time though.

I feel like now theres an expiration date on our relationship. We have a big vacation planned in 20 days and now I don't even want to go because I feel like I will just be a depressed mess the whole time. Just knowing that in three months he'll be gone is making my heart feel like theres a big black cloud around it. Hes my best friend, my fucking rock. I've had to say goodbye to so many people, but none of them meant what he means to me and I don't know how to handle this.

I know we're both young but I thought we were special. I don't know how to talk to him about this. I'm wondering if I should break up with him soon just to rip the bandaid off, because I know neither of us would be able to handle long distance. We've never had a serious fight, not since high school anyway. We've always been good when communicating but I seriously have no idea how to bring this up to him, or even what I want to say.

599,"So, there's this guy I have worked with directly and indirectly for about six years now. He's been a superior to me in the past (but not since this all started). Here's where it gets confusing...

I was having some issues in my personal life and expressed I just wasn't feeling myself. He opened his door to talk to me. Admittedly I should have cowered away from his attempt to be a friend, but I didn't. I opened up to him about my life. And...he did the same about his own.

Now, we've been talking pretty much non stop for the past two weeks. I'm starting to feel like we may be crossing into the realm of ""more than friends"", but it's hard to understand. I can tell he is unhappy with his relationship, but he keeps playing it very cautious in that arena. I tried to back off by letting convos die, but he would be right back in my text messages with something to say or a new conversation to spark!

I'm not asking for advice on how to be a homewrecker. I enjoy his friendship, but I don't want to hurt anyone by being THIS close. How can I make sure that if his wife found our messages that she wouldn't be suspicious, or think him or myself have ulterior motive? Am I being naive...is it possible that he just needs a friend?

To sum up, the details shared include personal traits about his partner that he dislikes...which to me, seems like he's throwing his scent and vulnerability out for me to pick up on...

606,"To begin, I recently turned 18 and graduated high school this year. I am from Missouri, and have an impressive abundance of family members in one county, and overall state. For the most part, my relatives are very family-oriented, and prize over being so close together, especially the older ones. ""Blood is thicker than water"" sums it up. Unfortunately, I found myself wanting to break the tradition of sticking around.  


I met my boyfriend online when I was 14, and fell in love with him. The internet was my getaway from a lot of abuse I received from my mother's ex boyfriend (a different story to tell, but i love my mom endlessly), and we ended up being together. A long-distance relationship from Missouri to Arizona is not easy, to say the least, but I love him and our relationship. It has been truly nothing but an amazing healing experience for me. He makes me comfortable in my own skin, and I have found that extremely difficult throughout my teenage years. We have never broken up before, or gotten in huge fights that could change our relationship's stance, which gives me hope that I have truly found love with someone that puts in the same amount of work as I do.  


We have met in person about 6-7 times throughout the 3 1/2 years we've been together, being roughly a week or more each time, back and forth from each other's homes. I am lucky enough that I had the privilege to even go to Arizona in 2018 for his graduation, because most of those times, it was him coming to my place, because his mother put her trust in us. My family, however, mostly despises the idea of my online dating and does not want to comply with my interest in Arizona, and being in the city with him and his family. I have learned a lot of things from my boyfriend's siblings (his sister being my best friend) and his mom, one of those being that family doesn't always have to be who you're related to... and it hit me hard. They treat me like one of their own, especially when I felt disregarded by my family. I am forever grateful and have fell in love with them as well.   


All in all, I have been wanting to move to Arizona for a solid 2 years now. I've been there a few times, and I truly desire to make some new memories somewhere I am happy. I prefer the dry-heat, being up in the city, and enjoy the cultural diversity I experienced while visiting. I also love the scenery. I understand that I cannot run away from my past, but there is a lot of trauma that I would love to leave behind, so I can start writing a new chapter of adventure. The only thing that's holding me back is my hermit family. My grandfather, especially, is very upset over the situation. He claims that I won't make it and I'll regret it, and that I will hate being roommates with my boyfriend. I was also told that the only support I will receive from him if I go, is the airplane ride home when I have to come back (I have a car, so that was irrelevant of him to say, but whatever). They would much prefer my boyfriend moving to the Midwest, which he said he wouldn't mind, but I don't want to stay.   


The fear-mongering has gone to my head, of course, and now I am having second thoughts about taking the next step to moving out. My family is very disappointed, and I can't help but feel like a burden for wanting to spread my wings and explore Arizona. I feel degraded for wanting to do my own thing for once, instead of someone else's. I know it will be a big change and reality will slap me in the face, but doesn't that happen to everyone at some point?   


With the intentions of moving out, we are currently saving money and will have enough to get an apartment with necessities if I make up my mind. I would line out a job before I move there so I can start working right away. I plan to go to college after I get residency so it will be cheaper. I tried to explain this to my family, too, but they claim I am incapable. I personally feel as if I am a responsible young adult and could handle it, but maybe they're right. Am I just being a kid making stupid decisions?   


I just need someone else's outside opinion to tell me if I should discourage the idea, or quit getting guilt tripped and do it. Thank you in advance, and if you need more specific details that I might have left out, I'd be happy to clarify.

But for a month now I have some personal problems,and I think a have become really dependent on this person: I feel the need to talk to them Everytime. They are the only person to whom I can talk to when i'm not feeling well. Not a long time ago I really freaked out and I didn't know what to do,so I called them. They didn't know what to do or say to me,so it was basically very ankward while I was juste crying at the phone. I think that they just don't care about me,and it hurts so much. I saw that I was the only one starting a conversation,and one time we didn't talk for like 5 days and they said to me that ''it was good because they didn't have to worry about me''. It really makes me feel like shit,and it's ridiculous but I have no one to talk to beside them.
 So,should I stay friend with them ?

613,"Hey guys, so how the titles show.. it was my 27th birthday yesterday. I spent it alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am teaching English in Denizli, Turkey at the moment and have not been here long, maybe 6 weeks, so I am not surprised that I did not do anything but my family never even sent me a card, only an awkward phone call from my Dad and my younger sister (21). My Mum passed away 4 years ago but she was my best friend and always made a fuss about my birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what to do with my family.. they don't make too much of an effort to keep in touch with me, they only call maybe once every 2-3 weeks or so. They do ask me if you want stuff for my birthday and I say hey I don't need anything, there is nothing in particular that I want, but they don't get creative or imaginative and send me a pair of socks at least or photos of themselves etc. They don't just send me something nice as a nice thought, not even a card even though I send them my Turkish address for another reason a few weeks ago. Maybe they lost that on the WhatsApp chat, but they never asked for it since. Yesterday not long after I woke up, I thought ""oh its the 22nd, I am 27 today"".. not long after my Dad sent me a text message saying ""Happy birthday Luke."" - and that was it. No warm energy, no love, he contacts me like it's a chore. Later he emailed me saying ""what's your address Luke, me and Lia want to send you a guitar tuner?"" and I told him that I already have one and that it's my birthday today and that it would not arrive until sometime in June and that it defeats the purpose of sending a meaningful give. It seems to me that he would be just sending it out of feelings of guilt rather than just sending it to show appreciation for me and to celebrate my birthday. I asked him why he did not even send me a card to say happy birthday but he just said ""I know Luke, I am sorry that's not right. I have been really busy sorting out work and moving but that's no excuse"". - Of course, that's no excuse, I think that he just doesn't care, I would never treat my first child and Son like that. I am a good man and a very kind and loving person and I don't deserve to be treated like this - So what do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

My parents broke up when I was 17 in a bad way, involved family court etc. My sister went with my Dad and I cut contact with him for about 4/5 years because of how he handled things and consequently, I missed a lot of growing up time with my little sister. We're not very close as you can imagine but I have tried to build a stronger relationship but they have always seemed half-bothered in reciprocation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year when I turned 26, the same thing. I was working in France at the time and on my birthday he asked me what my address was, and I just said look it won't get here for ages so what's the point. I didn't make a deal of it then but you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

The year before when I turned 25 and when I was still living in the same country as them, they drove to my house to pick me up because we were going to go out for dinner for my birthday. I just assumed that they had booked something but they handed me an unwrapped bottle of shampoo and a card for my birthday and I hopped in the car. My family is not poor at all so I do not understand why they treat me like this. My heart sank but I pretended it didn't bother me. I am not materialistic, I do not care how much things cost but it hurt me that that's all they think of me and then we start driving to where I thought they had booked us a table but he just turns to me and says ""so where do you wanna eat Luke?"" - nothing booked. We drove to some pizza place and it was shut, so I just said ahhh I'm not in the mood, just drive me home. I could tell that they felt a bit guilty, but they drove me home, then went home themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after this, my Dad was turning 50 which is a milestone and I'm sure most of you agree. I was going to plan a nice restaurant, a nice meaningful present etc. My sister and her friend (who has been living with my dad and sister for about 3 years or so, and they have become very close) were at the counter of their shop. I asked my sister what restaurant she would like to plan for dads birthday and I showed her a few suggestions on my phone and her friend interjected and said: ""actually, I want us to go to another one that I found"". And I said, ""Well actually, it's our father so we'll make that decision I think"". I was polite but firm, but apparently, she got all upset and offended about it, made the whole thing about herself and told my dad the whole thing about we were deciding the restaurant for his birthday and that I made her feel like some kind of stranger. My dad ended up coming home and making up some false stories to me, in front of my sister and her friend and said that he had overheard my sister and her friend talking about planning the restaurant and that he would like to go to the one that they chose. I found out that he was lying to me because I called him out about it a few days later and he comes clean. I told him that I was hurt that he lied to me for the sake of someone that I hardly know and that I was his son, the family should come first and he just said: ""yeah I know, I am very sorry Luke"". Total bollocks, what do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

About a month later after I moved back to London to start a new life, I rang him and just had it out with him, I told him how I felt and that if he's not bothered with me that I have o problem cutting ties with them because I will not make effort with people who will not make effort with me and he just said ""yeah you're right, I'm sorry"".

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think as individuals reading this? Do you think my family actually loves me, or do you think that they are probably not really bothered with me? I am a happy person, I like meeting new people, I travel, I like a good laugh and I love Yoga. I don't need negative people or people who do not care about me in my life. I saw a picture of me when I was about 3 and my mum yesterday and I just cried my eyes out. I miss her so much and I know that she would never treat me this way. I told my dad and my sister yesterday that I will never ever send them birthday or Christmas presents ever again. My sister said, ""ah I'm sorry you said you didn't want anything so we didn't know what to get you"". They say the same thing but I still always send them stuff like recipe books or sketching pencils for my sister, thoughtful stuff, you know. But I never get anything back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What would you all do if you were me? Would you cut them off and ignore them? Do you think they love/ care about me or what? I have suffered from sex addiction the past 2 years (for those who are unfamiliar with it or don't think it is an addiction, think again. It's real and it's dark). I finally resorted to selling my smartphone and changing my lifestyle completely this week just to finally kill this beast so this should fix me for good - but I have read that all addictions come from a need to numb pain and I think that this has been a big issue with that, but I want to finally let go.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",23May2019,0

622,"Hey, Reddit. Any advice for this situation would be greatly appreciated.  This situation has been really affecting me for the last couple of weeks and I just don’t know how to approach this.

As a bit of background info, I’m affected by Bipolar II Disorder and I suffered from an eating disorder when I was around 15 years old, so about 6 years ago.  I’ve been doing very well and actively seeking out treatment for my Bipolar disorder and am mostly confident in my own body and am at a healthy weight now.  I am making efforts to keep myself sane and happy, and it feels great!  A couple of years ago I was also sexually assaulted by a very close male friend of mine and have had to avoid sex altogether in order to keep my disorders in check.

I have a close friend who has recently begun living a lifestyle that’s become very triggering for me.  I’m not a sensitive person, but I have learned to recognize when I’m going downhill and what has triggered it.  My friend has been having a lot of casual sex lately, which would be fine, except she tells me in excruciating detail how each experience has gone and how she feels during it in detail.  It’s like listening to a reading of an early 2000s fan fiction.  I asked her to please keep it to herself about a month ago but she has now taken to posting it all over her social media and got upset at me for unfollowing her, so I had to follow her again to prevent drama.  

My friend has also started to lose a lot of weight and stop eating.  She texted me the following the other week:
https://imgur.com/a/RWQ8JDS

I spoke to her about it and encouraged her to seek professional help.  She said she would but I’ve noticed on social media that she’s been losing more and more weight, and she continues to approach me about it to complain about it.  I told her she needed to see a doctor and that I couldn’t provide her with the support or help that she needed.  To see her start losing weight like this and refusing to get help has been making my own self-image begin to go back to where it was when I had my ED.

In addition to both of those things, she has also been sending me memes about Bipolar disorder.  I feel like she’s trying to make me laugh and feel more lighthearted about my disorder, but since she doesn’t suffer from it and because I’ve almost committed suicide during one of my worst phases, it’s not very funny coming from someone who doesn’t actually understand how awful it has been for me before I finally found a successful treatment.  She has other mental disorders she says, but has admitted to not having this disorder.  I don’t ever get upset when she sends the memes because I don’t want to be a sensitive pussy.  I already feel like one.

I don’t want to be the selfish friend, but I feel like if she isn’t going to seek professional help for her own issues, I need to have some space between us.  I have come so far in getting help for my disorders that the idea of being around something so triggering has become really scary to me.

How would you all suggest I approach this?  Should I even approach it at all or am I being too selfish or sensitive? Any input, including constructive criticism would be so very much appreciated.",23May2019,1

625,"I confided in a club committee member (CCM)  in long car ride about issues with my soccer team. one thing is that if we don’t train we don’t, that’s normal! It’s just if we don’t tell the coach or captain before we t play this isn’t usually an issue but I’ve tried to tell my captain why I can’t attend many trainings as I study at university in another city, I have a 9 month old baby, I can’t drive, I work part time, I just moved houses &amp; unpacked single handedly, my family live away and I don’t like the idea of asking the team members to put my babycar seat in their car (nor have they offered this) but also um what do I just sit my baby to just chill there in the dark? My partner plays sport that night not a training session! Ugh... 

When I told the captain this all she ignored my message. I told her in person too. I told her I told like when the girls talk about me (one player always tells me) 
I missed a training because it was my birthday dinner and to be honest I was debilitated in anxiety to message her as she has responded to me about things patronisingly before but I did and they didn’t play me ‘I’m back up’ and she said now it was because the last week before this one  I didn’t tell her I was training... ikr it’s tiring... 

ANYWAY - I finally got to training (yay) but ... the CCM was THERE?! With our club president they ambushed our coach told him before we even began training ‘people have made complaints’ so he just quit then and there... I was so utterly embarrassed &amp; the CCM said it was ‘about the no train/no play policy’ thus everyone immediately knew it was me despite her making up ‘four people came to her’ ...
I was scathingly attacked and really publicly ‘why can’t she just ‘%#£* off to another team!!!!!’  Or ‘she’s a joke’ and ‘not welcome here!” “One player has an issue they can leave!” 

I didn’t say anything at the time &amp; I should have had the courage to admit the CCM misinterpreted and skewed my words but they were just standing there all having their go and I froze and I can’t jeopardise the CCM who drives drives me to uni!? I have no one else and I know she knew what I really said in the car and did this for her own agenda... 

I messaged the captain explaining I never complained about the coach and she said I was ‘indecent’, a ‘liar’ and ‘disrespectful to the team’ (she was drunk) and I understand why they’re so angry I really do- it looks like I’ve just gone and trashed them all and the coach because something didn’t suit me, but I didn’t. I didn’t need CCM to defend me... 
I was genuinely upset to her, I was never listened to or understood/cpt attack messages ... one incident was when people (even one of my bestfrnds) didn’t come to my birthday dinner because she was so afraid she didn’t train not to risk not playing  (this is a very social women’s club btw and she was made to recently publicly apologise for not training when she is in DV relationship and was unable to leave the house she got so stressed she got stomach ulcers)... i addressed how disturbing this was with cpt in person ...

In the end. I messaged the coach a long sincere apology (i mentioned Id like to apologise in person) I was sorry he was made to feel disliked &amp; that I will absolutely leave the club and to please come back as it’s all my fault (he hasn’t replied yet). 
The captain is coming to my house tomorrow night to discuss it all. She thinks I don’t message them because I outright disrespect them, that I somehow think I’m too good to train and be a part of the team...despite me desperately trying to explain its not true, yes communication skills are weak on my end but for good reason it appears... I hated that my perceived anxieties about the team literally came to life and their opinion of me so little &amp; expressed and then splashed in comments on their private social media page  ... soccer is my only social/physical outlet and I don’t know what to do? Is quitting the only way to resolve the issues? Could I do anything more? 
What do I say to my captain when she comes over? That I haven’t already tried to tell her before? 

I have never had so many people dislike me at once, it’s really affecting my mental health i don’t want them to believe that I am ‘indecent’. I could just leave yes but please try understand I’ve put a lot into the club in previous years, my partner is captain of the men’s team and on the committee etc.

628,"Hi everyone! Thank you for your advice :) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background:** 

I \[20F\] am back for the summer in my parent's home. They are lovely people, but my mom has always had certain opinions based on a culture and society she grew up (Japan). I've been trying to open up to her with my opinions, but every time I do that, it always turns into a giant argument.   


**Building up:** 

I made the mistake of telling her firmly that I don't want to have biological children (will adopt) in the future. She started screaming about how she's a failure of a mother, I should stop going to college until I get my priorities straight, etc... After an entire night of arguing, I just semi-agreed to her by arguing that having kids was way in the future, and I would keep my options open. 

However, from that argument, she has gotten the idea that I am a changed person. 

Did my 'bad' friends make me so radical? Which friends? Where did you get these ideas from? I was able to deflect most of these questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflict:**   
She is now focused on *why I am not a 'happy person'*. For context, I was the most ridiculously optimistic person in high school - I was known as the smile girl. It's true I am no longer as happy, *because of ongoing problems with an eating disorder and maybe depression*. *I am not about to tell her that, in part because even if I did, I don't think she would understand the concept*. (Here's a link to [Better understand positions of eating disorders in Asian Cultures](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/a9fno7/for_the_asian_women_out_there_if_you_are_out_there/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) For example, when my sister was \~12, she talked to us about how depressed she was because of some friend group drama. My mom reacted by deciding her friends were too \*evil\*, and all in all - it was too much. My mental health issues also correlate with my grades at university, which my dad knows but my mom doesn't, because of good reason.

My final mistake was telling my mom that *I don't want to tell her anything because I don't trust her not to overreact*.   
Obviously, overreaction happened and now she's not getting off my back. What should I do? Please help me :)",23May2019,1

Hello. I am a young teen who is really not very popular (also the quiet kid in school). I’m ok with that at the moment.

Only thing is I love buying expensive clothes but I’m afraid that if I wear them in front of people I know I will get laughed at.

631,"This question is pretty much what it says on the tin. I’m a psych nurse in the NHS (in England) and I’m currently applying for jobs in a new area and a new trust, which is an interesting opportunity but also a bit scary, because nobody knows me and has any idea of what my strengths and weaknesses are.

I’ve applied for quite a few jobs that sound interesting, including one that would probably be my favourite, but I haven’t heard back from them and might not get an interview at all.

I have one offer at present. It’s the kind of job I would like, it’s more money and potential career progression than other jobs might offer (although this is my first offer so who knows) and they’re willing to be flexible about the shifts I work, which is a big help as I’m a single mum and childcare is tricky.

The main problems are firstly that I feel I interviewed very badly (it was a Skype call after I’d just come off a night shift and was basically asleep) so I feel concerned about the fact that they offered the job to someone who was not presenting as particularly competent. I had absolutely written it off until they called to make the offer on Monday.

The larger issue is that I’m a very new driver, and this would be a 70ish minute commute every day. That’s a lot of pressure on me as someone who is still basically scared of cars. My current job is a commute of similar time, but on a train (and then a bus), so I can sit there and be half asleep.

Has anyone here committed to this kind of distance for a new job? Is it probably worth it for the other perks on offer, or would I be better off waiting to see if I get an offer from my favoured job, or one of the similar jobs which are closer to home, but may not offer so many perks?

This is huge for me because for the last 2+ years I was in an extremely toxic romantic situation. I was manipulated a lot and I lost SO much of myself because I loved someone who just wanted to use me. 

Being single for a few months has given me time to heal and go through therapy (I still go), but I do feel strong enough to be able to have a relationship with someone new. Finally. 

So this new guy that I’ve been seeing is great, but I may have jumped the gun on my own mental health because now that I like someone new, my anxiety won’t leave me alone. 

So for example he is not a big texter at all. I get it, and I understand that logically but somehow still if he doesn’t text me for like a day or two I immediately think “oh he’s done with me. He’s just texting other girls.” and make myself feel like absolute shit.

639,"\[content warning: potential sexual harassment via unsolicited images\]

Okay, this is a rather strange situation I've found myself in.

I looked at my message requests today and there was a group message from late April. The group was made my a girl I don't know \[who I shall call E.\], a guy I do know from when I was in a program to get my teaching license before I left \[who I shall call S.\], and several people I don't know but that all are likely connected to S. through the university based on what I can tell from their profiles. All people in the group except S. are perceived female.

In the message is:

\- ""E. waved hello to the group"" (a thing you can do in a facebook group message)  
\- 4 pictures of S., all of which are somewhat grainy screenshots of a Facebook video call between (I presume) E. and S. Three are of S. masturbating, one is of his face.

\- and that's it.

No one has replied to the chat. I'm not sure any of the others have seen it, since it went to message requests. S. has since deleted his facebook page, but I can't find any indication why aside from this. E. is totally unconnected from everyone else in the chat (lives in a different state, has only a couple public posts, none of which include any English??) and I don't actually think she's a real person.

S. didn't post the pics himself, so I'm inclined to say this isn't quite sexual harassment from him unless E. is real and is trying to give us proof of harassment, in which case: why these random people?? I'm not very connected to S., I have no idea why I'd be in this chat. And she didn't post any context. (Otherwise this is really harassment from E., which I'm still not sure how I'd handle in this case...)

I'm 90% sure I should just leave this alone, but I have some reservations about S.--he's always given me the impression of being someone I didn't want to be alone around--and he's just graduated a teacher-prep program, so he's been working with and will continue to work with high school-aged kids. If I ignore this completely and he abuses his role to assault a girl in the future, I'm not sure I could forgive myself.

Should I do any of the following:  
1. Accept the group message to see if I can uncover more? (I don't think it will show me anything else, but I could try?)  
2. Reach out to people in the teacher-prep program I left and see if anything happened with S., if they know why he deleted his facebook, etc.?

3. Try to contact E., knowing a) she's probably not real and b) the message will probably go to her requests and she may never see it?

4. Try to get S.'s phone number and contact him directly and ask what this is about?

5. Ignore it entirely?  
6. Something else?

The dreams are 95% crazy, stressful dreams that make me wake up with my heart racing and feeling like I've gotten no sleep.

I’ve said to him so many times to call the police or do something but because it’s his brother and because his brother has a kid he refuses to do anything (he cares about his brother and his brothers kid too much). 
What do I do ? His family knows everything but have never done anything about it (acting like it never happened) 
I don’t see why our future has to be put on hold for someone who is so selfish. 
I obviously don’t understand my partners logic in not reporting him, maybe I’m missing something? 
Any advice ?",23May2019,1
652,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",23May2019,1

656,"So this is going to be a lil bit of a long story but to get the full effect i need to tell you everything from the beginning. 

A year ago I met this amazing guy at a music festival and we vibed really well together and I though it was just gonna be a music festival weekend thing but then he lived in the same city as me so I was like okay bet. so we hung out all the time over summer and then I was like okay this is just a summer thing because we were both going to college in the fall so I didn't know what he felt, but at the end of our summer together we decided that we were gonna give this long distance a shot right. His college is around an hour and half away from mine. It was amazing, the first semester flew by and it was great but then second semester came around and we both got busy w shit and we barley saw each other and we were fighting constantly pretty much. Spring break goes and he calls me saying he loves me less... which may I add that my last ex did this same thing but said that shit alll the time and he knew about it and still said it to me. I was heartbroken and crushed but then a week later my dudes like I didn't mean that, I was confused and stressed out. So I forgave him and we were good for a bit and then he starts pushing me away, barley talking to me, IGNORING me all day long and I know he was on purpose bc he would be on social media. But still I didn't not want to lose him. I asked him multiple times if he was good or how he felt and he wouldn't say anything. I asked him multiple times if we should try a break( I hate breaks ) but he was like no he doesn't want to do that, and either did I. So it was the beginning of this month and shit was weird as fuck. His friends asked me if we were still dating and what were we and that scared me. The next day, he said we need to talk a break and he just needs to figure his shit out. A week later he comes home for the summer and we talked and he said that we need to break up. I asked why and he was like I need to be alone for a while. I need to be single and I was like okay why do you feel like that and he just repeats himself. I was like i know shits weird rn but its summer now lets just see how it goes and if half way through shits still weird lets talk then but at least we should try you know. like we made it a whole year in college. He said that we see that differently and he does not want to try. I ask him if hes giving up and he said thats one way to put it and before he left my car, I gave him his shit back. Im so sad and I honestly dont know what to think or feel. I just dont understand him and what happened. We both bought tickets to the same music festival we met at for our one year but alas were going with our own friends and I dont know if ill see him there or not. 

I wanna text him and tell him how im feeling and everything but like idk if its worth it.  If you have any advice please comment.",23May2019,1

661,"Alright, I'm not very good at titles and typing so there will be a tldr at the bottom THROWAWAY CAUSE THEY KNOW MY REDDIT AAA

(Expect lots of ranting, I tend to just type out my emotions) 

Happened mostly on discord 


I've been friends with these people since October and when I first met them they seemed nice.. probably because I was a girl. One of my friends, let's call him MF for mean friend, said that I was only wanted because I am a girl and I don't have any actual talents that would make me useful. They would call me a whore and a bitch and a retard and would make fun of my voice.

At first I was like okay I'm used to this, I've been made fun of memeingly before  so it was no big deal. For awhile things were going well because I acted how they wanted I guess. The problem started when I made a mess up (100% my fault, I was immature) and I would gossip about them like they did to each other. They all started hating me and there was no one really to protect me from MF because they agreed with them. 

MF would join the voice chat with me and talk to me how I needed to change and that I was garbage. I agreed I did need to change until he was doing it everyday repeating it.  One of the other members got my nudes and was planning on posting it (( I had talked shit about him and lost his trust, another stupid mistake on my part)) but MF stepped in and told them to stop. MF found out I was talking to someone he didn't like ((I stupidly talked to this person because they seemed mature enough to help me or at least keep things private.. that's a story for another time )) and lost their shit, calling me an ewhore and a retard and yknow classy things to call people. 

I'm now hated by pretty much everyone there, and they constantly make fun of my weight and body hair, telling me to shave my face and arms. 
MF seems to be nice to me when it's to defend him (making a Reddit post proving he's never harassed me even though he has just so he doesn't get attacked by his teammates in his game) 

I do feel I am part of the problem, I've said stuff I regret, and I'm trying so hard to fix it but it's so hard when everyone's against me.  I've spiraled into a whole new level of anxiety and self esteem problems when I just got out of my depression rut from sophomore year.  

Is there anything I can do with this situation? 

Tldr: whiny bitch (me) talks about how her friends are mean and wants to make them be nicer and also apologize to them. 

And for all you ladies on Reddit, should I shave my face and arms? I've never seen a problem with them until now and I feel like garbage.",23May2019,2
662,"As the title says, my girlfriend is pregnant (were about 99% sure about that, unless a miracle happens and her period comes back tomorrow). We have a good relationship and we have long term plans, that include having a family together at some point. But we're 100% sure that we're not ready to have a child, at least for now. I'm still studying and she just graduated from uni, and we don't even live together yet!

So, we're just waiting to the results of the pregnancy test, but as I said, we're almost 100% sure that she's pregnant. If she's pregnant, we decided not to have it. So we are going to get an abortion, with pills or surgically removed. The issue is that abortion is not legal in my country, but it's not strictly enforced, so it's not that hard to get hold of an obstetrician that does them. The problem is that because it's not precisely legal, the conditions for a surgical abortion are usually not safe (there are safer conditions, but they are much more expensive). This issue is scaring/stressing my girlfriend a lot, and deservedly so. 

So, our best option is getting abortive pills (which neither of us know how to get, but I'll try to find a way to get them). The whole reason of my post is that I really don't know how to support her. I'm dealing with a lot of guilt, because although our sex was 100% consensual we weren't responsible enough to not make stupid mistakes. I feel that I should've been a lot more responsible, and she has to carry that burden. But at the same time, I don't want to overwhelm her with my feelings right now. 

I'm really lost, I don't know how should I help her, and I'm even more lost in how to deal with my own guilt. I can't tell anyone in my family, it would be painful for them and I just managed to get back to be in good terms with them. My best friend and I grew apart, so we're not as close as we used to be.

Being young, it would make us younger parents and more able to keep up with our children. There are a lot of benefits to being our age and conceiving.

The problem I am having is, we just got married March 29th and he just went into the Army and he is off at basic. I'm trying to decide if I want to take birth control pills to make sure we don't conceive when he graduates end of June. Plus, during next training he may get weekend passes. I'm moving to where his next training will be shortly after he starts that one. So any weekend passes means more time for us to see each other.

I worry that after his training he will be deployed. I worry that if it doesn't happen immediately, I'll get pregnant and then he will be gone and I want him to be at all of the appointments like any other dad.

I'm ok with having kids now, all for it, but the deployments worry me. I also hate taking the pills but no other bc method works for me (all have horrid side effects).

668,"So I'm a 19 year old guy and I've got a friend who is a 19 year old girl. We went to school together and have been good friends ever since we were about 16 years old. We've always had great time together, we both find each other attractive and we both enjoy each others company.

When we first met, she had a crush on me but I didn't know this until about a year later when she no longer had a crush on me. Although I have known her for a very long time and loved her as a friend, I have never been romantically interested in her until recently. I'm not sure why.

About a year ago, we decided to go out to dinner together and we ended up back at my house and had sex and cuddled. After this, I noticed that I was beginning to develop feelings for her although I didn't mention this to her. The next day, she told me that she was actually in an open relationship with 2 other guys and she asked me if I would like to also be in an open relationship with her. I told her that I had started to develop feelings for her but, I wasn't comfortable with the idea of being in an open relationship and that if we were to get into a relationship, it would have to be exclusive. Unfortunately, she told me that at that point in her life, she wasn't interested nor did she feel ready to be part of an exclusive relationship. So, we mutual decided to remain as friends and as time went on, my feelings for her slowly subsided until I only saw her as a friend again.

Fast forward a year, and she's dating someone now. They've been dating for a few months. She seems like she's happy with him, which I'm glad about just because she's happy. For the past couple of weeks, they've been a little rough and they decided to go on a break. They both agreed that during this break, they would be allowed to have sex with whoever they wanted to. Her boyfriend hasn't had sex with anyone during their break however, he did admit that he went on tinder, he just hasn't be successful. So, it's not that it's a lack of trying on his behalf, it's more just that he hasn't managed to been successful. She and I, however, did have sex. We spent 3 nights at a hotel. We only had sex on the first night, and the other 2 nights we spent kissing and just talking. Occasionally, while we were talking, she would bring up her ""boyfriend"" and say something about him that was related to what we were talking about. For example, when we were talking about our financial situations, she brought up the fact that her ""boyfriend"" would often tell her that she needs to learn how to manage her money better or that when her ""boyfriend"" would be at her house, if her dad came into her room he would have to hide under her bed. We both told each other that we really enjoyed the time we spent together and she even told me it was the happiest she had been in a long time. Just like before, I felt myself developing feelings for her again. Only this time, it felt a lot stronger than before.

After this, she told her ""boyfriend"" that we had slept together, he got really pissed off about it (not sure if this is important but from what she has told me about him, she seems like quite an insecure guy, especially in relation to their relationship) and although I believe that he has no right to get angry at her, that's another story for another post. Anyways, they argued about it and even came close to breaking up entirely. During this time, she was messaging me about how it was going but eventually stopped messaging me. I sent her a few more messages asking how she was but she didn't reply and I didn't want to annoy her so I stopped.

2 days later (today), I messaged her asking her if she was okay and how it went. She told me that they've decided to get back together and give it another go. As much as that hurts me, I'm just glad that she's happy (as far as I can tell) and I'd like to put her happiness in front of mine.

Now here's the thing, I kind of want to tell her how I feel. On the one hand, I feel like it most likely won't do anything or go anywhere and she will still remain with her ""boyfriend"" so I kinda feel like it's a bit pointless to tell her. However on the other hand, I'm feeling kinda shit right now because of this and I kind of feeling getting this off my chest will feel good. Not only that, for most of my life I've struggled with anxiety and depression which has caused me to become a very reserved person who doesn't like to share personal information. So much so, that I have had multiple friends get annoyed at me about this and tell me that I should try to start sharing more with people as it would probably help with my issues. I kind of want to tell her as I see it as me taking the first steps to becoming more open with people and ultimately overcoming my depression and anxiety, I'm just not entirely sure if this is a good or appropriate idea. I'm writing this post because I'm hoping to get objective opinions on what I should do. If anyone could give me some advice, that would be really appreciated.",23May2019,1

674,"This is something that has been on my mind for a looong time and am relatively new to Reddit.  Would really like some honest advice in my situation.  

I will preface this by saying I've always been somewhat of a poor kid (my girlfriend's family being very well off), however I went to college for some time, where I met my girlfriend (I'll refer to her as F from now on.), via student loans.  When I met her, I was going through somewhat of a rough time.  Was struggling in school academically and financially.  The first semester we basically were just kinda hooking up and hanging out a decent amount, not much to it.  She was a freshman and I was junior at the time, she had a meal plan and would get me food for free a lot.  

Second semester, things became worse financially and her getting me free food became more often.  I could tell she truly began having deep feelings for me and although, I liked her back, it was clear she was much more into the thought of us than I was.  I will also admit the food was an additional reason why she was around.  After this semester, I didn't end up going back to school for financial reasons.  At the time, my family lived about 3 hours away from school.  We ended up continuing to try things out, and she would drive down that summer and see me every couple of weeks.  By that fall I moved about an hour closer and began working, beginning my life I suppose and by this time we are truly dating, maintaning a somewhat long distance relationship (2 hours away).

We have now been together for almost 4 years now.  My mother loves her and her parents and family absolutely adore me, I carry myself well.  I truly love F and care about her.  However... she is absolutely in love with me and is adamant I am the one.  I unfortunately don't believe I feel this way.  She is my best friend and someone I can truly be myself around, however, when I think of children and having her as my wife, I just don't see it.  It's as if she loves me 10/10 and I love her 9/10, to simplify it.  I'm not sure if she is ""the one"".

This is a bit of a side note, and despite what many will think, this is important.  I am african-american and she is white.  I am the first guy she has brought home in general and her parents (mainly her dad) didn't seem too sure on having his daughter be with a black guy.  However, after meeting them for the first time, this all completely flew out of the window.  They love me and I love them.

My overall request for advice is should I break things after being with her for 4 years and not seeing myself being with her for the rest of my life?  I don't mind dating her more, but part of me tells me if I don't want to marry her now after all of this time, this will probably never change.  

I would love to say that is all.. but there is another layer to this:

Last December I've had these same thoughts and had this conversation with her and decided to break things off.  We officially weren't together anymore.  Sadly, 2 weeks later a close family member in her family had passed away.  I was the first person she called and I ended up attending the funeral.  I believe her parents knew we were having some relationship troubles, but were incredibly grateful of me coming.  That evening, her father wanted to speak with me privately.  Long story short, he was honored I came to the funeral and being there for his daughter and family in general.  He offered to pay for me to finish my schooling.  My heart dropped when he asked me this.. I was speechless.  F and I are currently together and I am happy with our relationship as of now, but still feel that 9/10 way.  This is something she is aware of. Do I love his daughter? Absolutely yes.  But I'm not sure where we will be in 2 or 3 years.  What happens in the circumstance I take his offer and I don't end up marrying his daughter?  Did I use him?

I am grateful for any advice someone can provide. 

TL:DR

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years.  Although I do love her, and don't necessarily want to break up, I also can't see me marrying her at this time.  My thoughts have always been I should know by now, should I break things off?  I struggle financially, and recently her father offered to pay for my last 3 semesters of college and this has further clouded my judgment.  What happens if I don't end up marrying his daughter.",23May2019,2

My insurance couldn’t cover any DAMAGES (I still don’t know if he broke anything but he’s a male like in his early 30s and I was going like 25, he was wearing a dark hoodie and I  hit him and he stood up just fine and walked it off a bit and called his wife)My lawyer said I have a good chance of beating this ticket and in my court date they guy I hit didn’t show up so we rescheduled it. But honestly I’m more worried about seeing if I can get my forklift license. I have been a good driver for 3 years and never been in a accident this is my first ever misdemeanor,. Will this lower my chance to get my forklift license or to get a good job? I’m 20 years old, male.

680,"My coworker and I were joking around like normal and he took a joke seriously even though he laughed at. He said something to me and I replied your mom(this is how we joke we say it back and forth to each other all the time). He even laughed at it first then decides to slam me against a wall. I started laughing because I thought we were just playing then he gets more physical. After that he decided to slam me against a wall again and proceeds to clock me out so he could fight me , but i wouldn’t out of the respect i had for him , I just want to figure out why he was so mad? . I have since quit my job because I know there is no possible way I could go back and not want to fight him since he did this and feels he was in the right. My manager said he’d put us on opposite shift but I’d still see him and I know I’d just lose control and possibly got to jail. My back and shoulders are pretty sore.

681,"I'm a teen, living together with my mother, and I might go insane from this. Basically, the whole apartment is really, really dirty. I'm talking floors that don't get cleaned in months, food moths that constantly fly around, refrigerator full of moldy things, liquids and dirt. After finding dead bugs in cups, books, whatever I'm really about to lose it. It's a shithole. Whenever I bring it up, my mother disregards me as sensitive, mentally ill and that I don't try hard enough to keep it clean myself. Except, I clean my OWN room every day because cleaning anything else here is a waste of time and energy.

Is there any way I can get out of here, based on such problems? It's really really taking a toll on me. I've grown extremely scared and paranoid of bugs and dirt as a result, and feel disgusted to sleep in my bed or touch anything really. I just want to have my own home - I already wash my own clothes, make my own food, clean up after myself. I see no reason to stay here. I don't care how small of a living space, I just want it to be clean. So yeah-- is this a good enough reason to get help? :/",23May2019,1
682,"I’m gonna keep this short. 2 years ago my fiancé and I moved 5 hours away from home to be closer to my family and to live closer to a big city and more opportunities. 6 months after we moved I got pregnant! We had our daughter and she is now 9 months old. We are currently living at my parents as our rent went up and our lease ended and we thought we wanted to buy a house here instead of continuing to rent. But after talking my fiancé and I realize we both kind of want to move back home. All of our friends and his family is back home, it’s a smaller city, with better access to more outdoor activities. They have good schools, and a lot more “free” things for kids to do which is great as I’m currently a SAHM. We also could afford a nicer house if we rented or purchased a home. My fiancé has plenty of job opportunities as well.
 
The two reasons we would stay here are
 1. The potential. There are tons of things to do. Mostly expensive, which is why we don’t really do them but there’s a possibility of if we wanted to go and do them we could. Theres tons of people to meet! But we haven’t and it’s difficult now because we have a baby and don’t get to go out often because my mom is the only person here we trust to watch our daughter. We also have my family but we’re quite spread out, at least and hour or two away from each other (not including my parents as we obviously live with them) But also we’ve been here two years and have yet done anything we thought we would/should/could. 
2. The guilt of leaving my family. We moved down here to be closer to them, but after a year of them being 90% of our social interaction I’ve quickly learned there’s more to life than family. I love them but I’m also feeling as though we’re not doing what best for OUR family in fear of hurting mine. My parents do so much for us and my 92 year old grandparent also lives down here and I hate to take my daughter away and for them to miss out on her in their final days. I also don’t want this to ruin my relationship with my parents. 

But that’s the extent as to why we would stay, and in two years we haven’t unlocked any potential and I hate making a life long decision based on guilt. 

If we moved home we’d have a huge umbrella of family and friends to socialize with and to have help with our daughter if we needed it. We’d have plenty of free, close parks and activities to go to. The traffic is non existent which at times limits us from going out and doing things where we are currently. Financially we’d be a lot more comfortable. 

The cons of moving home are that we have never lived at home when we weren’t young and free, could we adapt to having a child there? I know this seems silly but I’ve seen friends struggle with the adjustment. What if it’s not what we want wand we’re unhappy there as well? 

We made the decision to move away very quick, we decided and two weeks later we moved. I don’t regret moving but we definitely weren’t ready for the move. 
Any advice? Anyone deal with a similar situation?",23May2019,1
683,"There’s a bench in front of my house where I sit two or three times a day just to relax and take in the sun. Tonight, I was sitting there, when this guy stops his car near me.

There weren’t many people around so I was cautious. He got out of his car after about 5 minutes, and came up to me.

For context, I’m an 18F and he’s a 30M. He told me that he lives next door and noticed me sitting there all the time. We live in a very student-y area so he started just asking me about myself.

He works at the takeaway place down the road (I sort of know the owners and they’re very nice). We kept on chatting for about 20 minutes. He went to talk to some of his friends who live across the street in the middle of our conversation too. Those are the main reasons I feel like I can trust this guy.

On the other hand.. He asked me fairly quickly if we could go get drinks. I told him that I have an important exam tomorrow and that I couldn’t. He asked if it was ok if he stopped by if he saw me sitting there again and maybe we could go get drinks. I said ok.

He then got up to leave, put out his hand so I would shake it - which I did - then went in for a hug, which I also allowed. But, as I was pulling back, he gave me a little kiss on the cheek. I feel like this is a major creep move. Am I wrong?

As a young girl - with a lot of experience with creepy guys but not enough that I know if this dude is one - I’m wondering if you guys have any advice for me.

I feel uneasy about going for drinks with a 30 year old, no matter how attractive and nice. Is this a really bad idea? Should I go with him, get drinks, and bail if I don’t like where it’s going? Should I never sit on that bench again?",23May2019,0

686,"Today I went to a target store self checkout to get some personal lubricant which cost $3.59, and an unrelated item that cost $3.99. I scan both items at the self checkout, not wanting to draw attention cuz it was busy. I scan them both, place them in the bag, then go to pay. I swipe the card and it doesn’t work, so an employee comes over and enters a code on the screen to reset the payment, and then I try again, still no dice and the employee does the same. I try a different card and the payment goes through. I leave and check the receipt, and it says I was charged twice for the $3.99 item, but not the lube. Which brings the total to more than it would have otherwise been. 

I feel kinda guilty like I messed up, but at the end of the day I payed more than what was owed. I don’t think they are gonna investigate me over a 40 cent discrepancy but I could have sworn I scanned each item once, not one twice. 

Maybe the employee messed up when resetting the payment for me twice or something. Should I be worried? I would have no problem going back to clear things up if it was not an embarrassing item to buy, but that’s not the case and I don’t care overpaying 40 cents to keep my privacy.",23May2019,1
687,"I need some second opinion if I'm the asshole in this situation or if my point makes sense.

I had a falling out with a close friend recently I used to have a crush on a few years ago. She had gone through a recent break up with her fiance and I helped get her back on her feet last year. One night she stayed over and hooked up with my older brother. This did make me jealous at the time but my feelings had long passed. It stung but I really didn't care. However, I did not know she was already dating a new guy. I didn't know him but he even drove over to come pick her up in the morning after a night out.

Fast forward a few months and I meet the girl I'm seeing now. My friend offers to host me and my gf for New year's up in the mountains at her BFs fancy mansion house. We of course accept. However my gf and my friend did not get along. My friend is a very pretty alpha female and made my gf feel very insecure. I confronted her about it and differences were resolved. We had a great time.

Now fast forward to recently. My friend called me venting about her bf feeling insecure and jealous of other guys. It was a weird convo to have with me but we always told each other a lot over the years like siblings. I then asked her if she had been honest about sleeping with my brother. She had not told her BF. Her BF btw is this super nice and successful rich guy. She's terrified of losing him. I felt this was fucked up that she wasn't honest. Especially because she doesn't want to hang around my brother anymore. My brother and I are close and do everything together.

I told her I don't like holding secrets like that and if she isn't honest with her BF then I don't really want to talk. She hasn't responded since I confronted her about telling the truth.

I get a call today from my gf that my friend has unfollowed her on Instagram. I said wow that's so petty of her. And my GF said she checked and she's still following me. My gf said I should just unfollow her too. I told her that I really did not want to stir anything else up and stoop to her level. My GF is now ignoring me over not unfollowing this for because she thinks I'm not standing up for her.

I feel it's a waste of energy and will cause me more drama than it's worth. My GF is insecure and deep down thinks I'm going to end up with her one day. I have no feelings towards my friend especially after all this shit.

I've involved myself in some challenges like joining my school's rugby team, and commissioning in the Marine Corps. These are personal goals and I'm still involved in both, but it's an uphill battle.

I currently have a problem in my life, I hope someone can help me with. I will explain it to you, but it is a longer story and english is only my secound language, so please excuse all my mistakes. 

My dad is very interestet in insects and spiders, he even breeds abd sells them. I have been around a lot of animals since my birth and he thaught me a lot abour nature and the eco system od our planet. It got to the point that I am breeding and selling some mantis as a hobby and for more pocket money. I am 19, but due to a lot of pressure of German schools I am not able to do a side job. Anyway. This year i got really lucky with my breeding generation and was able to raise a lot of mantis. After some time I recently took nice pictures of them and loaded the up on a local platform, to sell them. As I am on the website I notice that my dad put my animals up there for sale too without even informing me, he made his own prices, I dont agree with, advertises animals I want to keep for myself, ect. Normally it wouldnt be a problem, because I already sold animals over his account before, but he didnt asked me, didnt informe me, or talked with me about it.
I dont consider myselfe a shy person, but I am simply not able to confron my dad properly about it. I drop some hints here an there, but I dont think he got the message. 
I really love my dad and he is an amazing father to all of hos children, he is always there for me and I know he meant it well and wanted to help me.
That is why I dont know how to confront him. Could you give me some advice how to make it easier for both of us. I simply dont what him to do him thinks like that, as I am feeling like he crissed over me and my own desicion an belongings.

700,"# TL:DR

I need to help out this guy because he's squandered so much of his massive intellectual potential and is vandalising my Reddit posts. He is in extreme pain and feels very victimised by me. He is also a schadenfreude for me because I could have chosen to be like him.

# Actual post

My posts are frequently commented on by a guy named u/AnhedonicHermit (his former accounts include u/Metal_Inserter and u/AnhedoniaAddict). You see, in March last year, back when I was on the account u/Fart_Gas, I encountered a racist post on r/Australia_ about kicking Indians out of Australia - I checked the OP's post history and used it against him, and because of this, he claims that I ""stalked him first"" and that I am ""cyberbullying"" him. He feels very victimised by what I did, and he has been vandalising my posts in revenge ever since. 

He keeps reminding me that I will never get laid because of my race, my ugly face and [my ""ugly"" voice](https://www.removeddit.com/r/codyslab/comments/9el2hm/can_someone_please_explain_why_this_weird_motion/e5ro4qh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) \- but unlike him, I can live with the prospect that I might never get laid. Anyway, he's an incel ([I'm technically an incel too since I never had a girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/bro8ce/how_detrimental_is_it_to_academic_scores_for_high/)), and he is extremely miserable. The fact that he's got [Anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia) means that he can't ever feel pleasure, even when good things happen to him. 

To be honest, [no matter how much](https://i.redd.it/im7cyd967yf11.jpg) [he tries to make me kill myself for being incel](https://www.removeddit.com/r/codyslab/comments/9oauzz/_/e7supcg/), I refuse to do so. In fact, I find him a source of schadenfreude, since he is a living reminder that I could have chosen his life path (i.e. subjecting yourself to extreme misery over the fact I never had a girlfriend).

He is also a very smart man. He has an [ATAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Tertiary_Admission_Rank) of 96, compared to my ATAR of around 73. He even has a Python program tracking this Reddit account because he is just so miserable that he needs someone to attack. I sometimes worry that he might kill himself and blame me in the suicide note. He claims that he can't be bothered to do anything productive with his life because he's ""ugly"" ([he even sent me nudes to try to make me say that he's ugly](https://www.removeddit.com/r/techgore/comments/az9mb8/_/ei69v8s/)) and therefore is doomed to be forever alone - just imagine all the potential he's squandered being miserable over the fact that he can't get laid. 

I can't just give him a woman because [he is quite picky with women](https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/b7ab03/las_islas_británicas_son_argentinas/ejr5hhp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Personally, I believe that if he is right about me and him being ultra-ugly, then beggars shouldn't be choosers.

# P.S. 

If you are going to tell me to call the cops on him, that advice is useless. You see, last November, [he found out my real name and created an account with it to to frame me a racist](https://www.removeddit.com/r/codyslab/comments/9s0bez/why_do_indian_men_not_understand_that_they_are/) in revenge for me [following the advice of other r/codyslab users to block him](https://www.removeddit.com/r/codyslab/comments/9oauzz/_/e7t1jex/). Because he framed me, I called the cops on him, so he deleted that account and thankfully, my name is no longer associated with racism. With the evidence deleted, the cops couldn't do anything about it, so he's able to come back.",23May2019,0
702,"So context; I’m 18 and my sister is 16. I’m moving out in September but we live together with both of our parents. Back in January my sister stole my savings which was around £600 (most of it was birthday money.) and I know she did it because I kept it in a place that she only knew of. It was in cash and yes NOW I know that it was typos to keep it in cash but I’d just never have realised that she would do something like this for me.
Fast  forward a couple of months now I have a savings account and I never carry cash so she won’t do it again. I happened to have a £10 note in my wallet and accidentally left it at hone when I went out for about 2 hours. Nobody was home apart from her and when i returned the money was gone.
The things is I have no idea what to do; me and my parents both know it was her but obviously I have no physical proof so I can’t do anything about it. I also want her to face consequences for this but my parents aren’t punishing her in any way, so I’m stuck. Any advice would be appreciated.
Oh and some more context: i have a part time job and i don’t earn a lot of money, i can barely afford to buy lunch at college and my sister knows this which makes it worse. Additionally the first bit of money she stole was a birthday gift from my grandmother who had saved up for months to give me that as Polish retirement can be a bitch but she was lovely and wanted to gift me the money so I could get a drivers licence.

704,"So I'm basically new to reddit and english isn't my main language so please excuse possible mistakes. Kinda have to tell the story first, sorry that it's a little long.

I remember vividly that I had a conversation with the voices of a grown man and a woman in my head when I was about 4 years old. I wasn't scared at the time and answered them verbally. Can't remember most of the conversation except  the end where they brought up the decision of knowing the age I will die or the possibility to keep talking to them. The idea of death wasn't really something I had to do with at that age. No one around me had died, neither family nor pets. Decided on the first option, mainly because I didn't feel comfortable with the idea of hearing those two all the time. They asked each other ""Why do they always choose that one?"" and basically disappeared forever. My mom came into my room shortly after because she had noticed I was more talking to someone than just talking while playing a story with my toys. She was obviously confused when I tried to explain and at that moment I realized how scary and not normal the whole thing was. Can't remember that I talked to those two before or after at all. 

Around the time I was 23 something similar happened again. Just heard a male voice saying ""Hello?"" though, loud and clear but definitely inside my head. I was in bed at the time and froze in panic, but nothing came after. Nothing like that ever happened after that again.

Should I let a professional know? Is something wrong with me?

Honestly scared to tell anyone in person about it.

Is there anyone else that experienced something like that?

707,"I hope this doesn't sound pathetic. I feel pathetic. But I could really use some help if it's at all possible.

I live at home during the summer in between semesters. Home is a very small town surrounded by other small towns until you drive about 45 minutes away in any direction. This means there aren't a ton of summer/part-time job opportunities for people like me who are around for only a few months. No malls, no movie theaters, nothing like that for two dozen miles or more, which wouldn't be worth the drive for a minimum wage job. Because of this I've been doing some online transcription jobs, my dad has been paying me a small amount a week for doing the family's (4 people) laundry and dishes on top of anything else he needs help with, and he's asked me to help him sell some of his old military things on eBay for a cut of what he makes on them.

But I'm starting to get more depressed because I'm stuck at home all the time and my friends have either moved away or didn't go to college and have full-time jobs. I was away from home for a few days recently, and I went from somewhat depressed before I left, to doing great while I was gone, and instantly depressed again when I came back. I'm also not making a lot of money and that's going to become a problem when I'm about to go back to school, which stresses me out a bit as well.

Every few weeks I visit and stay with my boyfriend who lives a little over an hour and a half away (he lives closer university), whenever he's available. Not getting to see him much is hard, but when I do have the chance, my depression and anxiety symptoms are really reduced. Basically what I'm trying to say is, having even less of an opportunity to see him from what I am now makes my symptoms a lot worse. (I know that's not healthy but my family is not exactly a supportive environment, so living with them for four straight months every summer is hard on me mentally.) Because of this, if I did happen to find a job, I would need something that's not going to interfere with this a ton, something that's at least somewhat flexible.

I kind of doubt finding an actual job is possible considering my needs right now and the lack of options around here. I don't know if there's any help anyone can give. I just don't feel like I'm doing well at all and I don't know if there's anything I can do to fix it.",23May2019,1
708,"I've been working in a Office Supply Store for almost a year. I'm working part time while finishing uni (basically finished), I already payed my scholar fee's and paying my drivers licence at the moment, I need to keep my job soo I can finish paying it. 

Everything was doing just fine in work for months, I love my co-workers, but recently two of five bosses I have started making my life a living hell, leaving me stressed all the time while out of work. All this stress accumulating started to have and effect on my productivity, I've been failing to do my job properly because I'm overthinking everything they yell at me and gossip. To the point where they now hate me and started poisoning my co- workers with gossip and lies. For example, our chash register coins come in little plastic bags, and you only open them when you run out of them, soo you don't overfill the register and make it hard on the guys who at the end of the day they have to count the money before they leave. Someone has been opening the bags when they souldn't and now they are spreading word it's me. I started to feel that my co workers have been kinda wierd with me lately... Now I found out why.  


I just haven't quit because there are still two months left untill I get payed my bonuses, soo I can eventualy buy a car and have some independence. But I'm starting to doubt my willingness to endure work anymore just because of the money. I fear that I might explode during work.  


Does anyone have any experience with a situation like mine who can share some insight on how to act ? Feeling lost/confused about all this.

713,"So I have 2 options. I can stay at home and work remotely for my part time internship that pays or I can go back to my uni and do part time research and part time internship, both of which are paid. I would have to pay for housing for 2 months (June &amp; July) &amp; for plane tickets there &amp; back if I go back to school to do research. Even with those costs, I will still make over $2000 extra by doing research in addition to the part time internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I stay at home, I can work out &amp; lose weight &amp; maybe work on my mental health. But I'll be very bored because very few of my friends will be in town. Though I could probably visit some of my friends occasionally, I will be living with my parents &amp; can't have that wild &amp; fun 21st bday. 

If I go back to uni for research, I will probably be more busy with work to do and probably won't be able to eat as healthily and exercise as easily as if I stay at home. But I will be living with some really fun friends that I want to be closer with. I will have more freedom to have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I choose? Am I only leaning towards going back to uni because of FOMO and the idea of having fun &amp; being able to drink &amp; party &amp; is staying at home the more mature option?",23May2019,1
714,"I’m at 17M in high school that has been doing some self reflecting. I have been struggling with depression and loneliness for a while now. Let me start off by saying I live in a good family and I have plenty to be grateful for. When I was about 9 my mothers alcoholism really started to show. She began drinking excessively and I remember times when she was blacked when it was just me and her in the house. Luckily she received help over about a two year period but my father was an out of town worker. So constantly I was left with my younger sisters and babysitters. This I think made me develop severe anxiety to the point were I would miss weeks of school simply due to pure fear of the leaving the house. My father isn’t big on mental health so he truly didn’t understand and often yelled at me for not wanting to go to school. This truly made it worse. Eventually my mother came back from treatment and she said she would never leave again. Now of course she relapsed and left for another year, but the only reason I mention it is because that is her worst worry. That I would never forgive her for leaving after promising to never leave again. I never thought anything of it but she makes it a big deal. Now she is sober for something like 5 years and I’m in no fear of her relapsing. Today, I’m in my junior year of high school and I dont have the same anxiety issues, but the the relationship anxiety still occurs strongly. For instance I see others with friends and become extremely lonely or I I’m always checking up on my girlfriend ect. I just am never in the moment I guess. I guess my biggest question is does my past with my mothers absence have anything to do with my clinginess and loneliness? It’s just hard for me to understand why I fell this way when I have friends and a SO.

I do not mean to offend anybody that is dealing with serious abandonment issues, and believe me I am very happy to have my mother back.

717,"I have noticed that, whenever i'm in a situation where someone is criticising me,or i'm being talked down to, i get timid and i can't think. My mind can't think of anything and i can only feel the emotions i'm feeling at that moment. This is also probably why i can't speak either. It's frustrating when i want to talk and want to tell the person what i did or why i did something.

I think this comes from my narcissist parents who always questioned me fiercely or negated my question when i questioned their suggestion or idea. Right or wrong, they would always become agitated or defensive, desperately looking for something to change the conversation in to a way that makes me look like im doing something wrong, even though i'm just suggesting something or questioning their decisions. I believe this is what trained my mind to stay quiet and not say anything when i'm in a situation where im being criticized or being talked down to.

719,"I feel like I may make a bratty decision. A few Christmases ago my parents got me a really nice Note8 phone. They just finished paying it off because AT&amp;T don't let you pay for things upfront. To this day it works really well and I love it. 

But I HATE how hard it is to get a case for it. I hate how the curved screen makes it near impossible to get a screen protector for it. I hate how despite getting a paint on screen protector (total garbage), the screen is starting to scratch to hell and back within months of me having to beg Samsung to cover the out of nowhere screen damage (never dropped the phone, it's always alone in my bag pouch or pocket, and so on). So yeah, this is the NEW screen getting heavily scratched out of nowhere AGAIN. 

Now as of now, the scratches are minor. One shallow scratch along the screen and a deep scratch on the side. I have NO clue where they came from or how it happened. Just pulled it out of my backpack with nothing but a stuffed animal and my soft wallet and BOOM, scratches.

So, while I was going to get the screen repaired my mom suggested just getting a new phone. I at first just laughed it off because it's such a waste of money when the phone works just fine, its just physically fragile.

But now I'm really tempted to buy myself the phone. My parents won't be paying a dime of it (and I DO NOT want them to because I don't like them paying for my fun stuff anymore, it's not their job). Yet it was just paid off... 

Am I being spoiled and wasteful or is it okay to get the phone if I can afford it?",23May2019,1
720,"1,5 years ago a friend of mine physically abused me twice in ways which I'd rather not get into. He was apologetic and regretful afterwards and blamed it partially on me which I agreed with.

Everything went somewhat nicely until maybe two weeks ago when I ran into him in a store. He came to me telling how much he misses me and how we should start hanging out again. I didn't want to cause a scene in the store and pretended to be busy and said I'd message him later. Which I never did because I don't want him to talk me into being friends again. Then a week ago he started sending me some unsettling messages reminding me that he knows my address and hinting that if I don't want to come see him he can show up at my doorstep any time when I'm home alone. I panicked and started talking to him because I was scared.

735,"Hello! First time posting on Reddit.

I'm nearly ending my sophomore year in high school, so I'm not sure if this will really be a problem for next year. However, this issue has been haunting me for weeks now, and because of this, my focus has been ridiculously out of whack. So, there's this dude in my English 10 class. He's always been kinda weird, but to be honest, I found him really amusing. He's one of those alt-right, radical, Republican white kids, and feels the need to make his political position known (which I don't really mind, but a lot of what he says is... unsettling(?)). Anyways, I didn't even know his name until like two months ago. Let's just call him Tortilla, as a code name. So, before spring break, him and his group of friends came over and sat where me and my partner were because it was empty and there was a group project due at the end of the period. At first I was pretty hyped about it because the entertaining kid in the class decided to grace my presence, and the stuff he says is pretty priceless. Keep in mind that I have NEVER talked to this dude in my entire life. 

&amp;#x200B;

He poked me. Like, playfully. Three times that period. Tell me if I'm wrong, but I highly doubt that it is acceptable to touch another person when they have literally no idea who they are. I played it off, laughed about it, and enjoyed my spring break without another thought about Tortilla.

&amp;#x200B;

The following weeks were interesting, to say the least. He'd go out of his way to talk to me, and I'd try to keep the conversation going because that's the polite thing to do. But as one does, he's ridiculously awkward, says things that burned out the conversation, and I sympathized with him. I was civil, friendly, and nothing more. I don't think I made any kind of move or action that made him think it was okay to do this. What am I referring to, you may ask? Well, Tortilla decided to HUG ME. Not a side hug, not a friendly pat on the back, and quite a ways off from a friendly poke or two. Like, a hug. An actual hug. He lingered for like thirty seconds, and I just gave him a pat on the back (to again, stupidly, be polite). I literally learned this dude's name like two weeks before this and he already thinks it's okay to hug me. Rad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a person who is conservative with affection. In fact, I do hug and cuddle my friends quite a bit, and I throw around the occasional ""I love you"" when talking with my gal pals. But this went way too fast. I feel nothing for this guy. Absolutely nothing. Nada. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I did find it creepy when he tried to hug me again last week. He's been looking me up and down whenever I wear something even remotely form-fitting (I hit puberty a bit earlier than the other gals), and that time I was wearing a turtleneck a bit tight around the breast area. I was wearing a loose trench coat outside, so it wasn't as noticeable. Tortilla kept staring at me, which I had gotten used to at this point. The second sorry excuse of an embrace was billions of times more awkward than the first, and I didn't even have time to react when he put his arms around me. I politely (albeit curtly) said goodbye, and with a disgusted expression on my face all throughout passing period, proceeded to my next class.

&amp;#x200B;

He followed me today. And last night after the music concert. He poked me, and held the door open for me for almost a full minute. Nobody else was coming out. He just looked at me. I briefly thanked him, and power-walked as fast as I could manage in my heels. Tortilla is not a fit kid, and I am a fast power walker. So one could imagine my surprise and horror when he TRIED to keep up with me, actively pursuing me. Very much the same thing happened today. He followed me, and stared at me from across the street. I stopped talking to my crush because of how Tortilla made me feel. If my crush feels this weird and uncomfortable talking to me, then I should just stop. And it's been a bit rough on me, to be honest. Do I act that way in front of him? Does he think I'm weird or creepy?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm too sensitive or petty. But I've just about had enough. He doesn't get it. Tortilla is a nice(?)ish(?) kid, but he represents everything I don't like about a person. I won't get into those things, but what matters is that he doesn't get social cues or etiquette. My friend even told him to stop, and he agreed. But he kept pursuing me. Tortilla makes me feel weird and anxious. In a bad way. He's going through some stuff, like self-hate and depression, and the last thing I want to do is make him feel like shit about himself. However, I don't want his feelings to be played with; the more this goes on, the more he thinks that he actually has a chance with me. This needs to stop. I want to be civil, but firm. I don't want to make him hate himself, but I do want to get across that I really do not feel comfortable around him. I'm planning to talk to him on Monday, but what do I say to him?",23May2019,1

My boyfriend (M21) and I (F21) are long distance and had gotten back together a few weeks back after splitting for a month. We've been together for 5 years and that was our first split. 2 weeks ago, we found out I'm pregnant. We are currently long distance and won't see each other until August and I'm still in University.

We both wanted the pregnancy and were going to talk things out to be together physically in the town I live in as well as take care of the child... Or so I thought. He's recently mentioning his distaste for the town where I live, even though he knows I'm living here with the child no matter what (my University is here and he's not in school nor has a full time permanent job where he lives). My family is close and I would like to be with them while I have a baby and go through pregnancy. Not only has he been shitting on the town I live in, he recently rescued a massive, aggressive dog that requires a large living space and no interaction with children or other dogs. I have a small dog and well.. am having his baby. How is he expecting to move to my town, live in an apartment with me and have this large aggressive dog?

I believe he is no longer wanting to come here and be with me and the baby. But, more recently, he threatened that if I terminate he and his whole family would never speak to me again.

753,"INFO: I am graduating soon, and my parents are throwing a graduation party. I don't want it because I despise high school and don't think being forced to do shit I don't like for 4 years is worth celebrating and being proud of. I'd rather just move on and forget about it. However they want to do it because it's what's normal, their friends and our family are expecting me to have one, and also because I will receive gift money that I will use for college (which I also don't want to go to). So the party is happening.

If I had it my way, I'd only invite my friends, or if I caved my family too make them feel better (but then it wouldn't be the same kind of party... I guess because I basically keep my friends and family separate. Even my parents hardly know my friends). Well anyways I won't have it my way. It's basically my mother's party to show me off or something. She's inviting not just our family, but her friends and their spouses. Also she's doing all this stuff that I told her I don't care about (getting graduation themed tablecloths, cutlery, decorations, cake...).. She's had me do a bunch of work around the house to make it look nice for the people I didn't invite, doing stuff that I know they won't even care about (having me trim the weeds around trees, which are not crazy). Maybe she's insecure and wants to show off the nice house. She's one of those moms that is on Facebook regularly watching everyone else's lives and I guess she just wants to play the part of having a wonderful life. Worded that weird but you know what I mean.

SOOOOOOO anyways I invited some close friends that I would have invited anyways, and also invited some other people that I'm not as close of friends with. Now that I think of it I've only invited them to be a wall between myself and all the people I don't know and don't want to interact with them. I feel bad and don't want them to drive out to my house to just end up standing around. Also I have multiple friend groups if you will, and these people aren't friends with each other. I know that I will be expected to sort of lead the way since it is considered my party, and my friends and sort-of-friends will not just go off on their own out of politeness. There won't be much going on because we don't have any yard games/stuff like that... so what I am trying to say is that I just want to have a casual party where I can be closer with my friends, so I want to un-invite the people I'm not that close with so I -- a quiet, introverted, admittedly boring and depressed person -- won't need to try and cater to my family, the guests I don't know, my close friends, and my other not so close friends all at once.

The party is the day after tomorrow. Also I don't have a phone so I will have to tell the people tomorrow at school. Shit at this point if my friends read this there will be no doubt in their minds that this is me.",23May2019,1

2019 has been terrible. Every possible rejection that could've happened has come my way. I just finished my first year of PhD. I had an idea of a thesis subject I really wanted. I would meet professors one after the other and all couldn't take me in for various reasons. I applied to many scholarships, got rejected to all of them. I applied to many jobs, got rejected to all of them. I used to believe I had a good resume, a good profile. Now I don't know. I've been so out of focus these past few months, people probably start to wonder how I even made it to a PhD level. Even my stocks are doing so badly now, and I'm forced to sell them very soon because of some unexpected expenses coming up.

755,"So this girl let's call her Amy had a crush on me and well so did I so naturally we began dating and it was the best time of my entire life. But after the first month she grew distant from me which worried me cause I loved her, even told her that to which she replied ""that's a bad choice"" now she may have been talking about something happening on TV but idk. 
Anyways she broke up with me in March and initially was a bit hostile towards me even though she was the one to break up with me because she lost feelings.
Although after a couple of weeks we were back to normal but she kept giving me signals that she still liked me e.g. very, very close proximity to me whilst walking so much so that our hands touched, various sexual jokes, then touching my shoulder (this is something that I've been told is a thing girls do when they're into you, and she done it prior to us dating). But when I text her she sometimes just won't reply, for instance I asked how she got on in her exam and how her work was but I didn't get a reply which was odd because she would normally reply. 
This has all left me rather confused as she seems to be sending mixed emotions which toys with the feelings I have for her because a part of me still loves her but I just don't know what to do about it and it's kinda leaving me in a pretty crappy mood.
This girl was my whole world and I just don't know what to do at this point.
I've posted this on a few different subreddits but I've got an update: so we've actually began texting alot more recently and I'm reminded of why I like her soo much and I've toyed around with the idea of asking her if she still has feelings for me but I'm not entirely sure if it's a good idea mainly because I feel like it could result in losing her as a friend which is the last thing that I want to happen. 
Also I was told just today by my friend someone told him that she has feelings for him but the thing is he absolutely despises her and he makes it very obvious.

759,"Hi reddit, 
TL;DR flunked a semester for the first time. Don’t know what to do. 

(Background, I have depression/anxiety and possibly autism, being tested in August) 

I’ve been struggling through college for the past four years. I started in another city undeclared, was really unhappy and didn’t do very well. I transferred to another school near my hometown. I had one really good semester as a bio major, the next one was a struggle, and the one after that I dropped all but one class. My parents didn’t want to pay for me to go back so I worked for a few months before going back as an education major. Within a month of me starting again, my mental illnesses came up again and I attempted suicide. I was hospitalized, which made me fall farther behind, and I dropped another class and struggled to finish the others. I started this semester better than ever after getting stable with my medication, but, like always, I got fatigued and my anxiety started getting the better of me. I had no more drops left, and I failed 3 of my courses and passed the other two with C’s. It was the last semester for them to admit me into the teacher education program, and of course, I didn’t make the cut. 

I just don’t know what to do. I keep coming back and burning money but I have no idea what to do to stop myself from the self-destructive habits I always fall into. I’m not even sure what I want to do, I just keep trying to push through college because that’s what I’m expected to do. This year all my peers from high school are graduating. My brother and cousins have graduated. Everyone in my family went to college except one uncle, who is the joke of the family. I am just so humiliated. I was one of those “gifted” kids that thought I was meant for greatness, and now dealing with the crushing realization that I am not even mediocre. 

 I don’t know who to talk to. I go to a really big school and the advisors are not well trained and just don’t have time for you. I don’t know if it’s worth it for me to just keep pounding away at this. I’m afraid I will just keep wandering through life directionless and wake up in twenty years feeling like I didn’t accomplish anything. 

I haven’t even told my parents yet because I’m deathly afraid of how they’re going to take it. 

Has anyone ever gotten through this? What did you do?

762,"Over a week ago I went on a short trip by myself to a neighboring city and I was approached by a guy who said he saw me from his car and found me attractive. We exchanged our snaps (I gave him my new one) and we said we will see each other later. I was caught off guard by this interaction since he was conventionally attractive and genuine and I was just wearing casual clothes and had no makeup on. When I got back to my hotel room, I did reach out to him through text and he did send me some suggestive messages that led him to admit that he just wanted to send nudes and have sex. I told him I was a virgin and I would rather lose it in a relationship or an fwb but it's frustrating because I have a high libido. The two of us agreed to just sext each other instead. We chatted about sex and he seemed reasonable and gave me advice. While we sexted, this guy was very close to visiting my hotel room to swipe my card but we didn’t because I wasn’t on the pill.

For about 5 days, we would on and off flirt with each other. I would made sure that he responded first so I didn't seem clingy and I spaced out the messages we would send so it wasn't all in a row. We once chatted about how he would like to take my virginity and shared that he had recently gotten out of a relationship and didn't want anything serious. Eventually, we agreed to have a long distance fwb and he wanted to make my first time special. I shared to him that I had been going through a rough patch since I've moved here and wanted something light hearted (I moved right after high school from my childhood home far away and the uncle I was closest with suddenly passed around the same time.\*I didn’t share what’s in parenthesis to him\*). He promised that he would make it fun and we sexted a little bit more. 

This is where I think I fucked up: I then texted him saying that I'm seriously insecure about certain things and that he should be gentle. He left me on open and didn't reply. This guy has done that to me in the past but I seriously felt like I messed up this time. Then I sent him a playful joke and a comment that stated that my comment doesn't mean that I'm not up for this. He left me on open again and I waited until the next morning to ask about when we should meet up and I asked him if what I said bugged him last night. I knew I was digging the hole deeper and deeper and I just decided to ignore it for a while and contact some old close friends of mine on my old snapchat. 

After two nice days of catching up with my old friends, this guy decided to tell me that he doesn't want to take my virginity and thinks I should lose it in a relationship. He also added that it didn't have to do with what I sent but it was just a change of heart. In response, I said that I understood him, asked if we could still just sext and I told him that I appreciated his honesty. When I asked those old friends for advice, they were just so supportive. These were friends I went from messaging daily to practically cutting them out because I was too depressed and unmotivated to message them. This was the first time in a while where I felt comfortable contacting them and I cried about it. My friends and I had a good heart to heart and I talked about and eventually sent unflattering nudes of me crying to them as a joke. I knew that I saved the photo and it sent to my old account to send to my friends. 

The problem was that I wasn't sure if I accidentally sent them to the guy. I'm pretty sure that I didn't because I checked that it sent to my old account and I checked the chat with the guy because after I sent the picture, I sent another message to the guy stating that ""I honestly just need to work on myself."" He left me on open again after I sent that message and the things we saved in our chat were still there. The next day, I open my snap to see that the arrow was grey next to where it said ""opened"" in our chat, which mean that he either unfriended or blocked me. I was too embarrassed to look further into whether he unfriended me or blocked me and I just unfriended him. 

These past couple of days, I've been really down because I’m left in the ambiguity of whether he blocked me and there was animosity (meaning that the photo accidentally sent) or if he just unfriended me because he knew that was the right thing to do. I really don't like ending on bad terms with people. Even in relation to grieving, it’s hard not to think that practically all opportunities are one in a million and never going to happen again. These interactions I had with this guy made me realize how I let my insecurities and problems get in the way of how I am with others. I'm still so disappointed with myself.

TL;DR The only time I was ever approached by a guy, it ended up not working out because of further responses I sent through text. I’m also stuck in the ambiguity of whether I accidentally sent a pic to him instead of just my friends and if that was why he blocked or unfriended me on snapchat. There have been certain complications in my life that affect the way I am towards others. Overall, I’m just disappointed with how I handled myself and I'm having difficulty getting over it.",23May2019,1
763,"Hi All,

We're with Sky as our Internet provider and over the last 12-18 months we've had intermittent issues of our line speed dropping significantly and have had many engineers out to ""attempt"" at resolving this issue. Until the timeframe above we were sitting at between 30-32megabits which I can't complain about, it's a very nice speed and gives the multiple household user the bandwidth to watch/do what they wish without hindering anyone else. However recently this speed has dropped to a low of 18 and the reasoning behind it was first said to be ""The line is being auto-managed by software and it is setting it at that speed for consistent line noise and reliability."" (along those lines) but we are now being told that the issue is actually the cable outside of the home being aluminium and degraded so the speed for us now is max 20. We have told both Sky and Openreach (BT own the line so Openreach work on it) that our speed was 32 in the past and we've been greeted with responses that come across as if they don't believe us or that ""the line is maxed at 20 outside so we don't know how"". We've made contact with BT recently and asked them what they're going to do about it as if there is a faulty line surely they should be repairing/replacing it especially as paying customers who are under their contract speed? Is there anything we can do to get this issue sorted or are ISP's really that stuck up and powerful that it's tough shit nobody can do anything about it?

764,"Posting this on a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but this has been bugging me for weeks now, and lately getting more annoying.

Pretty much,at school, I'm in a group of friends of around double digit amount of guys, and right off the bat, a lot of these are openly racist, saying the n-word quite often, making racist jokes on a regular basis, and to go along with that, the general atmosphere is toxic, for the most part, everyone seems to be always in a non-productive mood, and the interactions between most of us tend to be about immature topics and foolish arguments can happen often, and this includes a lot of negative talking behind each others back, which I have heard myself and have been informed about myself, which is a bit of a shame considering we're all in the most important stages of our lives so far and the general output of the group is negative and immature.

And the other main point that I would like to point out is how toxic some of my friends can be and this includes putting me down, to do with my life goals and aspirations, while it is fine to be jokey about a selection of topics, a constant putting down of what I would like to do with my life is sadly what has been making me feel more and more distant with my friends in terms of attitudes.

My other point is, I can be the butt of the joke and be seriously taken apart for everyday things, and when I start to argue back, it apparently becomes ""impossible"" to argue with me even though they won't outline any clear or firm points about why that is so to them or even hear me out, it feels like because of how I can be the main joke that it is alright to just push aside what I have to say and openly insult me and not give me a counterargument, man, all of these things have made me really look back at the people that I hang out with every day at school, and I just would like to know, what would you all do in this situation or suggest?",23May2019,1

I want to be petty and tell him to go fuck his baby mama. I honestly wonder why he cheated on her with me? 

Was she not making enough time for him? The stress of having a new family too overwhelming? Or just an asshole? 

I don't know. 

I mean they do say when you stop searching for love, love comes to you. I think he's just crawling back to me because I'm ""sexy""  or maybe he and his baby mama broke it off and he has no one to have sex with. 

I'll admit that during the times when he would text me off and on, I'd always give him another chance. 

Should I ask him why he keeps coming back? I know that he definitely doesn't like in a ""relationship type of way"", so why me?
